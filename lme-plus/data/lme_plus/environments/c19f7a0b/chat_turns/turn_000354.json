  "content": "I've been trying to improve my portrait photography skills, especially when it comes to capturing kids. I recently took some great photos of my niece and nephew playing in the backyard at a family gathering last month, and I was experimenting with the continuous autofocus feature on my Sony Alpha a6400. I'm thinking of starting a photography project where I take my camera with me every day for a month and capture a photo each day that represents my daily life. Do you have any tips on how to make this project more engaging and help me develop my own style?",
