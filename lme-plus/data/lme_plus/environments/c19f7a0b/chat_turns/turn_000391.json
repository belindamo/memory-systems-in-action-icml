  "content": "For both Snake Plants and Peace Lilies, you'll want to use a well-draining potting soil that's designed for indoor plants. Regular potting soil can work, but it's often too dense and may retain too much water, which can lead to root rot.\n\nHere are some tips for choosing the right potting soil:\n\n1. **Look for a mix specifically designed for indoor plants**: These mixes are usually formulated to retain less water and provide better drainage.\n2. **Choose a mix with good drainage**: A mix with perlite, vermiculite, or sand will help prevent waterlogging and ensure that excess water drains quickly.\n3. **Avoid mixes with added fertilizers**: You can fertilize your plants separately, and added fertilizers in the potting soil can cause more harm than good.\n4. **Consider a mix with a slightly acidic pH**: Both Snake Plants and Peace Lilies prefer a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH (around 6.0-7.0).\n\nSome good options for potting soil include:\n\n* Miracle-Gro Indoor Potting Mix\n* Black Kow All Purpose Potting Mix\n* Espoma Organic Indoor Potting Mix\n* Pro-Mix Indoor & Outdoor Potting Mix\n\nIf you're looking for a more specialized soil, you can also consider:\n\n* Orchid potting mix (which is often used for Peace Lilies)\n* Cactus and succulent potting mix (which can work well for Snake Plants)\n\nRemember, the key is to choose a potting soil that drains well and provides a balanced environment for your plants to thrive.\n\nI hope that helps!",
