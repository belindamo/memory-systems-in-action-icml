Richard Allen - Allen was a former slave who became one of the founders of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in 1816, the first independent black denomination in the United States.\n\n2. Sojourner Truth - A prominent abolitionist, women's rights activist, and Christian evangelist. She gave famous speeches such as \"Ain't I a Woman?\" and used her Christian faith to argue for the abolition of slavery and the equality of all people.\n\n3. Absalom Jones - Jones was another founder of the AME Church and one of the first black ordained ministers in the United States. He was also an advocate for abolition and fought against racial discrimination.\n\n4. Nat Turner - A preacher who led a slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831. Turner believed that his rebellion was ordained by God and was inspired by his interpretation of Christian texts.\n\n5. Frederick Douglass - Although he was not a religious leader per se, Douglass was a prominent abolitionist who used his own experiences to argue against slavery and advocate for the equality of all people. He also wrote his own narrative, \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,\" which used his Christian faith as a justification for his calls for abolition.",
