Additionally, they can be heavy, which might affect the overall weight distribution of your backpack.\n* Straightening irons: Straightening irons are usually around 10-12 inches long and 2-3 inches wide, which can also take up a lot of space. They can also be heavy and might have a cord that needs to be wrapped and stored.\n\nIf you really need to bring these items, you could consider the following options:\n\n* Look for travel-sized hair dryers and straightening irons: These are specifically designed to be compact and lightweight, making them easier to pack. However, they might not be as powerful as your regular hair dryer or straightening iron.\n* Pack them in a separate, smaller bag: If you have a separate, smaller bag or pouch, you could pack the hair dryer and straightening iron in that, and then place the bag inside your backpack. This way, you can still carry them with you, but they won't take up space in your main backpack.\n* Consider using hotel amenities: If you're staying in a hotel, you might be able to use their hair dryer and other amenities, which would eliminate the need to bring your own.\n\nHowever, if you're planning to pack clothes, toiletries, laptop, wallet, and phone, you might want to prioritize those items and leave the hair dryer and straightening iron behind. You could always use a hair dryer and straightening iron at a salon or beauty parlor if you really need to use them during your trip.\n\nRemember, packing light is all about making sacrifices and prioritizing what's essential. If you can live without the hair dryer and straightening iron for a few days, you might want to consider leaving them behind to make your packing experience easier and more convenient.",
