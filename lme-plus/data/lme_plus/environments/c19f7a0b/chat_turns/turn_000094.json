However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal knowledge of your schedule or personal life, so I don't have any information about your puppy training classes or Rocky.\n\nBut I can help you organize your schedule for the week! You can tell me about your commitments, appointments, and tasks, and I can help you create a schedule that works for you.\n\nPlease provide me with the following information:\n\n1. What days of the week do you have available for puppy training classes?\n2. What time of day do you prefer to have the classes (morning, afternoon, evening)?\n3. How often do you want to have puppy training classes (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)?\n4. Do you have any other commitments or appointments that you need to schedule around (work, school, family time, etc.)?\n\nOnce you provide me with this information, I can help you create a schedule that fits your needs and reminds you when you have puppy training classes for Rocky!",
