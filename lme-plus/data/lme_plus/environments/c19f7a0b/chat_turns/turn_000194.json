Categorizing tasks into must-do, should-do, and nice-to-do can help you prioritize your language learning sessions and ensure they don't get pushed aside by other tasks.\n\nBy making language learning a regular part of your routine, you're more likely to stick with it and see progress over time. It's fantastic that you're making slow but steady progress \u2013 every little bit counts, and it's awesome that you're committed to your goal!\n\nHere are a few additional tips to help you make the most of your language learning sessions:\n\n1. **Set specific goals for each session**: What do you want to achieve during your hour-long session? Is it to complete a certain number of exercises, practice a specific skill, or review a particular topic? Having a clear goal in mind will help you stay focused and motivated.\n2. **Use a variety of resources**: Don't rely on a single resource or method. Mix it up by using language learning apps, podcasts, videos, books, and conversation practice with native speakers (if possible). This will help keep your sessions engaging and prevent boredom.\n3. **Review and reflect regularly**: Take a few minutes at the end of each session to review what you've learned and reflect on what worked well and what didn't. This will help you identify areas for improvement and adjust your approach as needed.\n4. **Make it enjoyable**: Language learning doesn't have to be tedious! Find ways to make it enjoyable, such as listening to music or podcasts in the target language, watching TV shows or movies with subtitles, or cooking recipes from the culture you're interested in.\n\nRemember, consistency is key, and even small steps can lead to significant progress over time. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any language learning tips or resources!",
