  "content": "Hamlet is a tragic play by William Shakespeare that tells the story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark, who is seeking revenge for the murder of his father, King Hamlet. The play begins with the ghost of King Hamlet appearing to his son and revealing that he was murdered by his own brother, Claudius, who then took the throne and married Queen Gertrude, the king's wife and Hamlet's mother.\n\nDistraught and angered by this revelation, Hamlet decides to avenge his father's death. However, he is hesitant and indecisive, and he spends much of the play trying to determine the best course of action. He feigns madness in order to throw Claudius and others off the scent, and he engages in a series of confrontations and discussions with various characters, including his love interest, Ophelia, and his childhood friend, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n\nUltimately, Hamlet decides to confront Claudius directly and arranges for a play to be performed that will reveal the truth of the king's guilt. Claudius becomes agitated during the performance and storms out, confirming his guilt to Hamlet. In a final confrontation, Hamlet kills Claudius, but is mortally wounded in the process. He dies shortly thereafter, and the play ends with the arrival of Fortinbras, the prince of Norway, who claims the throne of Denmark.\n\nThe story of Hamlet is a classic tale of revenge, betrayal, and the consequences of inaction, and it has inspired many later works of literature and art.",
