Always use a cleaning rod and cloth to clean the inside of the recorder after each use to remove moisture and dirt.\n\n2. Oil the joints of the recorder occasionally to keep them lubricated and prevent sticking.\n\n3. Store the recorder in a case or protective cover when not in use to prevent dust and dirt from accumulating inside.\n\n4. Keep the recorder in a dry environment to prevent moisture from damaging the wooden or plastic parts.\n\n5. Avoid exposing the recorder to extreme temperatures, such as leaving it in a hot car or near a radiator.\n\n6. Avoid placing the recorder under pressure or stress as this could cause cracks or other damage.\n\n7. If you notice any cracks, scratches or other damage to the recorder, take it to a professional for repair.",
