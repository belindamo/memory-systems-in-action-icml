  "content": "That sounds amazing! I'm thrilled to hear that the hickory chips have taken your smoked meats to the next level. A 4-hour smoked brisket is a labor of love, and it's great that you were able to achieve tender and flavorful results.\n\nHickory is a classic pairing for brisket, and it's no surprise that it added an incredible depth of flavor. The sweet, smoky flavor of hickory complements the richness of the brisket beautifully, and it's a match made in heaven.\n\nServing it with coleslaw and baked beans is a great choice, too. The creamy coleslaw helps cut the richness of the brisket, while the sweet and tangy baked beans add a nice contrast in texture and flavor. It's a well-rounded and delicious meal that's sure to please a crowd.\n\nI'm curious, what's your secret to achieving tender and flavorful brisket? Is there a particular rub or seasoning you use, or a specific temperature and time you aim for during the smoking process?\n\nAlso, have you experimented with different types of wood chips or chunks in your smoker, or do you stick to hickory for your brisket?",
