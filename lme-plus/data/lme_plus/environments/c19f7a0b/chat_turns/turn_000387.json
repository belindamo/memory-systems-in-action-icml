  "content": "Snake Plant and Peace Lily are both low-maintenance plants that are perfect for busy people or those new to plant parenthood.\n\n**Snake Plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata)**\n\n**Watering:**\n\n* Water your Snake Plant sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering is the most common cause of death in Snake Plants.\n* Watering once a week is a good rule of thumb, but this may vary depending on the humidity and temperature of your bedroom.\n* Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water.\n\n**Special Care:**\n\n* Snake Plants prefer well-draining soil and can tolerate neglect, but they'll do best in a pot with good drainage holes.\n* They can thrive in a range of temperatures (65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F / 18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C) and humidity levels.\n* Avoid direct sunlight, as it can cause the leaves to become scorched. East- or west-facing windows are ideal.\n* Fertilize sparingly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer.\n\n**Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii)**\n\n**Watering:**\n\n* Peace Lilies prefer moist soil, but not waterlogged. Check the soil daily, and water when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry.\n* Water thoroughly, making sure the pot drains well to prevent root rot.\n* Reduce watering during the winter months when the plant is dormant.\n\n**Special Care:**\n\n* Peace Lilies prefer well-draining soil and a pot with good drainage holes.\n* They thrive in temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C) and high humidity.\n* Place your Peace Lily in a spot with bright, indirect light, but avoid direct sunlight, which can cause leaf scorch.\n* Fertilize every 2-3 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer.\n* Remove dead or dying flowers and leaves to maintain the plant's appearance and prevent the spread of disease.\n\n**Common Issues:**\n\n* Snake Plants: Overwatering, which can lead to root rot. Watch for signs like yellowing leaves, soft stems, and a soft, mushy crown.\n* Peace Lilies: Underwatering, which can cause the leaves to turn yellow and droop. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so make sure to check the soil moisture regularly.\n\nBy following these care tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a successful plant parent!",
