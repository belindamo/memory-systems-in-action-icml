I spent a good 2 hours editing the photos from my solo hike at Red Rock Canyon, and I'm really happy with how they turned out. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed playing around with the manual focus during the hike, and I think it made a big difference in the quality of the photos. Do you have any tips on how to improve my landscape photography skills, especially when it comes to capturing the beauty of natural light?",
