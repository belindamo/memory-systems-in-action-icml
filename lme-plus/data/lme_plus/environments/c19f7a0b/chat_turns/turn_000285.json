You're right that identifying the specific data that needs to be retrieved is a critical step that will help guide the design of the database schema and the data format. It will also ensure that the data being ingested is relevant to the system's predictions.\n\nSo for each source, we can include a task to identify the specific data that needs to be retrieved. This will involve researching the API documentation for each source to understand the available data fields and selecting the fields that are relevant to the system's predictions.\n\nHere's an updated list of tasks for the Data Ingest system:\n\n* Ingest data from the Coinbase API\n\t+ Identify the specific data that needs to be retrieved\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ingest data from the Reddit API\n\t+ Identify the specific data that needs to be retrieved\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ingest data from the Twitter API\n\t+ Identify the specific data that needs to be retrieved\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ensure that all ingested data is in a consistent format\n* Store the ingested data in the PostgreSQL database\n\nDoes that sound good to you?",
