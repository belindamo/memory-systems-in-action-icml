  "content": "As an AI language model, I suggest taking your recorder to a professional for repair in case it has cracks or any significant damage. Professional repair is often the safest and most effective option, especially when it comes to expensive or antique recorders. Repairing a recorder yourself can lead to further damage if not done correctly, such as misaligned finger holes that can affect playability.",
