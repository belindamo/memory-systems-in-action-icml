Guided meditations provide an easy way to start meditating by providing instructions, helping you focus your attention, and taking you through a step-by-step process to help you stay on track. Guided meditations are also available on apps, websites, and podcasts, which makes them very accessible. It is important to note that not all guided meditations are created equal. Make sure to find a teacher you trust, whose voice and style work well for you. Lastly, be patient with yourself - meditation is a practice that takes time to develop, so take it one step at a time and enjoy the process.",
