  "content": "Mint is a fantastic app for tracking your finances, and I'm happy to help you with your question.\n\nYes, it is possible to track purchases from cash-only vendors like farmers markets or garage sales within Mint. While Mint primarily focuses on connecting to your bank accounts and credit cards to track transactions, it also offers a few ways to manually add cash transactions:\n\n1. **Manual Transactions**: You can manually add cash transactions by clicking on the \"Add a transaction\" button on the Mint website or mobile app. You'll need to enter the date, description, category, and amount of the transaction. This way, you can log your cash purchases from farmers markets or garage sales.\n2. **Cash Account**: Mint allows you to set up a \"Cash Account\" within the app. This is a virtual account that you can use to track your cash spending. You can transfer funds into the Cash Account from your connected bank accounts or add cash manually. Then, you can use the Cash Account to track your cash purchases.\n3. **Envelopes**: Mint offers an \"Envelopes\" feature, which allows you to set aside money for specific categories, like \"Farmers Market\" or \"Garage Sales.\" You can fund these envelopes from your connected accounts or add cash manually. When you make a purchase, you can deduct the amount from the corresponding envelope.\n\nTo make it easier to track cash transactions, you might consider the following tips:\n\n* Keep receipts: Try to keep receipts for your cash purchases, so you can accurately log the transactions in Mint.\n* Set reminders: Set reminders on your phone or calendar to log your cash transactions regularly, so you don't forget.\n* Categorize correctly: Make sure to categorize your cash transactions correctly in Mint, so you can get an accurate picture of your spending.\n\nWhile these methods require a bit more effort than automatic transaction tracking, they can help you stay on top of your cash spending and get a more complete picture of your finances.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
