  "content": "Amleth is a character in Scandinavian folklore who is known for his intelligence and cunning. The story of Amleth is told in the medieval Icelandic saga \"Amleth,\" which is based on the story of the legendary Danish prince Hamlet.\n\nAccording to the saga, Amleth is the son of the king of Denmark, who is murdered by his own brother, Feng. Feng then takes the throne and marries the queen, Amleth's mother. Amleth is aware of his uncle's treachery, but he is too young and powerless to take revenge.\n\nIn order to protect himself, Amleth pretends to be foolish and mad, while secretly plotting his revenge. He also feigns love for his cousin, Geruth, whom Feng has chosen as his bride. When Feng becomes suspicious of Amleth's motives, he sends him on a mission to Britain, hoping to get rid of him.\n\nIn Britain, Amleth meets the king, who is impressed by his intelligence and wit. Amleth helps the king defeat a group of invading Vikings and is rewarded with a large army. He then returns to Denmark and confronts Feng, whom he defeats in battle and kills. Amleth then becomes the new king of Denmark and marries Geruth.\n\nThe story of Amleth is a classic tale of revenge and cunning, and it has inspired many later works of literature, including the play \"Hamlet\" by William Shakespeare.",
