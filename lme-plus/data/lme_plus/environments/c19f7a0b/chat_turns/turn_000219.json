  "content": "In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the flood is a catastrophic event that is sent by the gods to wipe out humanity because of their noise and disruption. The only survivor of the flood is Utnapishtim, a wise and righteous man who is warned of the impending disaster by the god Ea. Utnapishtim builds a large boat and fills it with his family, friends, and a variety of animals, and the boat rides out the storm safely.\n\nAfter the flood has subsided, Utnapishtim releases a series of birds to see if the waters have receded, and when the birds do not return, he knows that the flood is over. Utnapishtim and his family and friends leave the boat and offer a sacrifice to the gods, who are pleased with their devotion.\n\nThe story of the flood in the Epic of Gilgamesh is similar to the story of the flood in the Bible, and it is believed that the two stories may have a common origin. The story of the flood has been interpreted in many different ways over the centuries, and it continues to be a powerful and enduring tale that has inspired many works of literature and art.",
