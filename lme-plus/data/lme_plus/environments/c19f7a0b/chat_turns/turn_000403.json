Packing a spare set of clothes can give you peace of mind and help you avoid stress if something unexpected happens.\n\nIt's great that you learned from your previous experience and are taking steps to prepare for your next trip. Remember to pack your spare clothes in a separate, easily accessible compartment of your backpack, so you can quickly grab them if needed.\n\nDon't forget to check the weather forecast before your trip and pack accordingly. You might also want to consider packing a small umbrella or rain jacket, depending on the time of year and weather conditions.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a great trip to NYC and enjoy your time in the city!\n\nSafe travels!",
