  "content": "I'm excited to join the Fantasy Book Club on Goodreads. I've heard so many great things about it. By the way, speaking of book clubs, I also participated in an online book club discussion on Facebook Live last week, where we discussed Celeste Ng's \"Little Fires Everywhere\". It was amazing to hear insights from other readers. Do you have any recommendations for tracking my reading habits and reflecting on what I've learned from the books I've read? I've been meaning to start a book journal, but I'm not sure where to start.",
