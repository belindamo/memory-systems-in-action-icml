Here are some tips and information to help you prepare:\n\n**Road Conditions in North Cascades National Park:**\n\n* The park's roads are generally well-maintained, but they can be narrow, winding, and steep in some areas.\n* The main road through the park, Highway 20, is paved and well-maintained, but it's still a mountain road and can be affected by weather conditions.\n* Some secondary roads and trails within the park are gravel or dirt, and may be closed due to weather or maintenance.\n\n**Specific Roads to Be Aware Of:**\n\n* The North Cascades Highway (Highway 20): This is the main road through the park, and it's prone to rockfall, avalanches, and washouts. Check the park's website for up-to-date road conditions before you go.\n* The Diablo Lake Road: This road is narrow and winding, with steep drop-offs and no guardrails. Take your time and exercise caution when driving on this road.\n* The Cascade River Road: This road is gravel and can be rough in some areas. It's also prone to washouts and rockfall, so check the park's website for up-to-date conditions.\n\n**Tips for Driving in the Mountains:**\n\n* Always check the weather forecast before heading out, and be prepared for changing conditions.\n* Drive slowly and cautiously, especially on winding roads and steep inclines.\n* Use low gear when driving uphill, and avoid sudden acceleration or braking.\n* Keep a safe distance from other vehicles, and be prepared for unexpected stops.\n* Make sure your vehicle is in good condition, with proper tire pressure, good tread, and functioning brakes.\n* Bring a winter survival kit with you, including items like a flashlight, first aid kit, and snacks.\n* Consider investing in a portable Wi-Fi hotspot or a GPS device with offline maps, as cell phone reception can be spotty in the park.\n\n**Additional Tips for Visiting in the Spring:**\n\n* Be prepared for snow and ice on the roads, especially at higher elevations.\n* Check the park's website for up-to-date road conditions and trail openings.\n* Bring warm clothing and layers, as the weather can be unpredictable.\n* Consider visiting during the week, as weekends can be busier and road conditions may be more challenging.\n\nBy being prepared and aware of the road conditions, you'll be able to enjoy your trip to North Cascades National Park and Leavenworth.
