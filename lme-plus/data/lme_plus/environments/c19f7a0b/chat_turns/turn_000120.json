For cleaning the inside of the recorder, you can use a soft cloth or swab and some lukewarm water mixed with a few drops of mild dish soap. Make sure to rinse the recorder with clean water and allow it to air dry thoroughly before playing again. 2. To clean the outside of the recorder, wipe it gently with a soft, dry cloth. Avoid using any harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could scratch the surface. 3. For lubricating the joints of the recorder, use a light application of cork grease or petroleum jelly. Apply a small amount of the lubricant to a cotton swab or toothbrush and then apply it to the joints. 4. Some manufacturers also offer specific cleaning and maintenance kits for their recorders. These kits often include a cleaning rod, cloth, and lubricant specifically designed for the recorder. Always make sure to check the manufacturer's instructions before using any specific cleaning solution or oil on your recorder.",
