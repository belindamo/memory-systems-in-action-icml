It's great that you're making good progress on the blanket, and I'm sure your sister will appreciate the love and effort you're putting into it.\n\nFive to six hours a weekend is a great pace, and you should be able to finish the blanket in time for your sister's birthday. Just remember to take breaks, stretch your hands and wrists, and not to rush through the border. The Single Crochet border is a great choice because it's relatively quick to work up, but you still want to make sure you're maintaining even tension and counting your stitches correctly.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'll be here to help. Otherwise, happy crocheting this weekend, and I hope you make great progress on the border!\n\nRemember, the most important thing is the thought and love you're putting into the blanket. Your sister will appreciate the gift, and it'll be a special keepsake for years to come.",
