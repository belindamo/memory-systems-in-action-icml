  "content": "One-pot pasta and chicken fajitas are both great options for a quick and delicious dinner. With an hour to spare, you'll have plenty of time to prepare and cook these meals.\n\nTo make the most of your hour, here are some tips to help you prep and cook efficiently:\n\n**One-Pot Pasta:**\n\n* Start by boiling water for your pasta while you're getting changed or unwinding after work.\n* Chop your veggies (e.g., onions, bell peppers, mushrooms) and cook them in the pot with some oil before adding the pasta, sauce, and protein.\n* Use a pre-made pasta sauce or a simple homemade sauce made with canned tomatoes, garlic, and olive oil.\n* Add your protein of choice (e.g., ground beef, chicken, or veggies) and cook until browned.\n* Add the pasta, sauce, and any other desired seasonings, and let it simmer until the pasta is al dente.\n\n**Chicken Fajitas:**\n\n* Start by slicing your chicken breasts into thin strips and seasoning them with fajita seasoning, lime juice, and olive oil.\n* Chop your bell peppers and onions, and saut\u00e9 them in a hot skillet with some oil until tender.\n* Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until browned and cooked through.\n* Warm your tortillas by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20-30 seconds.\n* Assemble your fajitas with the chicken, peppers, onions, and your desired toppings (e.g., sour cream, salsa, avocado, shredded cheese).\n\nRemember to stay organized, and don't be afraid to multitask to save time. You can also prep some ingredients ahead of time, like chopping veggies or marinating the chicken, to make the cooking process even faster.\n\nEnjoy your meals, and let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance!",
