Here's how some of them handle specific model tracking:\n\n1. **CamelCamelCamel**: You can track prices for specific Amazon product pages, including exact models. Just enter the Amazon product URL or ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) into CamelCamelCamel, and it will track the price history and alert you when the price drops.\n2. **Keepa**: Like CamelCamelCamel, Keepa can track prices for specific Amazon product pages, including exact models. You can enter the Amazon product URL or ASIN, and Keepa will track the price history and alert you when the price drops.\n3. **Honey**: Honey's Droplist feature allows you to track prices for specific products, including exact models. You can enter the product URL or search for the product on Honey, and it will track the price history and alert you when the price drops.\n4. **PriceZombie**: PriceZombie allows you to track prices for specific products, including exact models, across multiple retailers. You can enter the product URL or search for the product on PriceZombie, and it will track the price history and alert you when the price drops.\n5. **Slickdeals**: Slickdeals allows you to track prices for specific products, including exact models, using their \"Deal Alerts\" feature. You can enter the product name or model number, and Slickdeals will alert you when a deal meets your specified criteria.\n6. **Flipp**: Flipp allows you to track prices for specific products, including exact models, by adding them to your shopping list. You can search for the product on Flipp, and it will track the price history and alert you when the price drops.\n\nFor your coffee maker search, you can try using one of these services to track the price of the specific model you're interested in. For example, if you're looking for a \"Breville BDC600 Precision Coffee Maker\", you can enter that exact model number into one of these services, and it will track the price for you.\n\nKeep in mind that some services might not have the exact model you're looking for, especially if it's a newer or niche product. In that case, you might need to track a similar product or a more general category (e.g., \"Breville coffee makers\") and adjust your alerts accordingly.",
