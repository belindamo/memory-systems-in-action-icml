Here are some tips to help you pack your snacks efficiently:\n\n1. **Use small, resealable bags**: Pack each type of snack in a separate, small, resealable bag (like a Ziploc bag). This will keep them fresh, organized, and prevent them from getting crushed or mixed up.\n2. **Compress the bags**: Use a packing cube or a small stuff sack to compress the snack bags, making them take up less space in your backpack.\n3. **Roll the bags**: Roll each snack bag tightly to remove any air and make them more compact.\n4. **Place them in a dedicated snack compartment**: Designate a specific compartment or pocket in your backpack for your snacks. This will keep them organized and easy to find.\n5. **Layer them**: Pack the snack bags in a layering system, with the most frequently accessed snacks on top and the less frequently accessed ones at the bottom.\n6. **Use the backpack's pockets**: Take advantage of your backpack's pockets and compartments to store snacks. For example, you can store energy bars in a small pocket or instant oatmeal packets in a mesh compartment.\n7. **Pack snacks near the top**: Pack your snacks near the top of your backpack, so they're easily accessible when you need them.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to pack your snacks in a compact and organized way, leaving you with plenty of space in your backpack for other essentials.\n\nFor your instant oatmeal packets, you can consider packing them in a small, resealable bag or a dedicated oatmeal container. This will keep them fresh and organized, and you can easily grab them when you need a quick breakfast or snack.\n\nRemember to check the expiration dates of your snacks before packing them, and consider packing a few extra in case of unexpected delays or changes in your plans.\n\nHow do you feel about packing your snacks now?",
