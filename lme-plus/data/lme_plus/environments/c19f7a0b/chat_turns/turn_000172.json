Martin Luther King Jr. - A Baptist minister and one of the most well-known civil rights activists. King led many nonviolent protests, including the Montgomery bus boycott, and delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the March on Washington in 1963.\n\n2. Malcolm X - Although he began as a member of the Nation of Islam, a group that some consider more of a political and social movement, Malcolm X eventually converted to Sunni Islam and continued his fight for civil rights.\n\n3. Jesse Jackson - An ordained Baptist minister who worked alongside King during the civil rights movement. He later became a presidential candidate in 1984 and 1988 and continued his advocacy work for marginalized communities.\n\n4. Ralph Abernathy - A Baptist minister and close associate of King, Abernathy participated in many civil rights protests and led the Poor People's Campaign after King's assassination.\n\n5. Fannie Lou Hamer - A civil rights activist and devout Christian who co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. She famously said, \"I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired\" and used her powerful testimony to advocate for voter rights and other issues affecting black Americans.",
