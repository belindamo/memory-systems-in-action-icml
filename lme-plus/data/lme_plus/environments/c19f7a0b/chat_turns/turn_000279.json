Here's a summary of what we have discussed in this phase:\n\nThe main components of the system are:\n\n* Data ingest system\n* Data processing system\n* Statistical analysis system\n* Machine learning system\n* Prediction system\n* Result scaling system\n* Web front end\n* Monitoring and log aggregation system\n\nWe decided not to include a separate data storage system, as a PostgreSQL database should suffice.
