I'm also excited to experiment with different genres and lighting setups. I've been trying to improve my portrait photography skills, especially when it comes to capturing kids, and I think this project will be a great opportunity to practice and develop my own style. Speaking of portraits, I've been following some photography accounts on Instagram, and I've been getting inspiration from their work. Do you have any tips on how to take my portrait photography to the next level, especially when it comes to working with kids?",
