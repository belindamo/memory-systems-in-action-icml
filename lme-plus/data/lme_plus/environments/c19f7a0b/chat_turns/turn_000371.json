It's always important to make sure you're purchasing compatible RAM and following the manufacturer's instructions to avoid any issues.\n\nIt sounds like you're a creative person who enjoys video editing and gaming! Adobe Premiere Pro is a powerful tool, and 4K footage can indeed be demanding on system resources. It's great that you can now run it smoothly with your new RAM. Overwatch and League of Legends are both popular games that can benefit from increased RAM, so it's awesome that you can play them without any issues now.\n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences like humans do, but I can provide information and answer questions about upgrading RAM and running resource-intensive programs! I'm here to help users like you with their tech-related queries, so feel free to ask me anything.\n\nBy the way, have you noticed any other benefits from upgrading your RAM, such as improved overall system responsiveness or faster loading times?",
