Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **CamelCamelCamel**: As I mentioned earlier, CamelCamelCamel is a browser extension that tracks price history on Amazon. You can create a price watch list and receive alerts when the price drops to a certain level or when it reaches a specific price.\n2. **Keepa**: Keepa is another browser extension that tracks price history on Amazon. You can create a price watch list and receive alerts when the price drops or reaches a specific level.\n3. **Honey**: Honey, the browser extension and mobile app, offers a feature called \"Droplist\" that allows you to track prices on items and receive alerts when the price drops.\n4. **ShopSavvy**: ShopSavvy is a mobile app that allows you to scan barcodes or search for products and track prices across multiple retailers. You can create a price watch list and receive alerts when the price drops.\n5. **PriceZombie**: PriceZombie is a price comparison tool that allows you to track prices on items and receive alerts when the price drops. They also offer a browser extension and mobile app.\n6. **Slickdeals**: Slickdeals is a deal aggregator website and mobile app that allows you to track prices on items and receive alerts when the price drops.

However, it's not as robust as some of the other options mentioned above.\n\nI hope this helps!",
