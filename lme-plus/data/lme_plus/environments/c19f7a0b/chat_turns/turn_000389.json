Since it's not directly in front of a window, it will receive indirect light, which is perfect for this plant.\n* As a bonus, the Snake Plant's upright growth habit will add a nice vertical element to your nightstand, and its sword-shaped leaves will create a striking silhouette against the wall.\n\n**Peace Lily on the Shelf near the Window:**\n\n* Peace Lilies prefer bright, indirect light, and a shelf near a window is an ideal spot for it. East- or west-facing windows are perfect, as they receive gentle, indirect light.\n* Since the Peace Lily is on a shelf, it will receive plenty of natural light without being directly in the sun's path, which can cause leaf scorch.\n* The Peace Lily's elegant white blooms and dark green leaves will add a touch of sophistication to your bedroom, and the shelf will provide a nice elevated display for the plant.\n\nJust remember to rotate both plants every few weeks to ensure even growth and prevent them from leaning towards the light source.\n\nOne more thing to consider: since both plants are relatively low-maintenance, you can move them around your bedroom to find the perfect spot that works for you and your plants. Observe how they respond to the light and adjust their positions accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear how your plants thrive in their new homes!",
