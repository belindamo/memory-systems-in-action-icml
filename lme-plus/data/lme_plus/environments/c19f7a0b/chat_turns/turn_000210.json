  "content": "That's great to hear! \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" is a fantastic novel, and it's even more enjoyable when shared with a friend. Buddy-reading can add a whole new level of depth and excitement to the reading experience. It's wonderful that you're discussing the book with Emily and sharing your thoughts and opinions with each other.\n\nBuddy-reading can also help you stay accountable, motivated, and engaged with the book. It's a great way to explore different perspectives and insights, and you might even discover new aspects of the story that you hadn't considered before.\n\nIf you're looking for more books to buddy-read with Emily, you could try some of the other debut novels I mentioned earlier. Alternatively, you could explore other genres or themes that you're both interested in. Whatever you choose, I hope you continue to have a blast discussing books with your friend!",
