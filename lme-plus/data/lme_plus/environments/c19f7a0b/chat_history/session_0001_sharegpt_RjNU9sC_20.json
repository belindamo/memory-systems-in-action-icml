      "content": "1 In the late Stone Age, the median life\n2 expectancy of humans was only around 33\n3 years; today, the median for people in wealthy\n4 nations is around 80 years, and the global\n5 average is around 67 years. From these\n6 figures, some people conclude that in the Stone\n7 Age most people died around 33 and today\n8 most people die around 67. However, that is\n9 not what these figures mean. The median age\n10 of death is the age by which half of people have\n11 died: it doesn\u2019t matter how long after 33 the\n12 older half survives, or how long before 33 the\n13 younger half died.\n14 In fact, for a child born in the Stone Age,\n15 the most dangerous part of his life would have\n16 been his very early childhood, between birth\n17 and five years of age. If he was able to survive\n18 as long as the median, then there was a very\n19 good chance that he would live into his fifties,\n20 or even his sixties or seventies. Ironically,\n21 although his life expectancy was 33, his thirties\n22 would have been nearly the safest time in his\n23 life!\n24 Modern life expectancy is more than\n25 twice as long as life expectancy in the Stone\n26 Age. But that does not necessarily mean that\n27 an individual today is likely to live exactly\n28 twice as long as an individual from the Stone\n29 Age. The main reason that modern humans\n30 have a higher life expectancy is that almost all\n31 of us survive into adulthood. If we only\n32 compare modern people with Stone Age people\n33 who actually survived to adulthood, there are\n34 still improvements in our expected lifespan,\n35 but they are more modest.\n36 Some imagine that this detail of life\n37 expectancies reveals something unfortunate:\n38 that childhood deaths have been reduced, but\n39 adults can\u2019t really expect to live twice as long.\n40 However, in my view this detail makes the\n41 numbers seem better, not worse. I will gladly\n42 take a world in which children are safe over a\n43 world in which I get 20 or 30 more years of old\n44 age. \n\n25. This passage is primarily concerned with\n(A) criticizing people who want to live\ninto their hundreds.\n(B) persuading people that the way\nhumans lived in the Stone Age was\nhealthier than the way they live now.\n(C) describing two different methods of\naveraging numbers.\n(D) explaining why median life\nexpectancy is so much higher today\nthan in the past.\n26. According to the passage, the median life\nexpectancy is\n(A) the age that half of all people will live\nto, or will live beyond.\n(B) the maximum age to which a person\ncan expect to live.\n(C) about how long a child can expect to\nsurvive.\n(D) the age at which people are most\nlikely to die.\n27. Information from the passage supports\nwhich of the following statements?\n(A) It is now possible to accurately\npredict how long an individual will\nlive.\n(B) The global average lifespan will\nprobably double again in coming\nyears.\n(C) Only a very small percentage of\npeople from the Stone Age are still\nalive.\n(D) Modern life expectancy is shorter in\ncountries that are not very wealthy.\n28. Based on information in the passage, we\ncan conclude that people who reach\nadulthood today\n(A) will probably live somewhat longer\nthan people who reached adulthood\nin the Stone Age.\n(B) shouldn\u2019t expect to live quite as long\nas people did in the past.\n(C) will not live as long on average as\ntheir parents.\n(D) will live twice as long as people who\nreached adulthood in the Stone Age.\n29. Based on information in the passage, we\ncan conclude that a Stone Age man in his\nthirties would most likely\n(A) continue to live for many more years.\n(B) die before reaching adulthood.\n(C) live twice as long as a person born in\nmodern times.\n(D) live only for one or two more years.\n30. With which of the following statements\nwould the author most likely agree?\n(A) It would have been much more\nexciting to live in the Stone Age than\ntoday.\n(B) We\u2019re all much better off in the\nmodern world, where children can\nsafely grow up.\n(C) Adults today are not really any better\noff than they were in the Stone Age.\n(D) The world would be a better place if\nfewer people lived into their\nhundreds"
