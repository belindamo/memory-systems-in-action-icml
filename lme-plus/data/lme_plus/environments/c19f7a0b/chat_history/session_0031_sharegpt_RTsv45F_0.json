However, I can provide two possible interpretations and their corresponding parses:\n\n1. If we assume that the sentence is intended to be \"The soldiers warned about the dangers and fled,\" the Penn Treebank style parse would be:\n\n(S\n(NP (DT The) (NNS soldiers))\n(VP (VBD warned)\n(PP (IN about)\n(NP (DT the) (NNS dangers))))\n(CC and)\n(VP (VBD fled))\n(. .))\n\n2. If we assume that the sentence is intended to be \"The soldiers warned about the dangers that the fleeing people faced,\" the Penn Treebank style parse would be:\n\n(S\n(NP (DT The) (NNS soldiers))\n(VP (VBD warned)\n(PP (IN about)\n(NP (NP (DT the) (VBG fleeing) (NNS people))\n(VP (VBD faced))))))\n(VP (VBD fled))\n(. .))"
