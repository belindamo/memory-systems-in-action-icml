      "content": "Great! The next phase is to identify the main components of the system. Can you break down the main components of the system?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "From what we discussed are the key deliverables I think I would break it down as \n- data ingest system\n- data processing system\n- statistical analysis system\n- machine learning system\n- prediction system\n- result scaling system\n- web front end\n- database for storage of historical data and predictions\n\nAre there any other systems you can think of that I might be missing?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That seems like a good breakdown of the main components based on what we've discussed. However, one additional system that comes to mind is a testing and debugging system, which would be responsible for verifying the accuracy of the predictions and identifying any bugs or errors in the system. This would involve unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.\n\nIn addition to the database for storing historical data and predictions, it might be necessary to have a separate data storage system for raw data, such as a data lake or data warehouse, to handle the large amounts of data being ingested from multiple sources. This would allow for efficient querying and processing of the data.\n\nFinally, it might be helpful to have a monitoring and alerting system in place to notify you if any issues arise with the system, such as if there are performance or availability issues.\n\nDo you think these additional components would be necessary for your project?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I don't think that the quantity of data coming in will be huge and it will mostly be well structured data from the exchange or text that wont need to be indexed. So I'm not worried about just putting it into a postgres database. Potentially with some special time series features turned on.\n\nA monitoring and log aggregation system will defiantly be important. I think using an off the shelf solution for this would be best rather than developing our own. There will need to be further investigation into what to use but we should definitely have it.\n\nAs for testing and debugging we will definitely do it but that's not a system right? It's more of a process?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That makes sense. If you don't anticipate needing a data storage system beyond a PostgreSQL database, that's fine.\n\nRegarding the monitoring and log aggregation system, using an off-the-shelf solution is a good idea, as it will save time and effort. There are several good options available that you can evaluate.\n\nAnd you're right, testing and debugging is not a system per se, but it's an essential process that needs to be integrated throughout the development lifecycle. Unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing should be built into the development process from the beginning to ensure the system works as expected and catches any errors or bugs as early as possible.\n\nBased on what you've said, it seems like we can proceed with the main components we have identified so far, which are:\n\n* Data ingest system\n* Data processing system\n* Statistical analysis system\n* Machine learning system\n* Prediction system\n* Result scaling system\n* Web front end\n* Monitoring and log aggregation system\n\nIs there anything else you would like to add or discuss before we move on to breaking down each component into smaller tasks?"

      "content": "I think that's everything. Could you give me a dot point summary of this phase as you did previously before we move onto the next phase"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure! Here's a summary of what we have discussed in this phase:\n\nThe main components of the system are:\n\n* Data ingest system\n* Data processing system\n* Statistical analysis system\n* Machine learning system\n* Prediction system\n* Result scaling system\n* Web front end\n* Monitoring and log aggregation system\n\nWe decided not to include a separate data storage system, as a PostgreSQL database should suffice. Testing and debugging is an essential process that needs to be integrated throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nNow that we have identified the main components of the system, we can move on to breaking down each component into smaller tasks."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure! Let's start with the first component, which is the Data Ingest system.\n\nHere are some tasks for the Data Ingest system:\n\n* Ingest data from the Coinbase API\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ingest data from the Reddit API\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ingest data from the Twitter API\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ensure that all ingested data is in a consistent format\n* Store the ingested data in the PostgreSQL database\n\nDoes that make sense?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Oh wow I wasn't expecting you to break it down for me but this is great thank you! I think this is good. Maybe for each one of these components there needs to be another task which is to figure out what data needs to be retrieved? This will also guide the database schema and consistent data format"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's a great point! You're right that identifying the specific data that needs to be retrieved is a critical step that will help guide the design of the database schema and the data format. It will also ensure that the data being ingested is relevant to the system's predictions.\n\nSo for each source, we can include a task to identify the specific data that needs to be retrieved. This will involve researching the API documentation for each source to understand the available data fields and selecting the fields that are relevant to the system's predictions.\n\nHere's an updated list of tasks for the Data Ingest system:\n\n* Ingest data from the Coinbase API\n\t+ Identify the specific data that needs to be retrieved\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ingest data from the Reddit API\n\t+ Identify the specific data that needs to be retrieved\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ingest data from the Twitter API\n\t+ Identify the specific data that needs to be retrieved\n\t+ Implement authentication to access the API\n\t+ Retrieve data from the API endpoints\n\t+ Clean and normalize the data\n* Ensure that all ingested data is in a consistent format\n* Store the ingested data in the PostgreSQL database\n\nDoes that sound good to you?"

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Sounds great! I'm ready to move onto the next component when you are"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Great! The next component is the Data Processing system. Here are some tasks for this component:\n\n* Analyze data using statistical methods\n\t+ Choose appropriate statistical methods for analyzing the data\n\t+ Implement statistical methods to analyze the data\n\t+ Test and evaluate the accuracy of the statistical models\n* Analyze data using machine learning methods\n\t+ Choose appropriate machine learning methods for analyzing the data\n\t+ Implement machine learning models to analyze the data\n\t+ Test and evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models\n* Transform data for use in machine learning models\n\t+ Preprocess data to handle missing values or outliers\n\t+ Normalize and standardize data to improve machine learning performance\n\t+ Create features from raw data to improve machine learning performance\n\nAre there any additional tasks you would like to include for the Data Processing system?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "No this looks good! I know order doesn't matter at this stage but I assume that the transform task needs to be completed before the analyze task?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, that's correct! In general, the data transformation task should be completed before the data analysis tasks, as the transformed data will be used as input to the statistical and machine learning models. The transformation process may involve several steps such as cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, and scaling, and it is essential to ensure that the data is in the appropriate format for analysis."
