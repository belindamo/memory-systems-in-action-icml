Here are some tips to help you do just that:\n\n1. **Wash in cold water**: Cold water helps preserve the fabric's softness and prevents shrinkage. Hot water can cause fibers to break down and lose their texture.\n2. **Use a mild detergent**: Choose a gentle, fragrance-free detergent that's designed for washing delicate fabrics. Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach, as they can damage the material.\n3. **Avoid fabric softener**: Fabric softener can leave a residue on your sheets, making them less breathable and potentially causing skin irritation. If you must use fabric softener, make sure to rinse your sheets twice to remove any excess residue.\n4. **Dry on a low heat**: High heat can cause your sheets to shrink or lose their softness. If possible, dry them on a low heat setting or air dry them to prevent damage.\n5. **Avoid over-drying**: Remove your sheets from the dryer while they're still slightly damp. This helps prevent wrinkles and makes them easier to iron. If you air dry, remove them from the drying rack when they're still slightly damp to prevent wrinkles.\n6. **Iron while still slightly damp**: Ironing your sheets while they're still slightly damp helps remove wrinkles more easily and prevents scorching.\n7. **Store them properly**: When not in use, store your sheets in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Fold or hang them neatly to prevent creases and wrinkles.\n8. **Consider using a mattress protector**: A mattress protector can help protect your sheets from stains and spills, making them easier to clean and maintain.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your new Threshold sheets for a long time and keep them looking and feeling their best. Happy sleeping!",
