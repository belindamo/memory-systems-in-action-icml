  "content": "Brutalist architecture became popular in the mid-20th century due to its emphasis on functionality, cost-effectiveness, and durability. It emerged as a response to the optimistic and extravagant architectural styles of the 1920s and 30s, which were seen as impractical and wasteful in the post-World War II era.\n\nBrutalism favored a stripped-down, utilitarian aesthetic characterized by exposed concrete, steel, and raw materials. This style was particularly popular in public and institutional buildings like government complexes, schools, and libraries. Its popularity can also be attributed to its association with socialist and progressive ideologies, as many left-wing movements embraced the style as a rejection of capitalist excess.\n\nDespite its popularity, Brutalism was not without its critics. Some of the main objections to the style included its perceived lack of beauty and grace, its harsh and imposing appearance, and its tendency to age poorly. Critics also argued that the style prioritized function over form, resulting in buildings that lacked any real character or distinctive design features. Additionally, many people found Brutalist architecture to be cold and uninviting, making it an unpopular choice for residential buildings or public spaces designed for leisure or recreation.",
