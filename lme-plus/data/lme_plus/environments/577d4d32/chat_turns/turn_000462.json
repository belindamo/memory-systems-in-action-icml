Using balloons in bright colors will also add a fun and playful touch.\n\nRegarding the sign or banner, I think it's a great idea! A sign or banner with your family name or a special message can be a lovely way to add a personal touch to your photos. It can also serve as a great way to commemorate the occasion and make the photos even more special.\n\nHowever, to avoid it being too cheesy or over-the-top, here are a few tips:\n\n1. **Keep it simple**: Choose a simple design and font that complements your family's style. Avoid anything too flashy or over-the-top.\n2. **Choose a meaningful message**: Instead of something generic like \"Family is everything,\" choose a message that's personal to your family, such as a favorite quote, a inside joke, or a phrase that resonates with your family's values.\n3. **Use it sparingly**: Don't overuse the sign or banner in every single photo. Use it in a few strategic shots, and then put it aside to focus on capturing natural moments and interactions.\n4. **Make it a prop**: Use the sign or banner as a prop to add some fun and playfulness to your photos. For example, you could have each family member hold a letter or symbol, or use it as a fun backdrop for a group shot.\n\nSome ideas for signs or banners could be:\n\n* A simple \"Family\" or \"Love\" sign in a bold, colorful font\n* A banner with your family's name or a special message, such as \"The [Last Name] Crew\" or \"Love is in the air\"\n* A fun phrase or quote that resonates with your family, such as \"Adventure together\" or \"Laughter is the best medicine\"\n* A personalized message, such as \"Grandma and Grandpa's favorite people\" or \"Cousins forever\"\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and be yourselves! The sign or banner should be a fun addition to your photos, not the main focus.",
