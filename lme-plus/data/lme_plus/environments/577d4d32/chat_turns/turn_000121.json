  "content": "On Tuesday, Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James became the all-time leading scorer in the NBA, breaking a record held by Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. James, a four-time NBA champion, MVP and Finals MVP, reached this achievement with 20 seasons of unmatched consistency and scoring prowess. With less than 15 seconds remaining in the third quarter of a 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, James hit a fadeaway jumper from the top of the key to surpass Abdul-Jabbar's record of 38,387 points.\n\nJames's historic shot was celebrated on the court, with a brief ceremony acknowledging his big moments and achievements in his career. He was joined by his family, Abdul-Jabbar, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for a presentation of the game ball. In a statement, Silver praised James's \"towering achievement\" and recognized that he continues to play at an elite level with his basketball history still being written.\n\nOvercome with emotion, James gave a heartfelt speech, thanking his family, friends, and the NBA for allowing him to fulfill his dream. He finished the game with 38 points, seven rebounds, and three assists, shooting 13 for 20 from the field, 4 for 6 on three-pointers, and 8 for 10 from the free throw line.\n\nThe milestone moment was months in the making and was surrounded by anticipation during an otherwise underwhelming Lakers season. With James needing just 36 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, two courtside seats were listed for $75,000 each, and the Lakers issued over 200 media credentials, a season-high. The event was attended by basketball royalty, A-list celebrities, and the NBA Commissioner.\n\nThe evolution of the NBA scoring record has been a journey from Wilt Chamberlain to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to LeBron James. James spent time during his pre-game warm-up working on his version of Abdul-Jabbar's signature skyhook, paying homage to the player he surpassed. On this historic night, James played the game and changed it forever.",
