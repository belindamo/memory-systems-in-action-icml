I've been taking Japanese language classes three times a week, and I think learning about Japanese culture through food will really help me connect with the language more. Do you have any recommendations for cookbooks or food blogs that focus on seasonal Japanese cuisine? I'd love to learn more about the different ingredients and dishes that are popular during different times of the year.",
