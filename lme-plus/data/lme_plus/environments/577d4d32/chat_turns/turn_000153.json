  "content": "A white button-down shirt with ruffles is a great piece to work with! Here are some styling tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Keep it simple**: Let the ruffles be the focal point by pairing the shirt with simple, solid-colored bottoms like jeans, trousers, or a flowy skirt. This creates a chic, effortless look.\n2. **Add a pop of color**: Introduce a bold, bright color with a statement piece of jewelry, a handbag, or a pair of shoes. This adds a fun touch to the outfit and creates visual interest.\n3. **Balance the volume**: Since the ruffles add volume to the top, balance it out with a fitted bottom or a flowy piece with a more streamlined silhouette.\n4. **Play with textures**: Mix and match different textures like lace, denim, suede, or leather to add depth to your outfit. For example, pair the shirt with a suede skirt or distressed denim jeans.\n5. **Try a feminine touch**: Emphasize the femininity of the ruffles by pairing the shirt with a flowy maxi skirt, a fitted pencil skirt, or a pair of high-waisted, flared pants.\n6. **Go for a relaxed vibe**: Roll up the sleeves and unbutton the top buttons for a more casual, undone look. Pair with distressed denim shorts or a flowy maxi skirt for a relaxed, summer-inspired outfit.\n7. **Add a blazer**: Throw on a tailored blazer to instantly dress up the outfit and add a professional touch. This is perfect for a workwear or a more formal occasion.\n\nSome specific outfit ideas to try:\n\n* White ruffled shirt + high-waisted, straight-leg jeans + pointed-toe pumps + statement earrings\n* White ruffled shirt + flowy, midi skirt + ankle boots + layered necklace\n* White ruffled shirt + distressed denim shorts + sneakers + wide-brimmed hat\n* White ruffled shirt + fitted, high-waisted trousers + blazer + loafers\n\nFeel free to experiment and have fun with it!
