Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Rolling:**\n\n* Pros: Reduces wrinkles, saves space, and can help prevent creases.\n* Cons: Can cause clothes to become misshapen, and may not be suitable for delicate or bulky items.\n\n**Folding:**\n\n* Pros: Allows for more control over how clothes are packed, and can be better for delicate or bulky items.\n* Cons: Can cause wrinkles and creases, and may take up more space.\n\n**The Best of Both Worlds:**\n\n* Try a combination of rolling and folding.
