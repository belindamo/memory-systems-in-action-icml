Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Creamy Garlic Chicken Pasta**: Use your garlic press to mince 2-3 cloves of garlic, then saut\u00e9 them in olive oil with your silicone spatula until fragrant. Add diced chicken breast, cook until browned, and then add heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and cooked pasta. Toss everything together with your spatula until the sauce coats the pasta.\n2. **Roasted Garlic and Rosemary Chicken Thighs**: Press 2-3 cloves of garlic using your garlic press and mix with olive oil, chopped rosemary, salt, and pepper. Rub the mixture all over chicken thighs, then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Use your silicone spatula to spread the garlic-herb mixture evenly. Roast in the oven until the chicken is cooked through and crispy.\n3. **Garlic and Herb Frittata**: Press 1-2 cloves of garlic and chop them finely. Saut\u00e9 the garlic with diced bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms using your silicone spatula. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs with salt, pepper, and shredded cheese. Add the cooked vegetable mixture to the eggs and pour into a greased skillet. Cook until the eggs start to set, then use your spatula to gently lift and fold the edges. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the frittata is golden brown.\n4. **Garlic and Lemon Shrimp**: Press 1-2 cloves of garlic and saut\u00e9 them in olive oil with your silicone spatula until fragrant. Add peeled and deveined shrimp, lemon juice, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Cook until the shrimp are pink and cooked through. Serve with crusty bread or over rice.\n\nThese recipes should give you a great opportunity to break in your new garlic press and silicone spatula! Enjoy experimenting and happy cooking!",
