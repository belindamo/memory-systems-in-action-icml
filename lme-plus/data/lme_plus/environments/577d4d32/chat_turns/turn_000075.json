I was wondering if you could help me with something. I really enjoyed working with soapstone in the workshop last month, and I'm interested in getting a small stone carving set for home. Do you know of any local suppliers or stores that sell soapstone or other carving stones? I'm not sure where to find them, and I'd love to get your recommendation.\n\nAdditionally, do you have any tips on what to look for when selecting soapstone for carving? Are there any specific types or qualities that are better suited for beginners like me?\n\nI'd really appreciate your help in finding a good source for soapstone and any advice you can offer on getting started with stone carving at home.\"\n\nThis script shows that you're interested in continuing to learn and practice stone carving, and you're seeking their expertise and guidance. By asking about local suppliers and tips for selecting soapstone, you're demonstrating your enthusiasm and willingness to learn, which can help build a positive relationship with the studio and their instructors.",
