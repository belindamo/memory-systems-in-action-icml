  "content": "I really like the idea of \"Feed the Future 5K\". It's short, catchy, and clearly conveys the purpose of the event. For the registration fee, I think $25 for individuals and $40 for families would be a good starting point. We could also offer a discount for early registration, say $20 for individuals and $35 for families if they sign up by a certain date. Additionally, we could have a \"fundraising challenge\" where participants are encouraged to raise a certain amount of money individually or as a team, and offer prizes for the top fundraisers.",
