  "content": "What a great start! A black cap and white underside are excellent field marks to work with. I'd be happy to help you try to identify the bird you saw. Here are a few questions to help narrow down the possibilities:\n\n1. **Size**: You mentioned medium-sized, but can you give me a better idea of how big it was? Was it smaller than a robin, about the same size, or larger?\n2. **Beak shape and size**: What was the shape and size of the beak? Was it short and stout, long and pointed, or somewhere in between?\n3. **Body shape**: Was the bird plump and rounded, or slender and streamlined?\n4. **Tail**: Was the tail long and forked, short and square, or somewhere in between?\n5. **Wings**: Did you notice any distinctive markings on the wings, such as bars, stripes, or spots?\n6. **Behavior**: What was the bird doing when you saw it? Was it foraging on the ground, perched in a tree, or flying around?\n7. **Habitat**: What's your backyard like? Is it wooded, open, or a mix of both? Are there any specific plants or features that might attract certain birds?\n8. **Location**: Where are you located? Different regions have different bird species, so this can help narrow down the possibilities.\n\nAny details you can provide will help me try to identify the bird you saw!",
