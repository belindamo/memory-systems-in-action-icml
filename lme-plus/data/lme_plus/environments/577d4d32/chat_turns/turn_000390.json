  "content": "A bird with a distinctive red cap, drumming on a tree trunk... That's a great description! \n\nGiven your location in the eastern US, I think it's highly likely that the bird you saw was a Pileated Woodpecker! They're one of the largest woodpeckers in North America, and they're known for their bright red crest (or \"cap\") on top of their heads.\n\nPileated Woodpeckers are also known for their drumming behavior, which is a way for them to establish territory and communicate with other woodpeckers. They typically drum on trees, especially in the spring, and can be quite loud and persistent.\n\nTo confirm the ID, here are a few more questions:\n\n* How big was the bird? Pileated Woodpeckers are large, reaching lengths of up to 19 inches (48 cm) and weighing up to 12 ounces (340 grams).\n* Did you notice any other distinctive markings or features, such as a white stripe on the face, a black back, or a long, pointed tail?\n* Did the bird have a loud, far-carrying call, often described as a series of loud, laughing \"kuk\" notes?\n\nIf you're still unsure, it's possible that the bird you saw was a different species of woodpecker, such as the Red-headed Woodpecker or the Red-bellied Woodpecker. But based on your description, I think Pileated Woodpecker is a strong candidate!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
