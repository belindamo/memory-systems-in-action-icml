According to the publication, Saudi Arabia is one of the largest producers of dates in the world, and has a total area of about 150,000 hectares dedicated to date palm cultivation. The publication also estimates that there are around 28 million date palm trees in Saudi Arabia, but this number includes both fruit-bearing and non-fruit-bearing trees.",
