  "content": "Yes, that is true. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, access to culture and the arts was largely limited to the wealthy and privileged classes, who had the time and resources to attend performances or patronize artists. This was partly due to the cost of producing and staging works of art and the limited availability of public funding. However, as societies became more affluent and more democratic, access to culture and the arts gradually became more widespread. Today, many works of art are accessible to people of all social classes and backgrounds, through public funding, technology, and other means.",
