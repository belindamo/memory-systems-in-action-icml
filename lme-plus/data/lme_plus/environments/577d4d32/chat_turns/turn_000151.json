Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Versatility**: If you love the style and fit of the shirt, having it in multiple colors can create a versatile wardrobe staple that can be mixed and matched with different bottoms, shoes, and accessories.\n2. **Easy outfit creation**: With multiple versions of the same shirt, you can create multiple outfits with minimal effort, as you already know the fit and style work for you.\n3. **Cost-effective**: Buying multiple versions of a shirt you already love can be more cost-effective than searching for similar shirts from different brands or styles.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Repetition**: As you mentioned, having multiple versions of the same shirt can look repetitive, especially if you wear them frequently.\n2. **Limited creativity**: Relying too heavily on the same shirt style might limit your creativity in terms of experimenting with different styles and silhouettes.\n3. **Over-saturation**: If you wear the same shirt style too often, it might lose its specialness and become too familiar to others.\n\nTo make the most of having multiple versions of the same shirt, consider the following:\n\n1. **Space out your wears**: Try to space out your wears of the same shirt style to avoid repetition. For example, wear one version one week and another version a few weeks later.\n2. **Mix and match**: Experiment with different bottoms, shoes, and accessories to create distinct outfits with each shirt.\n3. **Add a twist**: If you do decide to get multiple versions, try to add a twist to each one, like a different sleeve length, collar style, or embroidery detail, to make each shirt feel unique.\n4. **Consider your personal style**: If you have a defined personal style that incorporates a specific shirt style, having multiple versions can be a great way to reinforce your aesthetic.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether having multiple versions of the same shirt works for your personal style and wardrobe needs. If you love the shirt and feel confident wearing it, go for it!",
