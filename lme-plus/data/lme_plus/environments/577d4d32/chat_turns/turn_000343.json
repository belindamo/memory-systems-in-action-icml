I actually uploaded 37 new photos on Instagram during my trip, and surprisingly, my post from the Eiffel Tower got 127 likes, which is a record for me. Anyway, back to Asia, I'm planning to visit Japan and South Korea. I've always been fascinated by their cultures and food. Can you give me some recommendations on must-try dishes and restaurants in these countries?",
