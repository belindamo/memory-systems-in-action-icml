  "content": "I'd like to ask about how to ensure that the kids have fun while working on the mural project. Since I volunteered at the Children's Museum of the Arts, which is a museum I visited in the past month, I saw how much joy and creativity the kids expressed while making art. I want to replicate that experience with this project. Can you provide some tips on how to keep the kids engaged and entertained throughout the process?",
