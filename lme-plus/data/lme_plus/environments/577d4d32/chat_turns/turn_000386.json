  "content": "With that information, let's try to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nGiven the black cap and white underside, I'm going to take a few educated guesses:\n\n1. **Black-capped Chickadee**: A common bird in the eastern US, the Black-capped Chickadee is a medium-sized bird with a distinctive black cap and white underside. They're frequent visitors to bird feeders and are known to forage on the ground. They have a short, stout beak and a rounded body.\n2. **Carolina Chickadee**: Similar to the Black-capped Chickadee, the Carolina Chickadee is also found in the eastern US and has a black cap and white underside. However, they have a slightly longer tail and a more slender beak than the Black-capped Chickadee.\n3. **Tufted Titmouse**: Another possibility is the Tufted Titmouse, which has a distinctive tuft of feathers on its head, giving it a \"crested\" appearance. They have a black forehead and white underside, and are common in the eastern US. They're also known to visit bird feeders and forage on the ground.\n\nAll of these birds are medium-sized, with lengths ranging from 4-6 inches (10-15 cm).\n\nTo help further, can you tell me:\n\n* Did the bird have any distinctive markings on its face, such as a white stripe above the eye or a black stripe through the eye?\n* Did it have any notable behaviors, such as acrobatic movements or a distinctive call?\n* Was the bird alone or with other birds?\n\nAny additional details you can provide will help me try to identify the bird you saw!",
