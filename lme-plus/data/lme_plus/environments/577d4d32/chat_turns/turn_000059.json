  "content": "Making the protagonist a child can add a layer of innocence and perspective to the story. It could also reflect the idea that change and progress can come from unexpected places, and that it's never too early to make a difference in the world. Tying the concept of a \"Pandora's box\" with the number seven could add a sense of fate and destiny to the story, as in many versions of the myth, Pandora's box contains both blessings and curses, and it is said that only \"hope\" remains once the box is opened. The idea that the protagonist is a child during her journey can add a sense of responsibility and decision-making to the story, as she has to weigh the potential consequences of her actions and make a choice knowing she'll live to experience the outcome.",
