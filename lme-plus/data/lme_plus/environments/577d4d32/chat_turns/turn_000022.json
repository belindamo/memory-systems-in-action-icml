  "content": "I'm excited to try out paper clay and see how it compares to traditional ceramic clay. I'll definitely start with a simple project, like a small pendant or charm, to get a feel for the material. Thanks for the tips and advice! I'll make sure to work in small batches, keep it thin, dry slowly, and be gentle when handling the paper clay. Can you recommend any specific paper clay recipes or resources for beginners?",
