Here are a few additional ideas to consider:\n\n* **Influencer partnerships**: Reach out to local fitness influencers, bloggers, or social media personalities to see if they'd be interested in promoting the event to their followers.\n* **Sponsorship announcements**: Create a series of social media posts or email updates to announce your sponsors and highlight their contributions to the event.\n* **Personal stories**: Share personal stories or testimonials from people who have been impacted by the food bank or have participated in the event in the past. This can help create an emotional connection with potential participants.\n* **Countdown series**: Create a countdown series on social media, highlighting a new aspect of the event each day, such as the course route, the fundraising challenge, or the post-event celebration.\n* **Volunteer ambassadors**: Ask volunteers to serve as ambassadors for the event, sharing their experiences and encouraging their friends and family to participate.\n* **Local businesses**: Reach out to local businesses to see if they'd be willing to promote the event in-store or through their own social media channels.\n\nBy leveraging these channels and ideas, you'll be able to create a strong promotional campaign that will help drive registrations and fundraising for the Feed the Future 5K.\n\nHow do you plan to track registrations and fundraising progress, and what's your strategy for following up with participants and donors?",
