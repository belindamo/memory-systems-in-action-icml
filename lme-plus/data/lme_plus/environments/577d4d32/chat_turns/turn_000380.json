  "content": "Some people consider Brutalist architecture to be an eyesore because of its rough, raw, and often imposing appearance. The heavy use of concrete and other unadorned materials can create a stark and cold feeling that some find uninviting or unattractive. Additionally, many Brutalist structures were built during a time of urban renewal and rebuilding, which often involved tearing down historic buildings or displacing residents. As a result, some people associate the style with the destruction and loss of beloved landmarks or communities. Finally, despite its emphasis on function over form, Brutalist buildings can be difficult to navigate, with confusing layouts, narrow corridors, and concrete walls that can make the interiors feel claustrophobic. For these reasons, some people consider Brutalist architecture to be an eyesore, while others admire its raw and unconventional beauty.",
