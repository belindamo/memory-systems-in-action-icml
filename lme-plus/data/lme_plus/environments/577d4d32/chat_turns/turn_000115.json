  "content": "Yes, there are other ancient temples that were built before humans began farming and settled down. One example is the Neolithic temple complex of Mnajdra in Malta, which dates back to around 3,600 BC. The temple complex consists of three structures that were built using megalithic stones and were oriented to align with the rising sun on the solstices and equinoxes. The purpose of the temple complex is not entirely known, but it is believed to have been used for ritual and religious purposes.\n\nAnother example is the megalithic temple complex of Stonehenge in England, which was built over a period of several thousand years, beginning around 3000 BC. The site includes a ring of standing stones, each weighing several tons, and is believed to have been used for astronomical observations, as well as for rituals and ceremonies.\n\nSo, apart from Gobekli Tepe, there are other ancient temples that were built before humans began farming and settled down, and they provide insights into the cultural practices and religious beliefs of the people who built them.",
