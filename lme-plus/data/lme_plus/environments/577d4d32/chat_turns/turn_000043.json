I also want to get some new bedding, maybe something with a soft, natural fabric like cotton or linen. And, of course, I'll make sure to add some cozy throw pillows and blankets to the bed. Do you have any recommendations for a good brand or store to find these types of items?\nBy the way, I got a great deal on a set of sheets at Target's Threshold sale, so I'm excited to try those out!",
