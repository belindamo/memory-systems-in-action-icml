  "content": "I'm interested in learning more about Japanese culture, especially when it comes to food. I've been trying out different types of Japanese cuisine, from ramen to tempura to okonomiyaki. My favorite restaurant so far is a tiny ramen shop in Shibuya called Ichiran. Can you recommend any Japanese cooking YouTube channels or websites that can teach me how to make these dishes at home?",
