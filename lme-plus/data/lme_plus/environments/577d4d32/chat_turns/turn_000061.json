  "content": "The speed at which a myth can integrate into people's beliefs depends on a variety of factors, such as the cultural context and how widely the story is disseminated. In a society where oral tradition is important, a myth might spread quickly through storytelling. In a society with widespread literacy, a written account of the myth might be more influential. Additionally, if the society is experiencing significant upheaval or change, people may be more open to new beliefs and myths. The process of a myth becoming widely accepted can happen over many generations, so it's not necessarily unrealistic for the protagonist to be alive and traveling as a music box maker in her adulthood.",
