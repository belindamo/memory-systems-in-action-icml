  "content": "I've heard that this book is a great choice for a evening read, something to unwind with after a long day. Speaking of unwinding, I've been trying to establish a better evening routine, stopping work emails and messages by 7 pm to separate my work and personal life. It's really helped me relax and not think about work during my personal time. Do you have any recommendations for some relaxing evening activities that I could incorporate into my routine?",
