Here are a few more ideas to consider:\n\n* **Raffle prizes**: Offer raffle prizes donated by local businesses, such as gift cards, fitness classes, or wellness packages. This can be a fun way to raise additional funds for the food bank and give participants a chance to win some great prizes.\n* **Social media contest**: Encourage participants to share their experiences and photos on social media using a branded hashtag. You could have a contest for the most creative post, the most likes, or the most shares, and award prizes for the winners.\n* **Food bank showcase**: Set up an information booth or display to showcase the work of the food bank and the impact of the event. This can help participants learn more about the organization and feel a sense of connection to the cause.\n* **Volunteer recognition**: Take a moment to recognize and thank the volunteers who helped make the event possible. This could include a special shout-out, a certificate of appreciation, or a small gift.\n* **Kids' zone**: If you're expecting a lot of families to attend, consider setting up a kids' zone with activities, games, and entertainment. This can help keep kids engaged and happy while their parents relax and socialize.\n* **Sponsor recognition**: Make sure to recognize and thank your sponsors for their support. This could include a special announcement, a banner or signage, or a social media shout-out.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, you'll create a fun and engaging post-event celebration that will leave a lasting impression on participants and keep them excited for next year's event.\n\nHow do you plan to promote the Feed the Future 5K and get the word out to potential participants?",
