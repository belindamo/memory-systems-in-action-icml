  "content": "Good luck with your thesis research! I'd be happy to help you find relevant research papers on the impact of AI on job markets. Here are some suggestions for databases and search terms to get you started:\n\n**Databases:**\n\n1. **Google Scholar** (scholar.google.com): A great starting point, as it indexes a vast number of academic papers, articles, and books.\n2. **JSTOR** (www.jstor.org): A digital library of academic journals, books, and primary sources in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences.\n3. **Scopus** (www.scopus.com): A large abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature, including journals, conference papers, and books.\n4. **Web of Science** (wokinfo.com): A citation database covering a wide range of sciences, social sciences, and humanities journals.\n5. **arXiv** (arxiv.org): A repository of electronic preprints in physics, mathematics, computer science, and related disciplines.\n6. **ResearchGate** (www.researchgate.net): A social networking site for scientists and researchers to share research papers, projects, and collaborations.\n7. **ScienceDirect** (www.sciencedirect.com): An online platform for scientific, technical, and medical journals and books published by Elsevier.\n8. **IEEE Xplore** (ieeexplore.ieee.org): A digital library of technical literature in electrical engineering, computer science, and related fields.\n\n**Search Terms:**\n\n1. \"Artificial intelligence\" OR \"AI\" AND \"job market\" OR \"labour market\" OR \"employment\"\n2. \"Automation\" AND \"job displacement\" OR \"job replacement\"\n3. \"Machine learning\" AND \"employment impact\" OR \"labour market effects\"\n4. \"Robotics\" AND \"job creation\" OR \"job destruction\"\n5. \"AI adoption\" AND \"industry\" OR \"sector\" AND \"employment effects\"\n6. \"Skills\" AND \"AI\" AND \"future of work\" OR \"job market\"\n7. \"Unemployment\" AND \"AI\" OR \"automation\"\n8. \"Gig economy\" AND \"AI\" OR \"machine learning\" AND \"employment\"\n9. \"Job polarization\" AND \"AI\" OR \"automation\"\n10. \"AI ethics\" AND \"job market\" OR \"employment\"\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. Use quotes to search for exact phrases, like \"artificial intelligence\" or \"job market\".\n2. Use the advanced search features in each database to filter by date, author, publication, and more.\n3. Consider using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search queries.\n4. Look for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or surveys, as they often provide a comprehensive overview of the topic.\n5. Check the references cited in relevant papers to discover more related research.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your research!",
