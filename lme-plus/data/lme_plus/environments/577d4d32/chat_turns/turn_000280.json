However, it is widely acknowledged among education experts that there is no single best education system that all countries should adopt.

What works well in one country may not work in another, and what is suitable for one group of students may not be suitable for another group. Hence it is up to each country to develop an education system that is tailored to its own unique circumstances and meets the needs of its students.",
