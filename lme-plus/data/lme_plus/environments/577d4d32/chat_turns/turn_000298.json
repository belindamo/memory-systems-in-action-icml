  "content": "Here are some datasets that are suitable for beginners, with a relatively small number of rows and columns, and some missing values to practice with:\n\n1. **Iris Dataset**: A classic dataset with 150 rows and 5 columns, containing information about iris flowers. It's a great dataset for practicing handling missing values and data visualization.\n2. **Titanic Dataset**: A dataset with 891 rows and 12 columns, containing information about passengers on the Titanic. It's a great dataset for practicing handling missing values, data visualization, and merging datasets.\n3. **Wine Quality Dataset**: A dataset with 4898 rows and 12 columns, containing information about wine quality. It's a great dataset for practicing handling missing values, data visualization, and feature engineering.\n4. **Airbnb Listings Dataset**: A dataset with 1000 rows and 15 columns, containing information about Airbnb listings in New York City. It's a great dataset for practicing handling missing values, data visualization, and merging datasets.\n5. **Student Performance Dataset**: A dataset with 649 rows and 33 columns, containing information about student performance in a Portuguese school. It's a great dataset for practicing handling missing values, data visualization, and feature engineering.\n\nThese datasets are all available on Kaggle, and you can download them in CSV format. They're relatively small, so you can easily work with them in a Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.\n\nWhen working with these datasets, remember to:\n\n1. **Explore the data**: Take some time to explore the dataset, understand the variables, and identify any missing values.\n2. **Handle missing values**: Practice handling missing values using different techniques, such as mean imputation, median imputation, or listwise deletion.\n3. **Visualize the data**: Use data visualization techniques to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them.\n4. **Merge datasets**: If the dataset comes with multiple files, practice merging them using Pandas.\n5. **Document your process**: Keep a record of your steps, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, to help you reflect on your process and improve over time.\n\nRemember, the goal is to practice and learn, so don't be afraid to make mistakes or try different approaches. Good luck!",
