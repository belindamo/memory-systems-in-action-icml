I've had issues with my current suitcase's wheels getting stuck, so it's good to know that I'll be covered in case anything goes wrong with my new one. Speaking of wheels, I was wondering if you could recommend any luggage accessories that could help make my travels even smoother. I've been thinking about getting a luggage tracker or a portable power bank to keep my devices charged on the go. Do you have any suggestions?",
