The number 1,104,277 was the approximate number of date palm trees in Saudi Arabia according to the FAO in 2017, but it is not related to the amount of date production. The most recent data for date production in Saudi Arabia is approximately 253,330 metric tons in 2020. Based on an average yield of 110 kg of dates per tree per year, this would require an approximate number of 2,303,909 date palm trees.",
