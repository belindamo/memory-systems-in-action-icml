During the performance, Dylan was backed by a rock band (including future members of The Band) and played a set that included iconic songs like \"Maggie's Farm,\" \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" and \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry.\" \"Maggie's Farm\" is a particularly well-known song from this performance, and it's a great example of Dylan's transition from acoustic folk to electric rock. Overall, the entire set is worth a listen for any music fan."
