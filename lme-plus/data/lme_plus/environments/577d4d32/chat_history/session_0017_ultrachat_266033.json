      "content": "Yes, as an AI language model, I can explain the process for determining which teams play against each other in the DFB-Pokal.\n\nThe DFB-Pokal is a knockout cup competition in German football. The process for determining which teams play against each other in the DFB-Pokal involves several stages:\n\n1. The first round of the cup is drawn in June before the start of the new season. The teams entered into the competition include all clubs from the top two professional leagues, the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, and 24 amateur teams from the lower leagues.\n\n2. In the first round, the amateur teams play against each other, while the professional teams are drawn against each other. The draw is made randomly, and the team drawn first plays at home.\n\n3. In the second and third rounds, the remaining teams play against each other, with the draw being made after each round. Again, the draw is completely random, and the team drawn first plays at home.\n\n4. The quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final are played as one-off matches, with the draw made after each round. Like the earlier rounds, the draw is made randomly, and the team drawn first plays at home.\n\n5. The final match is played at the Olympiastadion in Berlin and features the two teams that progressed from the semi-finals.\n\nOverall, the process for determining which teams play against each other in the DFB-Pokal involves a mix of random draws and seeded fixtures to ensure fairness and excitement for all teams involved."

      "content": "As an AI language model, I can surely answer your question. \n\nThe DFB-Pokal involves 64 teams every year, which includes all 18 clubs from the Bundesliga, all 18 clubs from the 2. Bundesliga, and 28 teams from the regional leagues as well as a few amateur teams who qualify from preliminary rounds. \n\nThere are a total of six rounds in the DFB-Pokal, with the first round featuring 32 matches, followed by the second round with 16, and the third round with 8. The quarter-finals have 4 matches, the semi-finals have 2 matches, and the final is the last match of the competition between the two remaining teams."

      "content": "The record for most goals in a single DFB-Pokal season is held by Uwe Seeler, who scored 11 goals in the 1960-61 season. Seeler played for Hamburg at the time and helped his team win the DFB-Pokal that season. Seeler is considered to be one of the greatest German footballers of all time and is also the all-time top scorer for Hamburg with over 400 goals."
