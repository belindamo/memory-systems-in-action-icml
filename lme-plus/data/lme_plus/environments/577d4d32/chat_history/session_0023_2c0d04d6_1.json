Let me dive deeper into its durability and weight:\n\n**Durability:**\n\n1. **Polycarbonate shell:** The Omni PC's shell is made from a high-quality polycarbonate material that's resistant to scratches, cracks, and dents. Polycarbonate is a flexible material that can absorb impacts without shattering, making it an excellent choice for luggage.\n2. **Reinforced corners:** The suitcase's corners are reinforced with additional plastic to protect them from damage. This design feature helps to distribute the impact force, reducing the risk of cracks or breaks.\n3. **Stress points:** Samsonite has designed the Omni PC with strategically placed stress points, which help to absorb shocks and distribute the weight of the luggage more evenly. This design feature helps to prevent damage to the shell and wheels.\n\n**Weight:**\n\n1. **Ultra-lightweight:** The Samsonite Omni PC is incredibly light, with a weight range of 6.3-9.5 pounds (2.9-4.3 kg), depending on the size. This makes it easy to maneuver, even when fully packed.\n2. **Optimized design:** The suitcase's design is optimized to minimize weight while maintaining durability. This is achieved through the use of lightweight materials and a clever design that eliminates unnecessary weight without compromising strength.\n\n**Wheels:**\n\n1. **Spinner wheels:** The Omni PC features four multi-directional spinner wheels that can rotate 360\u00b0, making it easy to maneuver in any direction.\n2. **Durable wheel design:** The wheels are designed to withstand rough handling and are less likely to get stuck. They're also recessed into the suitcase's body, which helps to protect them from damage.\n3. **Smooth rolling:** The wheels are designed to roll smoothly, even on rough surfaces, making it easy to navigate through airports, hotels, and other travel environments.\n\n**Additional features:**\n\n1. **Micro-diamond texture:** The suitcase's shell features a micro-diamond texture that helps to reduce scratches and scuffs.\n2. **Integrated TSA lock:** The Omni PC comes with a built-in TSA-approved lock that allows you to secure your luggage while still allowing airport security to inspect it if needed.\n3. **Comfort grip handle:** The suitcase features a comfortable grip handle that makes it easy to carry, even when fully packed.\n\nOverall, the Samsonite Omni PC is an excellent choice for its durability, lightweight design, and smooth-rolling wheels.
