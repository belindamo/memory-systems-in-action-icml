For James, a four-time NBA champion, a four-time MVP and a four-time Finals MVP, passing Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s hallowed record of 38,387 points reflects an unmatched standard of consistency and scoring prowess across 20 seasons.\nWith less than 15 seconds remaining in the third quarter, James backed down on Thunder forward Kenrich Williams at the left elbow and worked his way across the paint. After bumping Williams to create space, James faded away and to his left, holding his follow-through as his jumper swished through to a loud ovation.\n\u201cI was able to get to a really good spot on the floor, where I\u2019m very comfortable, and get to one of my patented fadeaway shots,\u201d James said. \u201cA lot of people wanted me to go to the skyhook to break the record, or one of my signature dunks. But my fadeaway is a signature play as well. I was able to get it, and it touched nothing but the bottom of the net.\u201d\n\nJames then jogged down the court, raising both of his arms in celebration. The officials stopped the game for a brief ceremony with 10.9 seconds remaining in the period, as a video tribute played on the jumbotron recognizing big moments from James\u2019s career, including his titles with the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Lakers. James was joined on the court by his family, Abdul-Jabbar and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for a presentation of the game ball.\n\n\u201cA record that has stood for nearly 40 years, which, Kareem, many people thought would never be broken,\u201d Silver said. \u201cLeBron, you are the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring leader.\u201d\nLater, in a statement, Silver saluted James\u2019s \u201ctowering achievement,\u201d adding that \"quite amazingly, LeBron continues to play at an elite level and his basketball history is still being written.\u201d\n\nBefore giving a brief speech, James choked back tears and posed for photos with Silver and Abdul-Jabbar, who held up a single finger in recognition of the achievement.\n\n\u201cTo be in the presence of a legend as great as Kareem means so much to me,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling. Please give a standing ovation to the Captain.\u201d\n\nJames then thanked his family, friends and \u201ceveryone who has been a part of this run\u201d for the past two decades.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be me without y\u2019all,\u201d James said. \u201cAll your help, your passion and your sacrifice has helped me get to this point. To the NBA, to Adam Silver, to the late, great David Stern, I thank you guys for allowing me to be a part of something I\u2019ve always dreamed about. I never, ever in a million years would have dreamt this even better than what it is tonight.\u201d\nJames finished with 38 points, seven rebounds and three assists, shooting 13 for 20 from the field, 4 for 6 on three-pointers and 8 for 10 from the free throw line.\n\nThe milestone moment, which came at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles in front of a sellout crowd that repeatedly chanted \u201cM-V-P\u201d as he closed in on the record, was preceded by months of anticipation during an otherwise underwhelming Lakers campaign. James opened the season at media day in September saying he was \u201cin awe\u201d of the scoring record, and his chase of Abdul-Jabbar has been tracked on a game-by-game basis for weeks.\n\nWith James needing just 36 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar entering Tuesday, two courtside seats were listed on Ticketmaster for $75,000 each in the hours before tip-off. Meanwhile, the Lakers issued more than 200 media credentials, a season-high and roughly triple the typical amount, and they deployed large video boards adjacent to the jumbotron to track James\u2019s real-time progress relative to Abdul-Jabbar. At a hotel across from the arena, a large billboard bore James\u2019s image and an appropriate tagline for the occasion: \u201cPlay the game. Then change it forever.\u201d\nBasketball royalty and A-list Hollywood celebrities dotted the crowd. Abdul-Jabbar sat in a baseline courtside seat near the Lakers\u2019 bench, while Silver was joined by a cadre of league office employees on hand to recognize the historic achievement. In an homage to his target, James spent a few minutes working on his own version of Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s signature skyhook during his pregame warmup.\n\nHow the NBA scoring record evolved from Wilt to Kareem to LeBron\n\nActor Denzel Washington, rappers Jay-Z and Bad Bunny, boxer Floyd Mayweather, Nike co-founder Phil Knight, sports commentator Shannon Sharpe, former NBA stars Dwyane Wade and Vince Carter, Dallas Mavericks General Manager Nico Harrison and former Lakers players Magic Johnson, Bob McAdoo, James Worthy and A.C. Green were all in attendance, as were James\u2019s longtime business associates, Rich Paul and Maverick Carter. James\u2019s mother, Gloria, wife, Savannah, and children Bronny, Bryce and Zhuri turned the evening into a family affair. Jim Gray, the host of James\u2019s polarizing \u201cDecision\u201d free agency special in 2010, also mingled courtside before the game.\n\nPerhaps fueled by what he told ESPN was his \u201cdisappointment\u201d over the Lakers\u2019 inability to trade for former teammate Kyrie Irving, or simply a desire to end the circus that has developed around his chase, James came out unusually aggressive, attempting his first shot on the game\u2019s opening possession, scoring eight points in the first quarter, tallying 20 by halftime and breaking the record before the fourth quarter. His every shot was greeted with excited shouts from the crowd, and each made basket drew loud cheers.\n\nJames surpassed Abdul-Jabbar in fewer games (1,410 to 1,560), with a higher scoring average (27.2 points per game to 24.6) and at a younger age (38 to 42).\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar stands on court with LeBron James after James passed Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Abdul-Jabbar's career total of 38,387 points. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nOf course, James had the benefit of a head start by entering the NBA straight out of high school in 2003 at 18; Abdul-Jabbar spent four years at UCLA and debuted at 22. And after opponents such as the San Antonio Spurs famously dared him to shoot from the outside early in his career, James transformed himself into a reliable three-point shooter, thereby giving him another major edge. The NBA didn\u2019t incorporate the three-point line until 1979-80 \u2014 Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 11th season \u2014 and the 7-foot-2 center made just one three-pointer during his career. The 6-9 James, by contrast, has connected on more than 2,200 three-pointers and counting.\nAbdul-Jabbar, 75, had been the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer for more than 38 years. On April 5, 1984, he took a pass from Johnson and sank a skyhook against the Utah Jazz to surpass Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s career total of 31,419 points. Less than nine months later, James was born in Akron, Ohio.\n\nFive truly unbreakable NBA records now that LeBron has passed Kareem\n\n\u201c[James] got out of high school, he had the size and the talent to step right into the NBA, and he immediately started to have his effect,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said in a postgame interview. \u201cThat\u2019s gone for almost 20 years now. You\u2019ve got to give him credit for just the way he planned to last and to dominate. He led teams to [four] world championships, and they didn\u2019t get there because of someone else. LeBron led them. He has that indefinable essence that they call leadership.\u201d\n\nHall of Fame forward Karl Malone had previously come closest to threatening Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s record, retiring with 36,928 points in 2004. Kobe Bryant (33,643) and Michael Jordan (32,292) retired as top-five scorers but never seriously threatened the top spot. Remarkably, the closest active NBA player to James\u2019s total is Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, 34, who ranks 14th all-time with 26,684 points.\nPitched by scouts as a blend of Jordan and Johnson when he was a teenager, James has long prided himself on his ability to balance scoring and playmaking throughout his career, regularly stating that he tries to \u201cplay the right way\u201d rather than pad his own scoring numbers. Proving those lofty pre-draft expectations to be prescient, James now ranks first all-time in scoring and fourth all-time in assists, trailing only John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul. James is also the all-time postseason scoring leader with 7,631 points, topping Jordan (5,987), Abdul-Jabbar (5,762) and Bryant (5,640).\n\nLike Abdul-Jabbar, who led the NBA in scoring in his second and third season but never again, James arrived at the summit thanks to constant progress and durability. James\u2019s only scoring title came in 2007-08, while Jordan won 10 and Chamberlain claimed seven. Yet James has averaged at least 20 points per game in all 20 of his seasons \u2014 and at least 25 points in the past 19.\nLeBron James throws chalk in the air before taking the court for the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Oklahoma City Thunder at Crypto.com Arena on Tuesday in Los Angeles. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nMore prolific scorers such as Jordan, who retired twice in the middle of his career, and Chamberlain, who called it quits after 14 seasons, proved incapable of matching James\u2019s longevity. As such, James has made steady progress up the all-time scoring charts, passing Chamberlain in November 2018, Jordan in March 2019, Bryant in January 2020 and Malone in March 2022.\n\nCase in points: LeBron and Kareem will finally share a bond\n\nIn contrast to Abdul-Jabbar, who dominated the paint thanks to his unmatched skyhook, James isn\u2019t typically associated with one trademark move. Early in his career, his highflying transition dunks and chase-down blocks garnered most of the attention. As he aged, James worked to extend his shooting range beyond the arc and to improve his midrange turnaround jumper. In recent years, James has become even more reliant on the three-pointer, adding a look-away and sidestep combination that helps him generate cleaner looks.\nShortly after the game, a relieved and exuberant James shook hands with Abdul-Jabbar, took pictures with his family and watched a video of his record-setting shot filmed by his son, Bronny.\n\nDuring a postgame news conference in a room that had been rearranged to accommodate a standing room only horde of media members, James sat beside the game ball, which was decorated with a purple crown. He told reporters that he had \u201cdressed for the occasion\u201d with a sharp black suit and black dress shirt, and that he had donned a white headband during the game as a nod to his early days.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has really hit me on what just transpired,\u201d James said. \u201cAs much as I try to live in the moment, it\u2019s kind of a blur.\u201d\n\nGiven that James is under contract through the 2024-25 season and said recently that he is \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d and plans to play \u201cat least a few more years,\u201d he is on track to become the first NBA player to score 40,000 points \u2014 and he could exceed that threshold by a considerable margin.\nBefore James exited the arena, weaving through dozens of well-wishers, he was asked how the scoring record might impact the \u201cGreatest Of All Time\u201d debates that pit him against Jordan, Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell and other legends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great barbershop talk,\" James said. \"It\u2019s going to happen forever and ever. If I was the GM, or whatever the case may be, of a franchise that was starting up, and I had the No. 1 pick, I\u2019d take me.\u201d"
