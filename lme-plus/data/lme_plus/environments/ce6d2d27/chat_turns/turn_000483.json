The Khalifa is considered to be the successor of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement, and is responsible for interpreting the teachings of Ahmad and applying them to modern-day circumstances. The Khalifa is also responsible for guiding the community in matters of faith, providing religious education, and overseeing community projects and initiatives.\n\nThe teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad emphasized the importance of following the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad in everyday life, promoting peace and tolerance, and promoting the spiritual and moral development of individuals. Ahmad believed that the world was in a state of moral decline and that the teachings of Islam could be used to improve society.\n\nThe Khalifa serves as a living embodiment of these teachings and is expected to maintain a high moral standard. The Ahmadiyya community places great emphasis on obedience to the Khalifa, and followers are expected to abide by his teachings and guidance. The role of the Khalifa therefore plays a crucial role in ensuring the continued growth and development of the Ahmadiyya community.",
