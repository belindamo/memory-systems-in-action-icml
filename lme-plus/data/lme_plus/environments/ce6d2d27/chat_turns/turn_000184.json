Freezing can help preserve the flavor and aroma for up to 2-3 years.\n8. **Grind whole spices:** Whole spices like cumin, coriander, and cinnamon can be stored for longer periods than ground spices. Grind them just before using to release their flavor and aroma.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help preserve the flavor and aroma of your spices and herbs and ensure they remain potent and flavorful for a longer period.\n\nNow, go ahead and experiment with those Middle Eastern spices and herbs!",
