  "content": "Aw, thank you so much for your kind words and support! I really appreciate it.\n\nAs for calming music and nature sounds, I think I'm more drawn to instrumental music and nature sounds. I find that lyrics can sometimes be distracting or even triggering for me, so instrumental music or sounds that are more ambient and calming tend to work better.\n\nIn terms of nature sounds, I think I'd really enjoy sounds like rain, thunderstorms, or ocean waves. There's something about the constant, soothing rhythm of those sounds that I find really calming.\n\nI've also been interested in exploring more atmospheric and ambient music, like Brian Eno or Tim Hecker. Their music often has a really calming and peaceful quality to it, and I think it could be really helpful for my anxiety.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for instrumental music or nature sounds that might be helpful for me? I'm really open to exploring different options and finding what works best for me.",
