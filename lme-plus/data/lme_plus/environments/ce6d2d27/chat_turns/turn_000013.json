  "content": "The coconut lime panna cotta with mango salsa is a fantastic dessert that will provide a wonderful contrast to the spicy and savory flavors of the jerk chicken.\n\nFor the mango salsa to serve with the dessert, I would recommend making a slightly sweeter and less spicy version compared to the one you're serving with the jerk chicken. You can use a similar recipe as a base, but adjust the ingredients to suit the dessert course. Here are some tips to help you create a dessert-friendly mango salsa:\n\n1. **Reduce the heat**: Omit or reduce the amount of jalape\u00f1o or other hot peppers to minimize the heat in the salsa. You want the salsa to be sweet and tangy, not spicy.\n2. **Add more mango**: Increase the amount of mango in the salsa to make it sweeter and more fruit-forward. You can use a combination of ripe and slightly underripe mango for the best flavor and texture.\n3. **Balance the acidity**: Adjust the amount of lime juice to balance the sweetness of the mango. You may want to add a bit more lime juice to cut the richness of the coconut panna cotta.\n4. **Add a hint of sweetness**: Consider adding a drizzle of honey, agave nectar, or brown sugar to the salsa to balance out the flavors. This will help the salsa complement the sweetness of the coconut panna cotta.\n5. **Fresh herbs**: Add some fresh herbs like mint, basil, or cilantro to the salsa for a bright and refreshing flavor.\n\nHere's a rough guide to get you started:\n\n**Dessert Mango Salsa Recipe**\n\n* 2 ripe mangos, diced\n* 1/2 red onion, diced\n* 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped\n* 2 tablespoons lime juice\n* 1 tablespoon honey or agave nectar (optional)\n* Salt to taste\n\nMix all the ingredients together and adjust to taste. You can also add a splash of Grand Marnier or other orange-flavored liqueur to give the salsa a subtle citrus flavor.\n\nRemember, the key is to create a sweet and tangy salsa that complements the coconut lime panna cotta. Taste and adjust as you go, and don't be afraid to experiment with different flavors until you find the perfect balance. Good luck, and I hope your dinner party is a huge success!",
