While \"Into the Woods\" may oversimplify the complexities of human relationships, it can still be seen as an aspirational message that encourages people to strive towards empathy and selflessness in their relationships. The show can serve as a reminder of the importance of teamwork and supporting each other, which can ultimately lead to healthier and more fulfilling relationships.
