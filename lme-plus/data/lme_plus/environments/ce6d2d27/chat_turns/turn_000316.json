  "content": "Kowloon Walled City's extreme population density was the result of several factors, including historical, political, economic, and social influences. Some of the main factors that contributed to its high density were:\n\n1. Legal ambiguity: Kowloon Walled City existed in a unique political situation. After the British took control of the Kowloon Peninsula in 1898, the Walled City remained under Chinese jurisdiction. Over time, it evolved into a legal gray area, with neither the British colonial administration nor the Chinese government exerting effective control over it. This lack of regulation and oversight allowed the Walled City to become a haven for criminal activities, such as gambling, drug production, and prostitution, which attracted many residents.\n2. Migration and urbanization: During the 20th century, Hong Kong experienced rapid urbanization and an influx of migrants from mainland China. Many of these migrants sought affordable housing, and Kowloon Walled City offered a low-cost option due to its lack of regulation and oversight. The need for housing led to the construction of informal, cramped, and poorly built structures, which contributed to the city's high population density.\n3. Limited space: Hong Kong has a mountainous terrain, which has always placed constraints on available land for development. Kowloon Walled City was confined to a relatively small area, measuring just 6.4 acres (about 0.01 square miles). As more people moved in, the only way to accommodate them was to build vertically, resulting in closely packed high-rise structures.\n4. Informal economy: The lack of formal governance and regulation in Kowloon Walled City led to the development of a vibrant informal economy. Many residents operated small businesses, workshops, and factories within their homes, making the city a self-sustaining economic ecosystem. This attracted more people seeking employment or economic opportunities.\n5. Social networks and community: Despite its reputation for crime and squalor, Kowloon Walled City had a strong sense of community. Residents often relied on their social networks for support and assistance, which helped draw more people to the area, further increasing its population density.\n\nThese factors combined to create an environment where Kowloon Walled City became one of the most densely populated areas in the world.",
