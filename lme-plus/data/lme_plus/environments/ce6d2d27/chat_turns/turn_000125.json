However, I can provide some general information about controversies and criticisms faced by the French Academy in recent years.\n\nThe French Academy, also known as the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, has faced criticism over the years for its perceived elitism, lack of diversity, and resistance to change. Some critics have accused the institution of being out of touch with modern French society.\n\nIn 2018, the French Academy sparked controversy when it proposed changing the spelling of certain French words to be more gender-neutral. Some argued that the proposals were too politically correct and would lead to confusion.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, the French Academy has defended its role as a guardian of the French language and culture. It has also taken steps to address some of the concerns raised, such as increasing the representation of women and ethnic minorities in its ranks. In 2019, the Academy elected its first female permanent secretary, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Carr\u00e8re d'Encausse, who served as the President of the Academy from 2019 to 2020.",
