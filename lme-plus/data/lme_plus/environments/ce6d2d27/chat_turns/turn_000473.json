  "content": "Speaking of the characters in \"Into the Woods,\" I thought it was interesting how the show blended different fairy tale stories and brought them together in a unique way. It was a creative way to explore these themes of empathy and selflessness while also telling a fun and engaging story. Plus, the humor in the show helped balance out some of the heavier themes.",
