Here are some tips to help you ensure you're tensing the right muscles:\n\n**General Guidelines:**\n\n1. **Start with a gentle tension**: Don't overdo it. Begin with a gentle, subtle tension in each muscle group. You should feel a slight sensation of tightness, but not pain or discomfort.\n2. **Focus on the sensation**: Pay attention to the sensation of tension in each muscle group. You might feel a slight burning, warmth, or tightness.\n3. **Hold for a brief moment**: Hold the tension for about 5-7 seconds, then release.\n\n**Specific Tips for Common Muscle Groups:**\n\n1. **Lower Back:**\n\t* Imagine you're pulling your belly button towards your spine.\n\t* You can also try to arch your back slightly, feeling the muscles in your lower back engage.\n\t* Avoid tensing your stomach muscles, as this can cause discomfort.\n2. **Shoulders:**\n\t* Roll your shoulders forward and up towards your ears.\n\t* You can also try to squeeze your shoulder blades together.\n\t* Release the tension, feeling your shoulders drop and relax.\n3. **Neck:**\n\t* Slowly tilt your head to the right, bringing your ear towards your shoulder.\n\t* Hold for a few seconds, then release.\n\t* Repeat on the left side.\n4. **Arms:**\n\t* Bend your elbows and flex your biceps, as if you're curling weights.\n\t* Hold, then release, feeling the relaxation spread through your arms.\n5. **Hands:**\n\t* Make a fist, squeezing your fingers together.\n\t* Hold, then release, feeling the relaxation spread through your hands.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use a mirror**: Observe yourself in a mirror as you tense each muscle group. This can help you develop awareness of the correct muscles to engage.\n2. **Practice in front of a wall**: Stand or sit with your back against a wall, which can help you maintain proper posture and engage the correct muscles.\n3. **Listen to guided recordings**: Listen to guided progressive muscle relaxation recordings, which can help you learn the correct technique and pace.\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n\n1. **Over-tensing**: Don't tense the muscles too hard, as this can cause discomfort or pain.\n2. **Tensing the wrong muscles**: Be mindful of the specific muscles you're targeting. For example, avoid tensing your stomach muscles when trying to tense your lower back.\n3. **Not releasing fully**: Make sure to fully release the tension in each muscle group before moving on to the next one.\n\nBy following these guidelines and tips, you'll become more comfortable with tensing the correct muscles and enjoying the benefits of progressive muscle relaxation.\n\nDo you have any more questions or concerns about tensing specific muscle groups?",
