  "content": "My living room has a pretty relaxed, cozy vibe, and I'd describe the style as a mix of modern and traditional. The dominant colors are pretty neutral - beige, cream, and wood tones. Since I rearranged the furniture, I've got a nice little reading nook with a coffee table in the corner, and I'm thinking of adding some decorative items around that area to make it feel even cozier.",
