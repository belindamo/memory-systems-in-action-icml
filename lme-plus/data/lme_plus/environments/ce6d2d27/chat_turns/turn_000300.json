  "content": "I do not have a web development background, but here are some general tips that may help ensure keyboard-only navigation on websites:\n\n1. use semantic html tags: ensure that you use the correct html tags like \"nav\", \"header\", \"main\", \"footer\", and \"aside\" to properly structure the webpage. use \"tabindex\" to set the order in which the elements are navigated.\n\n2. provide visible focus indicators: focus indicators tell users where their keyboard is currently focused on the web page. ensure they are visible and that the focus point moves smoothly and predictably.\n\n3. keyboard shortcuts: provide keyboard shortcuts that help users to navigate around the website using the keyboard only.\n\n4. avoid using mouse-based events: avoid using mouse-based events like \u201cmouseenter\u201d and \u201cmouseleave\u201d for functionality, as some users may not have a mouse, and these events cannot be detected with the keyboard only.\n\n5. test for keyboard accessibility: use a keyboard-only interface to test and ensure that all parts of the website are easily accessible through keyboard-only navigation.\n\n6. provide documentation: provide documentation on how to use the website with a keyboard, particularly if you have custom-built features that may not be self-explanatory. \n\nby implementing these changes, web developers can help users with mobility impairments navigate their websites effectively using a keyboard only.",
