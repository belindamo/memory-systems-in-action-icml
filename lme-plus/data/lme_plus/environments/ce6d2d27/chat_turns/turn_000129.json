  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether the French Academy will start offering online courses or resources for people who want to learn French outside of France. However, it is worth noting that the Academy is known for its work in promoting and preserving the French language and culture. In recent years, they have expanded their reach by creating online resources and programs for teaching French to students around the world. \n\nFor example, the French Academy has partnered with various institutions and organizations to offer MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and other digital resources for language learners of all levels. Additionally, the Academy has also created the \"Dicovia\" project, which is a collaborative platform for creating and distributing digital resources related to the French language and culture.\n\nGiven these initiatives, it is possible that the French Academy may continue to develop and expand their online offerings for language learners in the future.",
