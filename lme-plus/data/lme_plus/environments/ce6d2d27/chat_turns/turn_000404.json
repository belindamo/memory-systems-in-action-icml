  "content": "With your budget in mind, you should be able to get tickets to most of these shows, along with transportation and some merchandise.\n\nAs for ticket availability, some of these shows might sell out quickly, while others might have tickets available closer to the date. Here's a rough estimate of the demand for each show:\n\n**High demand, might sell out quickly:**\n\n1. **Phoebe Bridgers** at Music Hall of Williamsburg - Phoebe has a strong following, and this venue is relatively small, so tickets might go fast.\n2. **Weyes Blood** at Brooklyn Steel - Weyes Blood has been gaining popularity, and Brooklyn Steel is a popular venue, so don't wait too long to grab tickets.\n3. **Khruangbin** at Brooklyn Steel - Khruangbin has a dedicated fan base, and this show might sell out quickly, especially since it's a Friday night.\n\n**Moderate demand, might sell out eventually:**\n\n1. **Julien Baker** at The Bell House - Julien Baker has a strong following, but The Bell House is a smaller venue, so tickets might not sell out immediately.\n2. **The Tallest Man on Earth** at Town Hall - Town Hall is a larger venue, so tickets might not sell out as quickly, but it's still a popular show.\n3. **Yola** at The Bowery Ballroom - Yola is gaining popularity, and The Bowery Ballroom is a well-known venue, so tickets might sell out eventually.\n\n**Lower demand, might have tickets available closer to the date:**\n\n1. **Four Tet** at Good Room - Four Tet has a dedicated following, but Good Room is a smaller venue, and electronic shows might not sell out as quickly.\n2. **Sharon Van Etten (DJ set)** at Public Records - This is a DJ set, and Public Records is a smaller venue, so tickets might not sell out immediately.\n3. **Oneohtrix Point Never** at Pioneer Works - Oneohtrix Point Never has a dedicated following, but Pioneer Works is a unique venue, and tickets might not sell out as quickly.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just estimates, and ticket sales can be unpredictable. If you're interested in a particular show, I'd recommend checking ticket availability regularly and setting up price alerts on ticketing websites like Ticketmaster, AXS, or Songkick.\n\nRemember to also factor in transportation costs, merchandise, and any additional expenses when planning your concert outing. Enjoy the show!",
