  "content": "Yes, there are specific regulations in place for dangerous flight tests that are overseen by aviation authorities, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States or the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in Europe. These regulations provide guidance on what constitutes a dangerous flight test, the procedures that must be followed to ensure safety, and the requirements for reporting and investigating any incidents or accidents that may occur. \n\nFor example, the FAA has regulations on flight-test procedures, which provide guidance on how to develop test plans, conduct flight tests, and evaluate test results. The regulations also provide rules for conducting flight tests related to airplane certification, which include control surface effectiveness, stall characteristics, and flight envelope expansion.\n\nThe goal of these regulations is to ensure that flight tests are conducted safely and efficiently, while also minimizing risks to flight crews, aircraft, and the public.",
