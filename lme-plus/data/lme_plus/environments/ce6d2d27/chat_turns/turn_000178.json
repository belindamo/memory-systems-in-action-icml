  "content": "What a great idea! Mango can add a wonderful sweetness and creamy texture to the curry. Yes, you can definitely add mango to the lentil curry. Here's how:\n\n**Adding Mango to the Curry:**\n\n1. **Diced mango:** Add 1-2 cups of diced fresh mango ( ripe but firm) to the pot during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking. This will allow the mango to heat through and blend with the flavors of the curry.\n2. **Mango puree:** If you prefer a smoother texture, you can puree 1-2 cups of cooked mango in a blender or food processor and add it to the curry during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. This will give the curry a creamy, sweet, and tangy flavor.\n\n**Tips for adding mango:**\n\n* Use ripe but firm mango for the best flavor and texture. Overripe mango can make the curry too sweet and mushy.\n* Adjust the amount of mango according to your personal taste. If you prefer a stronger mango flavor, add more. If you prefer a subtle hint of mango, start with 1 cup and taste as you go.\n* Be gentle when stirring the curry after adding the mango, as it can break down and become mushy.\n* If using mango puree, start with a small amount and taste as you go, as it can quickly overpower the other flavors.\n\n**Other options:**\n\n* You can also add mango chutney or mango powder to the curry for an intense mango flavor. Start with a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) and adjust to taste.\n* If you want to add a tropical twist to the curry, you can add a splash of coconut milk or coconut cream along with the mango.\n\nRemember, the key is to taste as you go and adjust the seasoning and sweetness to your liking. The mango will add a new dimension to the curry, so be prepared to make some tweaks to the spice levels and saltiness.\n\nEnjoy your mango-infused lentil curry!",
