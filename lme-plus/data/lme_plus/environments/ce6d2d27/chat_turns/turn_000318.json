  "content": "Kowloon Walled City was an extraordinary place with several counterintuitive aspects that might surprise those unfamiliar with its history. Some of these aspects include:\n\n1. Strong sense of community: Despite the city's notorious reputation for crime, squalor, and overcrowding, residents often reported a strong sense of community and camaraderie. Neighbors relied on each other for support and assistance, and a mutual trust developed among the residents.\n2. Self-sufficiency: Given its dense population, limited resources, and lack of formal governance, one might assume that the Walled City would have been dependent on external support for its survival. However, the city developed a self-sustaining informal economy, with residents operating small businesses, workshops, and factories within their homes. There were also schools, medical clinics, and religious institutions that catered to the community's needs.\n3. Relative safety: Although Kowloon Walled City was a haven for criminal activities such as drug production, gambling, and prostitution, many residents reported feeling relatively safe within the city. The close-knit community and the absence of effective police intervention led to a unique form of self-governance, with some criminal groups providing a degree of security for the residents.\n4. Adaptability and ingenuity: The extreme population density and lack of space in the Walled City forced residents to be highly adaptable and resourceful. They ingeniously built their homes to maximize space, with structures often sharing walls and floors. They also developed intricate networks of narrow alleys, rooftop pathways, and shared communal spaces.\n5. Access to natural light and air: Despite the densely packed buildings and narrow streets, residents were able to create shared open spaces, courtyards, and rooftop gardens that allowed for natural light and air circulation. This was achieved through the adaptive use of space and the ingenuity of the residents.\n\nThese counterintuitive aspects of Kowloon Walled City illustrate the adaptability and resilience of its residents in the face of extreme living conditions.",
