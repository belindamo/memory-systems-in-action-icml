  "content": "Matt and I are starting a podcast together - tentatively called \"After the wire\". \n\nWe will interview early stage founders to understand the real challenges they are facing building their company, learning about the ups and downs of their journey, and what they're trying to build. It has an emphasis on substance and building, rather than the hype of investing. \n\nWe will initially use founders that we've invested in as guests, but expand to other founders that we want to build relationships with as well. \n\nGiven this, please help us with creating a show outline, potential intro/outro script, and whatever else we may need to get started in creating a podcast like summaries, descriptions etc.\n\nThe audience is people in early stage tech, venture investors, and people generally interested in startups.",
