  "content": "It is difficult to accurately predict the population of Kowloon Walled City if it had not been demolished and continued to be developed until the present day. However, we can make an estimation based on historical data and trends.\n\nAt its peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kowloon Walled City was one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with an estimated 50,000 residents living within its 6.4-acre area. That translates to a population density of approximately 3,250,000 people per square mile.\n\nAssuming that the Walled City could maintain or even increase its population density through further development, we can consider a few scenarios:\n\n1. A conservative estimate: If the population density had remained constant since the early 1990s, the population in 2023 would be approximately the same, at around 50,000 residents.\n2. A moderate growth estimate: If the population density had increased at a moderate rate, say 1% per year, the population in 2023 would be around 50,000 \\* (1 + 0.01)^(2023-1990) \u2248 68,000 residents.\n3. A high growth estimate: If the population density had increased at a more aggressive rate, say 3% per year, the population in 2023 would be around 50,000 \\* (1 + 0.03)^(2023-1990) \u2248 120,000 residents.\n\nThese numbers are purely speculative and do not account for factors like infrastructure constraints, resource availability, and social, economic, or political changes in the region. However, they provide a rough idea of how Kowloon Walled City's population might have evolved if it had not been demolished.",
