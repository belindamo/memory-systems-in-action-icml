  "content": "I totally agree with using a pre-trained language model like BERT as a starting point. It's a great way to leverage the knowledge it has gained from its massive training dataset and adapt it to my specific task. I'll definitely explore fine-tuning BERT for my task and see how it performs. Thanks for the advice!\n\nNext, I'm thinking of exploring different preprocessing techniques to prepare my dataset for training. What are some common preprocessing techniques that I should consider, and how can I evaluate their effectiveness?",
