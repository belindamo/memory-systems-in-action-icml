  "content": "The question of what constitutes life is a complex and ongoing area of scientific investigation and philosophical inquiry. Generally, life is defined as a characteristic property or quality that distinguishes physical entities with biological processes, such as growth, reproduction, adaptation, and metabolism, from those without such processes. Life is also associated with the presence of certain molecular and cellular structures and processes, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, cells, and energy exchange.\n\nHowever, different disciplines and perspectives have proposed different definitions and criteria for what constitutes life, and there is ongoing debate and discussion about whether there are forms of life that do not fit within traditional definitions, such as viruses or synthetic organisms.\n\nOverall, while there is no one single, universally agreed-upon definition of life, it is generally characterized by a range of properties and processes that allow living organisms to grow, reproduce, adapt, and interact with their environment in complex and dynamic ways.",
