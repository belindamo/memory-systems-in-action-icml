  "content": "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes objects with mass to attract each other. It is a universal force that affects everything with mass, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest structures in the universe. Gravity is what keeps planets in orbit around their stars, causes objects to fall towards the ground, and holds galaxies together. The strength of gravity between two objects depends on their mass and the distance between them. The more massive the objects and the closer they are to each other, the stronger the gravitational force between them. Gravity is described mathematically by the theory of general relativity, which was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century.",
