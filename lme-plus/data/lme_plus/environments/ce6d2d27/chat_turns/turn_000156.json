  "content": "Adding tofu is a fantastic idea! Tofu can absorb the flavors of the korma sauce beautifully and provide a nice protein boost to the dish. It's a common practice in Indian cuisine to add paneer (Indian cheese) or tofu to korma recipes, so you're on the right track!\n\nHere's how you can incorporate tofu into the recipe:\n\n**Tofu Preparation:**\n\n* Use extra-firm tofu, drained and cut into small cubes (about 1-inch or 2.5 cm).\n* In a shallow dish, mix together 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.\n* Toss the tofu cubes in the cornstarch mixture to coat evenly.\n* Heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the tofu from the skillet and set aside.\n\n**Adding Tofu to the Korma Recipe:**\n\n* Once you've prepared the sauce and vegetables, add the cooked tofu to the saucepan with the sauce.\n* Simmer the mixture for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the tofu is fully coated in the sauce and heated through.\n* Adjust the seasoning as needed, and serve the Vegetable Korma with tofu over basmati rice, naan bread, or with some roti.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Make sure to press and drain the tofu before cutting it into cubes to remove excess moisture.\n* Don't overcook the tofu, as it can become dry and crumbly.\n* You can also marinate the tofu in some yogurt and spices before cooking it for added flavor.\n\nBy adding tofu, you'll not only make the dish more substantial but also increase its protein content. Enjoy your delicious and satisfying Vegetable Korma with tofu!",
