  "content": "Grilled jerk chicken with mango salsa is a fantastic choice! The spicy and aromatic flavors of the jerk seasoning will pair beautifully with the sweet and tangy mango salsa.\n\nAnd absolutely, grilled asparagus and quinoa would make a wonderful side dish to accompany the jerk chicken! The slightly charred flavor of the asparagus will complement the smoky flavors of the jerk seasoning, while the quinoa will provide a nice textural contrast and help to soak up the juices from the chicken and salsa.\n\nGrilled asparagus is a simple but delicious side dish that's easy to prepare. Just toss the asparagus spears with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and grill them alongside the chicken until tender and slightly charred. You can also add some grated Parmesan cheese or a squeeze of lemon juice for extra flavor.\n\nQuinoa is a great choice as a side dish, too. You can flavor it with some saut\u00e9ed onions, garlic, and herbs like thyme or cilantro to give it a bit of depth. Alternatively, you could try a citrus-herb quinoa recipe, which would tie in nicely with the tropical flavors of the mango salsa.\n\nNow, about that cocktail-making class \u2013 how exciting! I hope you have a blast learning new recipes and experimenting with different flavors and techniques. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help or inspiration with cocktail pairings for your dinner party. Spicy mango margaritas are a great starting point, but you might want to consider offering a few other options to cater to different tastes. I'd be happy to suggest some pairing ideas or recipes if you'd like!",
