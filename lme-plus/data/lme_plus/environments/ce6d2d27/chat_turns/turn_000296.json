Some of her notable accomplishments include:\n\n1. Co-sponsoring the Green New Deal resolution, which has helped to bring national attention to the urgency of the climate crisis and promote the need for a transformative approach to addressing it.\n\n2. Advocating for a $15 minimum wage as part of the Raise the Wage Act, which passed the House of Representatives in 2019.\n\n3. Co-sponsoring the Automatic Voter Registration Act, which seeks to expand voter access and increase voter turnout.\n\n4. Proposing the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act, which aims to provide relief to people struggling to pay rent or mortgages due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile not all of her proposals have been successfully passed into law, Ocasio-Cortez's activism on social justice and equity issues has started important conversations in Congress and brought national attention to these critical issues.",
