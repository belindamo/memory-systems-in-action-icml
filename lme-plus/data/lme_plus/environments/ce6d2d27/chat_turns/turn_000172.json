  "content": "You're going to have a blast experimenting with those recipes! The Paloma is a fantastic choice to showcase grapefruit juice, and it's a very popular cocktail in Mexico. The bitterness of the grapefruit pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the tequila, and the lime juice adds a nice touch of acidity.\n\nThe Tequila Sour is indeed a unique twist on the classic margarita, and the addition of egg white gives it a silky, velvety texture. The orange liqueur adds a subtle citrus flavor that complements the tequila nicely. It's a great cocktail to try if you want to experiment with egg whites in cocktails.\n\nRemember to adjust the amount of grapefruit juice and orange liqueur to your taste, as they can be quite potent. And don't be afraid to experiment with different types of grapefruit juice, such as pink or ruby red, to see how they affect the flavor profile.\n\nAlso, if you want to take your Tequila Sour to the next level, you could try using a flavored simple syrup, such as a citrus or spice-infused syrup, to add an extra layer of depth to the cocktail.\n\nHave fun during your class, and I hope your experiments turn out amazing!
