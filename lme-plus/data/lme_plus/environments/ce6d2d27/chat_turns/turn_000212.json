  "content": "La Mer and Drunk Elephant are both great brands! I'd be happy to help you explore new options.\n\nBefore I dive into recommendations, could you please tell me a bit more about your skin type and concerns? For example:\n\n1. What's your skin type (normal, dry, oily, combination, sensitive)?\n2. What are your main skin concerns (acne, hyperpigmentation, fine lines, dehydration, etc.)?\n3. Are you looking for specific product types (moisturizer, serum, exfoliant, sunscreen, etc.)?\n4. Do you have any preferences for natural/organic, fragrance-free, or cruelty-free products?\n\nAs for your Chanel handbag splurge, happy belated birthday to your sister! Treating yourself (or in this case, using a good excuse) is always a great idea.\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your skin needs, I can provide you with personalized recommendations from various brands, including some new ones you might not have tried before!",
