      "content": "After the natural disaster of 1692, Port Royal had to be rebuilt and has gone through many changes over the years. Today, Port Royal is a small town on the southern coast of Jamaica, bordered by Kingston Harbor on one side and the Caribbean Sea on the other. Most of the town's colonial architecture was destroyed in the disaster and subsequent earthquakes, so the current buildings are mostly modern. However, the town has retained some historical landmarks, including Fort Charles, which has been restored and is now a tourist attraction, and the St. Peter's Church, which was partially destroyed in the earthquake and restored. Port Royal is also known for its seafood and has several restaurants that specialize in seafood dishes."
