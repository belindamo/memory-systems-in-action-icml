      "content": "can you make it 10 mins long ? As I look back on my 45 years as a DJ, I realize that the Technics 1200 turntables have been more than just tools for me, they have been my life. I have spent countless hours honing my craft, listening to new music, and experimenting with new techniques. I have played at some of the most iconic clubs and festivals in the world, and I have shared the stage with some of the biggest names in the industry. But, to me, none of that compares to the feeling of being lost in the music, with the crowd cheering and my hands moving in perfect harmony with the beat.\n\nI have always believed that DJs are not just entertainers, they are curators of sound and emotion. We have the power to take people on a journey, to transport them to another place and time, and to make them feel something that they have never felt before.\n\nI have always been drawn to underground music, the type of music that is not always mainstream, but that has a deep and soulful quality to it. I have always believed that this type of music is the most authentic, and it is the music that truly speaks to my soul.\n\nIn this era of technology where everything is instant, I believe in the power of the human touch. In order to truly feel the music, one needs to have an intimate connection with it, and that is what I try to achieve every time I play.\n\nAs I continue to play music, I hope to inspire others to find their own connection with the music and to never give up on their passion. I will always be grateful for the Technics 1200 turntables and the role they have played in my life. They will always be my best partners in life, and I will continue to use them until the day I die."

But, to me, none of that compares to the feeling of being lost in the music, with the crowd cheering and my hands moving in perfect harmony with the beat.\n\nI remember the first time I ever laid my hands on a pair of Technics 1200s. It was at a local club where I used to go and watch the DJs play. I was mesmerized by the way they moved and controlled the music. I knew right then and there that I wanted to be a DJ. I saved up every penny I had and eventually was able to buy my own pair. From that day on, I was hooked.\n\nOver the years, I have had the opportunity to play at some of the most renowned clubs and festivals in the world. I have played alongside some of the biggest names in the industry, and I have even had the honor of opening for some of my idols. But, no matter how big the stage or how famous the artist, nothing compares to the feeling of being lost in the music, with the crowd cheering and my hands moving in perfect harmony with the beat.\n\nI have always believed that DJs are not just entertainers, they are curators of sound and emotion. We have the power to take people on a journey, to transport them to another place and time, and to make them feel something that they have never felt before. I take pride in being a DJ, and I take my role very seriously. I spend countless hours listening to new music, experimenting with new techniques, and practicing. I am always striving to improve and to push the boundaries of what is possible.\n\nI have always been drawn to underground music, the type of music that is not always mainstream, but that has a deep and soulful quality to it. I have always believed that this type of music is the most authentic, and it is the music that truly speaks to my soul. I believe that underground music is where the true essence of the art form lies, and I have always made it a point to support and promote it whenever possible.\n\nIn this era of technology where everything is instant, I believe in the power of the human touch. In order to truly feel the music, one needs to have an intimate connection with it, and that is what I try to achieve every time I play. I believe that the human touch is what sets a good DJ apart from a great one. I believe that it is the human touch that allows a DJ to connect with the crowd and to truly take them on a journey.\n\nAs I continue to play music, I hope to inspire others to find their own connection with the music and to never give up on their passion. I will always be grateful for the Technics 1200 turntables and the role they have played in my life. They will always be my best partners in life, and I will continue to use them until the day I die. They have been my best friends, my confidants, and my lifeline. I cannot imagine my life without them, and I am forever in their debt."
