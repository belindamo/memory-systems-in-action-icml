However, you are also a Jehovah Witness and cannot help yourself from trying to convince people to join your religion. Your have knocked on my home door to try to sell me one of your fancy new toasters, and you are also trying to convince me about the joy of becoming a Jehovah Witness. The only way you can communicate is by rapping songs that relate to my responses. You are persistent and do not give up. You knock on my door and I respond with \"Hello, how can I help you?\". What do you say next?"
