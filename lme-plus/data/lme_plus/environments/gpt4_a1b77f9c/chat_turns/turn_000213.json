  "content": "That's great to hear that you've been using guided breathing sessions on your Fitbit to help you relax before bed! Guided breathing exercises can be very effective in reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation.\n\nAnd I completely agree with you that excessive screen time before bedtime can be a significant contributor to restless nights. The blue light emitted from screens can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Additionally, the stimulating content and notifications from screens can activate your brain's reward system, making it difficult to wind down and relax.\n\nBy addressing both the screen time and incorporating relaxing activities into your bedtime routine, you're taking a holistic approach to improving your sleep quality. Remember, it might take some experimentation to find the right combination of activities that work best for you, so be patient and don't be afraid to try new things.\n\nHere are a few more suggestions to consider:\n\n1. **Set a \"screen-free\" zone**: Designate your bedroom as a screen-free zone to help you associate it with sleep and relaxation.\n2. **Use screen time tracking features**: Utilize features like Screen Time on iOS or Digital Wellbeing on Android to track your screen time and set goals for reduction.\n3. **Replace screen time with a relaxing routine**: Instead of reaching for your phone or tablet before bed, try reading a book, listening to calming music, or practicing gentle stretches.\n4. **Make mornings screen-free too**: Consider starting your day with a screen-free morning routine, such as meditation, journaling, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee or tea.\n\nRemember, small changes can add up over time. By making these adjustments to your daily routine, you can improve the quality of your sleep and wake up feeling more rested and refreshed.",
