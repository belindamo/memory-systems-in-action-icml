I'll probably set up a few tables and have a buffet-style dinner so that everyone can serve themselves and mingle. I'll also add some candles and fairy lights to create a warm glow, and maybe some soft background music to set the mood.\n\nI'm also thinking of having a few fun activities, like a photo booth or a game, to keep everyone entertained. And, of course, I'll make sure to have plenty of coffee and cheesecake on hand!",
