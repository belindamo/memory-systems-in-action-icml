I've actually been listening to a lot of podcast episodes about theater history and behind-the-scenes stories, and I recently heard an episode about the making of \"The Phantom of the Opera\". It was really fascinating to learn about how Andrew Lloyd Webber and Charles Hart came up with the iconic music and lyrics. Do you know if there are any documentaries or books about the making of specific musicals like \"Phantom\"? I'd love to learn more about the creative process behind some of my favorite shows.",
