Clean the garments before storing them: Before storing your knitwear, make sure they are clean and completely dry to keep away any moisture and prevent mildew or mold buildup.\n\n2. Fold the garments neatly: Folding knitwear, instead of hanging it, can help to maintain its shape over time. If you do hang knitwear, be sure to use padded hangers to avoid stretching out the shoulders.\n\n3. Store in a cool, dry place: Knitwear should be stored in a cool, dry and well-ventilated space, away from direct sunlight. Heat and humidity can cause the fibers to break down and encourage the growth of mold and mildew.\n\n4. Use mothballs or cedar blocks: To prevent moth damage, you can use mothballs or cedar blocks in the storage area.\n\n5. Rotate garments regularly: To avoid dust buildup or indentations from folding, it's a good idea to rotate knitwear garments, giving them a chance to breathe and recover between wears.\n\nThese tips can help ensure that your knitwear looks great for years to come.",
