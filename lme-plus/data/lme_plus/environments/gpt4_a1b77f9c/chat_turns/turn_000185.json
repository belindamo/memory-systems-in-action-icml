  "content": "What a great approach! Prioritizing tasks based on your energy levels can make a huge difference in your productivity and overall well-being. I'd be happy to help you plan out your day.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about the tasks you need to accomplish today? What are the most important ones, and which ones can be done when your energy levels are lower?\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n1. What are your top 3-5 priorities for the day?\n2. Which tasks require the most mental or physical energy?\n3. Are there any tasks that can be done in shorter bursts or in a more relaxed state (e.g., responding to emails, data entry, or routine admin tasks)?\n4. Are there any tasks that you've been putting off or procrastinating on, and would be best tackled when you're most focused and energized?\n\nOnce you share more about your tasks, I can help you create a plan to tackle the most important ones during your peak energy hours (before 3:00 PM) and save the less demanding tasks for when your energy levels dip.",
