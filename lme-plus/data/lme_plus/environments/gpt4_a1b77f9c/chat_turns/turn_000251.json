It's been getting a lot of buzz, and I've heard great things about it. The show's creator, Kerry Ehrin, is known for her work on shows like Parenthood and Friday Night Lights, so I'm not surprised to hear that it's well done.\n\nThe Morning Show tackles some heavy topics, like the Me Too movement, the role of women in media, and the cutthroat world of morning television. The show features an all-star cast, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell, which is definitely a draw for many viewers.\n\nI've heard that the show's strongest aspect is its portrayal of complex, multi-dimensional female characters, which is something that's often lacking in media. The show also explores themes of power, privilege, and accountability, which are all relevant to our current cultural landscape.\n\nIf you're enjoying it, I'd love to hear more about what you think of the show! What do you think of the characters and their storylines? Are there any particular themes or topics that resonate with you?\n\n(By the way, I'm curious - how do you like Apple TV+ so far? Are you finding that it's worth the subscription cost?)",
