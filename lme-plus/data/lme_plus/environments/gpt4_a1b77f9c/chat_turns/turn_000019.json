  "content": "Sure, here are some tips on how to properly eat injera:\n\n1. Tear off a small piece of injera with your right hand (in Ethiopia, the left hand is considered unclean) and use it to pick up a bite of food. 2. Use your thumb to scoop up the food and then use the injera to transfer it to your mouth. 3. Repeat the process with each bite, tearing off a new piece of injera as needed. 4. Be aware that injera often has a slightly sour taste, which is an acquired taste for some people. 5. It is common to share injera and dishes with others by tearing off a piece of injera and using it to pick up food from a shared platter. Remember, eating injera is a social and communal experience, so don't be afraid to share and try new things. Enjoy!",
