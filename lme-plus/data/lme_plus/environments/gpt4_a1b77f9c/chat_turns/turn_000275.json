Jemisin - This is the first book in the Broken Earth trilogy, which is an incredible work of fantasy. The story follows Essun, a powerful orogene, as she navigates a world torn apart by natural disasters and oppression.\n2. **The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang - This is a fantasy epic inspired by Chinese history and mythology. The story follows Rin, a young orphan who enrolls in a prestigious military academy and discovers her latent powers as a shaman.\n3. **The Wrath and the Dawn** by Renee Ahdieh - This is a lush and atmospheric retelling of The Arabian Nights, with a strong female protagonist named Shahrzad who volunteers to marry the ruthless caliph of Khorasan.\n4. **The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August** by Claire North - This novel follows a woman named Katharine, who is reborn every time she dies, remembering everything from her past lives. It's a thought-provoking exploration of reincarnation, time travel, and the consequences of human action.\n5. **The House of Shattered Wings** by Aliette de Bodard - Set in a post-apocalyptic Paris, this dark fantasy novel follows a young woman named Philippe, who is trying to survive in a world where fallen angels and rival houses fight for power.\n6. **The Girl Who Drank the Moon** by Kelly Barnhill - This is a beautifully written novel that follows a young girl named Luna, who is accidentally fed magic by a witch and develops incredible powers.\n7. **The Bear and the Nightingale** by Katherine Arden - This is a beautifully written fantasy novel set in medieval Russia, following a young girl named Vasilisa, who has the power to communicate with the spirits of nature.\n\nThese books all feature complex, strong, and intriguing female protagonists, and I think you'll find at least one that resonates with you!\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., adult vs. YA, light vs. dark fantasy, etc.)!",
