  "content": "I'd be happy to help! However, I need to know which country you're referring to in order to provide the relevant data. Could you please tell me which country you're interested in?\n\nThat being said, I can provide some general information on the dependency ratio and its impact on social security systems.\n\nThe dependency ratio is a demographic indicator that measures the number of dependents (people aged 0-14 and 65+) per 100 working-age individuals (aged 15-64). It's an important metric for understanding the potential strain on social security systems, as it indicates the number of people relying on working-age individuals for support.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the global dependency ratio is expected to increase significantly over the next few decades due to aging populations. By 2050, the global dependency ratio is projected to rise from 53.1 in 2020 to 72.2, meaning that there will be approximately 72 dependents per 100 working-age individuals.\n\nHere are some examples of dependency ratios for select countries:\n\n* Japan (2020): 78.4 (one of the highest in the world)\n* Italy (2020): 63.6\n* United States (2020): 52.2\n* China (2020): 41.4\n* India (2020): 46.6\n* Brazil (2020): 44.8\n\nPlease let me know your country, and I can provide the most recent data available on the dependency ratio.",
