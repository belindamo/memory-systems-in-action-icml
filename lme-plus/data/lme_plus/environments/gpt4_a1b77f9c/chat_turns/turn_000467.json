  "content": "To include Winnipeg in the calculation of the addressable market, we first need to find the population of the city and the estimated number of individuals aged 55 and above. As of 2021, Winnipeg\u2019s population was approximately 750,000. Assuming the 55+ demographic makes up approximately 20-25% of the population:\nWinnipeg:\n20% of 750,000 = 150,000\n25% of 750,000 = 187,500\nNow, we will add the Winnipeg estimates to the previous range for the other towns and communities (204,000 - 256,625):\nTotal addressable market including Winnipeg:\n204,000 + 150,000 = 354,000 (low estimate)\n256,625 + 187,500 = 444,125 (high estimate)\nTo calculate the number of sales needed to reach 2% of the total addressable market, including Winnipeg:\n2% of 354,000 = 7,080 sales\n2% of 444,125 = 8,882.5 sales\nSince you cannot have a fraction of a sale, you would need to round up the second number.\nSo, to reach 2% of the total addressable market, including Winnipeg, you would need to make between 7,080 and 8,883 sales.",
