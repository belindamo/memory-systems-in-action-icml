Be mindful of what you wear with your knitwear: Avoid wearing jewelry or other accessories that can easily catch onto your garments, as these can snag and cause damage. You may also want to avoid wearing items with sharp edges or rough materials that could cause snags, such as denim or waxed canvas.\n\n2. Hand wash or use laundry bags: It's best to hand wash knitwear, but if you prefer to machine wash, use a laundry bag to protect the garments in the cycle. Make sure to close all zippers and hooks on other clothes in the same laundry bag to avoid snags.\n\n3. Keep your knitwear away from pets: Pet claws can easily cause snags in knitwear, so keep your garments away from pets.\n\n4. Store knitwear separately: When storing knitwear, make sure to store it separately from other clothing items to avoid snags. You may also want to place a layer of tissue paper in between the folded garments to avoid rubbing and snags.\n\nBy taking some simple precautions, you can help prevent snags and prolong the life of your knitwear.",
