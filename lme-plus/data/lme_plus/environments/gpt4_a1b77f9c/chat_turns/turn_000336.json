  "content": "Certainly! As a beginner with no previous coding experience, I would recommend starting with Codeacademy or FreeCodeCamp. Codeacademy offers structured and interactive lessons for a variety of programming languages, while FreeCodeCamp offers a comprehensive curriculum for web development with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Both resources are free to use and provide a good foundation for beginners. Additionally, Khan Academy offers step-by-step coding tutorials specifically for beginners, so that could be a solid option as well.",
