I've been thinking a lot about how these themes relate to my own experiences as a woman, and I started listening to \"The Power\" by Naomi Alderman today, which got me thinking about how I take certain things for granted. Do you think \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" would be a good fit for someone interested in exploring these themes further?",
