And by leaving some buffer time before your yoga class, you'll ensure a smooth transition from work mode to relaxation mode.\n\nRemember to be flexible with your plan, and don't hesitate to adjust it if needed. You've got a solid schedule in place, and with some buffer time, you'll be able to unwind and enjoy your yoga class.\n\nHow does this revised plan look to you?",
