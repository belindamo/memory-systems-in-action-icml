But, here are some general tips that can help in avoiding pilling on knitwear for humans:\n\n1. Choose high-quality yarns: Investing in high-quality, tightly-spun yarns can help reduce pilling in knitwear. Cheaper yarns, which may be loosely spun and contain more short fibers, are more prone to shedding fibers and pilling.\n\n2. Wash knitwear inside out: This helps to reduce the amount of friction that the garment is exposed to during washing, which can cause pilling. It's also important to use the gentle cycle and a mild detergent.\n\n3. Avoid fabric softeners: Fabric softeners can break down the fibers in knitwear, making them more prone to pilling. Try using a specially-formulated wool detergent instead.\n\n4. Don't hang knitwear to dry: Hanging knitwear can cause it to stretch out of shape and increase the likelihood of pilling. Instead, lay it flat on a clean towel to dry.\n\nTo repair existing pills in knitwear, you can:\n\n1. Use a pill shaver: This is a handheld tool that pulls the pill away from the fabric and cuts it off. Be sure to use the tool gently and not press too hard, as this can damage the knitwear.\n\n2. Use scissors: Carefully trimming (not cutting) the pills off with a sharp pair of scissors can also be effective, but it can be more difficult to avoid damaging the fabric.\n\n3. Use a sweater stone: Rubbing a sweater stone over the affected areas can help remove pills. This method is gentle and doesn't damage the knitwear, but it can take longer than using a pill shaver.",
