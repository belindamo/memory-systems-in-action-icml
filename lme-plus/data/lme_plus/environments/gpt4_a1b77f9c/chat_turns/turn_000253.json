Jennifer Aniston's performance as Alex Levy is indeed fantastic, and I've heard that she's a big reason why the show works so well.\n\nRegarding Apple TV+, I'm with you - the original content is definitely promising, but the selection is still limited compared to other streaming services. However, I think it's great that they're focusing on quality over quantity, and I'm excited to see what they'll be releasing in the future.\n\nI haven't checked out For All Mankind yet, but I've heard great things about it! It's a sci-fi alt-history series that explores what would've happened if the Soviet Union had beaten the US to the moon. The show's creator, Ronald D. Moore, is known for his work on Battlestar Galactica, so I'm expecting great things.\n\nI have checked out Servant, which is a psychological thriller series from M. Night Shyamalan. It's a slow-burning show that explores the strange and unsettling world of a young couple who hire a nanny to care for their baby doll (yes, you read that right). The show's atmosphere is super creepy and unsettling, and I'm curious to see where it goes.\n\nWhat do you think about the future of streaming services? Do you think Apple TV+ will be able to compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu, or will it carve out its own niche in the market?",
