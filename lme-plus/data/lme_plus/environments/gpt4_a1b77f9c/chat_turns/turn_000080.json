Here's a breakdown of each show's seasons and episodes:\n\n**True Detective**\n\n* **Season 1 (2014)**: 8 episodes\n\t+ Stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as two detectives investigating a series of gruesome murders in Louisiana across a 17-year period.\n* **Season 2 (2015)**: 8 episodes\n\t+ Stars Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, and Vince Vaughn in a new story set in California, exploring a complex case involving a series of crimes and conspiracies.\n* **Season 3 (2019)**: 8 episodes\n\t+ Stars Mahershala Ali and Stephen Dorff as two detectives investigating a series of macabre crimes in Arkansas across three time periods: 1980, 1990, and 2015.\n\nEach season is a standalone story with new characters, settings, and mysteries. You can watch them in any order, but I recommend watching in the order they were released to appreciate the evolution of the show.\n\n**Westworld**\n\n* **Season 1 (2016)**: 10 episodes\n\t+ Introduces the theme park Westworld, where guests can interact with lifelike robots (hosts) in a Wild West setting. The story follows a group of characters, including Dr. Ford (Anthony Hopkins), Bernard (Jeffrey Wright), and the Man in Black (Ed Harris), as they navigate the park's secrets and the awakening of the hosts.\n* **Season 2 (2018)**: 10 episodes\n\t+ Explores the aftermath of the hosts' rebellion and the consequences of playing God. The story delves deeper into the park's inner workings, the true purpose of the park, and the humans' quest for power and control.\n* **Season 3 (2020)**: 8 episodes\n\t+ Takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the hosts have escaped the park and are fighting for survival. The story follows Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), Bernard, and Caleb (Aaron Paul) as they navigate the real world and confront the consequences of their actions.\n\nWestworld is a complex, thought-provoking show that rewards careful attention and multiple viewings. It's best to watch the seasons in order to appreciate the unfolding narrative and character development.\n\nBoth shows feature complex storytelling, moral ambiguity, and thought-provoking themes. If you enjoy philosophical discussions, complex characters, and intricate plots, you'll likely appreciate both \"True Detective\" and \"Westworld\".",
