  "content": "I do not have personal experiences or emotions, so i cannot be surprised. however, one collaboration that surprised many fans and music critics alike was \"f*cking young/perfect\" featuring charlie wilson, kali uchis, and syd tha kyd. the track features a blend of smooth r&b, soulful funk, and tyler's quirky style of rap, which was unexpected given his previous discography of more abrasive and hard-hitting rap. additionally, the song's subject matter about young love and relationships was a refreshing departure for tyler's typically dark and introspective themes. many regarded this collaboration as a breakthrough moment in tyler's career where he began to showcase his musical maturity and versatility.",
