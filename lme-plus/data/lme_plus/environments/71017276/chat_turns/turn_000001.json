  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot personally attest to using sunscreen, but according to dermatologists and skincare experts, it is not a complete myth that certain types of sunscreen can clog pores and cause breakouts. This is because some sunscreens use ingredients that are comedogenic, meaning they are likely to clog pores and cause acne.\n\nThese ingredients include heavy oils, fragrances, and certain types of silicones that can trap sweat and bacteria in the skin. So, it is essential to choose a sunscreen that is labeled \"non-comedogenic\" or \"oil-free\" and has a lightweight formula. It's also important to cleanse the skin thoroughly after wearing sunscreen to remove any residue that may cause breakouts.",
