However, Pacifika is known for being family-friendly and promoting cultural education for all ages. Many of their tours and activities are suitable for families with young children. For example, the \"Suva City Walking Tour\" is an easy walking tour suitable for all ages, including families with young children. Similarly, the \"Fijian Culinary Experience\" and the workshops on traditional crafts are also appropriate for families with young children. It's always best to contact Pacifika Eco Tourism directly to confirm age requirements for specific tours and activities, as this will vary depending on the activity.",
