  "content": "As an AI language model, I'd like to clarify that the SPF level of a sunscreen does not directly affect the likelihood of getting breakouts. The SPF level only indicates the amount of UVB protection the sunscreen provides against sunburns, but it does not affect the likelihood of clogged pores that can cause breakouts.\n\nHowever, it is still important to choose a sunscreen that suits your skin type and does not cause breakouts. Some people may find that higher SPF sunscreens contain more pore-clogging ingredients, while others may find that lower SPF sunscreens contain more fragrances or other potential irritants. So, it's a matter of finding the right balance that works for your skin.\n\nRemember that applying sunscreen is crucial to protect your skin from sun damage and reduce the risk of skin cancer. Finding a sunscreen that works for your skin is essential to maintain healthy and clear skin.",
