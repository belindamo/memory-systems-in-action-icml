  "content": "As of 2021, solar energy is the most popular renewable energy source worldwide. Solar energy is growing rapidly in popularity due to its wide availability and declining costs of solar panels, making it a cost-effective source of power. Wind energy is also becoming increasingly popular, especially in countries with strong winds, such as the United States, China, and India. Hydroelectric power has historically been the largest source of renewable energy, mainly due to the availability of large hydroelectric dams, but its growth has slowed down in recent years due to environmental concerns. Ultimately, the popularity of each renewable energy source varies by location, available resources, and infrastructure.",
