  "content": "Yes, there have been several collaborations with unexpected artists that Tyler, The Creator has worked with over the years. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. \"Earthquake\" featuring Playboi Carti: Playboi Carti is known for his trap-influenced rap style, which is quite different from Tyler's more alternative and eclectic sound. However, the song became one of Tyler's biggest hits yet, and the two artists' different styles blended together seamlessly.\n\n2. \"EARFQUAKE\" featuring Charlie Wilson and Devonte Hynes: Charlie Wilson is a seasoned R&B veteran, and Devonte Hynes is a multi-instrumentalist and producer. Both artists have a completely different style from Tyler's usual sound, but their collaboration on this song resulted in a catchy and infectious track that became one of Tyler's most popular songs.\n\n3. \"Puppet\" featuring Kanye West: Collaborating with Kanye West may not seem unexpected on the surface, but the song they worked on together, \"Puppet,\" is a melancholic, introspective track that features Tyler singing instead of rapping, which is not something he is known for. The result was a haunting and emotional song that showcased a different side of both artists.\n\nThese collaborations show Tyler, The Creator's willingness to work with artists outside of his usual musical wheelhouse and his ability to create unique and unexpected music by pushing boundaries and experimenting with different sounds and styles.",
