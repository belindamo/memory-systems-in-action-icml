Cookies and tea are a match made in heaven, and I've got a perfect recipe that pairs beautifully with berry-flavored tea, especially Berry Bliss!\n\nIntroducing... Shortbread Cookies with Dried Cranberries and Orange Zest!\n\nThese buttery shortbread cookies are infused with the sweetness of dried cranberries and the brightness of orange zest, making them an ideal companion to your Berry Bliss tea.

Preheat your oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.\n2. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
