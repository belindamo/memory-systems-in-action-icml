  "content": "North American Telugu Society, a non-profit organization formed in 2009 by 200 volunteers of similar values to serve Telugu communities across North America through cultural, spiritual, social, and educational activities. So far volunteers solicited, collected, and disbursed funds for charitable purposes to meet the goals of the organization; and to preserve, propagate and perpetuate Telugu cultural heritage in North America. Our flagship has been 24x7 helpline 1-888-483-5848 to provide immediate assistance for anyone needing help\nBi-annually NATS conducts a 3-day convention where approximately 8000 people attend to celebrate Telugu culture. This year we are planning to celebrate our 7th annual convention at Raritan Convention Center from May 26-28. This three-day mega event includes various cultural, literary, business symposiums, shark tanks, continuing Education classes, Women's forums, and career development for the younger generation. \nEvery year we invite few dignitaries (e.g Vice President of India Mr. Venkaiah Naidu, Apple Ex-CEO John Scully, Kapil Dev, Dean of Wharton Business School etc.) state governors for the main event. This year we would like to invite you as our chief guest and address an exclusive \"CXO '' group to share your experience as an immigrant and CEO of PepsiCo. Along with the above we would like you to address the 8000 people gathering on the mainstage during primetime, which would be a great inspiration for all of us. We also want to honor you with a Lifetime Achievement Award.",
