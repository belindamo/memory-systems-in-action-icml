You can use online real estate platforms, such as Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com, to find recent sales data.\n3. **Analyze the sales data**: Compare the sales prices of the comps to the asking price of the property you're interested in. Consider the following factors:\n\t* Sales price per square foot: Calculate the sales price per square foot of each comp and compare it to the asking price per square foot of the property.\n\t* Sales-to-list price ratio: Calculate the sales-to-list price ratio of each comp to see how close the sales price was to the original list price.\n\t* Days on market: Look at how long each comp was on the market before it sold. A shorter days-on-market period may indicate a hotter market.\n4. **Adjust for differences**: Adjust the comps to account for any differences between the properties, such as:\n\t* Upgrades or renovations: If a comp has upgraded features or renovations, you may need to adjust the sales price downward to account for the added value.\n\t* Lot size or location: If a comp has a larger lot or a more desirable location, you may need to adjust the sales price upward to account for the added value.\n\nSome specific questions to ask when gathering comps include:\n\n* What is the average sales price per square foot in the neighborhood?\n* How do the comps compare in terms of age, condition, and amenities?\n* Are there any signs of a seller's market or buyer's market in the area?\n* Are there any external factors affecting the market, such as new developments or changes in local zoning laws?\n\nBy gathering and analyzing comps, you'll be able to make a more informed decision about the asking price of the property and whether it's reasonable for the area.\n\nWould you like me to help you gather some comps for the property you're interested in?",
