  "content": "If the images columns in your query are returning NULL values, it could be because there are no matching records in the \"ps\\_image\" table for the product ID in the \"ps\\_product\" table. This can occur if a product does not have any images associated with it, or if there is a problem with the JOIN condition in the query.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. Verify that the product IDs in the \"ps\\_product\" table match the \"id\\_product\" column in the \"ps\\_image\" table. If there is a mismatch, the JOIN condition will not return any records, resulting in NULL values.\n2. Make sure that the images are correctly associated with their products in the \"ps\\_image\" table. In Prestashop, the main image of a product should have the \"cover\" column set to 1, other images should have it set to 0.\n3. Check if the table names, column names and the database name in your query are correct, if any of them is misspelled or wrong, the query will not work as expected.\n4. Try using a LEFT JOIN instead of an INNER JOIN, as a LEFT JOIN will return all records from the left table and any matching records from the right table, even if there are no matches.\n5. Try to debug by running a simple select query for one product\\_id, if it returns the image for that product, then you can add a where clause to the main query to filter out products that don't have images.\n6. If all of the above did not work, you may want to check if there are any issues with the database itself (e.g. connectivity issues, missing tables, etc.).\n\nIf you're still having trouble, please provide me with more information about your specific database and table structure and I'll be happy to help you further.",
