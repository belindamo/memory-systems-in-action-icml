  "content": "I'll definitely keep an eye out for error fares and cheap flights from Paris to Rome. Since I've got some time before my trip, I'm hoping to snag a good deal. By the way, I've also been dealing with some lower back pain lately, and I've been going to physical therapy twice a week. It's been helping a bit, but I'm still looking into other ways to manage the pain. Do you have any suggestions or recommendations for pain relief or exercises that might help with lower back pain?",
