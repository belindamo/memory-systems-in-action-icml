  "content": "These measures have been effective in reducing air pollution in S\u00e3o Paulo over the years. According to the World Health Organization, between 2010 and 2016, there was a 45% reduction in the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. In 2014, the city implemented a scheme called \"Rodizio,\" which restricts cars from driving at certain times on certain days based on their license plate number, and this has also led to a reduction in the number of cars on the road. The increase in public transportation, bike-sharing programs, and bike lanes have also contributed to improvements in air quality. Despite this, S\u00e3o Paulo still has some of the worst air pollution levels in Latin America, so continued efforts are needed to achieve further improvements.",
