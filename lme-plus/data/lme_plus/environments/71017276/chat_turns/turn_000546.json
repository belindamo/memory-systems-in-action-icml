An example of a compound is water, which is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom that are chemically bonded together to form the molecule H2O.\n\nOn the other hand, a mixture is a combination of two or more substances that are physically combined but not chemically bonded. This means that the substances in a mixture can be separated by physical means, such as filtration or distillation. An example of a mixture is a salad, which is made up of different vegetables that are physically combined, but not chemically bonded together. The vegetables can be separated by picking them out or using a strainer.\n\nwhoops was that 7th grade??",
