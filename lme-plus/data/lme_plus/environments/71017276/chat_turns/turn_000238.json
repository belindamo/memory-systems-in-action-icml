Checking fares several times a day or week can help you catch a good deal before it's gone.\n\n2. Use fare alert tools - Airlines and third-party sites offer fare alert tools that notify you by email or text message when fares change on a particular route. You can also set up alerts on price comparison websites like Google Flights or Skyscanner.\n\n3. Book at the right time - Booking flights during off-peak periods - like mid-week or early morning flights - can save you money, as well as booking well in advance for peak seasons.\n\n4. Book directly with airlines - Airline websites often offer exclusive deals or email promos. Additionally, they offer reward systems and always guarantee safe and secure booking.\n\n5. Consider surrounding airports - If you're flexible with your travel plans, consider flying into or out of an airport near your destination. Sometimes fares from nearby airports are cheaper than from the primary airport.\n\n6. Bundles and packages - Often, booking a flight and hotel together on third-party websites can save you money as part of package deals. Just make sure to compare prices to confirm you are getting the best deal.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help lower the cost of your air travel and make the most of your budget when planning your next trip.",
