  "content": "I didn't have too much trouble with the sourdough starter, it was more the waiting time that was challenging. I had to plan ahead and be patient, but it was worth it in the end. I've actually been experimenting with different recipes and flavor combinations, like adding nuts or herbs to the dough. And I've been thinking about trying out a sourdough rye recipe next. Do you have any tips or recommendations for making a good sourdough rye?",
