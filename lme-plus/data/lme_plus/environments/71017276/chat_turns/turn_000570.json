  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on cleaning and maintaining my antique furniture. I recently acquired a beautiful vintage armchair from the 1950s and I want to make sure I'm taking good care of it. By the way, I also got a stunning crystal chandelier from my aunt today, which used to belong to my great-grandmother - it's got intricate etchings and sparkling droplets that catch the light. Do you have any general tips on how to dust and polish these types of pieces?",
