  "content": "Yes, there are specific times of the year when airlines offer the best deals. Some of the best times to find great deals include:\n\n1. During low-season periods - Airlines offer discounted fares during low-demand months. For example, travel to Europe is often less expensive in the winter months like January and February, as opposed to summer months like July and August. 2. Holidays - During non-peak travel periods such as on major holidays or celebrations like Christmas, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, airlines offer discounted fares. 3. Early booking - Booking early, for the upcoming holiday seasons, is smart not only because you get the best prices but also allow more options. 4. Around major sporting events - Airlines often offer discounts when there's a big sporting event happening in a particular city because they want to fill their planes. 5. Last-minute deals - Occasionally, airlines offer last-minute deals for unsold seats, especially during off-peak travel periods. 6. Flash sales and promo codes - Airlines run flash sales to create buzz and generate leads. However, make sure to verify that these offers' terms are affordable and can be utilized. Note that the offers and promotions may be specific to location and date, so your best chance of finding the best deals is to keep track of these promotions and check different airlines frequently.",
