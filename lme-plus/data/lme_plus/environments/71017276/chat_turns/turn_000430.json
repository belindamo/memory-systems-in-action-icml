  "content": "Yes, Wilt Chamberlain's dedication to practicing free throws, among other skills, was an essential factor in his ability to score so many points. Chamberlain was a notoriously poor free throw shooter early in his career, which made him a liability in close games. However, he realized that improving his free throw shooting was essential to becoming a complete player, and he began to dedicate hours each day to practicing his technique. Eventually, Chamberlain became a much better free throw shooter, and this helped him to score more efficiently and effectively. In fact, during his 100-point game, he made an impressive 28 out of 32 free throws, which helped him to achieve this remarkable feat.",
