  "content": "If your outreach has been inconsistent, it may be difficult to determine whether or not Jess is interested in rebuilding the friendship. It's possible that her cold or distant behavior is a result of feeling unsure about where things stand between you two, or feeling frustrated by the inconsistency in your communication.\n\nIn this case, it may be helpful to try and establish more consistent communication with Jess, even if it's just small interactions or checking in with her every now and then. You can try to start small by sending her a message or inviting her to do something together, and then build from there.\n\nIt's also important to be open and honest with Jess about your intentions and feelings towards the friendship, and to try and understand her perspective as well. By having a clear and open dialogue, you may be able to determine whether or not she is interested in rebuilding the friendship, and if so, what steps you can take together to make that happen.",
