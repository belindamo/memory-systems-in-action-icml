Let's break it down and prioritize the most essential steps to help you process your anger and anxiety.\n\n**Top 3 Priorities:**\n\n1. **Establish a Safe Space and Self-Care Routine:**\n\t* Focus on creating a comfortable and calming environment that helps you feel safe and relaxed. This can be a physical space, like your home, or a mental space, like a mindfulness practice.\n\t* Develop a daily self-care routine that includes activities that bring you comfort and relaxation, such as:\n\t\t+ Journaling or writing\n\t\t+ Meditation or deep breathing exercises\n\t\t+ Gentle stretching or yoga\n\t\t+ Reading or listening to calming music\n\t\t+ Taking a warm bath or shower\n2. **Process Your Emotions with a Trusted Therapist or Support System:**\n\t* Continue working with your therapist to process your emotions, especially your anger and anxiety related to your ex-partner.\n\t* If you don't have a therapist, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or support group for emotional support.\n\t* Share your feelings, thoughts, and experiences with them, and allow yourself to be heard and validated.\n3. **Learn to Recognize and Manage Triggers:**\n\t* Identify the situations, people, or stimuli that trigger your anger and anxiety.\n\t* Develop strategies to manage these triggers, such as:\n\t\t+ Grounding techniques (e.g., focusing on your five senses)\n\t\t+ Deep breathing exercises\n\t\t+ Positive self-talk or affirmations\n\t\t+ Taking a break or stepping away from the situation\n\n**Additional Recommendations:**\n\n* Start with small, manageable steps. Focus on one or two areas at a time, and gradually build upon them.\n* Prioritize consistency over perfection. Aim to practice your self-care routine and emotional regulation strategies regularly, even if it's just for a few minutes a day.\n* Be patient with yourself. Healing and growth take time, and it's okay to experience setbacks or difficulties along the way.\n\n**Resources to Focus on First:**\n\n* The National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) or the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) for support and resources on emotional abuse and trauma.\n* \"The Body Keeps the Score\" by Bessel van der Kolk or \"Radical Acceptance\" by Tara Brach for a deeper understanding of trauma and emotional regulation.\n* Calm or Insight Timer apps for guided meditation and relaxation techniques.\n\nRemember, these priorities and resources are tailored to help you establish a foundation for emotional regulation and anger management. As you progress, you can explore more resources and strategies to continue your growth.\n\nHow do these priorities and recommendations resonate with you? Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on or any questions you have about getting started?",
