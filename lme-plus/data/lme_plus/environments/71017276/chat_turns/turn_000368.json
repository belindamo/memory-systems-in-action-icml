  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on home inspections. I recently made an offer on a house and it's been accepted, pending the inspection and financing. Can you tell me what to expect during the inspection process? By the way, the first house I looked at a few weeks ago had an asking price of $299,000, and I was wondering if that's a good price for the area.",
