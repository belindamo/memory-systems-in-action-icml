Could you please tell me which state you're planning to hike in?\n\nAdditionally, it would be helpful to know what you consider \"easy\" in terms of trail difficulty. Are you looking for trails that are:\n\n* Short and flat?\n* Well-maintained with minimal obstacles?\n* Suitable for beginners or families with small children?\n* Accessible for people with mobility issues?\n\nLet me know, and I'll do my best to suggest some easy trails in your state that fit your criteria!",
