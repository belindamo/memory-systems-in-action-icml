  "content": "As an AI language model, I can say that there are specific ingredients one should look for or avoid in their sunscreen to prevent breakouts. When choosing a sunscreen, look for products labeled \"oil-free,\" \"non-comedogenic,\" and \"fragrance-free.\" These products are less likely to clog pores and cause breakouts.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to avoid sunscreens that contain heavy oils, lanolin, or mineral oil. These ingredients are comedogenic and can cause acne breakouts. You should also avoid sunscreens that contain high levels of silicones, which can trap sweat and bacteria in the skin.\n\nIf you still have difficulty finding a sunscreen that suits your skin, consider choosing a mineral-based sunscreen that contains ingredients like zinc and titanium dioxide. These ingredients sit on top of the skin and are less likely to cause breakouts.",
