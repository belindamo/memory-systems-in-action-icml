  "content": "Yes, it is true that airlines offer secret deals to certain customers. These deals are often referred to as \"opaque fares,\" \"secret fares,\" or \"members-only fares.\" The main goal behind these deals is to sell unsold seats or fill planes during low demand periods.\n\nOpaque fares are generally offered through third-party websites that specialize in selling airline tickets. When travelers book these fares, they may not know which airline they are flying until the ticket is purchased. However, they may be given some general information such as departure time, arrival time, and the airport they fly from.\n\nThe catch with these deals is that they're usually non-refundable and non-changeable, leading to uncertainty among some travelers. However, they offer significant discounts to travelers compared to regular fares. The airlines offering these fares keep their identities hidden so that they don't dilute their brand recognition or cannibalize their direct bookings.\n\nTravelers may find opaque fare offerings on websites such as Priceline, Hotwire, or Kayak, among others. It is essential to note that these fares have a few restrictions, so conducting thorough research, making comparisons and reading the fine print is crucial before booking to avoid potential issues.",
