      "content": "The amount of time it takes to determine if someone is not interested in rebuilding a friendship can vary depending on the individuals and circumstances involved. However, as a general rule of thumb, if you have consistently made efforts to communicate with Jess and rebuild the friendship for several months and have not seen any progress or positive changes, it may be an indication that she is not interested in rebuilding the friendship at this time. Again, this is just a general guideline, and the length of time may be shorter or longer depending on the situation."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "If your outreach has been inconsistent, it may be difficult to determine whether or not Jess is interested in rebuilding the friendship. It's possible that her cold or distant behavior is a result of feeling unsure about where things stand between you two, or feeling frustrated by the inconsistency in your communication.\n\nIn this case, it may be helpful to try and establish more consistent communication with Jess, even if it's just small interactions or checking in with her every now and then. You can try to start small by sending her a message or inviting her to do something together, and then build from there.\n\nIt's also important to be open and honest with Jess about your intentions and feelings towards the friendship, and to try and understand her perspective as well. By having a clear and open dialogue, you may be able to determine whether or not she is interested in rebuilding the friendship, and if so, what steps you can take together to make that happen."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Here are some practical steps you can take to move forward and manage your feelings in this situation:\n\n1. Focus on your own self-care: Make sure you're taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental health. This can include things like getting enough sleep, exercise, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n2. Seek support from other friends: Reach out to other friends in your circle who you feel comfortable talking to and spending time with. You don't have to go through this alone.\n3. Set boundaries: If seeing Jess or interacting with her in certain situations is causing you emotional distress, it's okay to set boundaries for yourself. This might mean avoiding certain social events or not engaging in conversations with her that feel uncomfortable.\n4. Practice mindfulness: When you start to feel upset or anxious about the situation, try practicing mindfulness techniques like deep breathing or meditation to help calm your mind and regulate your emotions.\n5. Consider therapy: If you're really struggling to manage your emotions and move forward, consider seeking support from a therapist who can help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies."
