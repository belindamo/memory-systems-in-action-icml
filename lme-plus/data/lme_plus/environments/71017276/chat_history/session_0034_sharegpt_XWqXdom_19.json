However, there are several quotes from reviews that do not indicate a specific gender and could be seen as gender-neutral. For example, \"Daughter loved it and it fit her great!\" and \"Fits as expected. My daughter is an average sized 7 year old and this size 7 fits as I would hope. It is comfy and warm.\" These quotes use neutral language and do not specify a gender, making them gender-neutral."

The product is marketed as \"Hopeac Girls Color Block Hoodies,\" which suggests that it's intended for girls. However, some of the reviews do not specifically refer to the gender of the person wearing the hoodie, which could indicate a gender-neutral perspective. Without more specific information or context, it's difficult to definitively say whether the product and its reviews are gender-neutral or not."
