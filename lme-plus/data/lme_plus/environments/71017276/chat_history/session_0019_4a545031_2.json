Fall is a great time to visit, the weather is mild, and the crowds are smaller than in the peak summer months.\n\nGiven your flexibility with travel dates, I'll provide you with some general insights and tips to find affordable flights to Paris and Rome.\n\n**Flight Options:**\n\n1. **Budget Airlines:** You can consider budget airlines like Norwegian, Level, or WOW Air, which often offer cheaper fares.

This can sometimes be cheaper than booking a round-trip ticket.\n2. **Multi-city flights:** Look for flights that allow you to visit both Paris and Rome on a single ticket. This might be more convenient than booking separate flights.\n\n**Fall Travel Dates:**\n\n1. **September:** Prices tend to be lower in early September, as it's considered the shoulder season. You can find deals around $600-$900 for a round-trip ticket.\n2. **October:** As the peak tourist season ends, prices might drop. Look for fares around $700-$1,100.\n3. **November:** If you're flexible, consider traveling in November, when prices can be even lower (around $500-$900).\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Be flexible with your travel dates:** Prices can vary greatly depending on the day of the week and time of year.\n2. **Book in advance:** The earlier you book, the better your chances of getting a good deal.\n3. **Use flight comparison tools:** Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak can help you compare prices across airlines and find the best deals.\n4. **Consider alternative airports:** If you have multiple airport options, check prices for each airport to find the cheapest flights.\n\n**Sample Flights:**\n\nHere are some sample flights to give you an idea of what's available:\n\n* Norwegian: New York (JFK) to Paris (ORY) in September, starting at around $440\n* Level: Los Angeles (LAX) to Rome (FCO) in October, starting at around $520\n* American Airlines: Chicago (ORD) to Paris (CDG) in November, starting at around $650\n\nKeep in mind that these are just examples, and prices can vary depending on your specific travel dates and departure city.\n\nI hope this information helps you get started on finding affordable flights to Paris and Rome!"

Focus on exercises that strengthen your core, improve flexibility, and enhance posture.\n2. **Heat or Cold Therapy:** Applying heat or cold packs to the affected area can help reduce pain and inflammation.
