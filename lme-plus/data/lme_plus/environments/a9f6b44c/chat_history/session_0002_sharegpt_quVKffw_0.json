      "content": "In the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, deterritorialization refers to the process by which established systems, structures, and meanings are disrupted and transformed. It is a key concept in their theory of desire and the nature of social and cultural systems.\n\nAccording to Deleuze and Guattari, social and cultural systems are shaped by power relations and hierarchies, and they are characterized by territorialization, or the way that certain meanings and values are attached to specific places and identities. Deterritorialization, then, involves the disruption of these territorialized systems, allowing for the creation of new meanings and connections.\n\nDeleuze and Guattari argue that deterritorialization is a necessary aspect of social and cultural change, as it allows for the creation of new forms of organization and the breaking down of oppressive power structures. It can take many forms, including the movement of people and ideas across borders, the challenging of traditional beliefs and values, and the creation of new forms of art and culture.\n\nOverall, deterritorialization is seen as a key aspect of the process of becoming, or the creation of new identities and ways of being in the world."

      "content": "ok that's ace. Finally, how do both these concepts relate to their idea of 'minor literatures'?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, the concept of minor literature is closely related to the idea of deterritorialization. A minor literature is a literature produced by a minority group that resists the dominant culture and its dominant language.\n\nAccording to Deleuze and Guattari, minor literature is characterized by its resistance to reterritorialization, or the attempt to reassert the dominance of the dominant culture. Minor literature is a form of deterritorialization, as it disrupts the dominant language and its associated meanings and values, and creates new connections and meanings.\n\nFor Deleuze and Guattari, minor literature is a key site of political and social resistance, as it allows minority groups to assert their own identities and to challenge the dominant culture. Minor literature can take many forms, including literature written in a minority language, literature produced by marginalized groups, and literature that challenges traditional literary forms and conventions.\n\nOverall, the concept of minor literature is closely tied to the idea of deterritorialization and the process of becoming, as it involves the creation of new identities and ways of being in the world that challenge the dominant culture and its power structures."

      "content": "is minor literature an absolute or relative deterritorialization in that case?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, minor literature is a form of deterritorialization that is relative to the dominant culture and its language. Deterritorialization is the process by which established systems, structures, and meanings are disrupted and transformed, and minor literature is a form of deterritorialization that challenges the dominant culture and its language.\n\nMinor literature is relative to the dominant culture in the sense that it challenges and resists the dominant culture and its language, rather than attempting to assimilate to it or align with it. It is a form of resistance to the dominant culture and its power structures, and it creates new meanings and connections that are alternative to those of the dominant culture.\n\nHowever, minor literature is also an absolute form of deterritorialization in the sense that it creates new connections and meanings that are not simply a reaction to the dominant culture, but rather a distinct and alternative way of being in the world. Minor literature represents a break with the dominant culture and its language, and it allows for the creation of new identities and ways of being that are not beholden to the dominant culture.\n\nOverall, minor literature is a form of relative deterritorialization that challenges and resists the dominant culture, while also creating new and distinct connections and meanings that are alternative to those of the dominant culture."

      "content": "ok thank you. Finally finally, can you explain to me a bit about the difference between absolute and relative deterritorialization?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, absolute deterritorialization refers to the complete disruption and transformation of established systems, structures, and meanings. It is a complete break with the past and the creation of something new and distinct.\n\nOn the other hand, relative deterritorialization refers to the disruption and transformation of established systems, structures, and meanings, but in a way that is relative to those systems and meanings. Relative deterritorialization is a challenge to and resistance of the dominant culture and its power structures, but it does not necessarily involve a complete break with the past.\n\nFor Deleuze and Guattari, absolute deterritorialization is seen as a key aspect of the process of becoming, or the creation of new identities and ways of being in the world. It is a necessary aspect of social and cultural change, as it allows for the creation of new forms of organization and the breaking down of oppressive power structures.\n\nOn the other hand, relative deterritorialization is seen as a form of resistance to the dominant culture and its power structures, and it is a way for minority groups to assert their own identities and to challenge the dominant culture.\n\nOverall, the difference between absolute and relative deterritorialization lies in the extent to which established systems, structures, and meanings are disrupted and transformed. Absolute deterritorialization involves a complete break with the past, while relative deterritorialization involves a challenge to and resistance of the dominant culture and its power structures."

      "content": "ok sorry, this is too interesting - i've got one more question, that's only semi related. I've heard that Gilbert Simondon was an influence on Giles Deleuze, and all this stuff about 'becoming' certainly sounds related, but could you tell me a little about how specifically Simondon influenced Deleuze's thought?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Gilles Deleuze was heavily influenced by the work of Gilbert Simondon, a French philosopher who is best known for his theories on individuation and the nature of technical objects. Simondon's philosophy had a significant impact on Deleuze's thought, particularly in terms of Deleuze's ideas on becoming and the process of individuation.\n\nSimondon's theory of individuation emphasizes the role of the milieu, or the environment, in shaping the development and identity of individuals and technical objects. Simondon argued that individuation is a process of continuous becoming, rather than a fixed state, and that it involves the interaction between the individual and its environment.\n\nDeleuze was heavily influenced by Simondon's ideas on individuation and becoming, and he incorporated these ideas into his own philosophy of desire and the nature of social and cultural systems. For Deleuze, becoming is a key aspect of the process of individuation, and it involves the continuous creation of new identities and ways of being in the world.\n\nIn addition to his influence on Deleuze's ideas on becoming and individuation, Simondon also had a significant influence on Deleuze's thinking about the nature of technical objects and their relationship to society. Deleuze drew on Simondon's ideas in his own work on the role of technology in shaping social and cultural systems.\n\nOverall, Simondon's philosophy had a significant influence on Deleuze's thought, particularly in terms of his ideas on becoming, individuation, and the nature of technical objects."

      "content": "ok that's great thank you. The other interesting correspondence i've noticed is between Deleuze and Guattari's notion of territory, and Anna Tsing's nonscalability theory. Does she cite them or engage in their work?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Anna Tsing's concept of nonscalability is indeed related to the concept of territory in the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari. Tsing's work on nonscalability is an attempt to challenge the dominant scalar framework that underlies much of social and cultural analysis, and she argues that this framework is inadequate for understanding the complexity and diversity of the world.\n\nTsing's concept of nonscalability is based on the idea that certain systems, processes, and phenomena are not scalable, or cannot be reduced to a single scale or level of analysis. These nonscalable systems are characterized by their inherent complexity and diversity, and they resist attempts to impose a single scalar framework on them.\n\nIn Tsing's work, nonscalability is closely related to the concept of territory in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. Territory, in Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, refers to the way that certain meanings and values are attached to specific places and identities, and it is a key aspect of social and cultural systems. Tsing's concept of nonscalability challenges the scalar framework that underlies the concept of territory, and it highlights the complexity and diversity of the systems and processes that shape social and cultural systems.\n\nTsing does not explicitly cite Deleuze and Guattari in her work on nonscalability, but her concept of nonscalability is closely related to their concept of territory and the scalar framework that underlies it. Tsing's work on nonscalability can be seen as an extension and critique of Deleuze and Guattari's ideas on territory and the nature of social and cultural systems."
