  "content": "I remember that I got my Toyota Camry serviced at the Toyota dealership on January 10th, 2023, and they replaced the air filter, changed the oil, and rotated the tires. The total cost of the service was $250. I also filled up gas on January 18th, 2023, at the Shell gas station near my office, and I spent $35.50 on 15 gallons of gas. Can you help me calculate my Toyota Camry's expenses for January 2023?",
