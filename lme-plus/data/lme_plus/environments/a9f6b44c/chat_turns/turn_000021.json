  "content": "In the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, absolute deterritorialization refers to the complete disruption and transformation of established systems, structures, and meanings. It is a complete break with the past and the creation of something new and distinct.\n\nOn the other hand, relative deterritorialization refers to the disruption and transformation of established systems, structures, and meanings, but in a way that is relative to those systems and meanings. Relative deterritorialization is a challenge to and resistance of the dominant culture and its power structures, but it does not necessarily involve a complete break with the past.\n\nFor Deleuze and Guattari, absolute deterritorialization is seen as a key aspect of the process of becoming, or the creation of new identities and ways of being in the world. It is a necessary aspect of social and cultural change, as it allows for the creation of new forms of organization and the breaking down of oppressive power structures.\n\nOn the other hand, relative deterritorialization is seen as a form of resistance to the dominant culture and its power structures, and it is a way for minority groups to assert their own identities and to challenge the dominant culture.\n\nOverall, the difference between absolute and relative deterritorialization lies in the extent to which established systems, structures, and meanings are disrupted and transformed. Absolute deterritorialization involves a complete break with the past, while relative deterritorialization involves a challenge to and resistance of the dominant culture and its power structures.",
