  "content": "I think I'll go with the pico de gallo salsa and top my tacos with some pickled onions, cilantro, and queso fresco. I like the idea of adding some crunch and freshness to my tacos. I might also add some sliced radishes on top for extra texture and flavor.\n\nBy the way, I attempted to make homemade tortillas for the first time the week before that, and it was a disaster. The dough was too sticky, and I ended up with uneven, fragile tortillas that fell apart as soon as I tried to fold them. But I learned from my mistakes and tried again a few days later, adding a bit more flour and letting the dough rest for longer. The result was much better, and I used those tortillas to make delicious chicken fajitas with saut\u00e9ed onions and bell peppers.\n\nDo you have any tips for making homemade tortillas? I'd love to hear your advice on how to get them just right.",
