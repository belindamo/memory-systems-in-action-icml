  "content": "Your filling is shaping up to be a flavor bomb! With the saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic, grilled mushrooms, and creamy Oaxaca cheese, you've got a solid foundation. The dried oregano and lime juice will add a nice depth and brightness to the filling.\n\nFor salsa and toppings, you've got a lot of options to choose from. Here are some recommendations that would complement your filling nicely:\n\n**Salsa:**\n\n1. **Pico de Gallo**: A classic Mexican salsa made with diced tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, and lime juice. Its bright, fresh flavor will cut through the richness of the cheese and mushrooms.\n2. **Salsa Roja**: A smoky, slightly sweet salsa made with roasted tomatoes, onions, garlic, and chipotle peppers. This will add a deep, complex flavor to your tacos.\n3. **Salsa Verde**: A tangy, herby salsa made with tomatillos, onions, garlic, and cilantro. This will add a nice balance of acidity and freshness to your tacos.\n\n**Toppings:**\n\n1. **Pickled Onions**: Thinly slice some red onions and soak them in a mixture of lime juice, vinegar, and spices. These will add a nice crunch and a burst of flavor to your tacos.\n2. **Cilantro**: Chopped cilantro is a classic taco topping, and for good reason. It adds a fresh, herbal flavor that pairs well with the earthy mushrooms and creamy cheese.\n3. **Radishes**: Thinly slice some radishes and use them as a crunchy, spicy topping. They'll add a nice textural element to your tacos.\n4. **Avocado or Sour Cream**: Add some creaminess to your tacos with sliced avocado or a dollop of sour cream. These will help balance out the flavors and textures.\n5. **Queso Fresco**: Crumbling some queso fresco on top of your tacos will add a salty, tangy flavor and a nice texture.\n\nFeel free to get creative with your salsa and topping choices! You can't go wrong with a classic combination like pico de gallo, cilantro, and queso fresco, but don't be afraid to experiment and find your own favorite combinations.\n\nHow do you think you'll top your tacos? Do you have any other questions about salsa or topping options?",
