They have a stronger lineup of original sci-fi and fantasy shows, and their documentaries tend to focus on more in-depth, thought-provoking topics. Westworld and His Dark Materials are both highly acclaimed and might scratch that sci-fi/fantasy itch. Additionally, HBO's original content is often more cinematic in quality, which might appeal to your love of Marvel movies on Disney+.\n\nThat being said, Hulu has some great shows as well, and if you're interested in more anthology-style series or supernatural dramas, they might be worth checking out. The Handmaid's Tale is a critically-acclaimed show that explores themes of oppression and resistance, which might appeal to fans of Stranger Things.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to your personal preferences and what type of content you're in the mood for. If you're looking for more high-concept, cinematic sci-fi and fantasy, HBO might be the way to go. If you're open to exploring more anthology-style series and supernatural dramas, Hulu could be a good choice.",
