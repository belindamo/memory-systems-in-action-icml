I'm not aware of your location, so I can't provide you with a accurate weather forecast.\n\nBut I can suggest some ways for you to get the weather forecast for your area. You can:\n\n1. Check online weather websites such as weather.com, accuweather.com, or wunderground.com.\n2. Use a weather app on your smartphone, such as Dark Sky or Weather Underground.\n3. Tune into local news or radio stations for weather updates.\n\nAs for your road bike, it's great to hear that it's running smoothly after the service! Pedal Power must have done a great job.\n\nRemember to stay safe and enjoy your ride this weekend, regardless of the weather!",
