It's great that you're aware of your tendency to get discouraged when you miss a day or two, and that you're proactively thinking about how to overcome it.\n\nYour plan to make exercise a habit by incorporating it into your daily routine is a great strategy. Scheduling your morning walks and jogs at the same time every day can help make it a automatic habit, and reduce the likelihood of skipping it. And reminding yourself that it's okay to miss a day or two and that it's not a failure is a great way to reframe your thinking and reduce guilt.\n\nMixing up your routine to avoid boredom and prevent plateaus is also a great idea. Varying your route, incorporating different types of exercise, or trying new activities can help keep things fresh and exciting. This can also help prevent overuse injuries and keep your body challenged in different ways.\n\nIt's also important to remember that progress is not always linear. There will be ups and downs, and it's normal to have off days. The key is to focus on the bigger picture and celebrate your small wins along the way.\n\nHere are a few additional tips that might help:\n\n* **Celebrate milestones**: Celebrate your small wins, like completing a certain number of days or reaching a new personal best. This can help motivate you to keep going.\n* **Find an accountability partner**: Having someone to hold you accountable and share the experience with can make it more enjoyable and help you stay motivated.\n* **Reward yourself**: Consider rewarding yourself for reaching certain milestones or completing a certain number of workouts. This could be something small like a new workout outfit or a post-workout smoothie.\n* **Focus on how you feel**: Instead of focusing solely on the scale or measurements, focus on how exercise makes you feel. Remember that exercise has many benefits beyond just physical appearance, such as improved mood, energy levels, and overall health.\n\nYou got this! You're taking a great approach to making exercise a sustainable habit, and with time and consistency, you'll start to see the results you're looking for.",
