  "content": "Anna Tsing's concept of nonscalability is indeed related to the concept of territory in the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari. Tsing's work on nonscalability is an attempt to challenge the dominant scalar framework that underlies much of social and cultural analysis, and she argues that this framework is inadequate for understanding the complexity and diversity of the world.\n\nTsing's concept of nonscalability is based on the idea that certain systems, processes, and phenomena are not scalable, or cannot be reduced to a single scale or level of analysis. These nonscalable systems are characterized by their inherent complexity and diversity, and they resist attempts to impose a single scalar framework on them.\n\nIn Tsing's work, nonscalability is closely related to the concept of territory in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. Territory, in Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, refers to the way that certain meanings and values are attached to specific places and identities, and it is a key aspect of social and cultural systems. Tsing's concept of nonscalability challenges the scalar framework that underlies the concept of territory, and it highlights the complexity and diversity of the systems and processes that shape social and cultural systems.\n\nTsing does not explicitly cite Deleuze and Guattari in her work on nonscalability, but her concept of nonscalability is closely related to their concept of territory and the scalar framework that underlies it. Tsing's work on nonscalability can be seen as an extension and critique of Deleuze and Guattari's ideas on territory and the nature of social and cultural systems.",
