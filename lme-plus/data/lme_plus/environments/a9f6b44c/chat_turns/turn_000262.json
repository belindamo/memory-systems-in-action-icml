(e.g. modern, vintage, minimalist, rustic)\n* What are your interests or hobbies? (e.g. travel, art, nature, history)\n* Do you prefer books with a lot of images or those with more text?\n* Is there a specific size or shape you're looking for in a coffee table book?\n\nLet me know, and I can provide some personalized recommendations!",
