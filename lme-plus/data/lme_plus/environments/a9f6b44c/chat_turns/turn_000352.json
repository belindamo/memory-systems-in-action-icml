  "content": "A fruit salad is a perfect way to end a meal, and it's so easy to prepare!\n\nFor a refreshing drink, I have a few suggestions that would pair perfectly with your menu:\n\n1. **Iced Tea with Fresh Mint**: Brew a pot of tea, then sweeten it with a bit of honey or sugar. Add fresh mint leaves to the pitcher and refrigerate until chilled. Serve over ice with a sprig of mint for garnish.\n2. **Lemon-Ginger Sparkler**: Mix lemon-lime soda with freshly squeezed lemon juice, grated ginger, and a bit of honey. Serve over ice with a slice of lemon and a sprig of fresh mint.\n3. **Cucumber-Lime Refresher**: Muddle sliced cucumber and fresh mint leaves in a pitcher. Add lime juice, water, and a bit of sugar. Chill until cold, then serve over ice with a slice of cucumber and a sprig of mint.\n4. **Fresh Fruit Infused Water**: Slice up some strawberries, lemons, limes, and cucumbers, and add them to a large pitcher of water. Let it infuse in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving.\n5. **Sparkling Water with Fresh Fruit**: Add slices of lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit to a pitcher of sparkling water for a light and refreshing drink.\n\nThese drinks are all easy to make and can be adjusted to your taste.
