It's great that you're thinking ahead and wanting to ensure that you're in compliance with all the necessary laws and regulations.\n\nBy asking your lawyer to review your property deed, you'll be able to confirm that you have the necessary rights and permissions to build on the land. This is an important step, as it can help avoid potential disputes or issues down the line.\n\nSome specific questions you may want to ask your lawyer include:\n\n* What are the specific zoning regulations and building codes that apply to my property?\n* Are there any restrictions or limitations on the type of structure I can build on the property?\n* Are there any environmental or conservation regulations that I need to be aware of?\n* Do I need to obtain any special permits or approvals before commencing construction?\n* Are there any neighbors or adjacent property owners who may be affected by my construction plans?\n* Are there any potential issues with easements or rights-of-way that I need to be aware of?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll be able to get a better understanding of the regulatory landscape and ensure that you're taking the necessary steps to comply with all the relevant laws and regulations.\n\nAdditionally, you may also want to ask your lawyer about any potential risks or liabilities associated with building on your property. For example, are there any potential environmental hazards or risks that you need to be aware of? Are there any potential liabilities associated with building in a rural area, such as risks related to wildfires or flooding?\n\nBy getting a clear understanding of the regulatory requirements and potential risks, you'll be able to make informed decisions about your project and ensure that you're taking the necessary steps to protect yourself and your investment.",
