  "content": "Michael Jackson's biggest musical influence was James Brown, the \"Godfather of Soul\". Jackson idolized Brown and studied his music and dance moves extensively. Brown's emphasis on strong rhythm, funk-based grooves, and passionate vocal delivery inspired Jackson to infuse these elements into his own music.\n\nJackson also drew inspiration from other performers, such as Jackie Wilson and Diana Ross. He incorporated elements of Motown and R&B, as well as pop and rock, into his music. His unique blend of different genres, combined with his exceptional vocal range and energetic choreography, helped shape his iconic sound and made him one of the most influential artists of all time.",
