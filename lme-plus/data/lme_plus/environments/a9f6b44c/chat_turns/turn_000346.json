Monitor the system\n\nThis plan can be used for deploying any application or service that depends on other services. It's essential to have a clear deployment plan to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth transition. The plan involves rolling out changes in one data center at a time to ensure that the system remains operational while updates are made. The final step involves switching to load balanced traffic to ensure that the system can handle traffic from both data centers. It's crucial to monitor the system after deployment to ensure that everything is running smoothly and to quickly address any issues that arise.",
