Divide the players into two teams.\n2. Each team chooses a Spymaster, who will give the one-word clues.\n3. The game board consists of a grid of words, with some words belonging to each team.\n4. The Spymaster gives a one-word clue that relates to multiple words on the board.\n5. Their teammates try to identify which words on the board fit the clue.\n6. The teammates can ask for clarification or make a guess, and the Spymaster will tell them which words are correct or not.\n7. The goal is to identify all the words on the board that belong to your team before the opposing team does.\n\n**Why it's great for a big family gathering:**\n\n1. **Large player count:** Codenames supports 4-8+ players, making it perfect for big family gatherings.\n2. **Easy to learn:** The rules are simple, and players can learn the game in just a few minutes.\n3. **Fast-paced:** Games typically last around 30-45 minutes, making it a great filler game or a main event.\n4. **Encourages teamwork:** Players must work together to identify the words, promoting collaboration and communication.\n5. **Lots of laughter:** The game can be quite funny, especially when teammates misinterpret clues or make silly guesses.\n6. **Scalability:** The game can be played with teams of varying sizes, so you can adjust the team composition to fit your family gathering.\n\n**Tips for playing with a big group:**\n\n1. **Divide into smaller teams:** If you have a very large group, consider dividing into smaller teams of 3-4 players each.\n2. **Use multiple boards:** If you have multiple copies of the game, you can set up multiple boards and have multiple teams playing simultaneously.\n3. **Designate a timekeeper:** Appoint someone to keep track of the time and ensure each team gets an equal amount of time to make their guesses.\n\nOverall, Codenames is an excellent choice for a big family gathering.
