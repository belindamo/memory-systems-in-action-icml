Pruning shears: You can use pruning shears to trim the tree branches to better reach the fruit, to remove any dead branches that may hinder the growth of the tree, or to remove any diseased branches that may affect the fruit.\n\n3. Harvesting poles: Some varieties of mangoes can be harvested with the help of a long pole with a basket or sack attached to the end. This tool can be used to pull the fruit gently from the tree.\n\n4. Harvesting bags or baskets: These are used to hold the harvested fruit. They can be hung from a branch or tied to a ladder or platform for easy access.\n\n5. Gloves: Mangoes can be slippery, so it's important to have gloves to protect your hands while harvesting.\n\n6.
