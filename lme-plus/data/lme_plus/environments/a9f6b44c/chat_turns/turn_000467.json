The outer layer is a waterproof polypropylene material that protects your car from rain, snow, and UV rays, while the inner layer is a breathable mesh material that allows moisture to escape, reducing the risk of mold and mildew.\n\n**Fit:**\nThe OxGord Executive Car Cover is a universal-fit cover, which means it's designed to fit a wide range of vehicles, including sedans like your 2018 Honda Civic. However, since it's not a custom-fit cover, the fit might not be as precise as a cover specifically designed for your car's make and model. That being said, many customers have reported a good fit on their Honda Civics, so it's likely to work well for you.\n\n**Price:**\nThe OxGord Executive Car Cover is very affordable, usually priced around $30-$40, which is a great value considering its features and quality.\n\n**Pros and Cons:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Waterproof and breathable material\n* Affordable price\n* Easy to install and remove\n* Compact storage bag included\n\nCons:\n\n* Universal fit might not be as precise as a custom-fit cover\n* May not be as durable as more expensive covers\n* Some customers have reported issues with the cover's straps or elastic hems\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nIf you're on a budget and want a waterproof and breathable cover that will get the job done, the OxGord Executive Car Cover is a good choice. While it might not be the most premium or durable cover on the market, it's a great value for the price. Just be aware of the potential drawbacks, such as the universal fit and potential issues with the straps or elastic hems.\n\nIf you're willing to spend a bit more money, you might consider looking into other options that offer a custom fit and more premium materials.
