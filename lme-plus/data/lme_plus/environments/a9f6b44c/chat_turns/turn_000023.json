  "content": "Gilles Deleuze was heavily influenced by the work of Gilbert Simondon, a French philosopher who is best known for his theories on individuation and the nature of technical objects. Simondon's philosophy had a significant impact on Deleuze's thought, particularly in terms of Deleuze's ideas on becoming and the process of individuation.\n\nSimondon's theory of individuation emphasizes the role of the milieu, or the environment, in shaping the development and identity of individuals and technical objects. Simondon argued that individuation is a process of continuous becoming, rather than a fixed state, and that it involves the interaction between the individual and its environment.\n\nDeleuze was heavily influenced by Simondon's ideas on individuation and becoming, and he incorporated these ideas into his own philosophy of desire and the nature of social and cultural systems. For Deleuze, becoming is a key aspect of the process of individuation, and it involves the continuous creation of new identities and ways of being in the world.\n\nIn addition to his influence on Deleuze's ideas on becoming and individuation, Simondon also had a significant influence on Deleuze's thinking about the nature of technical objects and their relationship to society. Deleuze drew on Simondon's ideas in his own work on the role of technology in shaping social and cultural systems.\n\nOverall, Simondon's philosophy had a significant influence on Deleuze's thought, particularly in terms of his ideas on becoming, individuation, and the nature of technical objects.",
