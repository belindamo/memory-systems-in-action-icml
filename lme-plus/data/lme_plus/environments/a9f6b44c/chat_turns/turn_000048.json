Here's what we'll use:\n\n1. Your Honda Civic's fuel economy: According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the 2022 Honda Civic has an estimated fuel economy of up to 32 miles per gallon (mpg) in the city, 42 mpg on the highway, and a combined rating of 36 mpg. Let's assume your car's fuel economy is around 36 mpg.\n2. Gas prices in January 2023: According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average gas price in the United States in January 2023 was around $3.10 per gallon.\n\nNow, let's do some math!\n\nSince you spent $28 on gas, we can set up an equation to estimate how many gallons of gas you bought:\n\nNumber of gallons = Total cost \u00f7 Price per gallon\nNumber of gallons = $28 \u00f7 $3.10\nNumber of gallons \u2248 9.03 gallons\n\nNow, let's use your car's fuel economy to estimate how many miles you drove on those 9.03 gallons:\n\nMiles driven = Number of gallons \u00d7 Fuel economy\nMiles driven \u2248 9.03 gallons \u00d7 36 mpg\nMiles driven \u2248 325.08 miles\n\nSince you mentioned the odometer reading wasn't 14,890 miles at the time, we can subtract the estimated miles driven from the known odometer reading to get an approximate odometer reading at the time of the fill-up:\n\nOdometer reading \u2248 14,890 miles - 325.08 miles\nOdometer reading \u2248 14,564.92 miles\n\nKeep in mind that this is an estimate, and the actual odometer reading might have been slightly higher or lower. However, this should give you a rough idea of how much gas you got for that $28.\n\nRemember, this is just an estimate, and the actual amount of gas you got might have varied depending on several factors, such as your driving habits, road conditions, and the accuracy of your car's fuel economy.",
