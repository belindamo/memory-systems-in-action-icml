  "content": "Excellent approach! Asking the right questions can give you a better understanding of their expertise and services. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Experience with Toyotas:**\n\n* A reputable oil change shop should have experience working with Toyotas, including your Corolla model.\n* They should be familiar with the recommended maintenance schedules and procedures for your vehicle.\n\n**Synthetic oil:**\n\n* If you're interested in using synthetic oil, ask if they offer it as an option.\n* Make sure they use high-quality synthetic oil that meets Toyota's specifications.\n\n**Belts and hoses inspection:**\n\n* A good oil change shop should be happy to inspect your car's belts and hoses as part of their service.\n* They should check for signs of wear, cracks, or damage, and recommend replacement if necessary.\n* Keep in mind that some shops might charge extra for this service, so be sure to ask about any additional fees.\n\nSome other questions you might want to ask:\n\n* What kind of oil filter do they use?\n* Do they use OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) or aftermarket parts?\n* Do they provide a warranty or guarantee for their work?\n* Can they show you the old oil filter and drain plug after the service?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better sense of the shop's expertise, services, and attention to detail. This will help you make an informed decision about whether to trust them with your car's maintenance.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be proactive about your car's maintenance to prevent issues down the road. Enjoy your road trip to the mountains!",
