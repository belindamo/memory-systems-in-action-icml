It's also essential to warm up before class and cool down afterwards to prevent injury.\n\nIn addition to YogaGlo, you can also try some simple hamstring stretches on your own, such as:\n\n* Standing hamstring stretch: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend forward at the hips and reach for your toes.\n* Seated hamstring stretch: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you, then lean forward and reach for your toes.\n* Lying hamstring stretch: Lie on your back with your legs straight up, then lift your legs up towards the ceiling and hold for 30 seconds.\n\nRemember to hold each stretch for 30 seconds and breathe deeply, feeling the stretch in your hamstrings.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for you to start your yoga journey with YogaGlo!",
