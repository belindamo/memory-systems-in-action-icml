  "content": "Mangoes are best stored at room temperature until they are fully ripe. Once the mangoes are ripe, they should be consumed within a few days. If you want to extend their shelf life, you can store them in the refrigerator. To store ripe mangoes in the refrigerator, place them in a plastic bag with a few holes to allow for proper ventilation. If you store underripe mangoes in the refrigerator, they will eventually ripen, but the flavor and texture may not be as good as if they were allowed to ripen naturally at room temperature. Exposing mangoes to cooler temperatures can cause damage to the fruit so it's important to take care when storing them. Remember to only store ripe mangoes in the refrigerator and consume them as soon as possible to enjoy their fresh flavor.",
