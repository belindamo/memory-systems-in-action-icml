  "content": "As an AI language model, I am not capable of providing specific product recommendations. However, a sturdy and stable ladder with non-slip feet and a locking mechanism is recommended for harvesting mangoes.

Platforms can also work well, as they offer more stability than ladders, but they may be more expensive and harder to move around. It is always best to choose a ladder or platform that meets your specific needs and ensures your safety while harvesting.",
