Here's a brief comparison:\n\n**HBO Documentaries:**\n\n* Known for in-depth, cinematic documentaries that often tackle complex, thought-provoking subjects\n* Covers a wide range of topics, including politics, science, history, and social issues\n* Often features high-profile directors and producers, such as Alex Gibney, Errol Morris, and Brett Morgen\n* Documentaries are often critically acclaimed and award-winning, with many receiving Oscar nominations\n* Some notable documentaries on HBO include:\n\t+ \"The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley\" (about the Theranos scandal)\n\t+ \"McMillions\" (about the McDonald's Monopoly game scam)\n\t+ \"I'll Be Gone in the Dark\" (about the Golden State Killer)\n\t+ \"Leaving Neverland\" (about the Michael Jackson abuse allegations)\n\t+ \"The Apollo\" (about the Apollo Theater's history and cultural significance)\n\n**Hulu Documentaries:**\n\n* Focuses more on true crime, pop culture, and social issues, with a slightly more sensationalist approach\n* Often features documentary series with a stronger focus on storytelling and entertainment value\n* Covers a range of topics, including true crime, celebrity culture, and internet trends\n* Some notable documentaries on Hulu include:\n\t+ \"The Act\" (a true crime series about Dee Dee Blanchard and Gypsy Rose)\n\t+ \"Fyre Fraud\" (about the Fyre Festival scam)\n\t+ \"The Dropout\" (about the Theranos scandal, similar to HBO's \"The Inventor\")\n\t+ \"Hillary\" (a documentary series about Hillary Clinton's life and career)\n\t+ \"The Last Dance\" (a documentary series about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls)\n\nBased on your interest in documentaries, I think HBO might be a better fit for you. Their documentaries tend to be more in-depth, thought-provoking, and critically acclaimed, which aligns with your interest in watching documentaries on Netflix. HBO's documentaries often have a more cinematic feel, which might appeal to your appreciation for the Marvel movies on Disney+.\n\nThat being said, if you're interested in true crime or pop culture-focused documentaries, Hulu might be a good choice. Their documentary series are often more binge-worthy and entertaining, which could be a great fit for your commute.\n\nUltimately, you can't go wrong with either option. Both HBO and Hulu offer a unique documentary lineup that's worth exploring.",
