Here are some recommendations to help you maintain your newly organized workspace:\n\n1. **Daily maintenance**:\n\t* Set aside 5-10 minutes at the end of each workday to tidy up your workspace. Put away items you're not using, and make sure everything is in its designated place.\n\t* Take a few seconds to wipe down your desk and keyboard with a disinfectant wipe.\n2. **Weekly maintenance**:\n\t* Schedule 15-30 minutes each week to review your workspace and make adjustments as needed.\n\t* Go through your papers and files, and either file, recycle, or take action on them.\n\t* Wipe down your desk, chair, and any other surfaces with a damp cloth.\n3. **Bi-weekly deep clean**:\n\t* Set aside 30-60 minutes every other week to deep clean your workspace.\n\t* Dust and vacuum your workspace, including any shelves, furniture, and equipment.\n\t* Clean your computer and other electronics with a soft cloth and gentle cleaning products.\n4. **Monthly review**:\n\t* Schedule a 30-minute review of your workspace to assess its organization and functionality.\n\t* Identify areas that need improvement and make adjustments to your organizing systems.\n\t* Consider implementing new habits or systems to maintain organization and productivity.\n\nAs for cleaning and dusting your workspace, aim to:\n\n* Dust your workspace every 1-2 weeks, or more often if you have allergies or notice dust accumulating quickly.\n* Clean your desk and surfaces with a gentle cleaning product every 2-4 weeks, or more often if you eat or drink at your desk.\n\nAdditional tips to maintain your organized workspace:\n\n* Implement the \"one touch rule\" for papers, as I mentioned earlier.\n* Use a \"touch once, put away\" approach for office supplies and materials.\n* Keep frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations to avoid cluttering your workspace.\n* Consider implementing a \"homeless item\" box or bin to corral items that don't have a designated home.\n* Make it a habit to put things back in their designated place after use.\n\nBy following these maintenance schedules and tips, you'll be able to enjoy a consistently organized and productive workspace. Remember, maintaining organization is an ongoing process, but with consistent effort, it becomes a habit that pays off in the long run!",
