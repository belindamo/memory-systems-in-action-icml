  "content": "The best time to harvest mangoes varies depending on the variety and maturity of the fruit, but generally, mangoes are harvested when they are fully mature and ripe. However, ripe mangoes can be difficult to store and transport, so some varieties may be harvested slightly before they are fully ripe to extend their shelf life. When determining whether a mango is ready to be harvested, pay attention to its color and texture: ripe mangoes should have a deep yellow or orange color and feel slightly soft to the touch. Additionally, the stem of the fruit should come away easily from the tree. Try to harvest your mangoes in the morning when the fruit is still cool and the weather is not too hot to prevent any damage or bruising.",
