  "content": "I'm mostly into sci-fi, fantasy, and documentaries. I prefer TV shows over movies. I've been loving Marvel movies on Disney+, and I've also been hooked on \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Morning Show\" on Netflix and Apple TV+ respectively. I don't really care about licensed content, I'm more into original stuff. And I'm open to watching both old and new shows.",
