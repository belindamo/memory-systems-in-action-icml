Obedience training is an excellent way to strengthen your bond with Max and help him become a well-behaved pup.\n\nTypically, obedience training schools require certain vaccination records to ensure the health and safety of all dogs participating in the classes. The specific vaccination requirements may vary depending on the school, location, and local regulations. However, here are the most common vaccinations required for obedience training classes:\n\n1. **Rabies:** This is usually the most critical vaccination required, as it's mandated by law in most states. Make sure Max's rabies vaccination is up-to-date.\n2. **Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus (DHPP):** This is a core vaccination that protects against common canine diseases. Ensure Max's DHPP vaccination is current.\n3. **Bordetella (also known as Kennel Cough):** This vaccination is often required, especially if the obedience school has multiple dogs in close proximity. It helps prevent the spread of kennel cough.\n4. **Parainfluenza:** Some schools may require this vaccination, which is often included in the DHPP vaccine.\n\nIt's essential to check with the obedience training school you're interested in enrolling Max in, as they may have specific vaccination requirements or recommendations. They may also require a health certificate from your veterinarian, especially if Max is a puppy or hasn't been vaccinated recently.\n\nBefore enrolling Max in obedience training, schedule a consultation with your veterinarian to ensure he's up-to-date on all necessary vaccinations and to obtain the required records. Your veterinarian can provide guidance on the vaccinations Max needs and help you prepare for the training classes.\n\nRemember to also inquire about the school's policies on vaccination records, as some may have specific formats or requirements for proof of vaccination.",
