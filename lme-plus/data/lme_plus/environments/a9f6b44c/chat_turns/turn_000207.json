  "content": "I've actually been doing really well with yoga lately. I started taking classes again three months ago, and I've been going three times a week. It's been great for my flexibility and stress levels. I've also been trying to practice at home on Sundays, focusing on restorative yoga and gentle stretches. Do you have any recommendations for yoga apps or online classes that I can follow at home?",
