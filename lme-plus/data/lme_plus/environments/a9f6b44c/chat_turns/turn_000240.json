  "content": "Giant pandas are primarily herbivores, and over 99% of their diet consists of bamboo. However, pandas have adapted to cope with bamboo shortages in their habitat in a few ways:\n\n1. Dietary flexibility: Pandas are known to consume other types of vegetation, such as fruits, berries, and grasses, when bamboo is scarce. They have also been observed eating small mammals and birds that accidentally fall into their enclosure.\n\n2. Geographic mobility: Pandas have a large home range and can move to different areas to find more bamboo. This allows them to adapt to changes in bamboo availability.\n\n3. Seasonal migration: In some areas, pandas migrate to different elevations with changing seasons to access different species and stages of bamboo growth.\n\n4. Reduced activity: When bamboo is scarce, pandas have been observed reducing their activity levels and conserving energy until bamboo becomes more available.\n\n5. Human intervention: In areas where panda habitats overlap with human populations, conservation efforts have been implemented to supplement panda diets with bamboo and to create bamboo corridors to connect fragmented habitats.",
