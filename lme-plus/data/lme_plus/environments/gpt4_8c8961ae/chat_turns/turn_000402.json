However, many experts recommend practicing mindfulness or meditation every day for at least 10 to 15 minutes to see the benefits. It is also important to be consistent and make mindfulness a daily habit. Gradually, you may try increasing your meditation time as you become more comfortable with the practice. However, it is important to remember that quality is more important than quantity. It is better to practice for 10 minutes with focus and relaxation than to struggle through a longer meditation session. Ultimately, finding the right balance is essential for building a sustainable mindfulness practice. You can start with a few minutes each day and gradually increase your meditation time within your comfort level.",
