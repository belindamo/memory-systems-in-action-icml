The innovation in kitchen gadgets and cooking appliances now provides precision control of temperature and humidity, which helps to produce food that is more consistent in quality and flavour.\n\nHowever, at the same time, some people worry that the traditional taste of Anatolian cuisine may be lost as people experiment more with using new ingredients and techniques.

In this way, many restaurants and home cooks continue to maintain the traditional methods of cooking and recipes, alongside experimentation with modernization. \n\nOverall, the impact of technology on the traditional taste of Anatolian cuisine is a subject of debate, but it is certain that the evolution of cuisine is a crucial aspect of cultural imprinting that helps us have new cultural experiences.",
