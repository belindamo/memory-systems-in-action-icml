  "content": "I think that's a fantastic idea! Focusing on a specific theme or topic for our influencer marketing campaign could help us create more targeted and relevant content that resonates with our audience. Industrial automation is a broad topic, and by zooming in on a specific area, we can create more nuanced and detailed content that showcases our expertise and thought leadership.\n\nI love the idea of creating an influencer advisory board or council! This would not only provide us with valuable feedback and insights from industry experts but also help us build stronger relationships with our influencer partners. We could use this board to bounce ideas off of, get feedback on our content and campaigns, and even co-create content and thought leadership pieces.\n\nSome potential themes or topics we could focus on for our influencer marketing campaign could be:\n\n* The role of industrial automation in Industry 4.0\n* The benefits of AI and machine learning in industrial automation\n* The impact of industrial automation on supply chain management\n* The role of industrial automation in sustainable manufacturing\n* The future of work in industrial automation\n\nThese are just a few ideas, but I'm sure there are many other topics and themes we could explore.\n\nIn terms of the influencer advisory board, we could identify 5-10 influencers who are experts in industrial automation and have a strong following in our target audience. We could then invite them to join our advisory board and participate in regular calls or meetings to discuss our influencer marketing strategy and provide feedback on our content and campaigns.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this something we could explore further?",
