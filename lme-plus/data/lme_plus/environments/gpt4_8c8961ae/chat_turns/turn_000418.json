They have a quick-service counter for grab-and-go, and their prices are very reasonable (around $3-$5 per drink). It's about a 12-minute walk from the previous train stop.\n2. **Brewed Awakening**: This specialty coffee shop is located in a cozy corner spot and offers a wide variety of coffee drinks, including cappuccinos. They use small-batch beans and have a reputation for consistency. Plus, they offer a loyalty program to reward regular customers. It's about a 10-minute walk from the previous train stop.\n3. **The Coffee Club**: This Australian-inspired coffee chain has a location in the city center, about an 11-minute walk from the previous train stop. They're known for their high-quality beans, and their cappuccinos are made with a generous dollop of frothed milk. They also offer a loyalty program and a range of food options.\n4. **The Bean Scene**: This independent coffee shop is tucked away on a side street, about a 13-minute walk from the previous train stop. They source their beans from local roasters and offer a variety of coffee drinks, including cappuccinos. They have a cozy atmosphere, but it's also a great spot for a quick grab-and-go.\n\nAll of these options should fit your criteria, but if you want to explore more, I can definitely provide additional recommendations!\n\nWhich one of these options sounds most appealing to you, or would you like more suggestions?",
