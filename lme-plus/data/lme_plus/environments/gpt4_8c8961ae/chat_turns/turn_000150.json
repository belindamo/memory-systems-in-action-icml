  "content": "1) Soft Robots: These robots can move and manipulate their environment in ways that traditional rigid robots cannot. Soft robots are made from soft and elastic materials that mimic the body movements of living organisms.\n\n2) Swarm Robotics: This technology involves the use of a large number of simple robots that work together to perform complex tasks. These robots communicate with each other to accomplish the goal.\n\n3) Humanoid Robots: These robots are anthropomorphic, meaning they resemble human beings in their appearance and movements. They are being developed to perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for human beings.\n\n4) Autonomous Robots: These robots can function without human intervention. They are equipped with sensors and software that enable them to perceive and react autonomously to their environment.\n\n5) Wearable Robots: Also known as exoskeletons, these machines are designed to augment human strength and endurance. They are being developed to assist individuals with physical disabilities or to enhance the performance of able-bodied individuals.\n\n6) Brain-Computer Interface (BCI): This technology enables direct communication between the human brain and a computer or device. It is being researched for use in controlling and interacting with robots.",
