Here are some pros and cons of each approach to help you decide:\n\n**Approach 1: Treat gift cards as a separate fund**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ You can keep track of the gift card balances separately, which can help you avoid overspending.\n\t+ You can use the gift cards as a buffer for unexpected expenses or last-minute gifts.\n* Cons:\n\t+ You might forget to include the gift cards in your overall budget, leading to overspending.\n\t+ You might not account for the gift cards when planning your gifts, which could result in duplicate purchases.\n\n**Approach 2: Subtract gift cards from the total budget**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ You'll automatically account for the gift cards when planning your gifts, reducing the likelihood of overspending.\n\t+ You can adjust your budget accordingly, ensuring you don't exceed your overall budget.\n* Cons:\n\t+ You might not have a clear picture of the gift card balances, making it harder to track.\n\t+ You might feel like you're \"losing\" the gift card value if you don't use it for the intended occasion.\n\nUltimately, the approach you choose depends on your personal preference and financial habits. If you're worried about overspending or want to keep track of the gift card balances separately, treating them as a separate fund might be the way to go. However, if you want to ensure you account for the gift cards in your overall budget, subtracting them from the total budget could be a better approach.\n\nIn your case, since you've received gift cards worth $40, you could:\n\n* Set up a separate column in your digital planner to track the gift card balances (Approach 1).\n* Subtract the $40 from your overall gift budget, and adjust your budget accordingly (Approach 2).\n\nWhich approach do you think you'll choose?",
