  "content": "Yes, you're right! Independent labels often have more flexibility when it comes to signing and developing new artists, which allows them to take creative risks and support up-and-coming talent. This can lead to a more diverse and innovative musical landscape, as independent labels are able to support music that may not fit the mainstream.\n\nIn addition, independent labels tend to offer more artist-friendly contracts and better control over creative content than major labels. They are more likely to work collaboratively with the artists they represent, giving them greater artistic freedom and control over their output.\n\nOverall, independent labels play a vital role in the music industry and continue to shape the direction of music today.",
