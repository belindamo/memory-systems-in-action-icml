  "content": "Thank you for sharing the details.\n\nLet's break down your gift-giving expenses:\n\n* **Gifts:** $400 (you've already spent this amount)\n* **Gift Cards Received:** $40 (we'll set these aside for now, as they're essentially free money)\n\nSince you've already spent $400 on gifts, we'll categorize that under **Non-Essential Expenses > Gifts**.\n\nAs for the gift cards, you can consider them as a reduction in your future gift expenses. When you use them, you won't need to spend your own money, so we can set them aside for now. If you want to track them, we can create a separate category for **Gift Cards** under **Assets** or **Savings**. This way, you can keep track of the value and use them when you need to purchase gifts in the future.\n\nNow, let's think about your gift-giving habits:\n\n* Do you tend to buy gifts for specific occasions (e.g., birthdays, holidays, weddings) or do you also buy gifts just because?\n* Are there any particular price ranges you usually stick to when buying gifts?\n* Do you prefer to buy gifts in-store or online?\n\nThis will help me understand your gift-giving patterns and provide more tailored advice on how to manage your expenses.\n\nLastly, have you considered setting a budget for gifts in the future? Would you like to aim to reduce your gift expenses or maintain the current level of spending?",
