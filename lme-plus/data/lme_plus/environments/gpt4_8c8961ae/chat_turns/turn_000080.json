Here are a few recommendations:\n\n**Wall Art:**\n\n1. **Nature-inspired prints**: A botanical print or a landscape photograph with soft, muted colors will complement the gray rug's warmth. Consider a piece with greenery, like a fern or a tree, to bring in a natural element.\n2. **Abstract art with warm tones**: A abstract piece with warm, earthy tones like beige, taupe, or golden brown will create a harmonious contrast with the gray rug. Look for a piece with soft, blended brushstrokes to maintain the cozy feel.\n3. **Black and white photography**: A black and white photograph can add a touch of sophistication to your room while still complementing the gray rug. Opt for a piece with soft, gentle lines and subtle contrast.\n\n**Vase:**\n\n1. **Earthy terracotta vase**: A terracotta vase with a natural, earthy tone will bring warmth and coziness to your room. You can add some greenery like eucalyptus or ferns to complement the gray rug.\n2. **Soft-colored glass vase**: A vase with a soft, muted color like blush pink, mauve, or dusty blue will add a touch of elegance to your room. Look for a vase with a rounded, organic shape to maintain the cozy feel.\n3. **Wooden vase**: A wooden vase with a natural finish like oak or walnut will bring warmth and texture to your room. You can add some dried flowers or branches to complement the gray rug.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider the style and tone of your furniture and decor when choosing wall art and a vase. If you have modern, minimalist furniture, a more abstract or geometric piece might work well. If you have traditional or vintage furniture, a more ornate or natural piece might be a better fit.\n* Don't be afraid to mix and match different textures, like pairing a smooth vase with a rough-textured rug or a matte-finish wall art with a glossy vase.\n* Experiment with different heights and arrangements to create a visually interesting display.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find the perfect pieces to complement your new gray rug!",
