  "content": "The Urantia Book describes Paradise as a unique and central location in the universe of universes. It is the realm of primal origin and the final goal of destiny for all spirit personalities. Paradise is not part of the universal creation, not even a real part of the eternal Havona universe. It is an eternal and exclusive existence, and the source of all energies and the place of primal origin of all personalities. It is the center of all creation and the universal headquarters of all personality activities. Paradise is also the goal of desire for all supermaterial personalities and the real and far-distant destiny of the immortal souls of the mortal and material sons of God. It is the perfect abode of the Universal Father and a place of divinity pursuit and perfection attainment for those who embark on the long, long Paradise trail.",
