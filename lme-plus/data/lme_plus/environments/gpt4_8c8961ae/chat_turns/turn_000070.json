Here's a template to get you started:\n\n**Reading Log**\n\n**Books Read**\n\n* **Title** | **Author** | **Start Date** | **Finish Date** | **Rating** | **Notes**\n* -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nYou can copy and paste this template into a note-taking app, document, or even a spreadsheet if you prefer.\n\nTo add an entry, simply fill in the information for each column. For example:\n\n* **Title**: The Nightingale\n* **Author**: Kristin Hannah\n* **Start Date**: [insert date you started reading]\n* **Finish Date**: [insert date you finished reading]\n* **Rating**: 5 stars\n* **Notes**: Emotional and powerful read. Made me cry!\n\nNow, let's go back and log some of your previous reads. You mentioned you got some books on January 5th at Barnes & Noble. Can you tell me the titles of those books? I can help you add them to your log.\n\nAlso, do you remember any other books you've read recently or in the past that you'd like to add to your log?",
