Depending on the injury and its severity, certain stretches or exercises may be contraindicated or require modifications. \n\nA healthcare professional can provide recommendations for safe and effective stretches and exercises that can help improve flexibility without aggravating the injury. They may also suggest techniques for proper warm-up and cool-down to prevent further injury. \n\nIt is important to listen to your body and not push beyond your limits or experience pain during stretches or exercises. Gradual progress may be necessary, and it is important to communicate any discomfort or concerns with your healthcare professional.",
