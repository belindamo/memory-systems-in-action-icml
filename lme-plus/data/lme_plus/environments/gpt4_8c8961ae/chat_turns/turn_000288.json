Give them a blank circle and ask them to divide it into six equal parts. Label each part with a primary or secondary color and have them color each part accordingly.\n\nYou can also introduce the concept of warm and cool colors and ask them to create a painting using only warm or cool colors. This will help them understand the emotional impact of colors and how they can be used to express different moods and feelings.\n\nOverall, this lesson plan is designed to introduce the concept of colors to young children and help them understand the basics of primary and secondary colors, mixing colors, and identifying colors in everyday objects. It is a fun and interactive way to engage children in learning and promote their creativity and imagination.",
