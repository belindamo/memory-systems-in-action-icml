Is it one of the latest flagships with Wi-Fi 6 capabilities?\n\nFor streaming videos and online content, a Wi-Fi 6 router like the Netgear Nighthawk RAX80 or the alternatives I mentioned earlier would be a great choice. Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) offers several advantages over previous Wi-Fi standards, including:\n\n1. **Faster speeds**: Wi-Fi 6 supports speeds up to 9.6 Gbps, which is significantly faster than Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac).\n2. **Improved capacity**: Wi-Fi 6 can handle a larger number of devices on a single network, making it ideal for households with many devices.\n3. **Better performance in crowded environments**: Wi-Fi 6 uses advanced technologies like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) to reduce congestion and improve performance in crowded environments.\n4. **Increased efficiency**: Wi-Fi 6 devices are designed to be more power-efficient, which can lead to longer battery life and reduced heat generation.\n\nWhen choosing a router for streaming, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Dual-band or tri-band**: A dual-band router can operate on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies, while a tri-band router has an additional 5GHz band for dedicated traffic. Tri-band routers are ideal for households with many devices.\n2. **MU-MIMO and OFDMA**: These technologies enable the router to serve multiple devices simultaneously, reducing congestion and improving overall performance.\n3. **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Look for routers with built-in QoS features that allow you to prioritize traffic for critical applications like video streaming.\n4. **Range and coverage**: If you have a larger home or many obstacles, consider a router with a strong signal or a mesh Wi-Fi system.\n\nBased on your requirements, I would recommend the Netgear Nighthawk RAX80 or the Asus RT-AX88U. Both routers are Wi-Fi 6 capable, offer excellent performance, and have features like MU-MIMO and OFDMA to handle multiple devices.\n\nDo you have any other questions or concerns about these routers or Wi-Fi 6 in general?",
