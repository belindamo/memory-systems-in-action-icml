  "content": "The section 8 of the Urantia Papers explains the concept of Paradise Gravity. It states that gravity is the all-powerful grasp of the physical presence of Paradise and that the center and focal point of absolute material gravity is the Isle of Paradise. The paper also states that the inescapable pull of gravity effectively grips all the worlds of all the universes of all space and that gravity is the omnipotent strand on which are strung the gleaming stars, blazing suns, and whirling spheres. It also explains that space is nonresponsive to gravity, but it acts as an equilibrant on gravity, and that without the space cushion, explosive action would jerk surrounding space bodies. The paper also explains that there are three general stages of response to Paradise gravity: pre-gravity stages, gravity stages, and post-gravity stages.",
