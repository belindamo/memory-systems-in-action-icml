  "content": "I think I'll store my winter coat in a garment bag and hang it up in my closet. That way, it'll be protected from dust and creases, and it'll be easy to grab when winter comes around. I'll also use some cloth to stuff the sleeves and body to maintain its shape. For my other jackets, I'll use the stackable plastic bins and follow the tips you provided to prevent wrinkles and creases. Speaking of winter, do you have any recommendations for winter skincare routines? I want to make sure my skin stays moisturized and healthy during the cold months.",
