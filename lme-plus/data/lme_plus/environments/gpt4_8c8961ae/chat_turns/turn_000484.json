Here are some popular Ibanez bass models that are well-suited for rock music:\n\n1. **Ibanez SR300**: A popular choice among rock bassists, the SR300 offers a versatile sound with a strong low-end punch. It features a mahogany neck, a basswood body, and a pair of Ibanez humbucking pickups.\n2. **Ibanez SR505**: The SR505 is a step up from the SR300, offering a more aggressive sound with a stronger midrange presence. It features a 5-piece neck, a mahogany body, and a pair of Bartolini MK1 pickups.\n3. **Ibanez BTB740**: The BTB740 is a high-end bass that offers a complex, aggressive sound with a strong low-end response. It features a 7-piece neck, a mahogany body, and a pair of Bartolini MK1 pickups.\n4. **Ibanez GIO GSR200**: The GIO GSR200 is a more affordable option that still delivers a great sound for rock music. It features a mahogany neck, a poplar body, and a pair of Ibanez humbucking pickups.\n\nWhen choosing an Ibanez bass, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Neck type**: Ibanez offers a range of neck types, including the SR, BTB, and GIO. The SR neck is known for its slim, fast feel, while the BTB neck is a bit wider and more substantial.\n* **Body wood**: Ibanez basses often feature bodies made from mahogany, basswood, or poplar. Mahogany bodies tend to produce a warmer, more aggressive sound, while basswood bodies are brighter and more articulate.\n* **Pickups**: Ibanez basses often feature humbucking pickups, which are designed to reduce hum and noise. Bartolini pickups are known for their clear, articulate sound, while Ibanez humbuckers are a bit more aggressive and punchy.\n* **Electronics**: Consider the type of electronics you need. Do you want a simple, passive setup or a more complex, active setup with EQ controls?\n\nUltimately, the best Ibanez bass for you will depend on your personal playing style, tone preferences, and budget. I recommend trying out different models before making a purchase to find the one that feels and sounds right for you.",
