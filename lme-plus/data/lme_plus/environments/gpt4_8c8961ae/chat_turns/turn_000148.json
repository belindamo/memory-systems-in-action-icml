  "content": "I understand your sense of urgency, but as an AI language model, I am not able to accurately determine which stretches would be safe and effective for your injury without knowing your medical history or conducting an examination. \n\nI encourage you to prioritize your health and safety by consulting with a healthcare professional before attempting any stretches or exercises on your own. A healthcare professional can assess your injury and recommend exercises or stretches tailored to your specific needs. \n\nIn the meantime, you can consider activities that promote relaxation and flexibility, such as yoga, Pilates or tai chi, under the guidance of a certified instructor. While these activities may not be specifically designed for your injury, they can help increase flexibility and promote overall health. Always listen to your body and avoid any movements or positions that cause pain or discomfort.",
