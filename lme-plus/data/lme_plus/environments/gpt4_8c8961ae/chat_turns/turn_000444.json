  "content": "Yes, while analyzing the ingredients is important to understand the nutrient composition of a pet food product, it is also important to conduct feeding trials in real animals to ensure that the food is nutritionally balanced and meets the needs of the target population. In fact, AAFCO (the Association of American Feed Control Officials) requires that pet food undergo feeding trials or meet certain nutrient levels established by nutrient profiles to be considered nutritionally complete and balanced. Feeding trials can provide additional information about the digestibility, palatability, and overall nutritional adequacy of the food, which cannot be determined by laboratory analysis alone. Therefore, feeding trials are a crucial step in determining the nutritional values of pet food products, and many pet food companies, including Pedigree, conduct them to ensure the quality of their products.",
