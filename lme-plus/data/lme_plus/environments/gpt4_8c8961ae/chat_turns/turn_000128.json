Consider the upcoming occasions and events you know about, and allocate a certain amount for each gift. You can also set a general budget for impulse gifts, so you don't overspend.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n* **Gift Budget for the next 3 months:**\n\t+ Occasional Gifts: $150 (avg. $50 per month)\n\t+ Impulse Gifts: $50 (avg. $17 per month)\n\nThis is just a rough estimate, but it gives you an idea of how to allocate your funds. You can adjust the amounts based on your specific needs and financial situation.\n\nRemember, having a budget doesn't mean you can't be spontaneous or thoughtful. It's about being mindful of your expenses and making conscious decisions about how you want to allocate your money.\n\nHow does this sound? Do you have any questions or would you like to adjust the budget categories?",
