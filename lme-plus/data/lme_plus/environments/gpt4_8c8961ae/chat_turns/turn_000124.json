We'll divide your spending into main categories, and then break them down into subcategories. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going.\n\nHere are some common categories to get us started:\n\n1. **Essential Expenses**\n\t* Rent/Mortgage\n\t* Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet, etc.)\n\t* Groceries\n\t* Transportation (car payment, insurance, gas, maintenance, etc.)\n\t* Minimum payments on debts (credit cards, loans, etc.)\n2. **Non-Essential Expenses**\n\t* Entertainment (dining out, movies, concerts, etc.)\n\t* Hobbies (gym membership, art supplies, etc.)\n\t* Travel\n\t* Gifts (this is where we'll track your gift-giving expenses!)\n\t* Miscellaneous (pet expenses, home decor, etc.)\n3. **Savings**\n\t* Emergency fund\n\t* Retirement savings\n\t* Other savings goals (college fund, down payment, etc.)\n4. **Debt Repayment**\n\t* Credit card debt\n\t* Student loans\n\t* Personal loans\n\t* Other debt repayment\n\nNow, let's focus on your gift-giving expenses. Can you tell me:\n\n* How much you've spent on gifts in the past month?\n* What types of gifts have you been buying (e.g., birthday presents, holiday gifts, just-because gifts)?\n* Are there any specific occasions or people you've been buying gifts for?\n\nThis will help me understand your gift-giving habits and create a more accurate subcategory for your expenses.\n\nRemember, tracking your expenses is the first step towards taking control of your finances. By categorizing your spending, you'll be able to identify areas where you can cut back and make adjustments to achieve your financial goals.",
