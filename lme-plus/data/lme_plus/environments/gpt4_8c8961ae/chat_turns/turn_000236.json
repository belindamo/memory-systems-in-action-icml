  "content": "25% water changes every 4 weeks is a good starting point, but considering you're experiencing brown algae issues, it might be beneficial to increase the frequency.\n\n**Why more frequent water changes might help:**\n\n1. **Remove excess nutrients**: More frequent water changes can help remove excess nutrients, waste products, and organic compounds that can contribute to algae growth.\n2. **Maintain better water quality**: Regular water changes help maintain stable and optimal water parameters, which can reduce the likelihood of algae blooms.\n3. **Reduce algae growth**: By removing excess nutrients and waste products more frequently, you can reduce the fuel for algae growth, making it more difficult for brown algae to establish itself.\n\n**Increasing frequency to every 2 weeks:**\n\nI recommend increasing the frequency to every 2 weeks, but you can start with a slightly more conservative approach:\n\n* Try doing 25% water changes every 3 weeks for a few cycles to see how your tank responds.\n* If you still notice algae issues, you can then move to every 2 weeks.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n1. **Monitor your tank's response**: Keep a close eye on your tank's water parameters, fish health, and algae growth after increasing the frequency of water changes. If you notice any adverse effects, you can adjust your strategy.\n2. **Don't overdo it**: While more frequent water changes can be beneficial, overdoing it can cause stress to your fish and other tank inhabitants. Be mindful of your tank's bio-load and the health of your fish.\n3. **Consider other factors**: Remember that water changes are just one part of maintaining a healthy tank. Ensure you're also providing proper nutrition, adequate hiding places, and suitable water parameters for your fish.\n\nBy increasing the frequency of water changes, you should see an improvement in your tank's water quality and a reduction in brown algae growth. Keep me updated on your progress!",
