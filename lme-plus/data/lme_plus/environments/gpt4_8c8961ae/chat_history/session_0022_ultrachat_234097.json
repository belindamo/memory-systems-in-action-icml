      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or beliefs, but I can provide information based on research studies. \n\nAccording to several studies, there is evidence of some generational differences in attitudes towards other ethnic groups in the Czech Republic. The older generation, those born before 1960, tend to have more negative attitudes towards non-Czechs, particularly Roma people, and tend to hold more prejudiced and stereotyped views about them. \n\nOn the other hand, the younger generation, those born after 1980, tend to have more positive perceptions and attitudes towards people from different ethnic backgrounds. They are more likely to express an interest in multiculturalism and diversity, and are more accepting of people from other countries or with different cultural backgrounds.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that these generational differences are not absolute, and there are exceptions among individuals of different age groups. Overall, changing attitudes and perceptions towards other ethnic groups in the Czech Republic could be influenced by various factors such as education, media exposure, and social interactions."
