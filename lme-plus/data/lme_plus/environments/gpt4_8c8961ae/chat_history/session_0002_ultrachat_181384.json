      "content": "There are several distilleries in Frankfort, Kentucky that produce different types of bourbon. Each distillery has its unique taste and production process, which distinguishes its bourbon from others. Here are some notable differences:\n\n1. Buffalo Trace Distillery: Buffalo Trace produces a range of bourbons, including the flagship Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Eagle Rare, Blanton's, and W.L. Weller. Buffalo Trace uses a combination of both rye and wheat in its mash bill, giving it a spicy and sweet flavor profile. The bourbon is aged for several years in charred oak barrels, which impart a smoky and woody flavor.\n\n2. Woodford Reserve Distillery: Woodford Reserve produces a premium bourbon that is triple distilled, giving it a smoother taste. The mash bill contains a higher amount of rye, which gives it a spicy and peppery flavor. The bourbon is aged for six to seven years in charred oak barrels, giving it a deep amber color and a woody undertone.\n\n3. Four Roses Distillery: Four Roses is known for its unique blending process, which involves mixing ten different recipes of bourbon. Each recipe has a different mash bill and yeast strain, giving it a distinct flavor profile. Four Roses uses a higher percentage of corn in its mash bill, making its bourbon sweeter than most others. The bourbon is aged for several years in charred oak barrels, giving it a rich and complex flavor.\n\n4. Wild Turkey Distillery: Wild Turkey is known for its bold and robust flavor profile. The mash bill contains a high amount of rye, which gives it a spicy and peppery taste. The bourbon is aged for six to eight years in charred oak barrels, which contribute to a smoky and woody flavor.\n\nOverall, the main differences in taste and production process across the different types of bourbons produced in Frankfort are the mash bill, aging time, and blending process."
