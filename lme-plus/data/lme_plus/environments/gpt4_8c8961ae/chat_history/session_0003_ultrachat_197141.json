Modern kitchen appliances, such as electric stoves, ovens, and blenders, have generally replaced traditional woodburning stoves and manual cooking tools. This has made the process of preparing meals faster and easier, which has freed up time and energy for other activities.\n\nIn addition, social media platforms have become an increasingly popular way for people to share recipes and cooking tips. Many people in Anatolia are now able to access recipes from all over the world and incorporate new ingredients and cooking styles into their traditional recipes. This has also led to the exploration and experimentation with new flavours, and the fusion of Anatolian cuisine with other culinary styles.\n\nHowever, even with the influence of technology, many Anatolian communities continue to value the traditional methods of preparing and sharing meals. Family recipes that have been handed down from generation to generation are still cherished and passed on, and there is still a strong belief in the importance of sitting down together to share a meal."

Also, while the traditional methods of preparing meals may be time-consuming, it is believed that they help to preserve the authentic taste of the dishes. In this way, many restaurants and home cooks continue to maintain the traditional methods of cooking and recipes, alongside experimentation with modernization. \n\nOverall, the impact of technology on the traditional taste of Anatolian cuisine is a subject of debate, but it is certain that the evolution of cuisine is a crucial aspect of cultural imprinting that helps us have new cultural experiences."
