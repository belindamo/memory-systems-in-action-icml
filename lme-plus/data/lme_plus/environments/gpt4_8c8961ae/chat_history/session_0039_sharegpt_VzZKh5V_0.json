      "content": "Sure, here are some problem and solution statements that could fit in sticky notes:\n\nProblem Statements:\n\n1. Software engineering students struggle to find a platform to showcase their work and connect with their peers and alumni.\n2. Existing platforms for software engineering students lack key features and functionalities that would make them more useful and engaging.\n3. Lecturers struggle to find talented and motivated students for their projects and research.\n4. Software engineering students often struggle to find internships and job opportunities within their field.\n5. The process of creating and maintaining a personal website or portfolio can be time-consuming and overwhelming for software engineering students.\n\nSolution Statements:\n\n1. Create a showcase/community website specifically tailored to the needs and goals of software engineering students, including features like project galleries, profiles, messaging, and resource listings.\n2. Conduct user research and feedback sessions to identify the key features and functionalities that software engineering students want and need in a platform, and incorporate these into the website design.\n3. Allow lecturers to create profiles and post about their research projects and opportunities for student involvement, and enable students to connect with them directly through the website.\n4. Provide resources such as job/internship listings, career advice, and networking opportunities to help software engineering students find and secure relevant opportunities.\n5. Offer simple and intuitive website templates and hosting options to help software engineering students create and maintain their own personal websites and portfolios, without requiring extensive technical expertise.\n\nThese problem and solution statements can be used as starting points for brainstorming and ideation during the design process, and can be easily displayed on sticky notes to keep ideas organized and visible."
