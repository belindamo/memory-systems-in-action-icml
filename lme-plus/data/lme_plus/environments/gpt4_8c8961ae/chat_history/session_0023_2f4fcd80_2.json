      "content": "Brown algae on the glass walls of your tank can be frustrating! Don't worry, I'm here to help you identify the possible causes and provide some tips to get rid of it.\n\n**Causes of Brown Algae:**\n\n1. **Excess nutrients**: Overfeeding, especially with high-protein foods like live brine shrimp, can lead to an overabundance of nutrients in the water. These excess nutrients can fuel algae growth.\n2. **Insufficient water changes**: Infrequent or inadequate water changes can cause a buildup of waste products, which can contribute to algae growth.\n3. **Inadequate lighting**: Too much light, especially in the blue spectrum, can promote algae growth. Brown algae, in particular, thrives in low-light conditions.\n4. **High pH**: Brown algae tends to grow more rapidly in water with a higher pH (above 7.5).\n5. **Poor water circulation**: Inadequate water movement can create areas with low oxygen levels, which can contribute to algae growth.\n\n**Tips to Get Rid of Brown Algae:**\n\n1. **Increase water changes**: Perform regular water changes (20-30% every week) to remove excess nutrients and waste products.\n2. **Monitor your feeding**: Ensure you're not overfeeding your neon tetras. Only feed them as much as they can consume within a few minutes. Consider switching to a high-quality flake or pellet food as their staple diet.\n3. **Adjust your lighting**: Reduce the duration or intensity of your lighting, especially in the blue spectrum. You can also consider adding plants, which will help absorb excess nutrients and compete with algae for resources.\n4. **Check your pH**: Test your water pH and adjust it if necessary. Most fish, including neon tetras, prefer a slightly acidic to neutral pH (around 6.5-7.5).\n5. **Increase water circulation**: Make sure your tank has adequate water movement. You can add a powerhead or adjust the direction of your filter outlets to improve circulation.\n6. **Use algae-controlling measures**: Consider adding algae-controlling products, such as algae-absorbing media or algae-preventing supplements, to your tank.\n7. **Clean the glass**: Use a magnetic algae scraper or a scrubber to remove the brown algae from the glass walls. Be sure to clean the algae scraper regularly to prevent re-inoculating the tank with algae spores.\n\nRegarding your neon tetras, it's great that they enjoy the live brine shrimp! Just be sure to vary their diet and not overfeed them, as this can lead to water quality issues.\n\nBy addressing these potential causes and implementing the suggested tips, you should be able to get rid of the brown algae in your tank. Good luck!"
