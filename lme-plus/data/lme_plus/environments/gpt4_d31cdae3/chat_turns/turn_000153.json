Here's a breakdown of what you can expect from their free versions:\n\n**Headspace Free Version:**\n\n1. **\"Take10\" Program**: A free 10-day meditation program that introduces you to the basics of mindfulness and meditation. This program is a great way to get started with meditation and understand the Headspace approach.\n2. **\"Everyday Headspace\"**: A daily meditation exercise that's available for free, without a subscription. These exercises are shorter (around 3-5 minutes) and focus on stress, anxiety, or sleep.\n3. **\"SOS\" Sessions**: Headspace offers a few free SOS (Save Our Sanity) sessions, which are designed to help you cope with anxiety, stress, or overwhelm in the moment. These sessions are shorter (around 3-5 minutes) and are available without a subscription.\n4. **Basics Pack**: The free version includes a limited selection of meditations from the \"Basics\" pack, which covers the fundamentals of meditation and mindfulness.\n\nThe free version of Headspace is a great way to get a feel for the app and its approach, but it's limited in terms of content and features. If you want access to the full library of meditations, personalized progress tracking, and other premium features, you'll need to subscribe to Headspace Plus.\n\n**Calm Free Version:**\n\n1. **\"7 Days of Calm\"**: A free 7-day meditation program that introduces you to the basics of mindfulness and relaxation. This program is similar to Headspace's \"Take10\" program.\n2. **Daily Calm**: Calm offers a daily meditation exercise for free, without a subscription. These exercises are shorter (around 3-10 minutes) and focus on stress, anxiety, or sleep.\n3. **Sleep Stories**: Calm's free version includes a limited selection of sleep stories, which are designed to help you fall asleep.\n4. **Music and Nature Sounds**: You can access a limited selection of Calm's music and nature sounds for free, which can be used for relaxation or focus.\n\nThe free version of Calm provides a taste of the app's content and features, but it's limited compared to the premium subscription. With a free account, you'll have access to a smaller library of meditations, and some features like personalized progress tracking and access to Calm's full music library are only available with a subscription.\n\nBoth Headspace and Calm offer a free trial period for their premium subscriptions, so you can try out the full range of features and content before committing to a paid plan.\n\nI hope this helps you decide which app to try out first!",
