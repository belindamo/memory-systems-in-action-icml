I'll advertise these promotions on my social media channels and in-stall signage. I'm also considering offering a loyalty program or email list sign-up to encourage repeat customers and stay in touch with them after the event. Do you think I should also consider partnering with other vendors at the market to cross-promote each other's products and services?",
