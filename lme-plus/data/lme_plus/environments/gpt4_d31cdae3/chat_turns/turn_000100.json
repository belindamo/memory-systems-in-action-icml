  "content": "I've got a mix of fiction and non-fiction on the bookshelf, mostly novels and some self-help books. The decorative items are mostly things I've picked up during travels or gifts from friends and family, like that new vase from my aunt. Speaking of which, I was thinking of getting some new throw pillows for the couch to match the vase's color scheme. Do you have any suggestions on where to find some affordable but stylish options?",
