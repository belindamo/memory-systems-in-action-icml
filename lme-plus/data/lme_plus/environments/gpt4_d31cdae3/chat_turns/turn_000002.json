  "content": "I'm introducing a limited edition Easter-themed jam with bunny-shaped labels, and I'm thinking of pricing it slightly higher than my regular flavors. The jar size is 8 oz, and my COGS is around $3.50 per jar. I'm aiming for a profit margin of at least 50%. Also, I want to make sure I can cover the market stall fee, which is $50 for the day.",
