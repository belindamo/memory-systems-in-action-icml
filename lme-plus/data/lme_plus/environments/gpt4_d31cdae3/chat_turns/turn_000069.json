  "content": "Sure, here's some Python code that writes a JSON object to a file:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Create a dictionary object to represent your JSON data\ndata = {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\"\n}\n\n# Open a file for writing\nwith open(\"output.json\", \"w\") as outfile:\n\n    # Write the JSON data to the file\n    json.dump(data, outfile)\n```\nIn this example, the code creates a simple dictionary object to represent the JSON data, opens a file named \"output.json\" for writing, and uses the `json.dump()` function to write the data to the file in JSON format.\n\nNote that `json.dump()` expects two arguments: the data to write (in this case, the `data` dictionary) and the file object to write to (`outfile` in this example).",
