Prepare 2-3 general questions that might be relevant to the lecture. This will show your interest and engagement with the topic.\n2. **Wait for the lecture**: Listen to the speaker's presentation and take notes. Pay attention to the main points, concepts, and ideas discussed.\n3. **Refine your questions**: Based on the lecture, refine your prepared questions or come up with new ones. This will ensure your questions are specific, relevant, and show you've been paying attention.\n\nSome tips for asking questions:\n\n* **Be respectful**: Show respect for the speaker's time and expertise.\n* **Be clear**: Ask concise, clear questions that are easy to understand.\n* **Avoid assumptions**: Don't assume you know the answer; ask open-ended questions to encourage discussion.\n* **Take notes**: Write down the speaker's response to your question, so you can reflect on it later.\n\nBy preparing some questions in advance and refining them during the lecture, you'll be able to engage more meaningfully with the speaker and the topic. Enjoy the lecture and learn as much as you can!",
