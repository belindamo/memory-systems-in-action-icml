As for using a similar style of vase on the coffee table, it's definitely worth considering. Here are a few pros and cons to think about:\n\nPros:\n\n* **Visual cohesion**: Using a similar vase style on the coffee table can create a sense of visual cohesion and tie the two spaces together.\n* **Consistency**: If you like the style of the vase on your bookshelf, using a similar one on the coffee table can create a sense of consistency in your decor.\n* **Easy to mix and match**: If you find a vase that's similar in style, you can easily move it between the bookshelf and coffee table to change up the look.\n\nCons:\n\n* **Overkill**: If the vases are too similar, it might look like you're trying too hard to match everything, and it could end up looking a bit too \"matchy-matchy.\"\n* **Lack of contrast**: If the vases are identical or very similar, it might not add enough visual interest to the space.\n\nUltimately, it depends on your personal style and the overall aesthetic you're going for. If you like the idea of using a similar vase, you could try the following:\n\n* **Mix and match**: Pair the similar vase with other decorative items on the coffee table that have different textures, shapes, or colors to add visual interest.\n* **Add a twist**: Look for a vase that's similar in style but has a slightly different shape, size, or color to add some contrast.\n* **Balance it out**: Make sure the coffee table isn't too cluttered or overwhelmed by the vase. Balance it out with other decorative items or leave some negative space to create a sense of breathability.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards using a similar vase or trying something completely different?",
