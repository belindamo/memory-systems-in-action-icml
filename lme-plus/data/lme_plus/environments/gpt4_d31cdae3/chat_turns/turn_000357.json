  "content": "Developing characters can be an intricate process, but here are some ways you bring them to life on the page:\n\n1. Use vivid description: Use unique and lively descriptions to paint an image of your characters in the reader's mind. Their appearance, mannerisms, and speech can be powerful tools in establishing their personality.\n\n2. Show don't tell: Rather than telling the reader about your character's traits, show their personality through dialogue and action.\n\n3. Make them real: Look for ways to humanize your characters by creating realistic dialogue and emphasizing weaknesses and vulnerabilities, making your characters more relatable.\n\n4. Consider contrasting traits: Characters with clashing traits can make them more exciting and relatable. For example, a person who is outgoing but also struggles with anxiety can create an dynamic and engaging character.\n\n5. Make them have flaws: Give your characters faults so that they're not completely perfect. This makes them more authentic and relatable.\n\n6. Give them depth: Developing an interesting backstory that is unique to each character is essential. It lets the reader understand their motives and behavior, making them more relatable to the reader.\n\n7. Try writing in first person: Consider trying to write from the perspective of your character. This exercise can allow you to better understand and get in tune with your character.\n\nWhen characters come to life, they take on a sense of reality and communicate with the reader like actual people. These ways can allow you to create a memorable and exciting character that goes beyond the clich\u00e9.",
