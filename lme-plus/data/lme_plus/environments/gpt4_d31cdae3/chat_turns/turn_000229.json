  "content": "Sarah is a tough and resourceful young woman who has spent most of her life living on the streets. She is a skilled pickpocket and con artist, and she has a natural talent for getting herself out of sticky situations.\n\nDespite her tough exterior, Sarah is fiercely loyal and has a soft spot for those in need. She took Jack under her wing when he was just a kid, and she has always been there for him, no matter what.\n\nSarah is also fiercely intelligent and able to think on her feet. She is always coming up with clever plans and strategies, and she is not afraid to take risks in order to achieve her goals.\n\nAs Jack's magical abilities began to surface, Sarah was the first person he confided in. She was skeptical at first, but once she saw Jack's powers in action, she was convinced. Together, they began to use Jack's abilities to their advantage, pulling off seemingly impossible heists and staying one step ahead of the law.\n\nBut when the cult began to pursue Jack, Sarah stood by his side and helped him to evade their pursuers. She used her own skills and knowledge of the streets to help them stay hidden and stay one step ahead of the cult. And now, as they work to take down the cult and protect the innocent, Sarah remains Jack's closest ally and confidante.",
