However, they do prefer consistent moisture, especially when they're producing new growth or flowers.\n\n**Watering Tips for Spider Plants:**\n\n1. **Check the soil moisture:** Stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water.\n2. **Water thoroughly:** Water your spider plant thoroughly, making sure the pot drains well to prevent waterlogged soil.\n3. **Adjust for seasons:** Spider plants require more water during the spring and summer months when they're actively growing. Reduce watering during the fall and winter when they're dormant.\n4. **Humidity:** Spider plants prefer a humid environment, but they can adapt to average humidity levels.
