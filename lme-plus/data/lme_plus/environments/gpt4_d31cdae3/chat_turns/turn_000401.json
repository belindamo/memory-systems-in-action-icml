By doing so, you'll not only create a more authentic and engaging event, but you'll also build stronger relationships with your language exchange friends and Brazilian roommate.\n\nRemember to stay organized, be open to feedback and suggestions, and have fun with the planning process! It's a great opportunity to learn from others, share your own culture, and bring people together.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with your event planning, and I hope your Brazilian-themed night is a huge success!\n\nBoa sorte (good luck) with your event!",
