Congratulations on accumulating $25 in rewards points through your cashback app!\n\nIt's definitely worth exploring whether you can use those points to get a discount on a customized mug or tea infuser. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n**Check the cashback app's rewards catalog:**\n\n1. Log in to your cashback app and check their rewards catalog to see if they have any gift cards or discounts available for online marketplaces or retailers that sell customized mugs or tea infusers.\n2. If they do, you might be able to redeem your points for a gift card or discount code that can be used on your desired purchase.\n\n**Look for partnered retailers:**\n\n1. Check if the cashback app has partnered with any online retailers that sell customized mugs or tea infusers.\n2. If they have, you might be able to earn additional cashback or redeem your points for discounts on purchases made through those retailers.\n\n**Use points for a general gift card:**\n\n1. If the cashback app doesn't have specific retailers or gift cards for customized mugs or tea infusers, you might be able to redeem your points for a general gift card (e.g., Amazon, Visa, or Mastercard).\n2. You can then use the gift card to purchase the customized mug or tea infuser from your preferred retailer.\n\n**Check for any redemption restrictions:**\n\n1. Before redeeming your points, make sure to review the cashback app's terms and conditions to ensure there are no restrictions on using your points for gift cards or discounts on customized products.\n\nBy using your rewards points, you can potentially get a discount or even cover the full cost of the customized mug or tea infuser, depending on the retailer and the points' redemption value.\n\nHappy shopping, and I hope you're able to use your rewards points to get an amazing gift for your mom!",
