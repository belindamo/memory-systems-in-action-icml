COGS per jar: $3.50\n2. Desired profit margin: 50%\n3. Markup: $3.50 x 0.50 = $1.75 (this is the minimum profit you want to make per jar)\n4. Minimum selling price: $3.50 (COGS) + $1.75 (markup) = $5.25 per jar\n\nSince you want to price your limited edition jam slightly higher than your regular flavors, let's consider adding a premium to the minimum selling price. A common approach is to add 10-20% to the minimum price.\n\n1. Premium: $5.25 x 0.15 (15% premium) = $0.79\n2. Proposed selling price: $5.25 + $0.79 = $6.04 per jar\n\nRounding up to the nearest dollar or nickel can make the price more appealing to customers. In this case, you could consider pricing your limited edition Easter-themed jam at $6.00 or $6.50 per jar.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many jars you need to sell to cover your market stall fee:\n\n1. Market stall fee: $50\n2. Proposed selling price per jar: $6.00 (or $6.50)\n3. Number of jars to sell: $50 \u00f7 $6.00 (or $6.50) = 8-9 jars\n\nTo be safe, you may want to aim to sell 10-12 jars to account for any unexpected expenses or to make a bit more profit. This will also give you a buffer in case some customers negotiate prices or you need to offer any discounts.\n\nOverall, pricing your limited edition Easter-themed jam at $6.00 or $6.50 per jar should help you achieve your desired profit margin, cover your market stall fee, and make your product stand out as a special edition item.",
