With a flick of his wrist, the mugger was sent flying backwards, crashing into a trash bin with a loud thud.\n\n\"That's for messing with the wrong guy,\" Jack said, dusting off his hands.\n\nHe turned to Sarah, who was watching the scene with a mix of shock and admiration. \"Come on, let's get out of here before he comes to.\"\n\nSarah nodded and followed Jack as he led the way through the crowded streets.
