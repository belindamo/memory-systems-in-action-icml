I'm happy to help you with that.\n\n**Understanding Clay Consistency:**\n\nBlack stoneware clay can be quite dense and stiff, especially when it's fresh out of the bag. The ideal consistency for sculpting is often referred to as \"plastic\" or \"leather-hard.\" This means the clay should be firm enough to hold its shape, yet still be pliable and responsive to your tools.\n\n**Tips for Achieving the Right Consistency:**\n\n1. **Wedging and Kneading:** Your instructor is absolutely right! Wedging and kneading are essential steps in preparing your clay. This process helps to:\n\t* Remove any air pockets that can cause cracks or weaknesses in your piece.\n\t* Align the clay particles, making it more pliable and easier to work with.\n\t* Develop a consistent texture throughout the clay.\n2. **Conditioning the Clay:** If your clay is too stiff, try wrapping it in a damp cloth or plastic bag and letting it sit for a few hours or overnight. This will help the clay absorb moisture and become more pliable. If it's too soft, try leaving it uncovered for a few hours to firm up.\n3. **Using the Right Tools:** Invest in a good quality wire cutter or needle tool to help you gauge the clay's consistency. These tools will allow you to test the clay's flexibility and firmness.\n4. **Testing the Clay:** Perform the \"bend test\" by gently bending a small piece of clay. If it cracks or breaks, it's too dry. If it bends easily and springs back, it's ready to work with.\n5. **Adding Water or Slipping:** If your clay is too dry, you can add small amounts of water (about 1-2% of the clay's weight) and re-wedge. If it's too wet, you can try adding a small amount of dry clay or letting it sit uncovered for a bit. Remember, it's better to err on the side of caution when adding water, as excess moisture can lead to weak spots.\n6. **Working in Small Sections:** Divide your clay into smaller sections and work on each one individually. This will help you maintain a consistent consistency throughout your piece.\n7. **Practice and Patience:** Working with black stoneware clay takes time and practice to develop a feel for the right consistency. Don't be discouraged if it takes a few attempts to get it right \u2013 it's all part of the process!\n\n**Additional Tips for Sculpting with Black Stoneware Clay:**\n\n* Use a sturdy armature or support system to help hold your piece in place, especially if you're creating a larger or more complex design.\n* Work in a cool, dry environment to prevent the clay from drying out too quickly.\n* Use a gentle touch and work slowly, as black stoneware clay can be prone to cracking or breaking if handled too roughly.\n\nI hope these tips help you achieve the right consistency for your next sculpting project! Remember to stay patient, practice regularly, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions.",
