I recently treated myself to a designer handbag, but now I'm questioning whether it was worth the splurge. Speaking of luxury shopping, I was tempted to buy a pair of designer shoes from a luxury department store, but I didn't end up buying them because they didn't fit quite right. Can you help me find some budget-friendly alternatives for similar products?",
