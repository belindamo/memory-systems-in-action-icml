I'm glad I could help.\n\nIt's great that you're already in the habit of watering your plants regularly, and it's even better that you're willing to adjust your routine to accommodate your Prayer Plant's specific needs.\n\n**Soil Moisture Check:**\nRemember to check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. If it's already moist, wait a few more days before watering again. This will help prevent overwatering, which can be detrimental to your Prayer Plant.\n\n**Watering on Wednesday:**\nWhile it's good to have a regular watering schedule, it's essential to be flexible and adjust your watering frequency based on the plant's needs. If you find that your Prayer Plant needs more frequent watering, you might need to water it every 7-10 days, rather than just on Wednesdays.\n\n**Monitoring the Plant:**\nKeep an eye on your Prayer Plant's behavior and respond to its needs. If you notice the leaves starting to droop or the plant looking stressed, it might be a sign that it needs more water or humidity. Conversely, if the leaves are firm and perky, it's likely getting enough moisture.\n\nBy being attentive to your Prayer Plant's needs and adjusting your care routine accordingly, you'll be well on your way to becoming a Prayer Plant expert! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
