Add unpredictability: A character's behavior can become predictable, which can contribute to the story's dullness. Try to add little surprises to keep the character and story fresh.\n\n2. Heighten the stakes: Increasing the stakes will develop the character because it forces them to go through tougher scenarios they wouldn't have gone through before. Introducing high stakes adds crises to the story and keeps it dynamic and enthralling.\n\n3. Raise the stakes using the external conflict:\n\nIntroduce the type of conflict, which can leave your characters fighting for their identity, lives or, someone that they could not live without. This would bring a unique dynamics to your writing and inject the necessary energy into the characters.\n\n4. Make the character more vulnerable: Introduce vulnerability, it could be a weakness or a fear that the character may have. This makes them more relatable to the reader and highlights that they too are trying to battle their problems.\n\n5. Give them something to care about: Sometimes, characters can become bland, and one-dimensional when they don't seem to have genuine motives or interests. Think critically about what the character cares about and keep it as realistic as possible, then find ways to highlight that throughout the story.\n\n6. Take your characters out of their comfort zone: Put your characters in scenarios that make them uncomfortable, and they will be challenged to grow and develop in new and exciting ways.\n\nRemember, there's no one right way to make characters more exciting, but with these tips, the possibilities for character development become endless. As authors, our characters live and breathe outside of the story, and if we want our readers to care about them, putting extra time and effort into their personalities will undoubtedly help.",
