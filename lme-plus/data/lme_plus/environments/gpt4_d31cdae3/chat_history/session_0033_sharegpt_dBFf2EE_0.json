      "content": "In the wild west, a time of change\nWhen open range seemed so strange\nFor ranchers, life was hard and tough\nBut barbed wire brought a welcome rough\n\nNo longer did their cattle stray\nFrom open fields to towns away\nNo longer did they lose their herd\nAnd their profits soared, undeterred\n\nThe fences kept the land secure\nFrom predators, wild and impure\nThe crops grew strong, the cattle fat\nAnd fortunes were made, just like that\n\nBut then a twist came, unforeseen\nA darkness spread, a stifling sheen\nFor fences barred the way to roam\nAnd freedom's call, no longer home\n\nThe cowboys lost their wild terrain\nAnd with it, the freedom they gained\nTheir lives were now confined and small\nNo longer did they hear the call\n\nThe plains that once seemed infinite\nWere now just lines, cold and definite\nThe fences marked the end of range\nAnd the beginning of a prison strange\n\nSo now we stand, and look around\nAt the fences that we have found\nAnd wonder at the cost we paid\nFor the security that we've made\n\nFor though we've gained much, it's true\nWe've lost a lot, and that's not new\nAnd so we live, resigned and still\nWith fences that define our will."
