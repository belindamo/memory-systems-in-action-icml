      "content": "To add the functionality of sending a file on multiple social media platforms like LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and email, you can use their respective APIs to implement the feature in your application. Here are some general steps you can follow:\n\n1. Obtain the API keys for the social media platforms you want to use. For example, LinkedIn has the LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform, WhatsApp has the WhatsApp Business API, and email services have various APIs such as the Gmail API.\n2. Set up the API clients in your backend using Express.js. You can use libraries like `node-linkedin` for LinkedIn, `whatsapp-web.js` for WhatsApp, and `nodemailer` for email services.\n3. Create a route in your backend to handle the file upload and sending it to the social media platforms. You can use `multer` middleware to handle file uploads.\n4. In the frontend using React.js, create a form for the user to upload the file and select the social media platforms to send it to.\n5. When the user submits the form, send a request to the backend route created in step 3, which will handle sending the file to the selected social media platforms using their respective APIs.\n6. Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the file upload or sending process.\n\nIt's worth noting that each social media platform may have different requirements and limitations for sending files through their APIs, so be sure to check their documentation for specific details."
