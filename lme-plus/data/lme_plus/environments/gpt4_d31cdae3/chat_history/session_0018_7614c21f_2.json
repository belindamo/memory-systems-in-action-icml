Here are some pros of shopping locally:\n\n**Pros of local shopping:**\n\n1. **Tactile experience**: You can touch, feel, and see the products in person, which can help you make a more informed decision.\n2. **Unique finds**: Local gift shops often carry exclusive or handmade items that you won't find online.\n3. **Personalized service**: You can ask the shop owners or staff for recommendations, and they might be able to offer personalized suggestions based on your mom's interests.\n4. **Supporting local businesses**: By shopping locally, you're supporting small businesses and contributing to your community's economy.\n\nThat being said, online shopping has its own advantages, such as convenience, wider selection, and often competitive pricing. If you're short on time or have a specific item in mind, online shopping might still be a good option.\n\n**Why not do both?**\n\nConsider combining both approaches: visit local gift shops to get inspiration and find unique items, and then supplement your search with online shopping if you don't find what you're looking for. This way, you'll get the best of both worlds!\n\nRemember to take your time, enjoy the process, and have fun exploring local gift shops this weekend! You might stumble upon a hidden gem that will make a perfect gift for your mom."
