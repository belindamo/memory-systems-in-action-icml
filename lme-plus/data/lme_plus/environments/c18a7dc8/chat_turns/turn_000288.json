Visiting the local historical society or museum is an excellent first step, as they likely have a wealth of information about the town's history and may have archives or resources that can help you identify the lake and learn more about your grandma's story.\n\nTalking to older locals at the diner or community center can also be incredibly valuable, as they may have personal experiences or stories that can provide context and insights. By being respectful and open-minded, you'll be more likely to build trust and get honest, helpful responses.\n\nRemember to also be prepared to share your own story and connection to the town, as this can help establish a connection with the locals and make them more willing to open up and share their own stories.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Bring copies of the photo and any other relevant documents or artifacts to share with the historical society and locals. This can help spark conversations and provide a visual aid for your research.\n* Be prepared to ask questions that might seem obvious, but can help clarify information. For example, \"What's the history of the lake?\" or \"Have there been any notable events or changes in the town over the years?\"\n* Don't be afraid to ask for introductions or recommendations. If someone at the historical society or museum knows an older local who might have information, ask if they can facilitate an introduction.\n* Take your time and don't rush the conversations. Building relationships and gathering information takes time, and it's better to have a few in-depth conversations than to try to gather as much information as possible in a short amount of time.\n\nYou're off to a great start, and I'm excited to hear about your experiences and any new discoveries you make!",
