  "content": "I was thinking of inviting around 6-8 people, and I definitely want to invite Rachel, Emily, and Michael and Sarah, who I haven't seen in months. For the menu, I was thinking of something simple like pasta or tacos, and maybe some cocktails to get the party started. Also, about the club, we actually went there after our weekly brunch tradition at that new caf\u00e9 downtown, so I was wondering if you could recommend some brunch spots near my place that I could suggest to my friends for a pre-dinner gathering.",
