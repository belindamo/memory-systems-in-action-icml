  "content": "Spongy brakes can be a real concern, and it's great that you're taking proactive steps to address the issue.\n\nRemember to communicate clearly with the shop about the issues you're experiencing with your brakes, and ask them to take a close look at the brake system during the maintenance check. A good mechanic will be able to diagnose the problem and recommend the necessary repairs or adjustments to get your brakes functioning properly again.\n\nIn the meantime, it's a good idea to avoid riding your road bike until the issue is resolved, especially if you're not comfortable with the brake performance. Safety should always be your top priority when it comes to cycling.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns about brake maintenance or bike maintenance in general, feel free to ask. I'm here to help.\n\nGood luck with your bike maintenance, and I hope you get your road bike back in top shape soon!",
