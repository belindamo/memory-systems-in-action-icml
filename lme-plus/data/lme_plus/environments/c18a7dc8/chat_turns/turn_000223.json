Congrats to your cousin and your colleague's son on their achievements!\n\nNow, let's focus on brunch. Can you please tell me a bit more about what you're in the mood for? Are you looking for something fancy, casual, or somewhere in between? Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)?\n\nAlso, what's the general area around your office like? Is it in a busy city center, a quiet neighborhood, or somewhere with a lot of foot traffic? Knowing this will help me give you more tailored recommendations.",
