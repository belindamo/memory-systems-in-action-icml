  "content": "Filtering by patio seating is a great start. Now, let's consider filtering by price range and cuisine to further narrow down the options.\n\n**Price Range:**\n\n* If you're looking to keep things casual and affordable, filtering by price range can help you find options that fit your budget. You can set a price range, such as \"$10-$20 per entree\" or \"Under $30 per person,\" to get a sense of what to expect.\n* If you're open to splurging a bit, you can set a higher price range or remove the filter altogether.\n\n**Cuisine:**\n\n* If you or your colleagues have specific cravings or dietary restrictions, filtering by cuisine can be helpful. For example, if someone is vegetarian or gluten-free, you can look for restaurants that specialize in those options.\n* If you're open to trying new things, you can leave the cuisine filter open or try searching for \"brunch\" or \"breakfast\" to get a broader range of options.\n\nHere's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Start with a broad search for restaurants near your office, filtered by patio seating.\n2. Browse through the results and get a sense of the options.\n3. If you want to narrow down the results, add filters for price range and/or cuisine.\n4. Read reviews and check menus to get a better sense of each restaurant's atmosphere and offerings.\n\nRemember, you can always adjust your filters or search criteria as needed to find the perfect spot for your brunch gathering.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a fantastic spot to celebrate with your colleagues!",
