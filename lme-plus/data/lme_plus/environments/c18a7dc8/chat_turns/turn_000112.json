You mentioned earlier that your niece's graduation ceremony was last month, but you're planning a family gathering to celebrate her graduation now. If the ceremony was already held last month, that means you've already seen her walk across the stage and receive her diploma!\n\nIn any case, I'm sure you're still beaming with pride thinking about that moment. It's a significant milestone in her life, and I'm sure she's grateful for your love and support.\n\nNow, let's focus on finding a great spot to celebrate her achievement with the family! I hope you find a wonderful restaurant near the convention center that fits your needs. If you need any more assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",
