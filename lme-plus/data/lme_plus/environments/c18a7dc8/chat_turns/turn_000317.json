  "content": "I've been playing the guitar for about 6 months now, and I've been trying to dedicate at least 30 minutes every day to practice. I've recently mastered the chord progression for \"Wonderwall\" by Oasis, which has been a personal goal of mine for months. I'm now looking to record some of my own music and put it up online. Can you recommend some digital audio workstations like Logic Pro or Ableton Live, and also suggest some online resources or tutorials to help me learn how to use them?",
