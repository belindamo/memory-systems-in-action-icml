  "content": "Here are the key points about the therapeutic relationship in intergenerational therapy:\n\n1. In intergenerational therapy, the therapist's level of differentiation and emotional being are central to the change process.\n2. The therapist's level of differentiation is often the focus of supervision early in training, and therapists are expected to continually monitor and develop themselves to be of maximum assistance to their clients.\n3. The therapist's nonanxious presence is crucial in intergenerational therapy. This is not a cold, detached stance but rather an emotionally engaged stance that is nonreactive.\n4. The therapist calmly guides the client through the process of separating self from others and thought from feelings, and models differentiation.\n5. The therapist shepherds a difficult process of coaching clients through their fears and detests to facilitate growth.",
