I've got just the thing!\n\nConsidering your busy downtown location, I'd recommend checking out:\n\n1. **Bistro-style cafes**: Look for places that offer a mix of breakfast and lunch items, like eggs benedict, omelets, sandwiches, and salads. They usually have a relaxed vibe and won't break the bank.\n2. **Brunch chains**: Places like The Cheesecake Factory, First Watch, or The Egg & I offer a wide variety of brunch options and are often priced reasonably.\n3. **Local eateries**: Independent restaurants or diners that serve breakfast and lunch might offer a more unique experience. They might have a cozier atmosphere and more creative menu options.\n\nSome specific features to look for when choosing a spot:\n\n* Outdoor seating: If the weather's nice, grab a spot with outdoor seating to enjoy the downtown atmosphere.\n* Menu variety: Make sure they have options that cater to different tastes and dietary needs.\n* Reviews: Check online reviews to ensure the spot has good food, service, and a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nTo find the perfect spot, you can try:\n\n* Online review sites like Yelp or Google Maps to filter by location, price, and rating.\n* Ask your colleagues for recommendations \u2013 they might have some hidden gems to share!\n* Walk around your office neighborhood to see what catches your eye. You might stumble upon a new spot that's just opened up!\n\nHope this helps you find the perfect brunch spot for a lovely catch-up with your colleagues!",
