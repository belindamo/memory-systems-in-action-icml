Enjoying the downtown atmosphere while catching up with your colleagues will make the experience even more pleasant.\n\nWhen it comes to outdoor seating, both patio and rooftop options can be fantastic, but they offer slightly different vibes. Here's a brief pros and cons of each to consider:\n\n**Patio Seating:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Often more accessible and easier to find a table\n* Can be more shaded, which is great on sunny days\n* Usually more pedestrian-friendly, with people-watching opportunities\n\nCons:\n\n* Might be more noisy due to street traffic and pedestrians\n* Can feel more cramped or tight if the patio is small\n\n**Rooftop Seating:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Typically offers a great view of the surrounding area\n* Can be less noisy than patio seating, with a more elevated atmosphere\n* Often has a more trendy, upscale feel\n\nCons:\n\n* Might be more difficult to find a table, especially on weekends or peak hours\n* Can be more exposed to the elements (sun, wind, or rain)\n* May have a more limited menu or higher prices due to the premium location\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide between patio and rooftop seating:\n\n* Are you looking for a more lively, people-watching experience? Patio might be the way to go.\n* Do you want a more elevated, trendy atmosphere with a great view? Rooftop seating might be the better choice.\n* Is shade a priority for your group? Patio seating might provide more shade options.\n* Are you willing to potentially wait for a table or deal with more limited menu options? Rooftop seating might require more flexibility.\n\nUltimately, prioritize what matters most to you and your colleagues. If you're still unsure, you could always call ahead or check the restaurant's website to get a better sense of their outdoor seating options and atmosphere.",
