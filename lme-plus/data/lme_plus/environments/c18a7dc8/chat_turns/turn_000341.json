  "content": "I'm looking to explore some online courses to improve my marketing skills, particularly in content creation and strategy. I've been working in digital marketing for a while now, and I think it's essential to stay updated on the latest trends. By the way, I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing from the University of California, Berkeley, which I completed at the age of 25. Do you have any course recommendations that would be suitable for someone with my background and experience?",
