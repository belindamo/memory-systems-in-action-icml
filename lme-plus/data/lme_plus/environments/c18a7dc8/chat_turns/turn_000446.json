  "content": "Azul and Codenames are both excellent choices, and I think they could make a great combination to introduce to your neighbor. However, it's generally recommended to focus on one game at a time, especially when introducing new games to someone who's still relatively new to board gaming.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Overwhelming options**: Introducing two new games at once can be overwhelming, especially if your neighbor is still getting familiar with the basics of board gaming. Focus on one game, and let her get comfortable with it before moving on to the next.\n2. **Depth vs. breadth**: By focusing on one game, you can dive deeper into its mechanics, strategies, and nuances. This will help your neighbor develop a better understanding of the game and appreciate its complexity.\n3. **Building confidence**: Introducing one game at a time allows your neighbor to build confidence in her gaming abilities. As she becomes more comfortable with the game, she'll be more likely to take on new challenges and explore other games.\n\nThat being said, if you do decide to introduce both Azul and Codenames, consider the following:\n\n1. **Start with Azul**: Azul is a more strategic game that requires players to plan ahead and think critically. Introduce Azul first, and let your neighbor get familiar with its mechanics and gameplay.\n2. **Follow up with Codenames**: Once your neighbor is comfortable with Azul, introduce Codenames as a fun, social game that's easy to learn but challenging to master. Codenames is a great game for building on the strategic thinking developed in Azul.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make the gaming experience enjoyable and engaging for your neighbor. Take it one game at a time, and be patient with the learning process.",
