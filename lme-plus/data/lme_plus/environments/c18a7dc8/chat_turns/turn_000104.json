  "content": "Congratulations to your colleague's daughter on her graduation!\n\nCalculating the number of guests to invite based on the number of tickets you have is a simple process. Here's the step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Count the number of tickets you have**: Check how many tickets you've been allocated for the graduation ceremony.\n2. **Identify the number of people you want to invite**: Think about how many family members, friends, or other guests your colleague's daughter would like to attend the ceremony.\n3. **Match the number of tickets to the number of guests**: Assign one ticket to each guest you want to invite. Make sure you don't exceed the total number of tickets you have.\n\nFor example, let's say you have:\n\n* 4 tickets\n* You want to invite your colleague's daughter's parents, 2 grandparents, and 1 sibling (5 people)\n\nIn this case, you can invite all 5 guests, as you have enough tickets to cover each of them.\n\nIf you have fewer tickets than guests, you'll need to prioritize who to invite or consider alternative arrangements, such as watching a live stream of the ceremony or celebrating separately.\n\nRemember to also consider any specific instructions or restrictions provided by the school or ceremony organizers regarding ticket usage and guest attendance.\n\nI hope this helps!",
