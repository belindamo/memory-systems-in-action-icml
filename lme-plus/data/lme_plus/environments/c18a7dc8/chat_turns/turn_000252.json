To do this, simply create a new file in a text editor (such as Notepad or Sublime Text), add your CSS code to it, and save the file with a name of your choice, followed by the \".css\" extension.\n\nFor example, you could create a file called \"style.css\" and save it in the same directory as your HTML and JavaScript files. Then, in your HTML file, you would link to the CSS file by adding the following code to the head section:\n```bash\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\">\n```\nThis code tells the browser to load the \"style.css\" file and apply its styles to the HTML document.",
