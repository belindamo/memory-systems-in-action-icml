However, I can suggest a few ways to find a great family-friendly restaurant in your area:\n\n1. **Online Review Sites**: Check out review websites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews to see what other families have to say about local restaurants. Filter your search by rating, cuisine, and price range to find a spot that suits your needs.\n2. **Ask for Referrals**: Ask friends, family members, or colleagues for recommendations. They might have had a great experience at a local restaurant that's perfect for a family gathering.\n3. **Check Social Media**: Look up local restaurants on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram. You can get an idea of their menu, atmosphere, and events they host.\n4. **Restaurant Websites**: Visit the websites of local restaurants to see if they have a private dining area or special menus for large groups.\n5. **Call Ahead**: Once you have a few options, call the restaurants to ask about their availability, menu options, and any special accommodations they can make for your group.\n\nWhen selecting a restaurant, consider factors like:\n\n* Menu variety: Choose a place that offers a range of options to cater to different tastes and dietary restrictions.\n* Ambiance: Opt for a restaurant with a welcoming atmosphere that's suitable for a celebratory occasion.\n* Space: Ensure the restaurant has a private area or can accommodate your group size comfortably.\n* Budget: Pick a restaurant that fits within your budget and offers good value for the price.\n\nRemember to book your reservation well in advance to ensure availability, especially on weekends or during peak hours.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find the perfect spot to celebrate your niece's graduation!",
