  "content": "Two figures are reciprocal when the properties of the first relative to the second are the same as those of the second relative to the first. Several kinds of reciprocity are known to mathematicians, and the theories of Inverse Figures and of Polar Reciprocals have been developed at great length, and have led to remarkable results. I propose to investigate a different kind of geometrical reciprocity, which is also capable of considerable development, and can be ap- plied to the solution of mechanical problems.\nA Frame may be defined geometrically as a system of straight lines con- necting a number of points. In actual structures these lines are material pieces, beams, rods, or wires, and may be straight or curved; but the force by which each piece resists any alteration of the distance between the points which it joins acts in the straight line joining those points. Hence, in studying the equilibrium of a frame, we may consider its different points as mutually acting on each other with forces whose directions are those of the lines joining each pair of points. When the forces acting between the two points tend to draw them together, or to prevent them from separating, the action along the joining line is called a Tension. When the forces tend to separate the points, or to keep them apart, the action along the joining line is called a Pressure.\nIf we divide the piece joining the points by any imaginary section, the resultant of the whole internal force acting between the parts thus divided will be mechanically equivalent to the tension or pressure of the piece. Hence, in order to exhibit the mechanical action of the frame in the most elementary manner, we may draw it as a skeleton, in which the different points are joined VOL. II.\n\nexplain this",
