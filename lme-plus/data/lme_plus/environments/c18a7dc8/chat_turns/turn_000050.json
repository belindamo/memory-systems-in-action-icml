Genuine, kind, and a sense of humor are all wonderful qualities to look for.\n\nNavigating this situation can be tricky, but I've got some advice to help you avoid leading anyone on or getting hurt:\n\n1. **Be honest with yourself**: Take time to reflect on your feelings and intentions. Be honest about why you're interested in both Ryan and Alex, and what you hope to get out of each relationship.\n2. **Communicate openly**: When you're spending time with either Ryan or Alex, make sure to communicate openly and honestly about your intentions and feelings. Don't lead them on or give false hope if you're not sure about the direction of the relationship.\n3. **Don't compare them**: Try not to compare Ryan and Alex too much. Focus on getting to know each of them as individuals, rather than comparing their qualities or traits.\n4. **Take things slow**: Don't rush into anything. Take your time to get to know both Ryan and Alex, and let things develop naturally.\n5. **Prioritize respect**: Remember to treat both Ryan and Alex with respect and kindness, regardless of the outcome. Don't play games or lead them on if you're not interested.\n6. **Trust your instincts**: Ultimately, trust your instincts and listen to your gut.

Just be respectful, honest, and kind throughout the process.\n\nHow do you feel about being open with Ryan and Alex about your intentions and feelings?
