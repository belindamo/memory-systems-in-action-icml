You'll get to enjoy the downtown atmosphere and people-watching, which is always entertaining.\n\nFinding a spot within a 10-15 minute walk from your office should be doable. Most downtown areas have a high concentration of restaurants, so you should be able to find a great option. Here's a suggestion:\n\n1. **Use online maps**: Open Google Maps or a similar service on your phone or computer and search for restaurants near your office location. You can filter the results by rating, price, and cuisine to narrow down the options.\n2. **Check review sites**: Websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor can give you an idea of the restaurant's atmosphere, menu, and service. Look for spots with a high rating (4-5 stars) and read reviews that mention patio seating.\n3. **Ask colleagues or friends**: Ask your coworkers or friends who work in the area for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge on the best patio spots.\n\nAs for your niece's preschool graduation, congratulations to her! It's amazing how fast time flies, isn't it? It seems like just yesterday you were attending your cousin's graduation ceremony, and now your niece is moving on to the next stage. Enjoy the celebration and cherish the moment!\n\nNow, back to brunch plans... Once you find a few potential spots, you can check their websites or call them to confirm their patio seating availability and make a reservation if possible. Don't forget to ask about their brunch menu and hours of operation to ensure they fit your plans.",
