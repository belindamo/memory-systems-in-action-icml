However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location. But I can give you some tips to find a good bike shop near you:\n\n1. **Google Search**: Type \"bike shops near me\" or \"bike shops in [your city/zip code]\" and check the top results. Look for shops with good reviews (4-5 stars) and a high rating.\n2. **Online Directories**: Websites like Yelp, Google Maps, and TripAdvisor can help you find bike shops in your area. You can filter the results by rating, distance, and hours of operation.\n3. **Ask Around**: Ask friends, family, or coworkers who cycle for recommendations. They might have had a good experience with a local bike shop.\n4. **Check Social Media**: Look for bike shops on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Check their posts, reviews, and ratings to get an idea of their services and customer interactions.\n5. **Local Cycling Clubs or Organizations**: Reach out to local cycling clubs, bike advocacy groups, or cycling organizations in your area. They might have a list of recommended bike shops or know of shops that cater to cyclists.\n6. **Visit the Shop**: Once you've shortlisted a few shops, visit them in person. Look for a clean and organized workspace, friendly staff, and a good selection of bikes and accessories.\n\nWhen you find a shop you like, ask them about their maintenance services, pricing, and turnaround time. A good bike shop should be able to provide a thorough maintenance check for your road bike, including brake adjustments, gear tuning, and a safety inspection.\n\nRemember to also ask about their experience with road bikes specifically, as some shops might specialize in mountain bikes or other types of bicycles.\n\nI hope these tips help you find a reliable bike shop in your area. Happy cycling!",
