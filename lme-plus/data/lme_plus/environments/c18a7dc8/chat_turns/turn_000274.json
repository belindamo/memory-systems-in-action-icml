Experts in the field of study are involved in the editorial process.\n\nExplanation: Peer-reviewed journals go through a rigorous evaluation process where experts in the field of study review the article for quality, accuracy, and relevance. This ensures that the information published in the journal is reliable and trustworthy. Non-peer-reviewed journals may not undergo this type of evaluation, so the information they publish may not be as reliable. The other answer options are not correct because journal editors are not necessarily selected from more prestigious institutions (b), randomized controlled studies are not the only studies that can be published in peer-reviewed journals (c), and peer-reviewed journals do not necessarily require publication of all raw data (d).\n\nLevel of Bloom's Taxonomy: Knowledge/Comprehension",
