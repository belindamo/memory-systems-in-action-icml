  "content": "That's wonderful! It's great to hear that your sister's wedding was a huge success and that you had a fantastic time planning it with her. Being a part of such a special moment in your sister's life must have been incredibly rewarding.\n\nIt's lovely that you got to share in the experience of choosing the dress, menu, and other details together. Those memories will surely last a lifetime. Did you have a particular role or responsibility during the wedding, like being a maid of honor or giving a speech?\n\nAlso, I'm curious, how did you meet Alex, your sister's husband's best friend, at the bachelor party? Was it a fun and wild night, or more of a relaxed gathering?",
