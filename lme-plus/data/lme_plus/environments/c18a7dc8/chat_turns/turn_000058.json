Here are some tips to help you determine the value of your vintage treasures:\n\n1. **Research, research, research**:\n\t* Look for similar items sold on online marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, and Ruby Lane.\n\t* Check auction houses, antique dealers, and collector forums to see what similar items have sold for.\n\t* Consult price guides, such as those published by Krause or Collector's Weekly.\n2. **Condition, condition, condition**:\n\t* The condition of your item greatly affects its value. Consider the item's age, rarity, and overall state.\n\t* Document any flaws, damage, or restoration work to provide transparency to potential buyers.\n3. **Rarity and demand**:\n\t* If your item is rare or hard to find, it may be more valuable.\n\t* Consider current market trends and demand for similar items.\n4. **Provenance and history**:\n\t* If your item has a rich history, documentation, or connection to a notable event or person, it can increase its value.\n\t* Share any interesting stories or provenance with potential buyers to add value.\n5. **Get your items appraised**:\n\t* Consider hiring a professional appraiser or consulting with an expert in the specific field (e.g., a typewriter expert).\n\t* They can provide a more accurate valuation and help you set a competitive price.\n6. **Start with a competitive price**:\n\t* Set a starting price that's competitive with similar items on the market.\n\t* Be open to negotiations, but don't be afraid to hold out for a fair price.\n7. **Be transparent and honest**:\n\t* Clearly describe the item, its condition, and any flaws in your listing.\n\t* Provide high-quality photos and detailed descriptions to showcase the item's features.\n8. **Consider the platform fees**:\n\t* Factor in the fees associated with selling on various platforms, such as eBay, Etsy, or auction houses.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at your specific items:\n\n* **Vintage typewriter**: Research similar models and their selling prices. Consider the typewriter's condition, age, and functionality. Look for similar sales on eBay, Etsy, or specialized typewriter forums.\n* **Antique silverware**: Research the maker, pattern, and age of the silverware. Check online marketplaces, antique dealers, and silverware collector forums for similar sales. Consider the weight, condition, and rarity of the pieces.\n* **Old locket with a mysterious inscription**: This item's value may lie in its uniqueness and the story behind the inscription. Research similar lockets and their selling prices, considering the materials, age, and condition. Share the inscription's story and any historical context you've uncovered to add value.\n\nFor each item, make a list of similar sales, prices, and descriptions. This will help you determine a fair and competitive starting price. Remember to stay flexible and open to negotiations, and don't be afraid to ask for help from experts or appraisers if needed.\n\nGood luck with your sales, and I hope you get a great price for your vintage treasures!",
