  "content": "I need help finding a good restaurant for brunch this weekend. You know, I was just thinking about my cousin's graduation ceremony last month and how we took her to her favorite restaurant to celebrate. Speaking of which, I recall attending my colleague's son's middle school graduation ceremony on May 10th, and I was thinking of grabbing brunch with some colleagues afterwards. Do you have any recommendations for a good spot near my office?",
