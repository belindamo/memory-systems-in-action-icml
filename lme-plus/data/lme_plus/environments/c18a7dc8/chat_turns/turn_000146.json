  "content": "It sounds like you have a good start on your dinner party planning!\n\nFor the guest list, it's great that you have a few close friends in mind. With 6-8 people, you can keep the party intimate and still have a good time. You might consider reaching out to a few more friends to round out the group, but make sure you're not overcommitting yourself in terms of space and food.\n\nFor the menu, pasta and tacos are both great options for a casual dinner party. You could also consider a build-your-own taco bar or a pasta station with different toppings and sauces. Don't forget to think about appetizers and desserts, too! Cocktails are a great way to get the party started, and you could consider a signature drink for the evening.\n\nAs for brunch spots near your place, I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations. However, I need a bit more information from you. Could you please tell me:\n\n1. Where do you live (city, neighborhood, etc.)?\n2. What type of brunch are you in the mood for (e.g., breakfast-focused, lunch-focused, brunch with a twist, etc.)?\n3. Are there any specific amenities you're looking for (e.g., outdoor seating, pet-friendly, etc.)?\n\nWith that information, I can give you some personalized recommendations for brunch spots near your place.\n\nLastly, it's great that you have a weekly brunch tradition with your friends! That's a wonderful way to stay connected and catch up.",
