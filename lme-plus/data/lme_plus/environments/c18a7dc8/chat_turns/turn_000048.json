  "content": "That's great that you were able to be there for your sister as the maid of honor! I'm sure she appreciated having you by her side on her special day.\n\nIt's interesting that you met Alex at the bachelor party and have been keeping in touch since then. It sounds like there might be some potential there! But, of course, you're also considering Ryan, and it's good that you're taking things slow and getting to know both of them.\n\nBrunch sounds like a great idea for a date with Ryan. It's a casual, low-key setting that allows for good conversation and getting to know each other better. Just remember to be yourself, relax, and have fun! If it's meant to be, things will fall into place naturally.\n\nDo you have a sense of what you're looking for in a partner or relationship? Are there any specific qualities or characteristics that you're drawn to in both Ryan and Alex?",
