  "content": "The passage describes the limits of economy of material in frame structures, which refers to finding the minimum amount of material needed to sustain a given set of forces while ensuring the structure remains stable and secure.\n\nMaxwell's equation (1) is presented as a starting point for determining these limits. The equation states that the sum of the tensions in all the tie-bars and the sum of the thrusts in all the struts of a given frame under a given system of applied forces is equal to a function (C) of the forces and the coordinates of their points of application. This function is independent of the form of the frame.\n\nFrom this equation, the author explains that it is possible to find the lower limits of material necessary to sustain given forces, and also identify the frame forms that achieve the limit of economy.\n\nThe author then introduces a constraint on the maximum allowable stress in the material used in the frame. If the greatest tensile stress allowable is P and the greatest compressive stress allowable is Q, then the least volume of material required to ensure the frame is secure is given by equation (2). This equation sets a limit on the minimum amount of material that must be used to ensure the frame can sustain the given forces while staying within the stress limits of the material.",
