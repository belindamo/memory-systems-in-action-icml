It's indeed a classic and a great way to break the ice and have some fun.\n\nRegarding Alex, it's great that you met at the club and had a good time together! However, I have to clarify again that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't actually see you at the club. But I'm happy to help you plan your dinner party and make it a success!\n\nIf you're considering inviting Alex, that's perfectly fine! Just make sure to keep your guest list manageable and ensure that everyone gets along well. You might want to reach out to Alex and see if they're available and interested in attending.\n\nNow, let's finalize the details for your dinner party. What's the theme, if any? Are you planning any decorations or music to set the mood?",
