      "content": "Making Connection: The Therapeutic Relationship\nDifferentiation and the Emotional Being of the Therapist\nMore than in any other family therapy approach, in intergenerational therapy the therapist\u2019s level of differentiation (Bowen, 1985; Kerr & Bowen, 1988) and emotional being (Friedman, 1991) are central to the change process. Intergenerational therapists focus on developing a therapeutic relationship that encourages all parties to further their differentiation process: \u201cthe differentiation of the therapist is technique\u201d (Friedman, 1991, p. 138; italics in original). Intergenerational therapists believe that clients can only differentiate as much as their therapists have differentiated (Bowen, 1985). For this reason, the therapist\u2019s level of differentiation is often the focus of supervision early in training, and therapists are expected to continually monitor and develop themselves so that they can be of maximum assistance to their clients. Bowen therapists assert that the theory cannot be learned through books (such as this one) but can only be learned through a relationship with a supervisor or teacher who uses these ideas to interact with the student (Friedman, 1991).\n\nA Nonanxious Presence\nThe greater a therapist\u2019s level of differentiation, the more the therapist can maintain a nonanxious presence with clients (Kerr & Bowen, 1988). This is not a cold, detached stance but rather an emotionally engaged stance that is nonreactive, meaning that the therapist does not react to attacks, \u201cbad\u201d news, and so forth without careful reflection. The therapist does not rush in to rescue clients from anxiety every time they feel overwhelmed by anger, sadness, or another strong emotion; instead, the therapist calmly wades right into the muck the client is trying to avoid and guides the client through the process of separating self from other and thought from feelings (Friedman, 1991). The therapist\u2019s calm center is used to help clients move through the differentiation process in a safe, contained environment in which differentiation is modeled. When clients are upset, the \u201ceasiest\u201d thing to do is to soothe and calm their anxieties, fears, and strong emotions; this makes everyone calmer sooner, but nothing is learned. The intergenerational therapist instead shepherds a more difficult process of slowly coaching clients through that which they fear or detest in order to facilitate growth. For example, in the case study at the end of the chapter, the therapist uses nonanxious presence to help the family learn new ways to negotiate the constant conflict between the mother and teenage daughter."
