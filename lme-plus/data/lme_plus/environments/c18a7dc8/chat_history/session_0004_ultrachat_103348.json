    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, property managers are required to follow every rule and regulation that applies to their operation. Breaking any of these rules or regulations can lead to legal action from tenants or local authorities, which can result in hefty fines or even a loss of their license as a property manager. Property managers have a fiduciary responsibility to their clients to protect their property and follow all applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, violating any of these rules or regulations may have consequences for the landlord or property owner, as they are ultimately responsible for the conduct of their property manager. Therefore, it is essential that property managers strictly adhere to all necessary rules and regulations."
