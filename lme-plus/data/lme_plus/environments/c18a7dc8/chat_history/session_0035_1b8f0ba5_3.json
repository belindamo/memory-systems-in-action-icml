Consider durability, ease of cleaning, and your home's aesthetic.\n3. **Installation**: Decide whether you prefer a door that can be installed in a door, wall, or window.\n4. **Security**: If you have concerns about other animals entering your home, look for doors with security features like magnetic locks or adjustable flaps.\n5. **Ease of use**: Opt for a door with a simple, intuitive design that Luna can easily use.\n\nHere are some popular pet door options for kittens:\n\n1. **PetSafe Freedom Aluminum Pet Door**: A popular, affordable option with a durable aluminum frame and adjustable flap.\n2. **PlexiDor Pet Door**: A well-regarded, high-quality option with a sturdy frame and easy-to-clean design.\n3. **Ideal Pet Products Deluxe Pet Door**: A versatile door that can be installed in doors, walls, or windows, with a lockout slide for added security.\n4. **PetSafe Sliding Glass Pet Door**: A great option for sliding glass doors, with a sturdy frame and easy installation.\n5. **Hale Pet Door**: A high-end option with a durable, rust-resistant frame and advanced security features.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider reading reviews and consulting with your veterinarian or a pet supply expert to ensure you're getting the best pet door for Luna's needs.\n\nRemember to always supervise Luna when introducing her to the new pet door to ensure her safety and comfort."
