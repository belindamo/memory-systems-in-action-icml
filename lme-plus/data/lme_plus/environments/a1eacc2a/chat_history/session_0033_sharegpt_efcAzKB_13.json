Leave request cancellation notifications: The system should send notifications to employees and managers when leave requests are cancelled.\n4. Leave request reminder notifications: The system should send reminders to employees and managers about upcoming leave requests.\n5. Leave request approval history: The system should maintain a record of all leave request approvals and denials, including the reason for the decision.\n6. Leave request feedback: The system should allow employees to provide feedback on their leave experience, including the approval process and any issues that arose during the leave.\n7. Leave request reporting: The system should have reporting capabilities that allow managers to view leave request data in various formats, such as graphs, charts, or tables.\n8. Leave request data export: The system should allow for the export of leave request data to other formats, such as CSV or Excel.\n9. Leave request data import: The system should allow for the import of leave request data from other sources, such as legacy systems or spreadsheets.\n10. Leave request integration with payroll: The system should be able to integrate with payroll systems to ensure that leave is accurately reflected in employee pay."
