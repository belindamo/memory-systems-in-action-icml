  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can tell you that distance runners do not necessarily have to avoid any specific foods or food groups. However, they may need to limit or moderate their consumption of certain foods that may negatively impact their performance, such as high-fat, high-fiber, or high-protein foods that take longer to digest, causing digestive distress during exercise. Additionally, some runners may have specific food intolerances or sensitivities that they need to avoid. It is generally recommended that distance runners consume a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods to meet their nutritional needs and support optimal performance.",
