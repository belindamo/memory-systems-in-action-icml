  "content": "A 6-coaster set with different stitch patterns and colors is a great way to showcase your skills and offer a unique product.\n\nIncluding a small care instructions card with the set is an excellent idea! Here's why:\n\n1. **Customer appreciation:** Providing care instructions shows you care about the customer's experience and want to ensure they can enjoy their coasters for a long time.\n2. **Adds value:** A care instructions card can add a touch of professionalism and increase the perceived value of your product.\n3. **Reduces returns:** By providing clear care instructions, you can minimize the risk of customers damaging their coasters due to improper care, which can lead to returns or negative reviews.\n4. **Educational opportunity:** You can use the care instructions card to educate customers about the benefits of handmade crochet items, the materials used, and the process involved in creating them.\n\nKeep the care instructions card simple, concise, and easy to read. You can include information such as:\n\n* Washing instructions (e.g., hand wash, cold water, gentle cycle)\n* Drying instructions (e.g., air dry, avoid direct sunlight)\n* Storage tips (e.g., store flat, avoid folding or creasing)\n* Any special considerations (e.g., avoid exposure to heat, chemicals, or pets)\n\nYou can also use the care instructions card as an opportunity to:\n\n* Provide your brand's contact information and social media handles\n* Offer tips on how to maintain the coasters' appearance or extend their lifespan\n* Suggest ways to style or use the coasters (e.g., as a decorative accent or as a gift)\n\nRemember to keep the card small and unobtrusive, so it doesn't add bulk to the packaging. A 2x3 inch or 3x4 inch card should be sufficient.\n\nPricing your 6-coaster set at $30 seems reasonable, considering the time, materials, and effort you'll put into each coaster. Good luck with your sales, and I hope your customers appreciate the extra touch of including a care instructions card!",
