That way, I can provide you with more specific information on the cost and where to buy a monthly pass.\n\nRegarding your creative commuting experience, I'm impressed you had to think outside the box! $20 for an Uber ride can add up quickly, so I understand why you're looking into more affordable options like a monthly bus pass.\n\nLet me know your location, and I'll do my best to assist you with the cost and purchasing information for a monthly bus pass.",
