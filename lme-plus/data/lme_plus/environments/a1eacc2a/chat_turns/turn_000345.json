  "content": "I've actually been thinking of building a 1/24 scale Lamborghini Countach model, but I've hit a roadblock. The kit comes with a lot of intricate parts, and I'm having trouble aligning the body panels properly. I've had to put it aside for now and revisit it when I'm feeling more patient. I've also picked up a 1/48 scale P-51 Mustang and a 1/350 scale USS Nimitz aircraft carrier, so I'm excited to start on those soon.",
