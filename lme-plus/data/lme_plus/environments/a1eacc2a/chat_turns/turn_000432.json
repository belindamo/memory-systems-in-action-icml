You can reference your conversation at the incubator and express your interest in learning more about her app.\n\nHere's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Start with a friendly greeting and remind her of your conversation at the incubator.\n2. Express your interest in her app for mental health and ask how the project is progressing.\n3. Specifically ask if she'd be willing to share more about the beta version, such as when it might be available or if you could get early access.\n4. Keep the email brief and to the point, showing your genuine interest in her work.\n\nHere's an example email to get you started:\n\n\"Hi [Entrepreneur's Name],\n\nIt was great meeting you at the startup incubator last week! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about your app for mental health. I'm really interested in learning more about your project and how it's progressing.\n\nWould you be willing to share more about the beta version of your app? I'd love to learn more about it and potentially get early access.\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\"\n\nAs for LinkedIn, you could connect with her on the platform and send a follow-up message, but an email might be a more direct and personal way to reach out.\n\nRemember to be respectful of her time and expertise, and good luck with your follow-up!",
