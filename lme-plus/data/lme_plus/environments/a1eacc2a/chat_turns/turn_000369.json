  "content": "That's great! Having a room with a good view can definitely make a big difference in your stay.\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't know you stayed at the Marriott before. But I'm happy to help you with your current trip planning!\n\nThe 95th floor of the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is definitely a must-visit for its breathtaking views of the city. On a clear day, you can see up to four states from the Skydeck Chicago observation deck. It's an exhilarating experience, especially if you're not afraid of heights!\n\nAfter visiting the Skydeck, you might want to take a stroll along the Chicago Riverwalk, which is nearby. The Riverwalk offers beautiful views of the city's architecture and the Chicago River. You can also take an architecture river cruise to learn more about the city's rich history and iconic buildings.\n\nRemember to check the Skydeck Chicago website for any updates on operating hours, ticket prices, and special events before you go. Enjoy your visit!",
