City center is a bit vague, as it could refer to any city in the world.\n\nCould you please tell me the name of your city or the transit agency that operates the buses in your area? For example, are you in New York City (MTA), San Francisco (Muni), Chicago (CTA), or somewhere else?\n\nOnce I know the specific city or transit agency, I can provide you with information on the cost of a monthly bus pass and where to buy one.\n\n(And I'm curious, what's been going on with your commute that's required you to get creative?)",
