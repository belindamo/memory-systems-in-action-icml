  "content": "I'm thinking of creating a worn, battle-hardened look for my P-51 Mustang, similar to what you'd see on a plane that's been in combat for a while. I want to capture the subtle signs of wear and tear, like chipped paint, oil stains, and exhaust stains. I've seen some great examples of weathered Mustangs online, and I'm hoping to achieve a similar look with my model.\n\nI've also been considering adding some subtle rust effects to the model, particularly around the rivets and panel lines. I've heard that rust can be a challenging effect to achieve, but I think it would really add to the overall weathered look of the plane.\n\nDo you have any tips or recommendations for creating realistic rust effects on a model? I've seen some tutorials that use rust-colored paint or pigments, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.",
