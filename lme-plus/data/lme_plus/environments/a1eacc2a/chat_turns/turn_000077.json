It's always exciting to start fresh with a new space.\n\nChoosing the right yarn and hook size for a Granny Square blanket can make a big difference in the final result. Here are some tips for a beginner like you:\n\n**Yarn:**\n\n1. **Fiber content:** Acrylic, cotton, or blends are great choices for a Granny Square blanket. They're soft, easy to care for, and come in a wide range of colors.\n2. **Weight:** Choose a medium-weight yarn (4) or a worsted-weight yarn (3). These will provide a good balance between softness and durability.\n3. **Color:** Select yarns that complement each other. You can choose a single color, a few coordinating colors, or go for a scrappy look with many different colors.\n4. **Yarn label:** Check the yarn label for the recommended hook size and gauge (tension). This will give you an idea of how the yarn will behave.\n\n**Hook:**\n\n1. **Hook material:** Aluminum or steel hooks are good choices for Granny Squares. They're durable and easy to maneuver.\n2. **Hook size:** Choose a hook that feels comfortable in your hand. For a Granny Square blanket, a size J (6.0mm) or K (6.5mm) hook is a good starting point.\n3. **Hook size and yarn weight:** As a general rule, use a larger hook with thicker yarns and a smaller hook with thinner yarns.\n\n**Other tips:**\n\n1. **Swatch:** Always make a swatch before starting your project. This will help you gauge your tension and ensure your squares will be the right size.\n2. **Consistency:** Try to maintain a consistent tension while crocheting to ensure your squares are even.\n3. **Yarn usage:** Granny Squares can be yarn-heavy, so make sure you have enough yarn for the entire project. You can estimate the yarn usage based on the size of your squares and the number of squares you plan to make.\n\nFor a beginner-friendly Granny Square pattern, I recommend starting with a simple recipe like the Classic Granny Square. You can find many free tutorials and patterns online, or use a crochet app like Moogly or The Crochet Crowd.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and be patient with yourself. Don't hesitate to ask for help or advice if you need it. Good luck, and I hope your niece loves the blanket!",
