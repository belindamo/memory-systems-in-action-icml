  "content": "Here is an example of how you might create the tables for a comprehensive leave management system using SQL:\n```\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  first_name VARCHAR(255),\n  last_name VARCHAR(255),\n  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,\n  manager_id INTEGER,\n  FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(id)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE leave_policies (\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  name VARCHAR(255),\n  description TEXT,\n  entitlements INTEGER,\n  carryover INTEGER,\n  accrual_rate FLOAT\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE leave_requests (\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  employee_id INTEGER,\n  start_date DATE,\n  end_date DATE,\n  type VARCHAR(255),\n  status VARCHAR(255),\n  notes TEXT,\n  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE leave_balances (\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  employee_id INTEGER,\n  policy_id INTEGER,\n  balance INTEGER,\n  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id),\n  FOREIGN KEY (policy_id) REFERENCES leave_policies(id)\n);\n```\nThis example creates four tables:\n\n* The `employees` table stores information about each employee, including their name, email address, and manager.\n* The `leave_policies` table stores information about the leave policies that are available to employees, including the entitlements and carryover rules for each policy.\n* The `leave_requests` table stores information about leave requests made by employees, including the start and end dates, type of leave, and current status of the request.\n* The `leave_balances` table stores information about the leave balances for each employee, including the policy that applies to their leave and their current balance.\n\nYou would then need to create additional SQL queries to insert, update, and delete data in these tables, as well as to retrieve data for various purposes such as reporting or notifications.",
