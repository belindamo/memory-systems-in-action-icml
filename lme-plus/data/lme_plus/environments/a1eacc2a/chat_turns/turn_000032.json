  "content": "That's a great idea! I've been experimenting with different types of curry powder in my cooking lately, and I think it could add a really interesting depth to the filling. I'll definitely try adding a small amount of Madras curry powder to the saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic to see how it turns out.
