Which city are you looking to attend a design conference in?\n2. What type of design are you interested in (e.g. graphic design, UX/UI, product design, architecture, etc.)?\n3. Are you looking for a specific format (e.g. conference, workshop, meetup, etc.)?\n4. Are there any specific dates or time frames you're looking to attend an event?\n5. What's your budget for the event?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized recommendations for upcoming design conferences in your desired city!\n\n(And that's a great connection you made with the journalist, by the way!)",
