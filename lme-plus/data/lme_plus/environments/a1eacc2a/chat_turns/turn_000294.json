I'm happy to help you optimize your daily commute and find a seat on those busy Mondays and Fridays.\n\nHere are some suggestions to increase your chances of getting a seat on crowded days:\n\n1. **Arrive earlier**: Try arriving at the station 10-15 minutes before the 7:15 AM train to grab a spot in the queue. This might give you a better chance of getting a seat, especially if you're familiar with the platform layout and can position yourself near the train doors.\n2. **Choose a different carriage**: If you notice that a particular carriage is always more crowded than others, try boarding a different one. You might find that some carriages are less popular or have more available seats.\n3. **Avoid peak boarding points**: If possible, try boarding the train at a station that's not as busy. For example, if you're traveling from a suburban area, you might find that boarding at a smaller station before the train reaches the city center will give you a better chance of getting a seat.\n4. **Be prepared to move quickly**: When the train doors open, be ready to move quickly to find an available seat. Keep your belongings organized and easily accessible to minimize delays.\n5. **Consider a seat-finding strategy**: Observe the train layout and identify areas that tend to be less crowded, such as near the quiet cars or closer to the ends of the train. Develop a strategy to target these areas when searching for a seat.\n6. **Look into alternative transportation options**: If the crowds are really bothering you, you might want to explore alternative transportation methods, such as bus, bike, or carpooling, even if it's just for Mondays and Fridays.\n7. **Be flexible with your schedule**: If possible, consider adjusting your work schedule or flexible hours to avoid peak commute times.\n8. **Take advantage of train operator apps**: Many train operators have apps that provide real-time information on train occupancy and crowding. Use these apps to plan your commute and make informed decisions about which train to take.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you navigate the busy Monday and Friday commutes and find a seat more easily. Enjoy your daily reads, and I'm glad to hear you enjoyed \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"!",
