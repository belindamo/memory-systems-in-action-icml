I've heard that the 1/48 scale kit is a great representation of the real thing, and I'm looking forward to adding it to my collection. Plus, I've been wanting to try out some new weathering techniques on a aircraft model, and the Mustang's worn, battle-hardened look will be a great opportunity to practice those skills.",
