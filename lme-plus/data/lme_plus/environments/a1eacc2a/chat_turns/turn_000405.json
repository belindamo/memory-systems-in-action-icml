I mean, I know it's going to be tough, but I've been working hard and I'm confident in my abilities. Speaking of my old Nikes, I finally retired them after a particularly grueling 10K I did three Sundays ago, and it's made me realize how far I've come. I've also been trying to visualize myself crossing the finish line, feeling strong and proud of my accomplishment. Do you have any other tips for staying mentally tough during training and on race day?",
