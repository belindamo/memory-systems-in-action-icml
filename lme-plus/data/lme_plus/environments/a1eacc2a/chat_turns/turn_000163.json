I'd love to get my adrenaline fix with some jet boating or white water rafting, but I also want to take some time to relax and enjoy the scenery. A scenic boat tour or a leisurely cruise sounds like a great way to unwind and take in the beauty of Queenstown.\n\nBy the way, have you got any recommendations for some good restaurants in Queenstown? I'm looking for some local cuisine and maybe some places that serve some decent seafood?",
