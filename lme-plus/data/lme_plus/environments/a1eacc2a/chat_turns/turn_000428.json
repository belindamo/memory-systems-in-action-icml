It sounds like you're having a great experience at the startup incubator, meeting interesting people and making valuable connections.\n\nThe journalist's story about the startup ecosystem could be a great opportunity for you to learn more about the local startup scene and potentially even get involved in the story. You could reach out to her and ask if she'd be willing to share more about her story or if she needs any help with research or connections.\n\nAnd wow, the entrepreneur's app for mental health sounds fascinating! Mental health is such an important topic, and it's great to see startups tackling this issue. You could try to follow up with the entrepreneur and ask more about their app, their vision, and how they're approaching this complex issue.\n\nThese connections could lead to some great opportunities, whether it's learning more about the startup ecosystem, exploring the intersection of design and mental health, or even potential collaborations or projects.\n\nRemember to stay curious, ask open-ended questions, and be respectful of people's time and expertise. Who knows what might come out of these connections?",
