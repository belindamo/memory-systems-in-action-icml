  "content": "As an AI language model, I can offer some tips on what to eat before running that will provide enough energy without making you feel too full. Try to aim for carbohydrates that are easy to digest, such as:\n\n1. Bananas: Bananas are an excellent source of easily-digested carbohydrates and potassium, which help regulate fluid balance.\n\n2. Toast with jam or honey: Toast provides simple carbohydrates, and topping it with jam or honey adds some extra energy.\n\n3. Smoothies: Smoothies made with fruit, yogurt, and milk or a non-dairy alternative can provide carbohydrates and protein in an easily-digestible form.\n\n4. Energy bars: Energy bars that are low in fiber and high in carbohydrates can provide a quick source of energy without feeling too heavy.\n\n5. Half a bagel with peanut butter: Bagels provide carbohydrates, and peanut butter provides protein and healthy fats.\n\nRemember to consume your pre-run meal at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before exercise to allow time for digestion. It is also crucial to listen to your body and experiment with different foods to find what works best for you.",
