Enjoying a warm cup of coffee at Glacier Point while taking in the sunrise views will be a perfect way to reward yourself after the hike.\n\nRegarding the elevation gain and steep inclines, the Four Mile Trail to Glacier Point is indeed similar to the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls in terms of steepness and elevation gain. Both trails are considered strenuous and require a good level of physical fitness.\n\nHere's a comparison of the two trails:\n\n* **Elevation Gain:**\n\t+ Four Mile Trail to Glacier Point: 3,200 feet over 4.8 miles (average elevation gain per mile: 667 feet)\n\t+ Mist Trail to Vernal Falls: 2,000 feet over 3 miles (average elevation gain per mile: 667 feet)\n* **Steepness:**\n\t+ Both trails have steep sections, with the Four Mile Trail being more consistent in its steepness, while the Mist Trail has shorter, steeper sections.\n* **Distance:**\n\t+ Four Mile Trail to Glacier Point: 9.6 miles round-trip\n\t+ Mist Trail to Vernal Falls: 13 miles round-trip (including the return journey)\n\nWhile the Four Mile Trail is shorter in distance, its elevation gain is more consistent and steep, making it a challenging hike. However, since you've already completed the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls, you should be well-prepared for the Four Mile Trail.\n\nKeep in mind that the Four Mile Trail is a more exposed trail, with fewer trees and more rocky terrain, which can make it feel more challenging. Additionally, the trail is narrower and steeper in some sections, which may require more caution and attention.\n\nOverall, your previous experience on the Mist Trail will definitely help you prepare for the Four Mile Trail, but be sure to pace yourself, take regular breaks, and stay hydrated to ensure a safe and enjoyable hike.",
