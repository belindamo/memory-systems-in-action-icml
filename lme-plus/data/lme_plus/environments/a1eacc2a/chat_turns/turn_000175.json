It adds a whole new level of magic to the library and could create some really interesting interactions between the protagonist and the books. I'm imagining the books could be whispering secrets or offering cryptic advice, like you mentioned. Maybe they could even have their own personalities or motivations, which could lead to some intriguing conflicts or alliances.\n\nWhat do you think about the protagonist's relationship with the books? Should they be able to communicate with them directly, or would it be more of a subtle, intuitive connection?",
