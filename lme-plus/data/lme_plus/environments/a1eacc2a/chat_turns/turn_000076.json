  "content": "I love those ideas, especially the afghan blankets and granny square blankets. I've been meaning to make a blanket for my niece's birthday, and I think I have enough yarn in my stash to make a granny square one. By the way, I just organized my craft room three weeks ago and got rid of a lot of old supplies, so I'm excited to dive into some new projects with my newly organized space. Do you have any tips for a beginner like me on how to choose the right yarn and hook size for a granny square blanket?",
