  "content": "In order to calculate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) from the raw data, the following steps were taken:\n\n1. The first step is to calculate the transmittance of the radiation for each angle/measurement of B readings using the average of the two A reading as the reference above the canopy. This is done by taking the natural logarithm (LN) of the ratio of the B reading to the average A reading, and then averaging the log values.\n2. Then, the negative natural logarithm (LN) of the transmittance is taken, resulting in the LAI estimate.\n3. The final step is to divide the LAI estimate by the coefficient of shape (G) and the cosine of the angle of incidence. This correction is required as the radiation is being measured at different angles.\n\nIt is worth noting that the coefficient of shape (G) is a correction factor for leaf angle distribution. It is set to 0.5 for random leaf angle distribution.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the natural logarithm (ln) is used in this process instead of the common logarithm (log) because the latter only works on numbers greater than 0, while the former works on any positive number.\n\nIn order to implement this process in excel:\n\n1. In the first cell of the range you want to apply it to, use the formula =EXP(AVERAGE(LN(D11),LN(D22))) to calculate the average transmittance.\n2. Then use",
