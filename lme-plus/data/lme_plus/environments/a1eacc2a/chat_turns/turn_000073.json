Here are some tips to help you decide:\n\n**Fixed Amount vs. Percentage of Income:**\n\n1. **Fixed Amount**: Contributing a fixed amount to each IRA can help you stick to your savings plan and make it easier to budget. For example, you could contribute $2,000 to a traditional IRA and $2,000 to a Roth IRA.\n2. **Percentage of Income**: Allocating a percentage of your income to each IRA can help you save a consistent portion of your income and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging. For example, you could contribute 10% of your income to a traditional IRA and 5% to a Roth IRA.\n\n**Consider Your Financial Goals:**\n\n1. **Retirement Goals**: If you have a specific retirement goal in mind, such as saving for a certain amount or income level, you may want to allocate a fixed amount to each IRA to reach that goal.\n2. **Tax Strategy**: If you're concerned about taxes in retirement, you may want to allocate a larger percentage of your income to a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth and withdrawals.\n3. **Current Financial Situation**: If you're struggling to save, you may want to start with a smaller percentage of your income and increase it over time as your income grows.\n\n**Factor in Your 401(k) Contributions:**\n\n1. **Take Advantage of Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize your employer matching, as this is essentially free money.\n2. **Consider the 10% Contribution**: Your 10% contribution to your company's 401(k) plan is a great start, but you may want to consider increasing it over time to take full advantage of the tax benefits and compound interest.\n3. **Integrate with IRA Contributions**: Consider your 401(k) contributions as part of your overall retirement savings strategy, and allocate your IRA contributions accordingly. For example, you could contribute 10% to your 401(k), 5% to a traditional IRA, and 5% to a Roth IRA.\n\n**Example Allocation:**\n\nHere's an example allocation strategy:\n\n* 10% of income to 401(k) plan\n* 5% of income to traditional IRA\n* 5% of income to Roth IRA\n\nThis allocation strategy takes advantage of employer matching, provides tax benefits through the traditional IRA, and offers tax-free growth and withdrawals through the Roth IRA. However, this is just an example, and you should consider your individual circumstances and goals when determining your allocation strategy.\n\nRemember to review and adjust your allocation strategy regularly to ensure you're on track to meet your retirement goals.",
