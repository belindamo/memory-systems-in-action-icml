That sounds like a fascinating and unique flavor combination! Lavender can add a beautiful floral and subtle sweetness to cocktails. I'm sure it was a hit at your dinner party.\n\n**Lavender in cocktails**\nLavender is a popular ingredient in mixology, and for good reason. It pairs well with a variety of spirits, including gin, vodka, and even whiskey. When used in moderation, lavender can add a subtle, sophisticated flavor to cocktails.\n\n**Tips for working with lavender in cocktails**\n\n* Start with a small amount: Lavender can be overpowering, so begin with a small amount (about 1/4 teaspoon of dried lavender buds or 1/2 teaspoon of lavender syrup per serving) and adjust to taste.\n* Infuse or syrup: You can infuse gin or other spirits with dried lavender buds for a few hours or days to create a lavender-infused spirit. Alternatively, make a lavender syrup by steeping dried lavender buds in water and sugar, then straining and mixing with water.\n* Balance with citrus: Lavender pairs well with citrus flavors, so try combining it with lemon, lime, or grapefruit juice to balance out the flavors.\n\nSome popular cocktails that feature lavender include the Lavender Gin Fizz, Lavender Collins, and Lavender Sour. Feel free to experiment and come up with your own creations!\n\nWhat inspired you to try the lavender gin fizz, and what was the recipe you used? I'd love to hear more about it!",
