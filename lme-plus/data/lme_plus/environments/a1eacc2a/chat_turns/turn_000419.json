I've heard good things about it, and it seems like it can provide me with real-time information on public transportation and help me find the most efficient route. Plus, I can use it to track my walk from the bus stop to my office and see how much time I can save. By the way, I've been trying to get more exercise, so I'm hoping this will also encourage me to walk more and take the bus less.",
