  "content": "1. I calculated the average of the natural logarithm of the reference readings (A) and stored the result in a new cell.\n2. I calculated the transmittance for each angle by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of the measurement below the canopy (B) to the average of the reference readings. This is done for each angle.\n3. I calculated the LAI by multiplying the average of the transmittance for each angle by the factor -0.5\\*cos(angle) and summing the result for all angles. The factor of 0.5 is a correction factor for the geometry of the leaves, assuming a random distribution of leaf angles.\n4. I plotted the LAI as a function of angle to visualize the results.\n5. The fact that the values are not the same for all angles indicates that the transmittance and thus the LAI varies with the angle of incidence of the radiation.\n6. The difference between the two sets of measurements indicates that the LAI estimates obtained from the data is not constant across the canopy or the measurement positions.",
