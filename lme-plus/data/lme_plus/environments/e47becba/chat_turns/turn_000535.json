This will help you avoid buying unnecessary items and reduce food waste.\n3. **Shop sales**: Check the weekly ads for your local grocery stores and plan your shopping trip around the items that are on sale. Stock up on non-perishable items when they're at their cheapest.\n4. **Buy in bulk**: Purchasing items like rice, pasta, and canned goods in bulk can save you money in the long run. Just make sure you have enough storage space and that the items won't expire before you can use them.\n5. **Use coupons**: Clip coupons from the Sunday paper or look for digital coupons on store websites or apps.
