They usually have a finger on the pulse of what's happening in the community and can provide valuable insights and guidance.\n\nYes, it's likely that they would have information about other upcoming events in the area, including the Holiday Market in December. They might even have a calendar of events or a brochure that lists all the major events happening in the area throughout the year.\n\nWhen you contact them, don't hesitate to ask about:\n\n* The International Market: Ask about the date, time, location, and registration process for vendors. Also, ask about the types of products that are typically sold at the market and if there are any specific rules or regulations you need to follow.\n* The Holiday Market: Ask about the date, time, location, and registration process for vendors. You can also ask about the types of products that are typically sold at the market and if there are any special themes or focuses for the event.\n* Other events: Ask about other events happening in the area that might be of interest to you, such as festivals, parades, or other markets. You can also ask about any events that might be specifically geared towards local artisans or small businesses.\n\nRemember to also ask about any deadlines or important dates you need to keep in mind, such as application deadlines or setup and teardown times for the events.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get the information you need to plan your participation in these events!",
