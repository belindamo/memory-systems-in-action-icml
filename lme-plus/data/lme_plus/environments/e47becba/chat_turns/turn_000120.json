However, I have to break it to you that there is no band called \"The Electric Storm\" that I'm aware of, and it's possible that you might be thinking of a different band.\n\nIf you can provide me with more information about the band you saw, such as their genre, sound, or any notable songs they played, I'd be happy to try and help you find similar bands. Alternatively, you can also try checking the lineup of the Music Festival at the Outdoors Pavilion to see if you can find the correct name of the band you're thinking of.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for some general recommendations for bands that might fit the vibe of an outdoor music festival, I can suggest some popular bands across various genres:\n\n* Indie/Alternative: Arctic Monkeys, The Black Keys, Foo Fighters, The Strokes\n* Rock: Queens of the Stone Age, Royal Blood, Greta Van Fleet, Rival Sons\n* Electronic/Dance: Daft Punk, Justice, M83, The Chemical Brothers\n* Pop/Rock: Panic! At The Disco, Imagine Dragons, The 1975, Walk the Moon\n\nLet me know if any of these resonate with you, or if you have any more information about the band you're thinking of!",
