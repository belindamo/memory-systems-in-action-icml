However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or knowledge about your specific running shoes or the route you've chosen.\n\nAs a conversational AI, I can provide general advice and guidance, but I don't have access to specific information about your personal preferences, running style, or the terrain of your route.\n\nThat being said, if you've been enjoying your morning jogs in your new shoes and they've been comfortable and supportive, it's likely they'll continue to serve you well for your upcoming run. Just make sure to:\n\n1. **Check the terrain**: Ensure your shoes are suitable for the terrain you'll be running on. If you'll be running on trails or uneven surfaces, you might need shoes with more aggressive tread or better traction.\n2. **Consider the distance**: If you're planning a longer run, make sure your shoes are designed for longer distances and have sufficient cushioning and support.\n3. **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to your body and feet during the run. If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop and adjust your shoes or take a break.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to gradually introduce new shoes into your running routine to allow your feet to adapt. If you're unsure about your shoes or have concerns, consider consulting with a running specialist or a sports medicine professional.\n\nHave a great run, and I hope your new shoes continue to serve you well!",
