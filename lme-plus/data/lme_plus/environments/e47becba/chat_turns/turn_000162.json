  "content": "Three-point shooting consistency is crucial in today's NBA, and the Mavericks have indeed been inconsistent in that regard. When they're knocking down threes, they're a much more formidable offense, as it creates space for Luka to drive and operate.\n\nImproving their three-point shooting percentage will not only open up the floor for Luka but also make them a more well-rounded offense. It'll also put pressure on opposing defenses, making them think twice about doubling Luka or collapsing on the paint.\n\nThe Mavericks do have some capable three-point shooters in players like Reggie Bullock, Dorian Finney-Smith, and Tim Hardaway Jr. However, they need to find ways to get them more consistent looks and opportunities to get hot.\n\nOne potential solution could be to incorporate more movement and ball movement on offense, creating more open looks and driving opportunities. This would also help to free up Luka from double-teams and allow him to make plays off the dribble.\n\nDo you think the Mavericks should explore adding another three-point shooter or playmaker through trade or free agency to bolster their offense?",
