Your suggestion to try a more gradual approach to adjusting the wake-up time on non-yoga days is a great idea. It's always better to make small, achievable changes that can be sustained over time, rather than trying to make a drastic change that might not stick.\n\nBy waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day, you'll be able to gradually adjust to the new wake-up time and make it a habit. And, as you mentioned, it'll give you a sense of accomplishment as you work your way up to your goal.\n\nI think you're on the right track, and with a gradual approach, you'll be more likely to succeed in establishing a consistent wake-up time on your non-yoga days. Keep going, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further guidance or motivation!",
