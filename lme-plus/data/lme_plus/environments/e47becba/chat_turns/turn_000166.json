Here's a step-by-step guide on how to wash them effectively and banish the stink:\n\n**Before washing:**\n\n1. **Check the care label**: Make sure you follow the specific washing instructions provided by Nike. If you've lost the label, you can usually find the care instructions on the Nike website or the packaging.\n2. **Turn them inside out**: This helps protect the outer fabric and prevents pilling or snagging during washing.\n\n**Washing:**\n\n1. **Cold water**: Wash the socks in cold water (below 30\u00b0C or 86\u00b0F) to prevent shrinkage and color fading.\n2. **Mild detergent**: Use a mild detergent that's designed for washing activewear or sports gear. Avoid using harsh detergents, bleach, or fabric softener, as they can damage the fabric or affect its moisture-wicking properties.\n3. **Hand wash or gentle cycle**: Hand wash the socks or use a gentle wash cycle with a mesh laundry bag to protect them from snagging or tangling.\n4. **Avoid over-washing**: Wash the socks only when necessary, as excessive washing can cause them to lose their shape and performance.\n\n**Removing odor-causing bacteria:**\n\n1. **Add a 1/2 cup of white vinegar**: Vinegar is a natural odor-killer and helps balance the pH of the fabric. You can add it to the wash cycle or soak the socks in a vinegar solution (1 part vinegar to 2 parts water) for about an hour before washing.\n2. **Use a sports detergent with odor-fighting properties**: Look for detergents specifically designed to combat odor-causing bacteria in activewear.\n\n**Drying:**\n\n1. **Air dry or tumble dry on low**: To prevent shrinkage, it's best to air dry your socks or tumble dry them on a low heat setting. High heat can cause the fabric to degrade or lose its shape.\n2. **Do not wring or twist**: Gently remove excess water from the socks without wringing or twisting them, as this can cause stretching or distortion.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Wash your socks regularly**: Try to wash your socks every 3-5 wearings to prevent the buildup of bacteria and odor.\n2. **Store them properly**: When not in use, store your socks in a well-ventilated area or in a mesh bag to prevent moisture buildup.\n3. **Consider using an odor-controlling spray**: There are various products available that can help eliminate odors from your socks, such as baking soda-based sprays or specialized odor-controlling sprays.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to remove the smell from your Nike Dri-FIT socks and keep them fresh for your morning jogs in your new Asics Gel-Kayano shoes!",
