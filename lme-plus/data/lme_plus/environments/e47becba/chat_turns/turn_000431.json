  "content": "I'm interested in the International Market that's happening in our town next month. I'm not sure about the exact name, but I know it's a popular event that attracts a lot of visitors. I plan to sell my handmade crafts, like candles and soaps. By the way, I've been pretty busy with local markets and events lately - I attended the Farmers' Market at the town square just three weeks ago and had a great time.",
