Unfortunately, I'm still unable to find any information on a band called \"The Electric Storm\" or \"Whiskey Wanderers\" that matches your description. It's possible that they're a local or up-and-coming band that doesn't have a strong online presence yet.\n\nThat being said, I can try to help you find similar bands based on your description of their sound. A mix of classic rock and indie is a pretty broad genre, but here are a few bands that might fit the bill:\n\n* Classic Rock-inspired Indie Bands:\n\t+ Greta Van Fleet (as I mentioned earlier)\n\t+ Rival Sons\n\t+ The Black Keys (more blues-rock than classic rock, but similar energy)\n\t+ Royal Blood (high-energy rock duo)\n* Indie Bands with a Classic Rock Influence:\n\t+ Arctic Monkeys (more indie-rock than classic rock, but with a similar sound)\n\t+ The Strokes ( NYC-based indie rock with a classic rock influence)\n\t+ Foo Fighters (more mainstream rock, but with a strong indie influence)\n\t+ Kings of Leon (southern-tinged indie rock with a classic rock vibe)\n\nKeep in mind that these are just rough suggestions, and there are many other bands that might fit the bill. If you're still stuck on finding more information about The Electric Storm or Whiskey Wanderers, you might try searching social media or music blogs to see if anyone else has written about them.\n\nAlso, if you have a picture of the album artwork on your t-shirt, you could try sharing it online or with music enthusiast communities to see if anyone recognizes it!",
