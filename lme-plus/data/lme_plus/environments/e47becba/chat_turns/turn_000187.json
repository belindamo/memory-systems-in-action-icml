  "content": "You're already mirroring your yoga days by trying to wake up at a similar time on your non-yoga days. That's a great approach!\n\nSince you're aiming to wake up at 7:45 AM on your non-yoga days, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment to your approach. Instead of trying to wake up at 6:45 AM on your non-yoga days, why not try to wake up 15-30 minutes earlier each day and gradually work your way up to your desired wake-up time?\n\nThis will help you avoid feeling too abrupt of a change and make the transition smoother. Plus, it'll give you a sense of accomplishment as you gradually work your way up to your goal.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you willing to try a more gradual approach to adjusting your wake-up time on your non-yoga days?",
