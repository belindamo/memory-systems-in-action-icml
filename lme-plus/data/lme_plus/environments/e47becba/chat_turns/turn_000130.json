  "content": "I'm happy to help you with more recommendations! However, I have to reiterate that I couldn't find any information on a band called \"The Electric Storm\" that matches your description. It's possible that they're a local or up-and-coming band that doesn't have a strong online presence yet.\n\nThat being said, I can try to suggest more bands that blend classic rock and indie sounds. Here are a few additional recommendations:\n\n* The Black Keys (blues-rock with a strong indie influence)\n* Rival Sons (hard-hitting indie rock with classic rock elements)\n* Greta Van Fleet (young band with a strong classic rock sound, often compared to Led Zeppelin)\n* Foo Fighters (mainstream rock with a strong indie influence and classic rock roots)\n* Kings of Leon (southern-tinged indie rock with a classic rock vibe)\n* The White Stripes (garage rock with a strong blues and classic rock influence)\n* The Vines (Australian rock band with a mix of indie and classic rock elements)\n* The Hives (Swedish rock band with a blend of garage rock, indie, and classic rock)\n\nKeep in mind that these bands might not be an exact match to The Electric Storm (since I couldn't find any information on them), but they all share elements of classic rock and indie sounds.\n\nIf you're still stuck on finding more information about The Electric Storm, you could try searching social media or music blogs to see if anyone else has written about them. Alternatively, you could try reaching out to the merchandise booth or the festival organizers to see if they have any more information on the band.",
