  "content": "The craft stores you contact might have information on local suppliers for materials like wax, essential oils, or fragrances. They might even carry some of the supplies you need or be able to special order them for you.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try contacting local wholesale suppliers or distributors in your area to see if they sell to individual artisans or small businesses. You can search online for keywords like \"wholesale candle supplies near me\" or \"essential oil suppliers in [your city/town name]\" to find relevant results.\n\nAnother option is to reach out to other artisans or crafters in your network, like Rachel the jewelry maker, to ask about their suppliers or sources for materials. They might have some valuable recommendations or insights to share.\n\nYou can also consider joining local artisan or craft-related groups, online forums, or social media groups to connect with other crafters and ask about suppliers or resources. These communities can be a great way to network, share knowledge, and learn from others in the industry.\n\nRemember to always research and vet any potential suppliers to ensure they are reputable and meet your quality standards. It's also a good idea to compare prices, product offerings, and customer service before making a decision.",
