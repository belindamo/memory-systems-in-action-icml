  "content": "You're already experiencing the benefits of waking up earlier on your yoga days, and now you want to replicate that productivity on your non-yoga days. That's a great approach!\n\nSince you've already established a consistent wake-up time on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can use those days as a foundation to build upon. Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Mirror your yoga days**: Try to replicate your wake-up routine and morning habits on your non-yoga days. This means waking up at 6:45 AM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and following a similar morning routine that works for you.\n\nBy doing so, you'll be able to:\n\n1. **Consolidate your wake-up time**: You'll be waking up at the same time every day, which will help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to wake up in the morning.\n2. **Transfer your productivity**: You've noticed that you're more productive on your yoga days, so by mirroring your routine, you can apply that same productivity to your non-yoga days.\n3. **Create a sense of consistency**: Having a consistent wake-up time and morning routine will help you feel more structured and in control of your day.\n\nRemember, it might take some time for your body to adjust to the new wake-up time on your non-yoga days. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to give it a try and see how it goes?",
