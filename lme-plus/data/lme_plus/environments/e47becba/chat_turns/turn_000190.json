It's a great way to make sustainable changes to your wake-up time. Remember, it's all about making small, achievable adjustments that you can maintain over time.\n\nWaking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day will give your body a chance to adjust to the new wake-up time, and you'll be more likely to stick to it. Plus, you'll get to enjoy the benefits of having more time in the morning to focus on yourself, whether that's exercising, meditating, or simply enjoying a quiet cup of coffee.\n\nIf you need any more guidance or motivation, feel free to reach out. Otherwise, I'll be cheering you on from the sidelines as you work towards your goal of waking up at 7:45 AM on your non-yoga days!",
