This has led to greater access to these tools for people suffering from mental health issues.\n\n3. More holistic treatment: Mindfulness and meditation practices have encouraged a more holistic approach to mental health treatment, integrating physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.\n\n4. Increased focus on prevention: Mindfulness and meditation practices have also highlighted the importance of prevention in mental health.
