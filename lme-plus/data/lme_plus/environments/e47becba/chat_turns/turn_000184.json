Instead, set a series of small, achievable goals. For example, try waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day and gradually work your way up to your desired wake-up time.\n2. **Start with one day at a time**: Choose one non-yoga day to start with, and try waking up a little earlier than usual. Once you've successfully adjusted to the new wake-up time on that day, you can move on to the next day.\n3. **Use your yoga days as a reference point**: Since you're already waking up at 6:45 AM on yoga days, use those days as a reference point to gauge your progress. Try to get closer to that wake-up time on non-yoga days.\n4. **Establish a consistent sleep schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends. This will help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to wake up at the same time every day.\n5. **Create a wake-up routine**: Develop a consistent morning routine that signals to your body that it's time to wake up and start the day. This could be as simple as drinking a glass of water, stretching, or reading something inspiring.\n6. **Get some morning sunlight**: Exposure to natural light in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythms, making it easier to wake up. Open your curtains or take a short walk outside in the morning to get some sunlight.\n7. **Avoid snoozing**: Snoozing can make it harder to wake up and feel refreshed. Try to resist the temptation to hit the snooze button and get out of bed as soon as your alarm goes off.\n8. **Use a smart alarm**: Consider using a smart alarm that can monitor your sleep patterns and wake you up during a light sleep phase, making it easier to wake up feeling rested and refreshed.\n\nHere's an example of how you could gradually adjust your wake-up time on non-yoga days:\n\n* Monday (non-yoga day): Wake up at 8:15 AM\n* Tuesday (yoga day): Wake up at 6:45 AM\n* Wednesday (non-yoga day): Wake up at 8:00 AM\n* Thursday (yoga day): Wake up at 6:45 AM\n* Friday (non-yoga day): Wake up at 7:45 AM\n\nRemember, the key is to make small, incremental changes that you can sustain over time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results. It may take some time for your body to adjust to the new wake-up time, but with persistence and consistency, you'll get there!",
