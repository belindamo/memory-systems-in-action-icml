  "content": "The math problem that miners solve is called a \"hash function.\" A hash function is a mathematical equation that takes in a piece of data, like a Bitcoin transaction, and produces a unique output of a fixed length.\n\nMiners compete to solve this hash function by using their powerful computers to perform a series of calculations. They do this by trying different combinations of numbers until they find a solution that matches the required criteria. The first miner to solve the hash function gets to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain and receives a reward in the form of newly created bitcoins.\n\nSolving the hash function requires a lot of computational power and energy. As more miners join the network and competition increases, the difficulty of the hash function is adjusted so that it remains challenging and takes an average of 10 minutes to solve.\n\nThe mining process ensures that new bitcoins are introduced into the system at a steady rate, and it also helps to validate transactions and secure the network against fraudulent activity.",
