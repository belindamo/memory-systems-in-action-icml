While Altuve had a great postseason, that specific moment didn't happen.\n\nHowever, I'm thrilled to hear that you have fond memories of watching the game with your dad! Sharing sports moments with loved ones is a big part of the fun.\n\nIf you're interested, I can help you relive some of the actual highlights from the Astros' World Series run. We could talk about Jeremy Pe\u00f1a's clutch performances, Yordan Alvarez's towering home runs, or Cristian Javier's dominant outing in Game 4. Let me know!",
