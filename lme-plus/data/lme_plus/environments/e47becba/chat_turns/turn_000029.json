  "content": "To represent the intensity of the script provided, we can estimate the intensity levels during the bank heist and escape scenes. This example is based on a subjective interpretation of the action intensity in the script.\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example data: list of tuples (second, intensity)\naction_intensity_data = [\n    (0, 0),   # Calm before storm\n    (1, 5),   # Robbers enter bank\n    (2, 7),   # Joker speaks\n    (3, 8),   # Robbers collect money\n    (4, 8),   # Vault explosion\n    (5, 9),   # Getaway begins\n    (6, 10),  # High-speed chase\n    (7, 10),  # Fireworks diversion\n    (8, 5),   # Turn into hidden alley\n    (9, 2),   # Transfer to white van\n    (10, 1),  # Smoke bomb\n    (11, 0),  # Van escapes\n]\n\n# Create a pandas DataFrame from the list of tuples\naction_intensity_df = pd.DataFrame(action_intensity_data, columns=[\"Second\", \"Intensity\"])\n\n# Plot the action intensity data\nplt.plot(action_intensity_df[\"Second\"], action_intensity_df[\"Intensity\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"Time (seconds)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Action Intensity\")\nplt.title(\"Action Intensity vs Time\")\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code will create a graph plotting the intensity of the action in the scene over time, using the example data based on the provided script. Keep in mind that the intensity values are based on subjective interpretation and can be adjusted according to your perception of the script.",
