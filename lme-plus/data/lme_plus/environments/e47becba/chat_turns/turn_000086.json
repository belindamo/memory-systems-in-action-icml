  "content": "When a miner solves a hash function, they generate a unique output, called a \"hash.\" This hash is a digital fingerprint of the input data (such as a Bitcoin transaction) that the miner is trying to validate.\n\nTo know that they have solved the hash function correctly, miners need to compare the output hash they generated with the target hash. The target hash is a specific value that the Bitcoin protocol sets, which determines the level of difficulty for mining a new block.\n\nWhen a miner generates a hash that matches the target hash, it means that they have successfully solved the hash function. This is known as \"finding a block,\" and the miner who finds the block first broadcasts it to the entire Bitcoin network, along with the new transactions that they have validated.\n\nThe other miners in the network then verify the new block and its transactions, and if everything checks out, they add the block to their own copies of the blockchain. The miner who found the block is then rewarded with newly minted bitcoins, which incentivizes them to continue mining and validating transactions.",
