Instead of an explosion, several blocks away, fireworks shoot up into the sky, creating a spectacle that draws the attention of the police and bystanders alike.\n\n[EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY]\n\nWith the police momentarily distracted, the robbers make a sharp turn into a hidden alley.\n\n[INT. HIDDEN ALLEY - DAY]\n\nThe robbers abandon their getaway car and hastily transfer their bags into a nondescript white van. Joker throws a smoke bomb into the alley, creating a smokescreen.\n\n[INT. LT. HANNA'S CAR - DAY]\n\nLt. Hanna, unable to see through the thick smoke, stops his car and gets out.\n\n[EXT. HIDDEN ALLEY - DAY]\n\nAs the smoke begins to clear, Lt. Hanna walks cautiously into the alley, gun drawn. He discovers the abandoned getaway car, its engine still running.\n\nLt. Hanna: (into radio) The suspects have switched vehicles. I've lost visual. Notify all units to be on the lookout for a white van.\n\n[INT. WHITE VAN - DAY]\n\nThe Joker removes his mask, revealing a disturbing grin. He looks at Chris and Michael, who are still tense from the heist.\n\nJoker: (musing) You see, it's not just about the money. It's about sending a message. And today, we sent a message loud and clear. Chaos is inevitable, and I am its harbinger.\n\nChris and Michael exchange uneasy glances but say nothing.\n\n[EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY]\n\nThe white van merges back into traffic, blending in with the other vehicles as it drives away from the scene of the crime, leaving Lt. Hanna and the rest of the police force to sort through the chaos left behind.",
