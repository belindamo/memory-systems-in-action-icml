Banana: Bananas are a great pre-workout snack because they are rich in carbohydrates, which provide energy, and potassium, which can help prevent muscle cramps. 2. Greek yogurt: Greek yogurt is high in protein, which can help to prevent muscle breakdown during exercise. Choose a low-fat or non-fat option for a lower calorie snack. 3. Apple slices with almond butter: Apples are rich in carbohydrates, while almond butter provides healthy fats and protein. This combination can provide energy and help to prevent muscle breakdown during exercise. 4. Whole-grain toast with avocado: Whole-grain toast is a good source of carbohydrates, while avocado provides healthy fats that can help to sustain energy levels during exercise. 5. Hard-boiled eggs: Hard-boiled eggs are a good source of protein, which can help to prevent muscle breakdown during exercise. Remember to eat your snack at least 30 minutes to an hour before your workout to give your body time to digest and convert the nutrients into energy.",
