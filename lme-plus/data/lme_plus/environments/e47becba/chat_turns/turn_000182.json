Using the extra time to catch up on news, respond to emails, or do some light stretching is a great way to set yourself up for a productive day.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention having more energy on those days. Waking up earlier can definitely give you a natural energy boost, especially if you're getting some morning sunlight exposure. And, of course, the yoga classes themselves are probably contributing to that energy boost as well!\n\nNow that you've experienced the benefits of waking up earlier on your yoga days, you might find it easier to motivate yourself to continue the habit on the other days of the week. Remember, it's all about creating a routine that works for you and your lifestyle.\n\nHere are a few more suggestions to help you build on your progress:\n\n1. **Experiment with different morning activities**: While catching up on news, responding to emails, and doing light stretching are all great uses of your morning time, you might want to try some other activities to see what works best for you. This could be as simple as meditating, journaling, or reading a book.\n2. **Make a plan for your morning time**: Decide what you want to achieve in the morning and prioritize your tasks accordingly. This will help you make the most of your time and create a sense of accomplishment before you even start your workday.\n3. **Use technology to your advantage**: Set reminders, alarms, or even schedule your morning activities in your calendar to help you stay on track. You can also use apps like Habitica or HabitBull to track your progress and stay motivated.\n4. **Celebrate your wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue your morning routine.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Do you have any other questions or concerns about establishing a consistent wake-up routine?",
