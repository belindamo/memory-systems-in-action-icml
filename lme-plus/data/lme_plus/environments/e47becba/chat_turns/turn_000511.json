Ospreys are amazing birds, and it's great that you got to see them up close.\n\nAs for hummingbirds, it's possible to spot them near lakes and rivers, especially if there are flowering plants or trees nearby. However, hummingbirds are more commonly associated with gardens, feeders, and woodlands.\n\nThat being said, some species of hummingbirds can be found near lakes and rivers, particularly those that have aquatic plants or nearby vegetation. Here are a few species you might encounter:\n\n1. **Ruby-throated Hummingbird**: This is one of the most common hummingbird species in North America, and they can be found near lakes and rivers, especially if there are nearby flowers or feeders.\n2. **Rufous Hummingbird**: These hummingbirds are known to migrate through areas near lakes and rivers, especially during the summer months.\n3. **Calliope Hummingbird**: This species is less common, but they can be found near lakes and rivers in the western United States.\n\nTo increase your chances of spotting hummingbirds near the lake, look for areas with:\n\n* Flowering plants, such as trumpet-shaped flowers or red salvias\n* Nectar-rich feeders or hummingbird-friendly plants like honeysuckle or fuchsia\n* Nearby woodlands or shrubby areas with dense vegetation\n* Areas with insects, as hummingbirds feed on them to supplement their diet\n\nKeep in mind that hummingbirds are fast-moving and can be challenging to spot, so be patient and keep your eyes peeled!\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck on your upcoming trip!",
