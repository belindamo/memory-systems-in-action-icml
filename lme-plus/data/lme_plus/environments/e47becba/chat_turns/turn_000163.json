  "content": "I think that's a great idea. Adding a reliable three-point shooter or playmaker could take their offense to the next level. Someone who can stretch the floor and create their own shot would be a great asset, especially if they can play off Luka's strengths.\n\nThe Mavericks have some flexibility with their roster, so it's definitely possible they could make a move to address their needs. They could look to trade for a player like, say, a Bogdan Bogdanovic or a Mikal Bridges, who are both capable shooters and playmakers.\n\nAlternatively, they could try to sign a free agent like a Kyle Korver or a JJ Redick, who are both seasoned shooters with playoff experience. Either way, adding a piece like that could make a big difference in their playoff push.\n\nBy the way, have you been following the English Premier League at all? I've been trying to catch up on Manchester City's games, and they're looking strong this season.",
