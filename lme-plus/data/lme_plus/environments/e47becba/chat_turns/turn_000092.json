  "content": "Yes, the target hash is the same for every miner at a given time. This is possible because the target hash is a part of the Bitcoin protocol, and every node on the network follows the same set of rules and procedures.\n\nWhen a miner begins mining, they are trying to find a block hash that meets the target hash specified by the Bitcoin protocol. The target hash is a range of values, rather than a single value, and it's based on the current network difficulty, which is adjusted every 2016 blocks.\n\nAll miners on the network use the same target hash to compete with each other to solve the current block. Each miner generates a unique block hash by trying different combinations of numbers until they find one that meets the target hash.\n\nWhile the hash functions that miners solve are different for each attempt, they are all solving for the same target hash. This ensures that every miner on the network is competing on a level playing field, and that the protocol remains fair and secure for all participants.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is designed to be decentralized, so every node on the network is capable of verifying and validating transactions and blocks. This helps to ensure that the network is robust and resilient, and that the target hash is applied consistently across the entire network.",
