But it's great that you're acknowledging the impact it's had and wanting to get back on track.\n\nFirst of all, kudos to you for committing to that morning yoga class on Tuesdays and Thursdays! That's a great way to establish a consistent wake-up time, even if it's just a couple of days a week. And it's awesome that you've found it helpful.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to help you expand that consistency to the other days of the week:\n\n1. **Start small**: Don't try to wake up at 6:45 AM every day just yet. Instead, try setting a slightly more realistic goal, like waking up 15-30 minutes earlier each day. Gradually work your way up to your desired wake-up time.\n2. **Use your yoga days as anchors**: Since you're already waking up at 6:45 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, try to maintain a similar wake-up time on the days before and after those yoga days. This will help create a sense of continuity and make it easier to stick to your routine.\n3. **Identify your why**: Reflect on why you want to establish a consistent wake-up routine. Is it to have more time for yourself, get a head start on work, or simply feel more energized throughout the day? Reminding yourself of your motivations can help you stay committed.\n4. **Create a bedtime routine**: A consistent wake-up time is closely tied to a consistent bedtime routine. Try to establish a calming pre-sleep routine, like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. This will help signal to your body that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.\n5. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to have off days. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Instead, focus on getting back on track as soon as possible.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Do you have any other specific challenges or obstacles that are making it tough for you to establish a consistent wake-up routine?",
