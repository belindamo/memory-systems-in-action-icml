  "content": "The local tourism board might not have information about local classes or workshops, as their primary focus is on promoting tourism and events in the area. However, they might be able to point you in the right direction or provide recommendations on who to contact for that information.\n\nHere are a few suggestions on who you could contact to find out about local classes or workshops:\n\n* Local community colleges or universities: They often offer continuing education courses or workshops in various subjects, including crafts and art.\n* Craft stores or art supply stores: They sometimes offer classes or workshops on specific crafts or techniques.\n* Local art organizations or guilds: They might offer classes, workshops, or demonstrations on various art forms, including crafts.\n* Online event calendars or websites: Look for local event calendars or websites that list classes, workshops, or events related to crafts and art.\n\nYou can also try searching online for keywords like \"craft classes near me\" or \"art workshops in [your city/town name]\" to find relevant results.\n\nAdditionally, you can also ask other artisans or crafters in your network, like Rachel the jewelry maker, if they know of any good classes or workshops in the area. Word of mouth can be a great way to discover new resources and opportunities!\n\nRemember to also ask the tourism board about any other resources they might have for artisans, such as information on local suppliers, studios, or co-working spaces. They might have some valuable insights or connections that can help you grow your craft-making business.",
