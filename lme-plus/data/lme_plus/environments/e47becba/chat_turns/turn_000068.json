The user can click on the chart to set an alarm and display a draggable red line. If the line is within the y-range of the chart (i.e. within the minimum and maximum prices), an alarm message is displayed. Otherwise, the message is hidden.\n\nYou can adjust the appearance of the chart and the alarm message by modifying the options passed to the `go.Candlestick()` and `html.Div()` functions. For example, you can change the colors used for the up and down candlesticks, the color and style of the draggable line, and more.",
