Wake-up time: 7:30 am\n2. Get ready (40 minutes): 7:30 am - 8:10 am ( allocate more time for getting ready, including showering, dressing, and gathering belongings)\n3. Quick breakfast (5 minutes): 8:05 am - 8:10 am (grab a quick bite, like a granola bar or a piece of fruit, to hold you over until your meeting)\n4. Final preparations and head out the door: 8:10 am - 8:15 am\n5. Leave for work: 8:15 am (arriving 45 minutes before the meeting)\n\nBy allocating 40 minutes for getting ready, you should have enough time to get dressed, shower, and gather your belongings without feeling rushed. You can then quickly grab a small breakfast before heading out the door.\n\nRemember, this revised routine is all about finding a balance between getting ready, eating breakfast, and arriving at your meeting on time. If you need to make further adjustments, don't hesitate to experiment and find a rhythm that works best for you.",
