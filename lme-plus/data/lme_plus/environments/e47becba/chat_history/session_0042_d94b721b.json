Check online event calendars: Look up your town's website, local newspaper, or event calendars like Eventbrite or Facebook Events to see if they have a listing for the International Market you're interested in.\n2. Contact your local tourism board or chamber of commerce: They may have information about upcoming events in your area, including the International Market.\n3. Reach out to other vendors: Since you've participated in the Farmers' Market, you might know other vendors who have participated in the International Market. Ask them about their experience and if they can provide you with more information.\n4. Check social media: Look for social media pages or groups related to the International Market or local events in your town. You might find information about the event, including registration details and fees.\n\nOnce you find the correct information, you can usually expect to find the following steps to register as a vendor:\n\n1. Review the event's website or application form to ensure you meet the eligibility criteria.\n2. Fill out the application form, which may include providing information about your business, products, and insurance.\n3. Pay the registration fee, which can vary depending on the event and the type of vendor you are.\n4.

Some events may also charge additional fees for things like electricity, tables, or chairs.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck with your handmade crafts at the International Market!"
