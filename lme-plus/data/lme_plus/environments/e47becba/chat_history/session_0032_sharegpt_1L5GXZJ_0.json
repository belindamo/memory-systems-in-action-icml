We have a relationship where we make a lot of jokes and use extreme sarcasm. In addition we talk about sports wagers occasionally. I am worried this could be taken the wrong way by the people looking at his phone. \n\nCan you please write me a disclaimer that I will send via text message when we first open up communication again that will protect me legally from anything that could come up in the future? I want to be able to fall back on that message if joke or message is taken the wrong way by a third party. It will be sent to him, so it needs to be done in a way that is somewhat clever and not inherently obvious is it a legal disclaimer"
