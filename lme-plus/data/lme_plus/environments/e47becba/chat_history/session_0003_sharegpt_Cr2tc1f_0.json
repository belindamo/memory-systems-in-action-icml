BANK - DAY]\n\nJoker, Chris, Michael, and Waingro, all wearing clown masks, storm into the bank. Waingro waves his gun in the air, while Chris and Michael take out the security guards. The Joker calmly walks to the counter, a wide grin painted on his mask.\n\nJoker: (smiling) Ladies and gentlemen, today's your lucky day! We're here for your money, not your lives... unless, of course, you try to be a hero. So, let's make this quick and easy, shall we?\n\nThe bank employees and customers cower as the robbers begin their heist. Chris and Michael start collecting money from the cashiers, while Waingro watches the hostages.\n\n[EXT. BANK - DAY]\n\nLt. Vincent Hanna, a seasoned detective, is parked outside the bank, watching the scene unfold.\n\nLt. Hanna: (into radio) We've got a 211 in progress. Suspects are heavily armed and wearing clown masks. Requesting backup immediately.\n\n[INT. BANK - DAY]\n\nAs the Joker cracks open the vault, he looks around to make sure no one is watching.\n\nJoker: (whispering to himself) Why so serious? Let's put a smile on this vault.\n\nThe Joker uses a small explosive device to blow the vault door open. They gather the money and stuff it into large duffel bags.\n\nJoker: (to his crew) Time to go, boys. We've got a city to paint with chaos.\n\n[EXT. BANK - DAY]\n\nThe robbers exit the bank, duffel bags in hand, just as the police arrive. The Joker, Chris, and Michael get into their getaway car, while Waingro starts shooting at the police, causing panic.\n\nJoker: (irritated) Waingro, you trigger-happy fool! Get in the car!\n\nWaingro reluctantly stops shooting and jumps into the car.\n\n[INT. GETAWAY CAR - DAY]\n\nAs they speed away from the bank, Joker removes his mask and tosses it aside.\n\nJoker: (to Chris, while laughing manically) We did it, boys! Now, let's see if our dear Lieutenant can keep up with us.\n\nThe Joker leans out the window and fires a few shots at the pursuing police cars, causing them to swerve.\n\n[EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY]\n\nA high-speed chase ensues, with the robbers weaving in and out of traffic, narrowly avoiding collisions. Lt. Hanna, determined not to lose them, stays hot on their tail.\n\n[INT. GETAWAY CAR - DAY]\n\nJoker: (grinning) Time for a little diversion. Chris, take the wheel.\n\nThe Joker pulls out a remote control and presses a button, detonating a pre-planted explosion at a nearby construction site. The blast sends debris flying everywhere, creating chaos and blocking the police's path.\n\n[EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY]\n\nWith the police temporarily halted, the robbers make their escape, disappearing into the city.\n\n[INT. LT. HANNA'S CAR - DAY]\n\nLt. Hanna slams his fists on the steering wheel in frustration.\n\nLt. Hanna: (to himself) I'll get you, Joker. This isn't over.\n\nFADE OUT."

Instead of an explosion, several blocks away, fireworks shoot up into the sky, creating a spectacle that draws the attention of the police and bystanders alike.\n\n[EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY]\n\nWith the police momentarily distracted, the robbers make a sharp turn into a hidden alley.\n\n[INT. HIDDEN ALLEY - DAY]\n\nThe robbers abandon their getaway car and hastily transfer their bags into a nondescript white van. Joker throws a smoke bomb into the alley, creating a smokescreen.\n\n[INT. LT. HANNA'S CAR - DAY]\n\nLt. Hanna, unable to see through the thick smoke, stops his car and gets out.\n\n[EXT. HIDDEN ALLEY - DAY]\n\nAs the smoke begins to clear, Lt. Hanna walks cautiously into the alley, gun drawn. He discovers the abandoned getaway car, its engine still running.\n\nLt. Hanna: (into radio) The suspects have switched vehicles. I've lost visual. Notify all units to be on the lookout for a white van.\n\n[INT. WHITE VAN - DAY]\n\nThe Joker removes his mask, revealing a disturbing grin. He looks at Chris and Michael, who are still tense from the heist.\n\nJoker: (musing) You see, it's not just about the money. It's about sending a message. And today, we sent a message loud and clear. Chaos is inevitable, and I am its harbinger.\n\nChris and Michael exchange uneasy glances but say nothing.\n\n[EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY]\n\nThe white van merges back into traffic, blending in with the other vehicles as it drives away from the scene of the crime, leaving Lt. Hanna and the rest of the police force to sort through the chaos left behind."

      "content": "To generate a graph of the action intensity in a scene, you can use Python with the Matplotlib and Pandas libraries. First, you need to create a dataset containing the intensity of the action for each second. For simplicity, let's assume you have manually assigned an intensity value (0 to 10) for each second of the scene.\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example data: list of tuples (second, intensity)\naction_intensity_data = [\n    (1, 1),\n    (2, 2),\n    (3, 4),\n    (4, 6),\n    (5, 8),\n    (6, 9),\n    (7, 10),\n    (8, 7),\n    (9, 5),\n    (10, 3),\n    (11, 1),\n    (12, 0)\n]\n\n# Create a pandas DataFrame from the list of tuples\naction_intensity_df = pd.DataFrame(action_intensity_data, columns=[\"Second\", \"Intensity\"])\n\n# Plot the action intensity data\nplt.plot(action_intensity_df[\"Second\"], action_intensity_df[\"Intensity\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"Time (seconds)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Action Intensity\")\nplt.title(\"Action Intensity vs Time\")\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code will create a graph plotting the intensity of the action in the scene over time, using the example data provided. You can replace the `action_intensity_data` list with your own data to visualize the action intensity in your scene."
