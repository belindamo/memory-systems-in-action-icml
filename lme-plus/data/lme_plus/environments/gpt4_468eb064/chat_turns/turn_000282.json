  "content": "Yes, the dances performed during the Gaddi Festival usually take place during the daytime. The festival is celebrated during the months of August and September when the weather is pleasant, and the harvest season is in full swing. The performances generally start in the morning and continue until late afternoon when the sun sets. The main dancing area, called the \"chowgan,\" is usually set up in a central location in the village. The villagers dress up in their traditional attire and gather around to watch and participate in the dances. The atmosphere during these performances is usually lively and energetic, with lots of singing, clapping, and shouting. During the evenings, other activities such as feasts, storytelling, and music concerts take place, providing visitors with a chance to fully experience the festival.",
