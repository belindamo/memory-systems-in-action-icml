  "content": "The problem of pollution in the Doubs River is complex and not easy to solve completely. \n\nThere are multiple sources of pollution in the river, including agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage discharge. These sources of pollution are not necessarily under the control of the city, and some of them require the cooperation of upstream communities and other government authorities.\n\nMoreover, solving the problem of pollution requires significant investments in technology and infrastructure, which may not be affordable for the city. While the city has implemented measures to reduce pollution in the river, these efforts may not be sufficient to completely address the problem.\n\nFurthermore, addressing pollution in the river involves changing human behavior and cultural attitudes towards the environment. This requires a long-term effort to change the way people think about the river and to incentivize responsible behavior towards the river ecosystem.\n\nSo, while the city has taken measures to reduce pollution in the Doubs River, ultimately, solving the problem of pollution requires the cooperation of multiple stakeholders, significant financial investments, and a long-term, sustained effort over many years.",
