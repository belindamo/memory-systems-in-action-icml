  "content": "The fragrance is described as follow:\nSuggestive and unexpected, Gucci Guilty Pour Homme Eau de Parfum is a Woody Aromatic Spicy fragrance created to provoke.\nA contemporary take on two iconic fragrance ingredients popular in the 70s, Rose and Chili Pepper replace the original top notes of Pink Pepper and Italian Lemon to create an unexpected and invigorating retro vibe. The warm spiciness of red pepper contrast with a bitter aromatic freshness, as hints of vinegar and salt impart an unexpected sensation. Adding a higher level of intensity: Orange Blossom Absolute, Neroli and French Lavender evolve the heart of the fragrance into a stronger, more masculine statement. Richness and sensuality are accentuated at the base with Patchouli and Cedarwood.",
