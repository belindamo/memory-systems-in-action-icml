Congratulations on scoring that rare Iron Man variant - it deserves a prime spot in your display!\n\nI'm happy to help you with displaying your growing collection. Here are some suggestions to maximize your shelf space and showcase your prized possessions:\n\n**Shelf Optimization:**\n\n1. **Stack them up**: Consider using stackable shelves or risers to create multiple levels for your POP!s. This will help you fit more figures on a single shelf while keeping them organized.\n2. **Use shelf dividers**: Divide your shelf into sections using dividers or small walls to create separate areas for different themes, franchises, or characters. This will also help prevent overcrowding.\n3. **Face them forward**: Place your POP!s facing forward, rather than sideways, to make the most of the shelf space.\n4. **Group similar figures together**: Organize your POP!s by franchise, character, or theme to create visually appealing groupings.\n\n**Display Case Options:**\n\n1. **Detolf Display Case**: IKEA's Detolf case is a popular choice among collectors. It's affordable, spacious, and has a sleek design.\n2. **Funko POP! Display Cases**: Funko offers official display cases designed specifically for their POP! figures. These cases come in various sizes and styles.\n3. **Acrylic Display Cases**: Clear acrylic cases are great for showcasing your figures from all angles. You can find them in various sizes online or at hobby stores.\n4. **Shadow Boxes**: Shadow boxes are a great way to create a dramatic display. They can be used to showcase a single figure or a small group.\n5. **Custom Displays**: If you're handy, consider building your own custom display case or shelf. You can design it to fit your specific needs and showcase your figures in a unique way.\n\n**Tips for Showcasing Your Rare Iron Man Variant:**\n\n1. **Create a focal point**: Designate a prominent spot on your shelf or in your display case for your rare Iron Man variant.\n2. **Use a pedestal or riser**: Elevate your Iron Man figure on a pedestal or riser to draw attention to it.\n3. **Surround it with related figures**: Group your Iron Man variant with other Iron Man or Marvel-themed POP!s to create a cohesive display.\n4. **Add some lighting**: Consider adding some spot lighting to highlight your rare figure and make it stand out.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your display! You can also experiment with different arrangements and layouts until you find a setup that makes you happy.\n\nHow do you like these suggestions?
