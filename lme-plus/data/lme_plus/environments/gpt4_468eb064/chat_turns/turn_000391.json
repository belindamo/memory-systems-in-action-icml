  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Using shelf dividers to create a nested organization system is a great way to showcase your Marvel figures, with a special focus on your Spider-Man collection.\n\nBy creating a larger section for Marvel figures and then a smaller subsection for Spider-Man, you'll be able to:\n\n1. **Keep related figures together**: Marvel figures will be grouped together, and within that group, your Spider-Man figures will have their own dedicated space.\n2. **Reduce clutter**: By separating your figures into categories, you'll create a more organized and visually appealing display.\n3. **Highlight your favorite characters**: Your Spider-Man figures will stand out within the Marvel section, making it easy to show off your favorite web-slinger.\n4. **Add visual interest**: The nested organization will create a sense of depth and visual interest, making your display more engaging to look at.\n\nTo make this work, you can use shelf dividers of varying heights and widths to create the different sections. For example:\n\n* Use taller dividers to separate the Marvel section from the rest of your collection.\n* Use shorter dividers to create the Spider-Man subsection within the Marvel section.\n\nYou can also consider using different types of dividers, such as:\n\n* Solid dividers to create a clean separation between sections\n* Grid-style dividers to create a more open, airy feel\n* Dividers with a Marvel or Spider-Man theme to add an extra touch of flair\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and experiment with different arrangements until you find a layout that works for you!\n\nHow do you think you'll design your Marvel and Spider-Man sections? Will you add any special decorations or accessories to make them stand out?",
