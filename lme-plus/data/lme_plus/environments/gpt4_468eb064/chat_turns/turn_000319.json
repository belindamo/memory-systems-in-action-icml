Let me fix that.\n\n* Livestock Expenses: $657 - $120 - $500 = $37\n\t+ Vet bills: $120\n\t+ Feed: $500\n\t+ Breeding and genetics: $______\n\t+ Other livestock-related expenses: $______\n\nWith only $37 left for breeding and genetics, and other livestock-related expenses, we might need to adjust the allocations further. Maybe we can reduce the breeding and genetics expense to $20 and other livestock-related expenses to $17.\n\n* Livestock Expenses: $657\n\t+ Vet bills: $120\n\t+ Feed: $500\n\t+ Breeding and genetics: $20\n\t+ Other livestock-related expenses: $17\n\nDoes this revised breakdown look more accurate to you?",
