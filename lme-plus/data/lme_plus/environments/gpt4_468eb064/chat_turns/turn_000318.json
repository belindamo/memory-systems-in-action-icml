  "content": "Let's adjust the Livestock Expenses category to reflect the $120 vet bill.\n\n* Livestock Expenses: $657 - $120 = $537\n\t+ Vet bills: $120 (Luna's broken wing)\n\t+ Feed: $______ (we can estimate this based on your bulk purchase of hay)\n\t+ Breeding and genetics: $______\n\t+ Other livestock-related expenses: $______\n\nSince you mentioned the bulk purchase of hay will last for two months, we can estimate the feed expense for this period. Let's assume the bulk purchase cost $1,000 (just an estimate). Divide that by 2 months to get the monthly feed expense:\n\n$1,000 \u00f7 2 months = $500 per month\n\nWe can allocate this amount to the feed expense category:\n\n* Livestock Expenses: $537\n\t+ Vet bills: $120\n\t+ Feed: $500\n\t+ Breeding and genetics: $______\n\t+ Other livestock-related expenses: $______\n\nThis leaves us with $537 - $120 - $500 = -$83. Since we can't have a negative expense, we can either reduce the breeding and genetics expense or the other livestock-related expenses to make up for the difference.\n\nLet's assume you want to allocate $100 to breeding and genetics, and $100 to other livestock-related expenses. This would leave us with:\n\n* Livestock Expenses: $537\n\t+ Vet bills: $120\n\t+ Feed: $500\n\t+ Breeding and genetics: $100\n\t+ Other livestock-related expenses: $83\n\nHow does this revised breakdown look to you?",
