Here are some indie author recommendations in psychological thrillers and literary fiction that you might enjoy:\n\n**Psychological Thrillers:**\n\n1. **\"The Other Mrs. Miller\" by Allison Dickson**: A twisty, domestic thriller about a woman who discovers her husband is leading a double life.\n2. **\"The Devil's Work\" by Mark Edwards**: A chilling thriller about a woman who returns to her hometown, only to find herself embroiled in a mystery involving a series of murders.\n3. **\"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides**: A psychological thriller about a famous painter who shoots her husband and refuses to speak, and the psychotherapist who becomes obsessed with uncovering her secrets. (Note: This one is not entirely indie, as it was published by a traditional publisher, but it's a great example of a psychological thriller that has gained popularity through word-of-mouth and online communities.)\n\n**Literary Fiction:**\n\n1. **\"The Last Equation of Isaac Severy\" by Nova Jacobs**: A lyrical, atmospheric novel about a young woman who inherits a mysterious equation from her grandfather, a famous mathematician, and uncovers a family secret.\n2. **\"The Age of Light\" by Whitney Scharer**: A beautifully written novel based on the life of Lee Miller, a model, photographer, and muse to Man Ray, exploring themes of art, identity, and love.\n3. **\"The Weight of Feathers\" by Anna-Marie McLemore**: A magical realist novel about a rivalry between two rival families of performers, exploring themes of identity, family secrets, and first love.\n\nThese authors and books have received great reviews and have been well-received by readers in their respective genres. Keep in mind that indie authors might not have the same level of marketing or visibility as traditionally published authors, so you might need to look a bit harder to find them. However, many indie authors are active on social media and online communities, so you can often find them through online searches or by following book bloggers and reviewers.\n\nI hope you enjoy exploring these recommendations!",
