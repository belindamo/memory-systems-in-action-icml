  "content": "I recently took a solo trip to New York City for 4 days, and I was able to try out a lot of different restaurants on my own. I'm excited to try some of Chicago's famous deep-dish pizza, but I'm not sure if I should try other types of pizza as well. Can you recommend any other popular pizza styles in Chicago, or should I just stick with the classic deep-dish?",
