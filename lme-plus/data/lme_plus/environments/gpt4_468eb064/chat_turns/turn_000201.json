Both bestsellers and indie authors have their own advantages, so let's weigh the pros and cons:\n\n**Bestsellers:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Established quality**: Bestsellers are often well-written, edited, and polished, ensuring a engaging reading experience.\n2. **Familiarity**: You might already know the author or have heard of the book, making it easier to decide whether to try it.\n3. **Marketing and buzz**: Bestsellers often have a built-in audience and marketing machinery, which can make it easier to find reviews, discussions, and recommendations.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Higher expectations**: With bestsellers, you might have higher expectations due to their popularity, which can lead to disappointment if the book doesn't meet your expectations.\n2. **Less discovery**: You might not discover new, unique voices or styles, as bestsellers often follow established formulas.\n\n**Indie Authors:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Discovering new voices**: Indie authors can offer fresh perspectives, unique styles, and innovative storytelling, which can be exciting to discover.\n2. **Less expectations**: You might have lower expectations, making it easier to be pleasantly surprised by a hidden gem.\n3. **Supporting emerging talent**: By trying indie authors, you're supporting new writers and helping them gain visibility.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Variable quality**: Indie authors might not have the same level of editing, proofreading, or professional polish as traditionally published authors.\n2. **Less visibility**: Indie authors often have smaller marketing budgets, making it harder to find reviews, discussions, or recommendations.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide which approach to take. If you:\n\n1. Want a more predictable reading experience with established authors, focus on bestsellers.\n2. Are open to discovering new voices, styles, and genres, try indie authors.\n\nYou can also consider a mix of both approaches:\n\n1. Start with bestsellers to get a feel for a genre or style, then explore indie authors within that genre.\n2. Try indie authors in a genre you're already familiar with, and then move on to bestsellers in that genre.\n\nRemember, free e-book deals are a great way to take a risk on a new author or genre without financial commitment. If you don't enjoy the book, you can simply move on to the next one.\n\nHappy discovering!",
