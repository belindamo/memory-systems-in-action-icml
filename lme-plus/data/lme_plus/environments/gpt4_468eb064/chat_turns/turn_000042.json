  "content": "Historically, the residents of Besan\u00e7on relied heavily on the Doubs River for their livelihoods, especially in agriculture, fishing, and transportation. The river played a key role in the city's economic development, with the establishment of the watchmaking industry relying on the water power provided by the river.\n\nHowever, over time, the use of the river has changed significantly. With the growth of industrialization and infrastructure development, the river has become more important for hydroelectric power generation and water supply, while agricultural and fishing activities have declined.\n\nToday, the river remains an important source of drinking water, and the city's economy still benefits from hydroelectric power generation, tourism, and recreational use of the river.\n\nIn summary, while the residents of Besan\u00e7on no longer rely on the river as heavily for their livelihoods, the river continues to be an important resource for the city's economy and daily life.",
