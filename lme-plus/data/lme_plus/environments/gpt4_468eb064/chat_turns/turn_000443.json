  "content": "Deep-dish pizza is a must-try in Chicago! Here are some iconic spots and tips to help you navigate the rich, cheesy, and crusty world of Chicago-style deep-dish pizza:\n\n**Classic Deep-Dish Spots:**\n\n1. **Pizzeria Uno**: The birthplace of Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, opened in 1943. Try the original location on Ohio Street.\n2. **Lou Malnati's**: A family-owned institution since 1975, with multiple locations. Try the Buttercrust deep-dish pizza.\n3. **Gino's East**: A classic spot since 1966, known for their thick, cheesy crust and lively atmosphere.\n4. **Pequod's Pizza**: A Chicago staple since 1972, famous for their caramelized crust (aka \"Chicago-style crispy crust\").\n\n**Tips on What to Order:**\n\n1. **Order a classic deep-dish:** Typically, a deep-dish pizza comes with a thick crust, thick cheese, meats, and veggies. Avoid ordering thin crust or \"stuffed\" pizzas, as they're not traditional Chicago-style.\n2. **Choose your cheese:** Mozzarella is the classic choice, but some places offer other options like cheddar or a blend.\n3. **Meat lovers, rejoice:** Sausage, pepperoni, and bacon are popular toppings. If you don't like meat, opt for a veggie or mushroom pizza.\n4. **Don't overload the pizza:** Too many toppings can make the crust soggy. Stick to 2-3 toppings to ensure a balanced flavor.\n5. **Be patient:** Deep-dish pizzas take time to cook, so expect a 30-45 minute wait.\n\n**Example Order:**\n\n\"I'll take a classic deep-dish pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and onions, please.\"\n\nor\n\n\"Can I get a deep-dish with pepperoni, bacon, and olives?\"\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Be prepared for a rich, filling meal. Deep-dish pizzas are dense and satisfying.\n* Don't be afraid to ask for a \"well-done\" crust if you prefer a crisper crust.\n* If you're unsure about the wait, ask your server for an estimate or consider ordering ahead for pickup.\n* Try to visit during off-peak hours (e.g., lunch or early dinner) to avoid long waits.\n\nEnjoy your deep-dish adventure in Chicago!",
