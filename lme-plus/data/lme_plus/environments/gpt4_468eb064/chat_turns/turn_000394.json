  "content": "I think my favorite Spider-Man figure is the one from the Spider-Verse comic series. I love the unique design and colors. As for the new No Way Home figures, I'm thinking of displaying them in a group, maybe with some diorama or backdrop to recreate a scene from the movie. \n\nBy the way, I've also been collecting vinyl records for about a year now, and I've recently purchased 7 new albums in the last month. I got a limited edition pressing of The Beatles' Abbey Road at a garage sale last weekend, which is now one of my prized possessions.",
