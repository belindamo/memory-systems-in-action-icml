  "content": "Italian beef sandwiches are a quintessential Chicago classic! You'll find many spots serving them, but here are some iconic places to try:\n\n**Top Italian Beef Spots:**\n\n1. **Al's Beef**: A Chicago staple since 1977, with multiple locations. Try the original location on Taylor Street.\n2. **Mr. Beef**: Another classic spot, featured on TV shows and movies, including \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Blues Brothers.\"\n3. **Portillo's**: While they're famous for hot dogs, their Italian beef sandwiches are also a hit.\n4. **Johnnie's Beef**: A family-owned institution since 1967, with a nostalgic atmosphere.\n\n**How to Order Like a Local:**\n\n1. **Order it \"hot\" or \"sweet\":** Specify how you like your giardiniera, a spicy pickled vegetable mix. \"Hot\" means with hot giardiniera, while \"sweet\" means with sweet peppers instead.\n2. **Ask for it \"wet\" or \"dry\":** \"Wet\" means the sandwich will be dipped in the juices, making the bread soggy and flavorful. \"Dry\" means it won't be dipped, keeping the bread crispy.\n3. **Choose your cheese (optional):** Provolone or mozzarella are common options. Some places might offer other cheeses, but these are the traditional choices.\n4. **Don't be afraid to customize:** If you want extra giardiniera, cheese, or a specific type of bread, ask! Chicagoans are known for their straightforwardness, so don't hesitate to customize your order.\n\n**Example Order:**\n\n\"I'll take an Italian beef sandwich, hot, wet, with provolone cheese, please.\"\n\nor\n\n\"Can I get an Italian beef, sweet, dry, with mozzarella?\"\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be prepared for a messy, juicy sandwich. You might want to grab some napkins!\n* Try to avoid ordering during peak lunch hours (11:30 am - 1:30 pm) to avoid long lines.\n* If you're not sure what to order, ask the staff for recommendations or guidance. They'll be happy to help.\n\nEnjoy your Italian beef adventure in Chicago!",
