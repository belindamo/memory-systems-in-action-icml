This concept is intended to celebrate magnetism and self-love by \"coming out of the shadows\" or \"stepping into the sun/light,\" and by \"being proud of who you are.\" The campaign is expected to feature content that is shot in unexpected locations, such as vintage stores, laundry rooms, or underground spots, and is intended to incorporate product integration and visibility in order to showcase the fragrances. The overall message of the campaign is meant to be positive, with an emphasis on magnetism, self-love, and pride in one's identity.",
