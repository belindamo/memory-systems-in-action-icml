  "content": "The artistic biotope consists of four spheres: the domestic domain, the peer domain, the civil domain, and the market domain.\n\nAn artistic biotope could be redesigned in the form of a Business Model Canvas. This would make relations between the different components visible. For example:\n- the domestic domain is about the space, activities and materials you need as an artist to be creative. This relates to 'Key Activities', 'Value proposition', 'Key Resources' and 'Costs'. \n- the peer domain relates to colleagues and other partners you need to improve the quality of your work. This relates to 'Key Partners' and one of the 'customer segments'.\n- the civil domain is about the podiums and publications you need to make impact as an artist. This relates to 'Customer segments', 'Value proposition', 'Channels' and 'Partners'. \n- the market domain is about commissioners, funds and other ways to earn income as an artist. This relates to 'Customer segments' and 'Revenue streams'.\n\nRedesign a Business Model Canvas from the perspective of an artist, by connecting the elements of the Business Model Canvas to the elements of the artistic biotope.",
