It sounds like you have a good understanding of your income and fixed expenses, which is a great starting point.\n\nFirst, let's break down your income and expenses into percentages to get a better picture of where your money is going:\n\n* Income: $6,000/month\n* Fixed Expenses: $3,000/month (50% of income)\n* Disposable Income: $3,000/month (50% of income)\n\nIt's great that you're aware of your tendency to make impulse purchases, and you're wanting to make a change. To help you stay on track, let's allocate your disposable income into categories. Here's a suggested breakdown:\n\n* Savings: 20% of disposable income ($600/month)\n* Debt Repayment: 30% of disposable income ($900/month)\n* Entertainment/Miscellaneous: 20% of disposable income ($600/month)\n* Luxury Spending: 10% of disposable income ($300/month)\n* Emergency Fund: 20% of disposable income ($600/month)\n\nThis breakdown should help you prioritize your debt repayment and savings while still allowing for some discretionary spending. Remember, this is just a starting point, and you can adjust the percentages based on your needs and goals.\n\nTo track your expenses, I recommend using a budgeting app like Mint, Personal Capital, or YNAB (You Need a Budget). These apps can help you categorize your spending, set budgets, and receive alerts when you go over budget.\n\nHere are some additional tips to help you stay on track:\n\n1. **Create a 30-day waiting period**: When you see something you want to buy, wait 30 days before making the purchase. This can help you determine if the item is something you truly need or just a want.\n2. **Use cash**: For discretionary spending, consider using cash instead of credit cards. This can help you stick to your budget and avoid overspending.\n3. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your budget and spending to identify areas for improvement. Adjust your allocations as needed to stay on track with your goals.\n4. **Consider a \"splurge fund\"**: Set aside a small amount each month for luxury spending, like that Gucci handbag. This can help you indulge occasionally while still staying within your means.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Is there anything you'd like to add or change?",
