  "content": "I'm really into psychedelic rock and indie music, so I tend to focus on collecting albums from those genres. I've got a few records by Tame Impala, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, and King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard. I've also been trying to collect limited edition pressings and special releases, like colored vinyl or picture discs.\n\nAs for displaying my records, I've got a dedicated record shelf in my living room, and I try to keep it organized by artist or genre. I've also got a few record-themed decorations, like a vinyl record clock and a few music-inspired posters.\n\nThat's a great idea about combining my love of vinyl records and Funko POP!s! I didn't know there were vinyl record-themed Funko POP!s out there. I'll have to look into that. Maybe I could even create a display that showcases my favorite artists or albums with a corresponding Funko POP! figure.",
