That Gucci handbag I bought on May 15th for $2,000 is still weighing on my mind, and I want to pay off my credit card debt as soon as possible. Can we adjust the 20% allocation towards Savings and Debt to prioritize debt repayment? Maybe we can allocate 15% towards savings and 5% towards emergency fund, and use the remaining 0% towards debt repayment.",
