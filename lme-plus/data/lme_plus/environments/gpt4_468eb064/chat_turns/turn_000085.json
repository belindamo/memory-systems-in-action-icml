  "content": "A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) can be structured as an LLC (Limited Liability Company), which can act as a legal representative of the DAO. The LLC will protect its members from personal liability related to the affairs of the DAO and provide privacy. The creation of an LLC does not centralize the membership of a DAO but simply provides a legal identity to it. Opening a bank account and obtaining an EIN for an LLC can be done through the LexDAO Clinic or online. Taxes are handled by the KALI team, while annual reports and K-1s for LLC members can be handled by the LexDAO Clinic. Onboarding investors should respect local law and regulations and it is recommended to retain counsel. Automated investor onboarding processes are available in partnership with kycDAO, and KALI provides open source legal forms for self-certification of investors in private sales.",
