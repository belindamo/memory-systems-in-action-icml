This allows your body to fully recover and rebuild its energy reserves.\n\nIn the meantime, focus on the gentle exercises I suggested earlier, such as yoga, brisk walking, and bodyweight exercises. These will help you gradually build up your endurance and prepare your muscles for more intense strength training.\n\nWhen you're ready to introduce strength training, start with lighter versions of exercises and gradually increase the intensity and weight as your body adapts. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Begin with modified exercises**: Instead of doing full push-ups, try knee push-ups or incline push-ups. For squats, try half squats or quarter squats. For lunges, try stationary lunges or assisted lunges with a chair.\n2. **Use lighter weights or resistance**: If you're using dumbbells or resistance bands, start with lighter weights and gradually increase the load as you build strength.\n3. **Focus on higher reps and lower sets**: Aim for 12-15 reps and 2-3 sets to begin with. This will help you build endurance and stamina.\n4. **Listen to your body**: If you experience any discomfort, pain, or fatigue, stop immediately and rest. It's better to err on the side of caution and recover than to risk injury or exhaustion.\n5. **Warm up and cool down**: Always warm up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching before strength training, and cool down with static stretches afterwards.\n\nSome examples of modified strength training exercises you can try:\n\n* Push-ups: Knee push-ups, incline push-ups, or wall push-ups\n* Squats: Half squats, quarter squats, or sumo squats with a chair\n* Lunges: Stationary lunges, assisted lunges with a chair, or leg press\n* Chest exercises: Arm circles, shoulder rolls, or light dumbbell presses\n* Back exercises: Gentle rows, shoulder blade squeezes, or light lat pulldowns\n\nRemember to prioritize your recovery and only do what feels comfortable and manageable. As you progress, you can gradually increase the intensity and difficulty of your workouts.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to start with some gentle strength training exercises in a week or two?",
