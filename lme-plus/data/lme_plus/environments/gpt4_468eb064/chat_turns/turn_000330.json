  "content": "Yes, it is possible to make a time series forecast more robust by using exogenous variables and feature engineering.\n\nExogenous variables are external factors that may influence the time series being forecasted, such as economic indicators, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables. You can include exogenous variables in your ARIMA model by using a variant of the model called the SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model. In this model, you include one or more exogenous variables in addition to the endogenous (internal) variable, which is the GDP data.\n\nHere is an example of how you could include an exogenous variable in your ARIMA model in R:\n```\n# Import the exogenous variable data and create a time series object\nexog_data <- read.csv(\"exog_data.csv\")\nexog_ts <- ts(exog_data$value, start = c(year(exog_data$date[1]), quarter(exog_data$date[1])), frequency = 4)\n\n# Create a SARIMAX model with the GDP data and exogenous variable\nbest_model <- auto.arima(gdp_ts, xreg=exog_ts)\n```\nFeature engineering is the process of creating new features from the existing data that can be used to improve the forecasting accuracy. For example, you can create new features such as lags, differences, moving averages, and other derived variables that can be used as predictors in your ARIMA model.\nYou can create these features using various R functions like lag, diff, rollmean, etc\n\nHere is an example of how you could create lagged values of the GDP data as new features:\n```\n# Create lagged values of GDP data as new features\ngdp_lags <- data.frame(lag(gdp_ts, k = 1:3))\ncolnames(gdp_lags) <- paste0(\"lag_\", 1:3)\n```\nThen you can use these new features as predictors in your ARIMA model by including them in the xreg argument of the auto.arima function.\n```\nbest_model <- auto.arima(gdp_ts, xreg=gdp_lags)\n```\nIt's worth mentioning that, Exogenous variables and feature engineering are not the only ways to improve the forecast robustness, sometimes, other methods like Ensemble method, or combining multiple models can provide better results.\nIt's also important to evaluate the model performance using suitable evaluation metric, like Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error and other, and try different models, and evaluate them.",
