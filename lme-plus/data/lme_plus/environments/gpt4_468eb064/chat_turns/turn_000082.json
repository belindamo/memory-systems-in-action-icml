I'm a text-based AI assistant, and our conversation just started, so I don't have any information about your past trips.\n\nIf you'd like to keep track of your trips, you can try using a travel journal, a spreadsheet, or a travel app like TripIt or Google Trips to log your trips and keep a record of your travel history.\n\nBut I'm here to help with any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss! How about we focus on finding that award ticket to Hawaii?",
