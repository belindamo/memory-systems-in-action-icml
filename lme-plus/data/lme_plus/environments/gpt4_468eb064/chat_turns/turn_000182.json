  "content": "I make around $6,000 a month. My fixed expenses are around $3,000, which includes rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and minimum payments on debts. I'd say I tend to make impulse purchases, but I'm trying to be more mindful of my spending habits. I'd like to cut back on luxury spending and allocate more funds towards savings and debt repayment. I have some credit card debt from my previous splurges, so paying that off is a priority.",
