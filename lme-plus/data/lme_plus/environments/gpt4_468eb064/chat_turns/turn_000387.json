  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights is a separately ticketed event that takes place on select nights during the Halloween season, and it's a very different experience from Disneyland's holiday event.\n\nDisneyland's holiday event is a festive celebration that takes place during the day and evening, and it's included with regular park admission. The event features decorations, entertainment, food, and activities that are suitable for all ages. You can expect to see festive decorations, holiday-themed treats, and special character costumes.\n\nIn contrast, Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios is a separately ticketed event that takes place in the evening, and it's geared towards a more mature audience. The event features haunted houses, scare zones, and live shows that are designed to be scary and thrilling.\n\nWhile both events are seasonal and offer a unique experience, they are quite different in terms of tone, atmosphere, and content.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun and festive holiday experience with your friends, Disneyland's holiday event is a great choice. You can expect a magical and merry atmosphere, with plenty of opportunities to take photos, enjoy holiday treats, and experience the park's iconic attractions.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a spooky and thrilling experience, you might want to consider visiting Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights during the Halloween season.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and I'm sure you'll have a great time at Disneyland with your friends!",
