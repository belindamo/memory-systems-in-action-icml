We know that Alex Ferguson also threw a shoe at David Beckham. It's said that Fatih Terim also did such things sometimes. Knowing that my players' families are with me makes me happy. Today, my phones never stopped ringing, both from people writing to me on social media and those who called me personally to express their positive thoughts about me, it made me happy. There are also those who cursed my deceased mother. I identified them, and I will start the necessary legal process. My doing such things does not give anyone the right to curse me, because I love my players. I have a brother-father relationship with them. I know that I carried a player who had his leg in plaster to the third floor on my back. It was not something that should have been done, but it was during a match. Just like a married couple's bedroom is private, a coach's locker room is also private. There are situations like this that happen to achieve victory and win the cup. As I said, this is a method used by many coaches. Now we have become the scapegoat,\""
