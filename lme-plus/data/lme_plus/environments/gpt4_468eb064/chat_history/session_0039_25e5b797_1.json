      "content": "I'd be happy to help you compare crowd levels at Universal Studios and Disneyland on Friday evenings.\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time data or personal experiences, so I didn't know about your trip to Universal Studios three weeks ago with Emma and Ryan.\n\nThat being said, I can provide some general insights on crowd levels at both parks on Friday evenings.\n\n**Universal Studios Hollywood:**\n\nFriday evenings can be moderately busy at Universal Studios Hollywood, especially during peak seasons (summer, holidays, and school breaks). The park tends to attract a lot of locals and tourists alike, especially after work or school.\n\nYou can expect:\n\n* Longer wait times for popular attractions like Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, Jurassic Park River Adventure, and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.\n* Crowds in the Upper Lot, where most of the thrill rides are located.\n* A lively atmosphere in the evening, with live music and entertainment options.\n\n**Disneyland Resort:**\n\nFriday evenings are usually busier at Disneyland Park compared to Universal Studios Hollywood. Disneyland is a more popular destination, and its evening atmosphere is often more vibrant, with parades, fireworks, and nighttime spectaculars.\n\nYou can expect:\n\n* Longer wait times for popular attractions like Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and Indiana Jones Adventure.\n* Crowds in Fantasyland, Adventureland, and Main Street USA, which are popular areas.\n* A more festive atmosphere, with evening entertainment options like parades, fireworks, and character meet-and-greets.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nBased on general trends, Disneyland tends to be busier than Universal Studios Hollywood on Friday evenings. However, both parks can be busy, especially during peak seasons.\n\nIf you're looking for shorter wait times, consider visiting Universal Studios Hollywood. If you prefer a more vibrant evening atmosphere and don't mind longer wait times, Disneyland might be the better choice.\n\nKeep in mind that crowd levels can vary depending on various factors, such as special events, holidays, and school schedules. I recommend checking the parks' websites, social media, or crowd calendars to get a better sense of the crowd levels before your trip.\n\nHope this helps you plan your next theme park adventure!"

The event features decorations, entertainment, food, and activities that are suitable for all ages. You can expect to see festive decorations, holiday-themed treats, and special character costumes.\n\nIn contrast, Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios is a separately ticketed event that takes place in the evening, and it's geared towards a more mature audience.
