      "content": "Family game nights are the best! I'm glad to hear you had a great time playing Scattergories with your family! It's an excellent game for a big group, and it's awesome that you're planning another fun night with your loved ones.\n\nFor a big group, I'd recommend the following games that are perfect for a fun and engaging family game night:\n\n1. **Charades or Pictionary**: These classic games are always a hit with a large group. You can divide the group into teams and take turns acting out words, phrases, or drawing pictures to guess.\n2. **Taboo**: Similar to Scattergories, Taboo is a fast-paced word-guessing game where players take turns describing a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases.\n3. **What Do You Meme**: A hilarious party game where players compete to create the funniest meme by combining caption cards with a random image.\n4. **Jenga**: A classic physical game that's perfect for a big group. Players take turns removing blocks from a tower, trying not to be the one who makes it fall.\n5. **Two Truths and a Lie**: Each player tells two true statements and one false statement about themselves, and the others have to guess which one is the lie.\n6. **Would You Rather**: Present players with difficult choices, such as \"Would you rather go on a hot air balloon ride or go skydiving?\" and have them discuss and debate their answers.\n7. **Group Storytelling**: Have each player contribute to a group story, with each person adding a sentence or two to the narrative.\n8. **Karaoke Contest**: If your group loves music, set up a karaoke machine or use a karaoke app on a tablet or smartphone, and have a sing-off with fun prizes for the best performances.\n9. ** Minute to Win It**: Inspired by the popular TV game show, this game involves completing silly physical challenges using household items within a set time limit.\n10. **Group Trivia**: Create a quiz with questions on a variety of topics, such as history, pop culture, sports, or music, and divide the group into teams to compete.\n\nThese games are all great options for a fun and interactive family game night with a big group. You can also consider serving snacks and drinks to make the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose games that everyone will enjoy and that fit your family's interests and age range.

I'm happy to tell you more about it!\n\n**Azul** is a tile-laying game designed by Michael Kiesling, released in 2017. It's a game for 2-4 players, and a typical game takes around 30-45 minutes to play.\n\n**Objective:**\nIn Azul, players compete to create the most beautiful mosaic by collecting and placing tiles. The goal is to score points by creating lines of matching colors, completing sets, and creating patterns on your player board.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\n1. Each player starts with a player board and a set of random tiles.\n2. On each turn, players draft tiles from a central pool, trying to collect sets of matching colors.\n3. Players can place tiles on their board, trying to create lines of matching colors, complete sets, or create patterns.\n4. The game consists of multiple rounds, with each round representing a different phase of the mosaic's construction.\n5. At the end of each round, players score points for the tiles they've placed, with bonus points for completing sets and creating patterns.\n6.
