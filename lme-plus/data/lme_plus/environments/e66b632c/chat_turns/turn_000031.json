  "content": "I'm available to train on weekdays from 7-9 am and weekends from 8 am-12 pm. For frequency and duration, I'd like to do yoga 2 times a week for 45 minutes, cycling 1 time a week for 2 hours, soccer 1 time a week for 1.5 hours, and triathlon training 3 times a week with varying durations. I'd like to prioritize triathlon training on weekends. I want to take 1 rest day per week. As for specific goals, I'm training for a sprint triathlon on June 24th and I've recently completed a charity 5K run with a personal best time of 27 minutes and 45 seconds. My current fitness level is intermediate for yoga and cycling, beginner for swimming, and advanced for running.",
