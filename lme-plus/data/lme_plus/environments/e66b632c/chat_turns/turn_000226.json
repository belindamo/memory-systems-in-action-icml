I've been attending a bunch of film festivals lately, just got back from LAFF where I watched some great films like \"The Lost Daughter\" and \"Summer of Soul\". Before that, I volunteered as a festival coordinator for the documentary section at the Tribeca Film Festival, which was an amazing experience. Do you have any suggestions for documentaries that I might have missed?",
