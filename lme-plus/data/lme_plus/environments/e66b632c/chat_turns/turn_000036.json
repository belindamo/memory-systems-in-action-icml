From the local park, head east on Park Road for 1.5 miles until you reach Oakdale Avenue.\n2. Turn left onto Oakdale Avenue and ride for 2.5 miles, passing through a quiet residential area.\n3. Turn right onto Ridgeview Road, which will take you onto a scenic route with rolling hills and countryside views.\n4.
