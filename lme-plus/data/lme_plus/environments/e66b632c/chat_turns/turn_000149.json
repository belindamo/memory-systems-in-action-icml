Please provide the following:\n\n1. **Which social media platforms do you want to analyze?** (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, etc.)\n2. **What is your content categorization system?** (e.g., do you use tags, labels, or categories to organize your content, such as \"product updates,\" \"behind-the-scenes,\" \"promotions,\" \"educational,\" etc.)\n3. **What metrics do you want to focus on?** (e.g., engagement rate, reach, likes, shares, comments, clicks, conversions, etc.)\n4. **Do you have any specific time frames in mind for the analysis?** (e.g., last month, last quarter, last year, etc.)\n5. **Do you have access to analytics tools or data exports from each platform?** (e.g., Facebook Insights, Instagram Insights, Twitter Analytics, Google Analytics, etc.)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can guide you through the process of collecting and analyzing your data to identify which type of content is performing best across all your platforms.\n\nIf you don't have access to analytics tools or data exports, we can also discuss alternative methods for collecting data, such as using third-party tools or manual tracking.\n\nLet's get started!",
