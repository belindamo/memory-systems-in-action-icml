Here's the information you need:\n\n**LA City Hall Observation Deck:**\n\n1. **Public Access**: Yes, the observation deck is open to the public and offers panoramic views of the city.\n2. **Operating Hours**: The observation deck is open Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Unfortunately, it's not open on weekends or holidays.\n3. **Admission**: Admission is free, but you'll need to go through security screening before accessing the deck.\n4. **Restrictions**: No tripods are allowed on the observation deck, so you'll need to rely on your camera's image stabilization or a monopod (if allowed) to minimize camera shake.\n\nConsidering the operating hours, you might want to plan your visit during the day or early evening to capture the cityscape during the blue hour (the hour just before sunset). This can result in some amazing shots with a mix of natural and artificial light.\n\nIf you're looking for alternative high vantage points with more flexible hours, you might consider:\n\n1. **OUE Skyspace LA**: Located in the US Bank Tower, it offers panoramic views of the city from the 70th floor. It's open daily from 10:00 AM to 9:00 PM, and tripods are allowed.\n2. **Perch**: A rooftop bar in downtown LA with great views of the city. It's open daily from 5:00 PM to 1:00 AM, but you might need to make a reservation or arrive early to secure a spot.\n\nRemember to check the weather forecast and plan your visit accordingly. A clear sky can make for some amazing shots, while clouds or fog can add an interesting atmosphere to your photos.\n\nIt's great that you attended a workshop and learned from a well-known photographer! What were some of the most valuable lessons you took away from the workshop?",
