  "content": "Yes, high levels of nitrites in the water can harm plants, including Cabomba furcata, and cause the type of damage you described. Nitrite is a toxic compound that can damage plant cells and interfere with their ability to take up essential nutrients. In a not fully cycled tank, nitrite levels can rise rapidly as the bacteria that convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate are still establishing themselves.\n\nIf your tank is not fully cycled, it's possible that high levels of nitrite in the water could be contributing to the erosion of the stem and the floating of your Cabomba furcata. To confirm whether this is the case, you should test the nitrite levels in your tank using an aquarium test kit. If the nitrite levels are high, you should take steps to reduce them by performing partial water changes and adding beneficial bacteria to the aquarium.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while plants can help to reduce nitrite levels in the water by taking up and converting the compound into less toxic forms, it's essential to establish a stable and well-functioning nitrogen cycle in your aquarium before adding live plants. This will help to ensure that your plants have a healthy environment in which to grow and thrive.",
