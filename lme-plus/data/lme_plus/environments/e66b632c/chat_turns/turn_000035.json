  "content": "I'm in the local area, and I think a mix of rolling and steeper hills would be great for our group. We prefer secondary roads with less traffic, and an elevation gain of around 500-1000 feet would be suitable. It would be nice to have some scenic views along the way, and bike-friendly infrastructure is a plus. Oh, and I've been using the local park where I did the charity 5K run as a reference point, so if the route could start and end there, that would be convenient.",
