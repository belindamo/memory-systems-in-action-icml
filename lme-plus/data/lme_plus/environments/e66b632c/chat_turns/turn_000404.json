  "content": "That sounds great! I think the cabin's location is perfect for our trip. We'll have easy access to Rocky Mountain National Park and the town of Estes Park, but still have a peaceful and secluded spot to relax. I'm excited to explore the nearby hiking trails and scenic drives. By the way, I've been meaning to get my car serviced before our trip, I don't want any car trouble on the way to Estes Park. Do you know if there are any good mechanics in the area that can help me with an oil change, tire rotation, and brake check?",
