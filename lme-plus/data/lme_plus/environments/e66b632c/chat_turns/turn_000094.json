  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to current promotions or discounts that BetterHelp and Talkspace are offering. However, you can usually find this information on their websites or by contacting their customer support. That being said, both platforms generally offer a free trial or discount for first-time users. For example, BetterHelp offers a free 7-day trial period and Talkspace offers a $100 discount on the first month of therapy for new users. In some cases, either as a result of your insurance provider or direct from the platform, discounts might be given. It's always best to check their official website for the latest information on any promotions, discounts, or free trials that they may be offering.",
