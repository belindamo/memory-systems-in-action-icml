  "content": "These recommendations are really interesting, especially \"Say Amen, Somebody\" and \"Style Wars\" as they both capture the spirit of a specific time and place. I'm also intrigued by \"The Devil's Music: A History of the Blues\" as I've been exploring the blues genre more deeply lately. Can you recommend any recent documentaries that focus on contemporary music scenes or genres, like electronic or hip-hop?",
