Here's how your expense tracker might look so far:\n\n**Category: Gifts**\n\n* H&M (gifts for nephew): $80\n\nTotal: $80\n\nIf you'd like to add more expenses to this category or create new categories, feel free to share more information. For example, you might have also bought gifts for other family members or friends, or you might have spent money on gift wrapping or cards.\n\nWhat's next? Do you have any other expenses you'd like to track, such as daily habits like coffee or transportation costs, or maybe some bills or subscriptions you pay regularly?",
