  "content": "I'd be happy to help you find a suitable route for your Saturday cycling group ride.\n\nTo suggest a route, I'll need to know a bit more information about your location and preferences. Please provide the following details:\n\n1. **Location**: What city or region are you in? This will help me suggest a route with suitable roads and terrain.\n2. **Terrain preferences**: Are you looking for a route with:\n\t* Rolling hills: Gentle, gradual climbs and descents\n\t* Steeper hills: Short, punchy climbs that will challenge your legs\n\t* Mix of both: A route with a combination of rolling and steeper hills\n3. **Road type**: Do you prefer:\n\t* Main roads: Busier roads with more traffic, but often with bike lanes or shoulders\n\t* Secondary roads: Quieter roads with less traffic, but may have more potholes or rough surfaces\n\t* Bike trails or bike paths: Dedicated paths for cyclists, often separated from motorized traffic\n4. **Elevation gain**: Are you looking for a route with a moderate amount of elevation gain (500-1000 feet) or something more challenging (1000-2000 feet)?\n5. **Route features**: Are there any specific features you'd like to include in the route, such as:\n\t* Scenic views\n\t* Rural or countryside roads\n\t* Bike-friendly infrastructure (e.g., bike lanes, bike boxes)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can suggest a 20-mile route that meets your requirements and provides a fun and challenging ride for your group.\n\nIf you have a specific location in mind, you can also use online route planning tools like:\n\n* Strava Route Builder\n* MapMyRide\n* Ride with GPS\n* Google Maps (with the \"Bicycling\" option)\n\nThese tools allow you to create and customize routes based on your preferences. You can also search for existing routes in your area and modify them to suit your needs.",
