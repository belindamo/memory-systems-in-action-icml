It's estimated that over 100 billion single-use coffee cups are used worldwide every year, and most of them end up in landfills or oceans. Here are some eco-friendly alternatives to single-use coffee cups:\n\n1. **Reusable coffee cups**: Invest in a durable, insulated coffee cup made from materials like stainless steel, glass, or ceramic. Look for cups with leak-proof lids and comfortable grips.\n2. **Travel mugs**: Similar to reusable coffee cups, travel mugs are designed for on-the-go use. They're often made from lightweight materials like silicone or plastic and have insulation to keep your drinks hot or cold.\n3. **Coffee cup sleeves**: If you prefer to use a disposable cup, consider using a reusable coffee cup sleeve. These sleeves fit around a standard coffee cup and can be washed and reused multiple times.\n4. **Mason jars**: A popular alternative to traditional coffee cups, mason jars are a great option for hot or cold drinks. Simply add a lid and straw or handle for a stylish and eco-friendly cup.\n5. **Silicone cups**: Silicone cups are flexible, collapsible, and dishwasher safe. They're perfect for camping, travel, or daily use.\n6. **Compostable cups**: If you still want the convenience of a disposable cup, look for compostable cups made from plant-based materials like cornstarch or sugarcane. These cups can be composted at home or in industrial facilities.\n7. **Coffee shops with reusable cups**: Some coffee shops offer reusable cups or discounts for customers who bring their own cups. Support these businesses and encourage others to follow their lead!\n\nRemember, every small change you make can add up to make a big difference. You've already saved 20 single-use plastic bottles, and now you can start reducing your single-use coffee cup waste!\n\nKeep up the good work, and don't hesitate to ask about more eco-friendly alternatives to other single-use products!",
