That's a great achievement!\n\nNow, let's get back to planning a fantastic 20-mile bike route for your Saturday morning cycling group in Oakdale.\n\nSince you'd like to avoid downtown and the highway, I'll suggest a route that takes advantage of the bike trail along the river and explores some of Oakdale's quieter neighborhoods and scenic areas. Here's a possible route for you:\n\n**Route Suggestion:**\n\n**Segment 1: River Trail (4 miles)**\n\n* Start at the River Trail parking lot near the Oakdale Marina (or any other convenient access point).\n* Ride north along the river trail, enjoying the scenic views and relatively flat terrain.\n* Continue on the trail until you reach the intersection with Oakbrook Drive.\n\n**Segment 2: Quiet Neighborhoods (6 miles)**\n\n* Turn left onto Oakbrook Drive and ride west for about 1.5 miles.\n* Turn right onto Maple Street and continue for approximately 2 miles, passing through a quiet neighborhood with minimal traffic.\n* Turn left onto Elm Avenue and ride for about 1.5 miles, which will bring you to the edge of a small park.\n\n**Segment 3: Park Loop and Hill (4 miles)**\n\n* Enter the park and ride the loop around the perimeter, which includes a few small hills to get your legs pumping.\n* Exit the park and ride east on Parkview Drive for about 1 mile.\n* Turn left onto Highland Avenue, which will take you over a small hill and back down into a quiet neighborhood.\n\n**Segment 4: River Trail Return (6 miles)**\n\n* Turn right onto River Road, which will take you back to the river trail.\n* Ride south along the river trail, retracing your route from the start, and enjoy the scenic views one more time.\n\nThis route should provide a pleasant, relatively flat ride with some minor hills to keep things interesting. You'll avoid downtown and the highway, while still exploring some of Oakdale's hidden gems. Feel free to adjust the route to suit your group's preferences or add any additional stops along the way.\n\nHow does this route sound? Would you like me to make any changes or suggest any variations?",
