Both glass and stainless steel cups have their advantages, but I'd recommend a stainless steel cup for daily commuting, especially if you're planning to use it frequently on-the-go.\n\nWhile glass cups are a great option, they can be more delicate and prone to breakage, which might not be ideal for daily commuting. Stainless steel cups, on the other hand, are more durable and can withstand the rigors of daily use. They're also less likely to shatter or crack if you accidentally drop them.\n\nAdditionally, stainless steel cups are often designed with commuting in mind, featuring features like leak-proof lids, comfortable grips, and compact sizes that fit easily in bags or cup holders.\n\nThat being said, if you still prefer a glass cup, you can take some precautions to minimize the risk of breakage:\n\n1. **Choose a durable glass cup**: Look for glass cups made from thick, borosilicate glass, which is more resistant to thermal shock and breakage.\n2. **Use a protective sleeve**: Consider investing in a silicone or fabric sleeve to protect your glass cup from bumps and drops.\n3. **Handle with care**: Be mindful when handling your glass cup, avoiding sudden movements or drops.\n\nUltimately, the decision comes down to your personal preference and commuting style. If you're willing to take extra care and precautions, a glass cup could work well for you. However, if you're looking for a low-maintenance, durable option that can withstand the daily grind, stainless steel might be the better choice.\n\nEither way, kudos to you and Rachel for reducing your carbon footprint through carpooling and now, reusable coffee cups!",
