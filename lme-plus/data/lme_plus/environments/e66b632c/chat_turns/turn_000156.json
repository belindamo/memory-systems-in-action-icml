I've seen an increase in replies and mentions over the past two weeks, and I think it's because I've been participating in more Twitter Chats, like the #marketingmonday chat, and using more relevant hashtags like #socialmedia and #contentmarketing. One of my tweets from last week, where I shared an article about the importance of social media analytics, got 15 retweets and 20 likes, which is a lot of engagement for me on Twitter.",
