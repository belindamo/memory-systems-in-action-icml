This involves discussing the issues and concerns regarding the delay in completion and finding ways to address them. Homeowners should clearly express their expectations and discuss the implications of any delay. The builder should be made aware of the need to complete the work in a timely manner while also ensuring that the work is done to the required standard. Effective communication can help to identify any issues and find solutions before they become bigger problems. Homeowners should be proactive in asking for regular updates on the progress of the work and raising any concerns they have as soon as possible.
