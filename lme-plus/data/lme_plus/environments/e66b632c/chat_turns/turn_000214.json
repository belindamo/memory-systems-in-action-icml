  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. It appears there was a typo in the template. Please replace the `<h1>` line in `job_posting.html` with the correct text. Here's the corrected line:\n```html\n<h1 class=\"my-4 text-center\">Job Postings</h1>\n```\nRegarding Bootstrap CSS, you don't need to install it separately, as it's being included via a CDN (Content Delivery Network) in the template's `<head>` section. The following line of code is responsible for including Bootstrap CSS:\n```html\n<link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" integrity=\"sha384-KyZXEAg3QhqLMpG8r+Knujsl5/J5f5jU1wFzgW6xZI6loz6ldkgnC6fH1W9W1qw\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n```\nAfter updating the `<h1>` line, save the changes and refresh the page. You should now see the correct \"Job Postings\" heading along with the example job postings.\n\nIf you still encounter issues, please let me know, and I'll help you troubleshoot further.",
