You can share as much or as little as you'd like, but here are some questions to consider:\n\n1. What categories do you typically spend money on (e.g. food, transportation, entertainment, housing, etc.)?\n2. Do you have any regular bills or subscriptions (e.g. rent, utilities, Netflix, gym membership, etc.)?\n3. Have you made any large purchases or splurges in the past month?\n4. Do you use cash, credit cards, or debit cards for most of your transactions?\n5. Do you have any receipts or records of your spending that you can share with me?\n\nYou can also try to recall your daily expenses over the past month, such as:\n\n* How much did you spend on coffee or meals out?\n* Did you buy any clothing or accessories?\n* Did you take any trips or travel?\n* Did you make any purchases online or in-store?\n\nOnce you provide me with some information, I can help you organize and categorize your expenses to get a better sense of where your money is going.",
