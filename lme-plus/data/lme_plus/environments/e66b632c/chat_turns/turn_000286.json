However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal experiences or memories, so I didn't attend the workshop with you and don't know the specifics of what you learned. But don't worry, I can still provide you with some general tips and strategies to help you increase your Instagram followers!\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your current Instagram presence? What's your current follower count, and what kind of content do you typically post? Are you looking to target a specific niche or audience?\n\nAlso, since you mentioned meeting a social media influencer named Rachel, did you learn any specific tips or strategies from her that you'd like to incorporate into your plan?\n\nLet's chat, and I'll do my best to help you come up with a plan to grow your Instagram followers!",
