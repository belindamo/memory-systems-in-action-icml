However, I have to clarify again that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know about your personal experiences, so I didn't know you drove to the beach house today. But let's focus on planning your Rocky Mountains trip!\n\nWith your budget and preferences, I'd be happy to help you find a suitable cabin. Here are some options to consider:\n\n1. **Estes Park, Colorado**: Estes Park is a popular destination in the Rocky Mountains, with plenty of affordable cabin options. You can find cabins with hot tubs and Wi-Fi in the $800-$1,200 per week range, which fits your budget. Estes Park is close to Rocky Mountain National Park, which offers stunning scenery and outdoor activities.\n2. **Glenwood Springs, Colorado**: Glenwood Springs is another great destination in the Rocky Mountains, known for its natural hot springs and outdoor recreation opportunities. You can find cabins with hot tubs and Wi-Fi in the $900-$1,400 per week range. Glenwood Springs is about 160 miles west of Denver, making it easily accessible.\n3. **Big Sky, Montana**: Big Sky is a beautiful mountain town in southwestern Montana, surrounded by the Rocky Mountains. You can find cabins with hot tubs and Wi-Fi in the $1,000-$1,500 per week range. Big Sky offers plenty of outdoor activities, including skiing, hiking, and fishing.\n\nTo find the best deals, I recommend checking websites like:\n\n* VRBO (Vacation Rentals by Owner)\n* Airbnb\n* HomeAway\n* Mountain Reservations (specializing in mountain vacation rentals)\n\nYou can also consider contacting local property management companies or resorts directly to inquire about their cabin rentals and prices.\n\nBefore booking, make sure to read reviews, check the cabin's amenities, and ask about any additional fees or taxes.\n\nWhich of these options sounds most appealing to you, or would you like me to explore more destinations in the Rocky Mountains?",
