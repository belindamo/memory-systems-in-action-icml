  "content": "If you allow the trimmed stems of your Anacharis to float in the water column, the roots will likely develop all along the stem of the plant, not just at the bottom.\n\nAnacharis is a stem plant that can grow roots from multiple points along the stem, including nodes and internodes. When the stems are allowed to float, the lower portions of the stem will usually develop more roots than the upper portions since they are submerged in the water. However, it's common for roots to develop along the entire length of the stem, especially if the plant is healthy and receiving enough nutrients.\n\nTo encourage root growth on your Anacharis stems, make sure to provide the plant with a nutrient-rich substrate and adequate lighting. You can also add liquid fertilizers to the water to help promote healthy root growth. As the roots develop, they will help to anchor the plant in the substrate and provide it with a stable base for continued growth.",
