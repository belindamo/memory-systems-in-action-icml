  "content": "I currently run 3 times a week, with one longer run on the weekends and two shorter runs during the week. My average pace is around 9:30 minutes per mile, and I'm hoping to finish the 10K in under 55 minutes. I've got about 12 weeks until the event. I prefer to run in the morning, and I'm available to run any day of the week. I don't have any injuries, and I'm comfortable with incorporating speed workouts and hill repeats into my training.",
