  "content": "Cabomba furcata is a delicate stem plant that can be challenging to keep in an aquarium, especially for novice aquarists. There are several reasons why your newly planted Cabomba Furcatas are eroding away at the stem and then floating to the surface, including:\n\n1. Poor lighting: Cabomba furcata requires high light intensity to grow well. Inadequate lighting can cause the plant to weaken and decay, leading to erosion of the stem.\n2. Insufficient nutrients: Cabomba furcata requires a nutrient-rich substrate and regular fertilization to thrive. A lack of nutrients can cause the plant to deteriorate, leading to erosion of the stem.\n3. High water flow: Cabomba furcata prefers gentle water flow. High water flow can cause the plant to lose its grip on the substrate, leading to erosion of the stem.\n4. Incompatible water parameters: Cabomba furcata prefers soft and slightly acidic water. If the water parameters are not suitable for the plant, it can weaken and decay, leading to erosion of the stem.\n\nTo address the issue, you should check your aquarium's lighting, nutrient levels, water flow, and water parameters to ensure that they are suitable for Cabomba furcata. You may need to adjust these parameters to create a more conducive environment for the plant to thrive. You can also try to anchor the plant more securely to the substrate using plant weights or planting baskets.",
