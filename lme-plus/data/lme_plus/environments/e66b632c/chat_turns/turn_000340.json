  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or emotions. However, I can tell you that poetry comes in many different types, styles, and forms. Some of the most common types of poetry include:\n\n1. Sonnets - 14-line poems typically written in iambic pentameter. 2. Haiku - a three-line poem with a total of 17 syllables, typically focusing on images from nature. 3. Epic poetry - long, narrative poems that tell a story about a hero or legend, often written in a formal style and meter. 4. Free verse - poetry that does not necessarily rhyme or follow a specific meter, instead relying on the poet's personal style and voice. 5. Prose poetry - poetry that does not rely on meter or line breaks, but instead follows the rhythms and cadences of prose. 6. Ballads - narrative poems that were originally meant to be sung, typically telling a story of love, heroism, or tragedy. Again, there are many different types of poetry, and each has its own qualities and style.",
