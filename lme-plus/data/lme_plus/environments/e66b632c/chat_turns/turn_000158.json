I think this is because I haven't been posting as frequently, and when I do post, it's usually just a link to my blog or something promotional. I need to work on creating more engaging, native content for Facebook, like videos and polls. However, I did have a post from a month ago, where I asked my followers to share their favorite books, that got 50 comments and 20 shares, which is a lot of engagement for me on Facebook.",
