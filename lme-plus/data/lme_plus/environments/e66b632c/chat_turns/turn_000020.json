Here's a new version of the song that's more focused on the memories and the loss, with a simpler and more traditional lyrical flow:\n\nVerse 1:\nYou were always by my side\nMy faithful friend, my source of pride\nWe'd sit together, late at night\nWatching the world go by\n\nChorus:\nBut now you're gone, and I'm alone\nMemories of you fill my home\nI miss your warmth, your gentle touch\nI miss you so damn much\n\nVerse 2:\nWe'd take walks out in the park\nAnd stop to watch the stars\nYou'd nuzzle up against my leg\nAnd we'd both forget our scars\n\nChorus:\nBut now you're gone, and I'm alone\nMemories of you fill my home\nI miss your warmth, your gentle touch\nI miss you so damn much\n\nBridge:\nI know that you're not coming back\nAnd that's the hardest part\nBut I'll hold onto what we had\nAnd keep you in my heart\n\nChorus:\nBut now you're gone, and I'm alone\nMemories of you fill my home\nI miss your warmth, your gentle touch\nI miss you so damn much\n\nOutro:\nGoodbye my friend, my faithful guide\nYou'll always be right by my side\nI'll never forget the love we shared\nAnd the bond that we both bared.",
