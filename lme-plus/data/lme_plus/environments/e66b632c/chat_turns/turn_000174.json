  "content": "I actually learned a lot about composition and lighting techniques from the workshop. The well-known photographer who taught the workshop was really helpful in explaining the concepts in a way that was easy to understand. I especially struggled with understanding aperture at first, but by the end of the second day, I was able to take some amazing shots of the cityscape. Do you know if there are any other photography workshops or classes available in LA that might help me improve my skills?",
