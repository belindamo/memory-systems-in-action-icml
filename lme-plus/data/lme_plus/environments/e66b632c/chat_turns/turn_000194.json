I enjoy reading and taking short walks, and I'd like to incorporate those into my daily routine. I'm available to work from 9 am to 5 pm, but I'm more focused in the morning. I'd like to allocate at least 30 minutes each day for self-care, and I prefer to do it during my lunch break or right after work. I also try to maintain a daily journaling practice, so I'd like to fit that in somehow.",
