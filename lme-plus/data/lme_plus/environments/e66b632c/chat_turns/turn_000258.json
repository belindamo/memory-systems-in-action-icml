Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other anti-discrimination laws, discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and other factors still persists.\n\nIn some cases, people may face overt discrimination, such as being denied employment, promotions or equal pay because of their demographic characteristics. In other cases, discrimination can be more subtle, such as being subjected to less favorable working conditions than others, prejudice in performance evaluations, or social exclusion.\n\nMany organizations have implemented diversity and inclusion policies to combat workplace discrimination and promote equal opportunities for all employees. However, achieving true diversity and inclusion in the workplace requires continued effort, education, and awareness to address the unconscious biases and assumptions that can still exist.",
