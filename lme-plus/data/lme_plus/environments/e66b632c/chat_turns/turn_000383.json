  "content": "You're supporting a local roaster, and that's fantastic! Medium-roast coffees can be very versatile and pair well with a variety of brewing methods, including pour-over.\n\nThe pour-over method is a great way to bring out the nuances of a medium-roast coffee, as it allows for a high degree of control over the brewing process. The 1:17 ratio you're using is a great match for pour-over, as it allows for a clean and balanced extraction of the coffee's flavors.\n\nMedium-roast coffees often have a sweet and balanced flavor profile, with notes of chocolate, nuts, and fruit. The pour-over method can help to accentuate these flavors and bring out a smooth, velvety texture.\n\nI'm curious, what do you think it is about this particular roast that you enjoy? Is it the flavor profile, the acidity, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, have you experimented with different pour-over techniques, such as bloom time, pouring speed, or grind size, to see how they affect the flavor of your coffee?",
