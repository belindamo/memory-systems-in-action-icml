  "content": "I'm thinking of going to the Rocky Mountains, probably with 4-5 friends. Our budget is around $100-150 per person for the entire week, so we're looking for something pretty affordable. We'd love to have a hot tub and Wi-Fi, but it's not a deal-breaker if they're not available. And we're flexible with the dates, but we're thinking of going sometime in the next 2-3 months. By the way, the drive to the beach house today was really long, it took us around 5 hours with a stop for breakfast at a nice diner along the way.",
