Here are some tips to help you in your search:\n\n1. **Original copies are scarce**: Only 3,000-4,000 copies of the mono version were pressed in 1967, making it extremely rare. Be prepared for a challenge.\n2. **Check online marketplaces**:\n\t* eBay: Use specific keywords like \"Velvet Underground & Nico mono 1967\" or \"VU&N mono original pressing\" to find relevant listings. Be cautious of reproductions and high prices.\n\t* Discogs: This platform is a great resource for vinyl collectors. Filter your search by \"1967\" and \"mono\" to find relevant listings.\n\t* MusicStack: Another online marketplace where you can search for rare vinyl.\n3. **Specialty record stores and dealers**:\n\t* Visit local, independent record stores that specialize in rare and vintage vinyl. They might have a copy or know of someone who does.\n\t* Online stores like Academy Records (Brooklyn), Rough Trade (NYC), and Amoeba Music (CA) often carry rare vinyl.\n\t* Dealers like The Vinyl Factory, Vinyl Me, Please, and The Record Collector's Guild might have a copy or be able to find one for you.\n4. ** Vinyl collector communities and forums**:\n\t* Join online forums like Reddit's r/vinylcollectors, r/music, and r/vinyl, as well as Facebook groups like Vinyl Collectors Unite! or The Vinyl Community.\n\t* Post about your search and ask if anyone knows of a copy for sale or trade.\n5. **Auction houses and rare record dealers**:\n\t* Christie's, Sotheby's, and other reputable auction houses occasionally feature rare vinyl records, including the Velvet Underground & Nico mono pressing.\n\t* Dealers like Rare Record Price Guide, Vinyl Record Collector, and The Vinyl Exchange might have a copy or be able to find one for you.\n6. **Be prepared for a high price**:\n\t* In near-mint condition, a genuine 1967 mono pressing of The Velvet Underground & Nico can fetch prices upwards of $1,000 to $5,000 or more, depending on the condition and provenance.\n\t* Be cautious of reproductions or reissues masquerading as originals, and make sure to inspect the record and verify its authenticity before making a purchase.\n7. **Consider a reissue or alternative**:\n\t* If you're unable to find an original mono pressing, consider a high-quality reissue or a stereo pressing from 1967. These can still be valuable and enjoyable additions to your collection.\n\nRemember to stay patient, persistent, and vigilant in your search. Good luck, and happy hunting!"
