I have a few meetings and appointments already set, but I want to make sure I leave some time for self-care and relaxation. Speaking of which, yesterday was a crazy day - I had a doctor's appointment at 9 am, followed by a conference call at 11 am, and then a meeting with a potential client at 2 pm, and I still managed to squeeze in a 30-minute walk around the block to clear my head. Can you help me prioritize my tasks and create a balanced schedule for the week?"
