Please provide the following details:\n\n1. **Availability**: What are your available training days and hours per week? Are you available to train on weekdays, weekends, or a combination of both?\n2. **Frequency and duration**: How many times a week do you want to train for each activity, and how long do you want each session to last? For example, do you want to do yoga 3 times a week for 30 minutes each session?\n3. **Priority**: Are there any specific days or times when you need to prioritize one activity over others? For example, do you need to prioritize triathlon training on weekends?\n4. **Rest days**: How many rest days do you want to take per week?\n5. **Specific goals or events**: Are you training for a specific event or competition? If so, what's the date and what's your goal for that event?\n6. **Current fitness level**: What's your current fitness level for each activity? Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a personalized calendar that balances your sports activities and ensures you're making progress towards your goals.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider the following general principles when creating your schedule:\n\n* **Periodization**: Divide your training into specific periods or cycles to allow for variation in intensity and volume. This can help prevent plateaus and reduce the risk of injury.\n* **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of your training over time to continue making progress.\n* **Active recovery**: Incorporate low-intensity activities, such as yoga or easy cycling, on rest days to aid in recovery and maintain flexibility.\n\nLet's get started!",
