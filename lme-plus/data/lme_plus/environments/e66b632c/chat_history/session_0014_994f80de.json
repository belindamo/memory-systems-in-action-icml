      "content": "I'd like to discuss my Facebook performance. I've noticed that my followers have been decreasing slowly over the past few months, which is concerning. I think this is because I haven't been posting as frequently, and when I do post, it's usually just a link to my blog or something promotional. I need to work on creating more engaging, native content for Facebook, like videos and polls. However, I did have a post from a month ago, where I asked my followers to share their favorite books, that got 50 comments and 20 shares, which is a lot of engagement for me on Facebook."

      "content": "It's great that you're aware of the decline in your Facebook followers and are looking to revamp your content strategy.\n\n**Declining Followers:**\nA slow decline in followers can be concerning, but it's not uncommon, especially if you haven't been posting frequently or creating engaging content. Facebook's algorithm favors accounts that post high-quality, engaging content, so it's essential to focus on creating content that resonates with your audience.\n\n**Content Strategy:**\nYou're correct that posting links to your blog or promotional content can be perceived as less engaging. Facebook users are more likely to interact with native content, such as videos, polls, and questions that spark conversations. By creating more engaging content, you can increase interaction and reduce the likelihood of followers unfollowing your page.\n\n**Successful Post:**\nThe post where you asked your followers to share their favorite books is a great example of a successful engagement-driven post. By asking a question and encouraging users to share their thoughts, you created a sense of community and sparked a conversation. The 50 comments and 20 shares are a testament to the power of engaging content.\n\n**Actionable Insights:**\n\n1. **Increase posting frequency:** Aim to post at least 3-4 times a week to maintain a consistent presence on Facebook.\n2. **Create native, engaging content:** Focus on creating videos, polls, questions, and other interactive content that encourages engagement and sparks conversations.\n3. **Ask open-ended questions:** Ask questions that encourage users to share their thoughts and opinions, like the post about favorite books.\n4. **Use Facebook Groups:** Consider creating a Facebook Group related to your niche to foster a sense of community and encourage engagement.\n5. **Monitor Facebook Insights:** Keep an eye on your Facebook Insights to track your performance, identify areas for improvement, and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can revamp your Facebook content and attract more engagement from your audience.\n\nNow, let's discuss your TikTok performance. How have you been performing on TikTok, and what kind of content have you been creating?"
