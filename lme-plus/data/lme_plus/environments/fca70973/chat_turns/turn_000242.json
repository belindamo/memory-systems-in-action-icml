But I can definitely help you remember to set a reminder for yourself!\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n* Pull out your phone or computer and open your calendar or reminder app.\n* Create a new event or reminder for 2 pm today with the title \"Volleyball Game - The Spikers\".\n* Set the reminder to go off 30 minutes to 1 hour before the game so you have time to get ready and head to the location.\n\nThat way, you'll get a reminder to head to your game and have a great time with your team, The Spikers!\n\nIf you need any more help or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",
