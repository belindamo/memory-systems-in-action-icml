Here are some tips to help you keep your cookies fresh and delicious:\n\n1. **Cool cookies completely:** Before storing, make sure the cookies are completely cool to prevent moisture from building up and causing them to become soft or soggy.\n2. **Store in an airtight container:** Transfer the cooled cookies to an airtight container, such as a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. This will help keep air, moisture, and other contaminants out.\n3. **Room temperature storage:** Store the cookies at room temperature (around 68\u00b0F to 72\u00b0F or 20\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C) for up to 3 to 5 days. This is ideal for soft-baked cookies like snickerdoodles.\n4. **Refrigerate for longer storage:** If you want to keep the cookies fresh for a longer period, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 7 to 10 days. This is perfect for cookies that are more crunchy or crispy.\n5. **Freeze for longer-term storage:** For longer-term storage, place the cookies in a single layer on a baking sheet, and then transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. Store them in the freezer for up to 2 to 3 months. When you're ready to enjoy, simply thaw them at room temperature or reheat them in the oven or microwave.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Layer cookies with parchment paper:** When storing cookies in a container, layer them with parchment paper to prevent them from sticking together.\n* **Keep cookies away from strong-smelling foods:** Cookies can absorb odors from nearby foods, so store them away from strong-smelling foods like onions, garlic, or fish.\n* **Use wax paper or parchment paper:** If you need to stack cookies, use wax paper or parchment paper to separate them. This will prevent them from sticking together and make them easier to separate.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you'll be able to enjoy your delicious vegan snickerdoodle cookies for a longer period!\n\nDo you have any other questions about storing cookies or vegan baking in general?",
