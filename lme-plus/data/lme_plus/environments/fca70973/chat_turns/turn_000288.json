  "content": "Pizza Hut's buffalo wings are a popular item on their menu, and it's great that you're considering customizing the level of spiciness to your taste.\n\nYes, you can definitely ask for a customized level of spiciness for your buffalo wings. Here are some options you can request:\n\n1. **Mild**: If you found the wings too spicy last time, you can ask for a mild version, which will have a much lower level of heat.\n2. **Medium**: If you want to tone down the heat but still have some kick, you can ask for a medium level of spiciness.\n3. **No sauce**: If you want to avoid the buffalo sauce altogether, you can ask for the wings to be served without sauce or with a different sauce, like BBQ or Honey Mustard.\n4. **Extra sauce on the side**: If you want to control the level of spiciness yourself, you can ask for the buffalo sauce on the side, so you can add as much or as little as you like.\n\nWhen ordering, you can say something like:\n\n\"I'd like to order a Veggie Lovers' Pizza with a whole wheat crust, extra mushrooms, extra onions, and a lighter layer of part-skim mozzarella cheese. Can I also get an order of buffalo wings, but can you make them medium spicy instead of hot? Or can I get the sauce on the side?\"\n\nBy customizing the level of spiciness, you'll be able to enjoy your buffalo wings without feeling overwhelmed by the heat.",
