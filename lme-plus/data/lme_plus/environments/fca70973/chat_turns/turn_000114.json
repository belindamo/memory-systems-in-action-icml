  "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed charges against Do Kwon, the founder of Singapore-based firm Terraform Labs, and his company, accusing them of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. The collapse of Terra Luna and TerraUSD tokens is believed to have cost investors over $40bn globally. The SEC claims that Kwon and his company raised billions of dollars from investors by selling them \"an interconnected suite of crypto asset securities\" with many transactions being unregistered. The complaint also alleges that Kwon and Terraform misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD and made false claims that the tokens would increase in value. The value of the token and its linked Luna cryptocurrency plunged to close to zero in May last year, triggering a sell-off in major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether. The SEC accuses Terraform and Kwon of perpetuating a fraudulent scheme that led to the loss of at least $40 billion of market value. Kwon faces charges of fraud and breaches of capital markets law in South Korea, where an arrest warrant has been issued for him.",
