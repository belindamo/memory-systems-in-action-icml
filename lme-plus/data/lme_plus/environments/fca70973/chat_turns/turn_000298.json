Here are some tips to help you care for your handmade ceramic vases:\n\n**General Care:**\n\n1. **Handle with care:** Be gentle when handling your ceramic vase, as it can be fragile. Avoid dropping or bumping it, as it can crack or break.\n2. **Avoid extreme temperatures:** Don't expose your vase to sudden or extreme temperature changes, such as placing it near a heating vent, oven, or freezer.\n3. **Keep it clean:** Dust your vase regularly with a soft, dry cloth to prevent dirt and grime from accumulating.\n4. **Avoid harsh chemicals:** Never use abrasive cleaners, bleach, or strong chemicals, as they can damage the glaze or ceramic material.\n\n**Cleaning and Maintenance:**\n\n1. **Dusting:** Use a soft, dry cloth to dust your vase. For more thorough cleaning, mix a small amount of mild soap with warm water, and use a soft-bristled brush to gently scrub the vase. Rinse with clean water and dry with a soft cloth.\n2. **Avoid water spots:** To prevent water spots, dry your vase thoroughly after cleaning. You can also use a microfiber cloth to wipe down the vase and prevent streaks.\n3. **Glaze maintenance:** If your vase has a glossy glaze, you can use a gentle glass cleaner and a soft cloth to clean it. Avoid using abrasive materials or scrubbers, as they can scratch the glaze.\n\n**Display and Storage:**\n\n1. **Stable surface:** Display your vase on a stable, level surface to prevent it from tipping over.\n2. **Avoid direct sunlight:** While some ceramic vases can tolerate direct sunlight, it's best to place them near a window with filtered sunlight or use a UV-filtering window treatment to prevent fading.\n3. **Storage:** If you need to store your vase, wrap it carefully in bubble wrap or a soft cloth to prevent chipping or breaking. Store it in a dry, cool place away from direct sunlight.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Avoid using your vase as a planter:** Ceramic vases are not designed for holding plants or water, as the moisture can seep into the ceramic material and cause damage.\n2. **Check for damage:** Regularly inspect your vase for signs of damage, such as cracks, chips, or crazing (small cracks in the glaze). If you notice any damage, consider consulting a professional ceramic restorer.\n3. **Preserve the artist's intent:** As you've created the vase yourself, you know the thought and effort that went into it. Take pride in your creation and treat it with care to preserve its beauty and sentimental value.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your handmade ceramic vase for years to come. Remember to appreciate and cherish your artwork, and it will continue to bring joy and beauty to your space.",
