  "content": "The modifications I mentioned are designed to make the poses more accessible and comfortable for your body, while still targeting the hip and hamstring areas. Here's a breakdown of the modifications for Hanumanasana and Gomukhasana:\n\n**Hanumanasana (Monkey Pose) Modification**\n\n* **Block under the back thigh:** Place a block or a folded blanket under the back thigh, just above the knee. This will help to:\n\t+ Reduce the depth of the stretch in the front hip and groin area.\n\t+ Allow you to maintain a more neutral spine and avoid compressing the lower back.\n\t+ Make it easier to lift the chest and shoulders, keeping the pose more open and relaxed.\n* **Bent front knee:** Instead of straightening the front leg, keep the knee slightly bent (around 10-15 degrees). This will:\n\t+ Reduce the intensity of the stretch in the back hip and glutes.\n\t+ Allow you to maintain control and balance in the pose.\n\t+ Make it easier to engage the core and maintain proper alignment.\n\n**Gomukhasana (Cow Face Pose) Modification**\n\n* **Block under the sitting bones:** Place a block or a folded blanket under the sitting bones, which will:\n\t+ Help to lift the hips and reduce the pressure on the knees.\n\t+ Make it easier to lengthen the spine and maintain a neutral pelvis.\n\t+ Allow you to focus on the stretch in the hips and glutes rather than the knees.\n* **Knees bent at 90 degrees:** Instead of straightening the legs, keep the knees bent at a 90-degree angle. This will:\n\t+ Reduce the intensity of the stretch in the hips and glutes.\n\t+ Make it easier to maintain control and balance in the pose.\n\t+ Allow you to focus on the stretch in the hips and glutes rather than the knees.\n\nAdditional Tips:\n\n* Use a strap or towel to deepen the stretch or maintain proper alignment, if needed.\n* Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine throughout the pose.\n* Breathe deeply and slowly, focusing on relaxing the muscles and releasing tension.\n* If you experience any discomfort or pain, come out of the pose immediately and modify further or rest.\n\nBy incorporating these modifications, you can make the Deep Hip and Hamstring Opening routine more accessible and enjoyable, while still targeting the areas you want to focus on.",
