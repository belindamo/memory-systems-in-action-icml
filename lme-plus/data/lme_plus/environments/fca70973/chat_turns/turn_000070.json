For a ricotta and Parmesan filling, you'll want a sauce that complements the creamy, cheesy goodness without overpowering it.

Cook until the butter turns golden brown and fragrant. Toss with cooked ravioli, and top with grated Parmesan cheese.\n2. **Creamy and Rich:** **Carbonara Sauce**: Whip up a classic Carbonara by whisking together 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, and 1/4 cup of cooked bacon or pancetta. Toss with cooked ravioli, and add some black pepper to finish.\n3. **Classic and Timeless:** **Tomato Cream Sauce**: Cook down 1 cup of canned crushed tomatoes with 1/4 cup of heavy cream, 1 tablespoon of butter, and a pinch of salt. Simmer until the sauce thickens slightly. Toss with cooked ravioli, and top with grated Parmesan cheese.\n4. **Light and Fresh:** **Olive Oil and Garlic Sauce**: Saut\u00e9 2-3 cloves of garlic in 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil until fragrant.
