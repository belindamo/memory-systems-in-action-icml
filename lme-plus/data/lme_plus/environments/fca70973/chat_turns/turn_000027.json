No single weapon was considered to be the most effective overall, as different weapons were designed to serve different purposes. For example, maces were effective against armored enemies, bows and crossbows were effective in ranged combat, and swords were effective in close combat. Knights and soldiers would have used a range of weapons and strategies, depending on the battlefield and the enemy they were facing.",
