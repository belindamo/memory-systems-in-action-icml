  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases, and rankings and perceptions of \"highly-regarded\" MLIS programs can vary depending on various factors such as location, specialization, curriculum, and faculty. Some universities may be considered \"highly-regarded\" by one person or institution but not by another. \n\nHowever, there are some universities that are commonly recognized as having excellent MLIS programs by various publications, organizations, and professionals in the field. These universities typically have faculty members with a strong research background, a well-rounded curriculum, and a reputation for producing successful graduates. Some examples of universities with highly-regarded MLIS programs based on rankings and reviews include:\n\n- University of Washington Information School\n- University of Michigan School of Information\n- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science\n- Rutgers University School of Communication and Information\n- University of Texas at Austin School of Information \n\nIt's important to note that reputation and rankings should not be the only factor you consider when choosing a program. Other aspects such as location, cost, curriculum, and opportunities for practical experience and networking are also essential to consider.",
