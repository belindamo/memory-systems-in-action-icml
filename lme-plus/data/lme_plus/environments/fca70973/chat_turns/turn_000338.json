  "content": "I'm thinking of doing some day hikes in Yosemite Valley and maybe explore the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias. I'll probably take a day to drive to Glacier Point and enjoy the scenic views. I've heard the road to Glacier Point is closed in the winter, so I'm glad I'm going during a time when it's open. Speaking of road trips, I've been keeping track of my fuel efficiency since my last road trip 6 weeks ago, and I'm hoping to get good mileage on this trip as well.",
