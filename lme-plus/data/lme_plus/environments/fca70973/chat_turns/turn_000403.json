  "content": "Supervenience is a philosophical concept that refers to the relationship between two sets of properties or qualities. In the context of consciousness, supervenience refers to the idea that mental properties or qualities are \"supervenient\" on, or dependent upon, physical properties or qualities.\n\nAccording to the theory of supervenience, mental properties or qualities, such as thoughts, feelings, and sensations, are dependent upon, or \"supervenient\" on, physical properties or qualities, such as the activity of neurons and other cells in the brain. This means that changes in the physical properties or qualities of the brain should be accompanied by corresponding changes in the mental properties or qualities of an individual.\n\nThe concept of supervenience is often discussed in relation to the mind-body problem, which is the philosophical question of how the mind and the brain are related and how mental states and processes can arise from, or be realized in, the physical structure and activity of the brain. The theory of supervenience is one way of addressing this problem and suggests that the mind and the brain are closely interconnected, with mental states and processes being dependent upon, or supervenient upon, physical states and processes in the brain.",
