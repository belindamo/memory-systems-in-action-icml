Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect dough consistency:\n\n1. **Start with the right ratio:** In the Snickerdoodle Cookies recipe, the ratio of wet to dry ingredients is approximately 1:2. This means that for every 1 part wet ingredients (almond milk, vegan butter substitute, eggs, etc.), you'll have 2 parts dry ingredients (flour, sugar, etc.). This ratio will help you achieve a tender and chewy cookie.\n2. **Check the dough's moisture level:** After mixing the wet and dry ingredients, stop the mixer and inspect the dough. It should be slightly sticky, but not too wet. If it's too dry, add a little more almond milk (about 1 tablespoon at a time). If it's too wet, add a little more flour (about 1 tablespoon at a time).\n3. **Use the \"squeeze test\":** Take a small amount of dough and squeeze it gently between your thumb and index finger. If it holds its shape and doesn't crumble, it's ready. If it falls apart, it's too dry. If it's too sticky, it's too wet.\n4. **Look for the right texture:** The dough should be smooth, pliable, and slightly firm to the touch. It should not be too soft or too hard. If you're unsure, try refrigerating the dough for 30 minutes to firm it up before baking.\n5. **Don't overmix:** Overmixing can lead to a tough, dense cookie. Mix the ingredients just until they come together in a ball, then stop.\n6. **Chill the dough:** Chilling the dough will help the cookies to retain their shape and bake up with a better texture. Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours before baking.\n\nSome common signs of incorrect dough consistency include:\n\n* Too dry: The dough is crumbly, falls apart easily, or has a sandy texture.\n* Too wet: The dough is sticky, soggy, or has a batter-like consistency.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve the perfect dough consistency for your Snickerdoodle Cookies with Almond Milk. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and add a little more almond milk or flour as needed, rather than adding too much and ending up with an unpleasant texture.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!",
