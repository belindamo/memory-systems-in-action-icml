Don't worry too much about the outcome \u2013 it's all about expressing yourself and exploring your creativity.\n\nAs you start making your mark on the canvas, remember to let go of any self-criticism or expectations. This is a judgement-free zone, and it's okay if your first mark isn't perfect. In fact, it's often the imperfections that make art interesting and unique.\n\nIf you need any more encouragement or guidance, I'll be here, cheering you on from the digital sidelines. Otherwise, go wild, get creative, and make some art!\n\n(And don't forget to take a step back, admire your work, and say, \"Wow, I did that!\")",
