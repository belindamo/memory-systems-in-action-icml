  "content": "The 1975 is an amazing live act! While they're known for their blend of pop, rock, and electronica, they do have albums that share some similarities with Arctic Monkeys' indie rock sound. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**The 1975's indie rock-infused albums:**\n\n1. **The 1975 (2013)**: Their self-titled debut album has a more indie rock-oriented sound, with songs like \"Chocolate\", \"The City\", and \"Sex\" showcasing their ability to craft catchy, guitar-driven hooks.\n2. **I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016)**: This album is a bit more experimental, but tracks like \"The Sound\", \"Somebody Else\", and \"She's American\" have a more indie rock flavor, with a focus on guitar riffs and driving rhythms.\n\nThese albums might appeal to you if you enjoy Arctic Monkeys' indie rock sound. However, keep in mind that The 1975's overall style is more eclectic and incorporates a wide range of influences, from pop and electronica to funk and R&B.\n\n**Specific songs that might appeal to Arctic Monkeys fans:**\n\n* \"Girls\" (from The 1975) - A catchy, indie rock-infused track with a focus on guitar hooks and witty lyrics.\n* \"The Sound\" (from I Like It When You Sleep...) - A funk-infused indie rock track with a catchy chorus and guitar riffs reminiscent of Arctic Monkeys.\n* \"A Change of Heart\" (from I Like It When You Sleep...) - A more introspective, indie rock-oriented track with a focus on lyrics and melody.\n\nIf you enjoyed their live performance, you might also want to explore their newer album, **Notes on a Conditional Form (2020)**, which features a more experimental sound, but still has some indie rock elements.\n\nThe 1975's music often explores themes of love, relationships, and social commentary, which might appeal to fans of Arctic Monkeys' witty, observational songwriting. Give these recommendations a spin and see what you think!",
