In the 1980s, you could buy a pre-owned Paul Newman Daytona for around $5,000. Today, prices can range from $100,000 to over $1 million, depending on the condition and rarity.\n2. **Patek Philippe Calibre 89**: Produced in 1989 to commemorate the company's 150th anniversary, only 1,000 pieces were made. In the 1990s, the watch sold for around $100,000. Today, it can fetch upwards of $1.5 million to $2 million at auction.\n3. **Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar**: This iconic model, designed by G\u00e9rald Genta, was introduced in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the watch sold for around $10,000. Today, prices can range from $50,000 to over $100,000, depending on the condition and materials.\n4. **Omega Speedmaster \"Moonwatch\"**: This iconic chronograph was worn by astronauts during the Apollo missions. In the 1970s and 1980s, you could buy a pre-owned Moonwatch for around $1,000 to $5,000. Today, prices can range from $10,000 to over $50,000, depending on the condition and rarity.\n5. **Rolex Submariner \"Hulk\"**: This limited-edition Submariner, produced from 2010 to 2019, has seen a significant increase in value since its release. The watch originally retailed for around $8,000. Today, prices can range from $12,000 to over $20,000, depending on the condition and availability.\n\nThese examples illustrate how certain luxury watches can appreciate in value over time, making them a solid investment opportunity. However, it's essential to remember that not all luxury watches will appreciate in value, and some may even depreciate.\n\nWhen it comes to designer handbags, some limited-edition or vintage pieces can also appreciate in value, but the market is generally more volatile and subject to trends. For example:\n\n1. **Herm\u00e8s Birkin**: Certain limited-edition or exotic leather Birkin bags can appreciate in value over time, with prices ranging from $10,000 to over $100,000.\n2. **Chanel Classic Flap**: Vintage or limited-edition Chanel Classic Flap handbags can appreciate in value, with prices ranging from $5,000 to over $20,000.\n\nKeep in mind that the resale value of luxury items, whether watches or handbags, ultimately depends on factors like condition, rarity, market demand, and provenance.\n\nI hope these examples help you better understand the potential appreciation in value of luxury watches!",
