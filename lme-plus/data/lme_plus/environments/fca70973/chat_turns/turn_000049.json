Here are some examples to get you started:\n\n1. **A bold stroke**: Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle and make a sweeping, expressive stroke across the canvas. This can be a loose, gestural line that varies in thickness and direction.\n2. **A dynamic shape**: Create a geometric shape, like a circle, triangle, or square, but make it irregular and expressive. You can use a large brush or a palette knife to apply thick, heavy strokes.\n3. **A splatter**: Flick or drizzle paint onto the canvas to create a dynamic, high-energy splatter. This can be a great way to add texture and visual interest to your piece.\n4. **A messy blob**: Just plop a glob of paint onto the canvas and spread it around with your brush or palette knife. This can create a interesting, organic shape that you can build upon.\n5. **A loose scribble**: Hold your brush vertically and make quick, loose scribbles across the canvas. This can create a sense of movement and energy.\n\nRemember, the key is to be bold and expressive. Don't worry too much about creating a \"perfect\" mark \u2013 it's the imperfections that will make your piece interesting.\n\nHere's a fun trick to get you started:\n\n**Blind mark-making**: Close your eyes, hold your brush or palette knife, and make a mark on the canvas without looking. This will help you let go of any preconceived notions and tap into your subconscious creativity.\n\nOnce you've made your initial mark, take a step back, and respond to it with another mark, and another, and another. Let the paint guide you, and see where the process takes you.\n\nDo you feel more comfortable giving it a try now?",
