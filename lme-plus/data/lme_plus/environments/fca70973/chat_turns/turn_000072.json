  "content": "Brown butter and sage sauce is a fantastic choice! It's a classic Italian combination that pairs beautifully with the creamy ricotta and Parmesan filling. Sage is a wonderful herb that adds a warm, earthy flavor to many dishes. It's especially lovely with the nutty, caramel notes of brown butter.\n\nWhen working with sage, keep in mind that a little goes a long way. Fresh sage can be quite potent, so start with a small amount and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove the flavor once it's added.\n\nHere are a few tips for working with sage:\n\n1. **Choose fresh sage**: Fresh sage has a more delicate flavor than dried sage, and it's perfect for this sauce. Simply chop the leaves finely and add them to the butter as it's browning.\n2. **Don't over-brown the butter**: Brown butter can quickly go from nutty to burnt, so keep an eye on the heat and stir constantly. You want the butter to reach a golden brown color and have a nutty aroma.\n3. **Add the sage at the right time**: Add the chopped sage to the butter when it's almost fully browned. This will help the flavors meld together and prevent the sage from burning.\n4. **Taste and adjust**: As with any sauce, taste and adjust the seasoning as you go. You may want to add a pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon juice, or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese to balance the flavors.\n\nNow, go ahead and give that brown butter and sage sauce a try! I think you'll find it's a perfect complement to your homemade ravioli. Buon appetito, and I hope you enjoy every bite!",
