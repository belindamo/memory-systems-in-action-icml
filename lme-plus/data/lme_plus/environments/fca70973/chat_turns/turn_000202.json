A global color token is a design element that is used consistently across a product or brand's visual identity. It can refer to a specific color or a set of colors that are used throughout the product or brand's user interface, marketing materials, and other visual assets. These colors are often stored in a design system or style guide and can be easily referenced and reused throughout the design process to ensure consistency in the visual identity of the product or brand.",
