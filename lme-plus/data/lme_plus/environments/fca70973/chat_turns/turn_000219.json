  "content": "I have a cable connection with Comcast, and my current internet speed is supposed to be 150 Mbps. I've got a bunch of devices connected, including my smart TV, laptop, wireless speaker system, and a few smartphones. I've been experiencing slow speeds and dropped connections, especially in the evenings. I haven't changed anything in my home or network setup recently, but I do have a lot of walls and furniture between my router and devices.",
