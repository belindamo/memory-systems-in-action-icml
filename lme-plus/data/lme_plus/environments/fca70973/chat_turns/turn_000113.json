As a result the term cryptocrash trended online.\n\n\"I am heartbroken about the pain my invention has brought on all of you,\" Mr Kwon said at the time.\n\nThe SEC complaint, which included other allegations, did not state where Mr Kwon was located.\n\nIn December, South Korean authorities, who have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Kwon, said they believed he was in Serbia.\n\nMr Kwon had previously denied that he was in hiding, but did not reveal his whereabouts.\n\n\"For any government agency that has shown interest to communicate, we are in full cooperation and we don't have anything to hide,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nMr Kwon faces charges of fraud and breaches of capital markets law in his home country of South Korea.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission is suing the creator of the collapsed Terra blockchain protocol for securities fraud following last year\u2019s meltdown that sent reverberations throughout the cryptocurrency industry. According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon \u201cperpetuated a fraudulent scheme that led to the loss of at least $40 billion of market value.\u201d\n\nLast September, South Korea issued a warrant for Kwon\u2019s arrest, while Interpol reportedly issued a \u201cred notice\u201d for him or a call to international law enforcement agencies to \u201clocate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.\u201d Despite Kwon insisting that he\u2019s \u201cnot on the run,\u201d the complaint notes that \u201chis current address is unknown.\u201d South Korean police reportedly traveled to Serbia in an attempt to track him down earlier this month.\n\nKwon co-founded Terraform Labs in 2018 with Daniel Shin and went on to release the cryptocurrency Luna later that year. The company launched its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD in 2020, which was linked to Luna to help maintain its dollar peg. That\u2019s why when TerraUSD started crashing last year, so did Luna, vaporizing the billions of dollars hopeful investors threw at the cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe SEC accuses Terraform and Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of TerraUSD, noting they failed to inform investors that the price of the coin falling below its dollar peg \u201cwould spell doom for the entire Terraform ecosystem.\u201d Additionally, the agency claims that Kwon and Terraform falsely told their customers that Chai, the Korean electronic mobile payment app, used the Terraform blockchain to process payments.\n\n\u201cIn reality, Chai payments did not use the blockchain to process and settle payments,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cDefendants deceptively replicated Chai payments onto the Terraform blockchain in order to make it appear that they were occurring on the Terraform blockchain, when, in fact, Chai payments were made through traditional means.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe allege that Terraform and Do Kwon failed to provide the public with full, fair, and truthful disclosure as required for a host of crypto asset securities, most notably for LUNA and Terra USD,\u201d SEC Chair Gary Gensler says in a statement. \u201cWe also allege that they committed fraud by repeating false and misleading statements to build trust before causing devastating losses for investors.\u201d",
