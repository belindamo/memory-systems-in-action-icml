Here's why:\n\n**Why engage the core?**\n\n1. **Stability and balance:** Your core muscles, including your abdominals, obliques, and lower back muscles, help maintain stability and balance in the pose. This is especially important in poses like Hanumanasana and Gomukhasana, where you're working with deep hip flexion and external rotation.\n2. **Support for the spine:** Engaging your core helps to maintain a neutral spine, which is essential for protecting your lower back and preventing unnecessary strain. When your core is active, it supports the natural curvature of your spine, reducing the risk of compression or over-arching.\n3. **Efficient energy transmission:** When your core is engaged, it helps to transmit energy efficiently throughout your body. This means that you can generate more power and control in your movements, making it easier to maintain proper alignment and depth in the pose.\n4. **Reducing strain on joints:** By engaging your core, you're distributing the weight and tension more evenly throughout your body, reducing the strain on your joints. This is particularly important in poses that involve deep flexion or external rotation, where the joints can be more susceptible to strain.\n\n**How to engage your core correctly:**\n\n1. **Start with a neutral spine:** Before engaging your core, make sure you have a neutral spine, with your ears, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles in alignment.\n2. **Activate your transverse abdominis:** Imagine drawing your belly button towards your spine, or engaging your pelvic floor muscles as if you're stopping the flow of urine. This will help to activate your transverse abdominis muscle, which is the deepest abdominal muscle that wraps around your spine and pelvis.\n3. **Engage your obliques:** As you inhale, imagine your ribcage expanding and your obliques (the muscles on the sides of your abdomen) contracting. This will help to support your spine and maintain stability in the pose.\n4. **Feel the connection:** As you engage your core, feel the connection between your pelvis, lower back, and abdomen. Imagine a band of energy surrounding your midsection, supporting and stabilizing your body.\n5. **Maintain engagement throughout the pose:** Once you've engaged your core, maintain it throughout the pose. Avoid releasing the engagement as you move or breathe, as this can cause your body to compensate and put unnecessary strain on your joints.\n\nTips for engaging your core in Hanumanasana and Gomukhasana:\n\n* In Hanumanasana, focus on engaging your core as you lift your chest and shoulders, keeping your spine long and neutral.\n* In Gomukhasana, engage your core as you sit down, maintaining a neutral spine and avoiding collapsing forward.\n* Use your breath to help engage your core, inhaling to lengthen and exhaling to deepen the engagement.\n\nBy incorporating these tips into your practice, you'll be able to engage your core correctly and experience the benefits of increased stability, support, and control in your yoga practice.",
