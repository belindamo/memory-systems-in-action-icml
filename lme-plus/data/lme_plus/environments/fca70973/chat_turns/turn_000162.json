  "content": "I'm sorry, I don't have an up-to-date information about catfish production in Africa. However, I can tell you that catfish farming is a major aquaculture industry in many African countries, such as Nigeria, Egypt, and Senegal, among others. It's an important source of food, employment, and income for many people in rural communities. The exact amount of catfish produced per year in Africa would likely depend on factors such as farming techniques, disease outbreaks, and market demand. If you want to learn more about it, you can visit the website of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) or other organizations that track global fish production statistics.",
