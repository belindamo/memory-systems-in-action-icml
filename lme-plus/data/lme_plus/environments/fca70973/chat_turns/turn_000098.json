The rise of audiobooks is definitely an interesting topic, and it's fascinating to hear about the industry expert's insights on how it's changing the way people consume books.\n\nAudiobooks have become increasingly popular in recent years, and it's clear that they're here to stay. With the rise of smart speakers, streaming services, and mobile devices, it's easier than ever for people to access and enjoy audiobooks. The convenience and flexibility of audiobooks have made them appealing to a wide range of readers, from commuters to busy professionals to people who prefer to multitask while \"reading.\"\n\nIt's interesting to think about how audiobooks might impact the publishing industry more broadly. On one hand, audiobooks offer a new revenue stream for publishers and authors, as well as a way to reach new audiences. On the other hand, the rise of audiobooks might also lead to changes in the way books are written, edited, and produced. For example, authors might need to consider the audio experience when writing their books, and publishers might need to invest in high-quality narration and production.\n\nDon't worry about not getting to network with the panelists afterwards \u2013 it's not always easy to make connections in a busy event setting. But it's great that you're planning to attend more events in the future and make connections in the industry.
