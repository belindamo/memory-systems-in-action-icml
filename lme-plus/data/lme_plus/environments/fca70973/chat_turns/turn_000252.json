That's a great foundation to build on.\n\nNow, let's talk serves! A strong serve can be a game-changer in tennis. Here are some tips to help you improve your serves:\n\n1. **Stance and Footwork**: Make sure you're standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, with your body facing the net. Take a small step forward with your non-dominant foot as you toss the ball.\n2. **Toss Consistency**: Practice your toss to ensure it's consistent and at the right height. Aim for a spot just in front of your dominant eye.\n3. **Racquet Angle**: Experiment with different racquet angles to find what works best for you. A slightly closed racquet face can help generate more power.\n4. **Wrist Snap**: Use your wrist to generate power and spin. Snap your wrist forward as you make contact with the ball.\n5. **Follow-Through**: Complete your serve with a full follow-through, keeping your arm extended and your racquet pointing towards the target.\n6. **Practice Variations**: Practice different types of serves, such as flat serves, topspin serves, and slice serves. This will make it harder for your opponents to anticipate your serve.\n7. **Video Analysis**: Record yourself serving and analyze your technique. This can help you identify areas for improvement.\n8. **Drills and Exercises**: Practice serving drills, such as serving with your non-dominant hand or serving with your eyes closed (to focus on feel and muscle memory).\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect! Work on these tips with your coach, Mark, and you'll be acing your opponents in no time!\n\nGood luck with your tennis lesson on Saturday, and I hope you crush your serves!",
