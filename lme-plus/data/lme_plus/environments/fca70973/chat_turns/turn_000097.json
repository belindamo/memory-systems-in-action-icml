  "content": "I did get to ask a question during the Q&A session. I was curious about how the panelists thought the rise of audiobooks would impact the publishing industry, and one of the industry experts shared some interesting insights on how audiobooks are changing the way people consume books. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to network with the panelists afterwards, as the event was quite busy and I had to rush to another commitment. But I'm hoping to attend more events like this in the future and make some connections in the industry.",
