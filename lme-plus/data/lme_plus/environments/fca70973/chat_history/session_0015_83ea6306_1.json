They offer a range of plans, including coverage for dental, vision, and travel insurance.\n2. **Other private insurance providers**: You can also explore other private insurance companies, such as Allianz, Sun Life, or Manulife, which offer international student insurance plans.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* Make sure to research and compare the coverage and costs of different insurance options to find the best fit for your needs and budget.\n* Keep in mind that some insurance plans may have a waiting period before coverage begins, so plan accordingly.\n* You may need to provide proof of insurance when you arrive at UBC or apply for the BC MSP.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. Review the UBC iMED website for more information on the plan and enrollment process.\n2. Research and compare private insurance options to supplement your iMED coverage.\n3.
