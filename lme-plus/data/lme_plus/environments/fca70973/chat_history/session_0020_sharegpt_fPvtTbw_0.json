      "content": "Yes, I am familiar with the concept of a global color token in the context of design systems and branding theming. A global color token is a design element that is used consistently across a product or brand's visual identity. It can refer to a specific color or a set of colors that are used throughout the product or brand's user interface, marketing materials, and other visual assets. These colors are often stored in a design system or style guide and can be easily referenced and reused throughout the design process to ensure consistency in the visual identity of the product or brand."

You can also use color adjusting tools such as color picker to adjust the tints.\n\nPlease note that the color values provided here are just examples, and the actual values may vary depending on the specific design system and branding guidelines."

You can use color adjusting tools such as color picker to generate the new value.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example, and the actual value may vary depending on the specific design system and branding guidelines."
