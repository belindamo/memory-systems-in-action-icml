The streets are full of feline creatures of all shapes and sizes, and they seem to be organizing themselves into a formidable force. You must find a way to stop them before it's too late.\n\nYou stand in the middle of a bustling city, surrounded by towering buildings and busy streets. The sound of meowing is everywhere, and you can see cats of all sizes darting in and out of alleys and buildings. There is a sense of urgency in the air, and you know that time is of the essence. What do you do?"

A nearby pet store: You could try to break into the pet store and grab something useful. You see a variety of items in the window, including fish tanks, bird cages, and scratching posts.\n2. A construction site: You notice a construction site nearby. Perhaps you could find a hammer or some other tool that could serve as a weapon.\n3. An abandoned alleyway: You see a dark alleyway that looks like it hasn't been used in a while. It's possible there could be something useful hidden away there.\n\nWhat do you do?"

Cats are darting back and forth, hissing and spitting at each other. Some of them are even attacking humans who get too close.\n\nWhen you arrive at the construction site, you see that it's been abandoned for some time. The equipment is rusty and covered in dust, but you're determined to find something useful. You notice a pile of tools in the corner, including hammers, wrenches, and saws.\n\nWhat do you do?"

As you look around, you notice that there are a few other hammers scattered around the site.\n\nJust then, you hear a loud meowing noise coming from outside. You peek out the window and see a group of cats approaching the construction site. They seem to have spotted you, and they're not happy about your presence.\n\nWhat do you do?"
