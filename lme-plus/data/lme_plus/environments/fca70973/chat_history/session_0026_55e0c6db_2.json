Use the same amount called for in the recipe.\n* **Basil**: Basil has a sweeter, more aromatic flavor than cilantro.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "**Ground Ginger vs. Fresh Ginger:**\n\nYou can definitely use ground ginger as a substitute in this recipe. Since ground ginger is more concentrated than fresh ginger, use about half the amount called for in the recipe. So, instead of 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, use about 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger. Keep in mind that ground ginger may not provide the same depth of flavor as fresh ginger, but it'll still work well.\n\n**Roasting Vegetables:**\n\nRoasting vegetables brings out their natural sweetness and pairs beautifully with the Indian-inspired quinoa bowl. Here's a basic guide to roasting vegetables:\n\n**Step 1: Choose Your Vegetables**\n\nSelect your favorite vegetables, such as:\n\n* Cauliflower\n* Broccoli\n* Carrots\n* Bell peppers\n* Brussels sprouts\n* Sweet potatoes\n\n**Step 2: Prep the Vegetables**\n\n* Cut or chop the vegetables into bite-sized pieces.\n* Remove any seeds or stems (e.g., bell peppers).\n* Peel the vegetables if desired (e.g., carrots).\n\n**Step 3: Toss with Oil and Spices**\n\n* In a bowl, toss the prepared vegetables with:\n\t+ 2-3 tablespoons of oil (e.g., olive, avocado, or grapeseed)\n\t+ Salt and pepper, to taste\n\t+ Any additional spices you like (e.g., cumin, coriander, paprika)\n\n**Step 4: Roast in the Oven**\n\n* Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n* Spread the vegetable mixture in a single layer on a baking sheet.\n* Roast in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and lightly caramelized.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can roast vegetables in advance and store them in the refrigerator for up to a day.\n* If using sweet potatoes, they may take longer to roast (about 40-45 minutes).\n* Feel free to add other aromatics like onions, garlic, or lemon slices to the roasting pan for added flavor.\n\nNow, go ahead and roast those veggies to perfection!"
