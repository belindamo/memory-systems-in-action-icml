Yes, restaurant portions can sometimes be smaller than expected, especially when you're paying a premium price.\n\nThe good news is that making green curry at home can be very cost-effective. With a few simple ingredients, you can create a delicious and authentic-tasting green curry that's likely to be larger in portion size and more budget-friendly.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of the costs involved in making green curry at home:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs: $3-$4\n* 2 cups mixed vegetables (bell peppers, bamboo shoots, Thai basil): $2-$3\n* 2 tablespoons Thai green curry paste: $1-$2\n* 2 cups coconut milk: $2-$3\n* 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes: $1-$2\n* Fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, salt, and spices: $1-$2\n* Steamed rice: $0.50-$1 (depending on the type and quantity)\n\n**Total cost:** $11-$18\n\nThis should yield 4-6 servings, depending on serving sizes. So, the cost per serving would be around $2.75-$3.50. That's significantly cheaper than the $15 you paid at the restaurant!\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates may vary depending on your location, the specific brands and types of ingredients you choose, and the portion sizes you prefer.\n\nMaking green curry at home also allows you to customize the recipe to your taste preferences, use fresh and high-quality ingredients, and enjoy leftovers for future meals.\n\nIf you're interested, I can provide you with a simple recipe to get you started.
