  "content": "It seems like you are installing NGINX on an Amazon EC2 instance running Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. NGINX is a popular web server that can be used to serve static content, reverse proxy dynamic content, and load balance traffic. To install NGINX, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH:\n```java\nssh -i \"NODEJS.pem\" ubuntu@ec2-3-109-174-93.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com\n```\nReplace \"NODEJS.pem\" with the name of your PEM file and \"[ubuntu@ec2-3-109-174-93.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com](mailto:ubuntu@ec2-3-109-174-93.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com)\" with the public DNS of your EC2 instance.\n\n2. Update the package lists and upgrade the installed packages:\n```sql\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n```\n3. Install NGINX:\n```csharp\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n```\n4. Start NGINX:\n```sql\nsudo systemctl start nginx\n```\n5. Check the status of NGINX:\n```lua\nsudo systemctl status nginx\n```\n6. If everything is working properly, you should see a message that says \"active (running)\" in the output of the previous command. You can also test the NGINX installation by navigating to the public DNS of your EC2 instance in a web browser. You should see the default NGINX welcome page.",
