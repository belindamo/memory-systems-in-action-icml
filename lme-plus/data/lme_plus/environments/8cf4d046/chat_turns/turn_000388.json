However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I won't be able to provide specific trail recommendations based on your city.\n\nBut I can offer some general tips to help you find great hiking trails near you:\n\n1. **Check online trail databases**: Websites like AllTrails, TrailLink, or Hiking Project allow you to search for trails by location, distance, difficulty, and more.\n2. **National Park Service website**: If you have national parks or forests near your city, check the National Park Service website for trail information and recommendations.\n3. **Local outdoor groups and clubs**: Look for local hiking clubs, outdoor groups, or Meetup.com groups in your area. They often have knowledgeable members who can recommend trails and provide insider tips.\n4. **Social media and online forums**: In addition to your Facebook friend, you can also search for local hiking groups or forums on social media platforms like Reddit (e.g., r/hiking or r/[your city name]) or online forums dedicated to hiking and outdoor activities.\n5. **State or local park websites**: Visit the website of your state or local park department to find trail information, maps, and recommendations.\n6. **Ask local outdoor gear shops**: Visit local outdoor gear shops or outfitters and ask the staff for trail recommendations.
