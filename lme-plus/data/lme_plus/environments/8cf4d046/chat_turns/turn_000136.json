  "content": "The type of pool you are describing is:\nD. Vinyl.\n\nVinyl pools are a common type of pool that is known for their low initial cost and high customization options. They are available in many shapes and sizes and are made from a durable, waterproof vinyl material that is easy to clean and soft to the touch. The main disadvantage of vinyl pools is that the liner, which is the waterproof layer that forms the inner surface of the pool, may need to be replaced every 7 to 15 years. Concrete, fiberglass, and above ground pools are all different types of pools that may have different characteristics and installation processes.",
