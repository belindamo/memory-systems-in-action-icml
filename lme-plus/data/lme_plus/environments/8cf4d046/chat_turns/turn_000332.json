  "content": "Wow, $120 is a pretty big haul! I'm glad you stocked up on some essentials, including those delicious apples! It's always great to have a well-stocked pantry and fridge, especially when you're planning to cook up a storm like you are this week.\n\nApples are a great snack to have on hand, and they're so versatile - perfect for snacking, baking, or even adding to savory dishes like the chili recipe I shared earlier. Did you happen to notice what type of apples you bought? Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or maybe some other variety?\n\nBy the way, I'm curious - what else did you pick up at Walmart? Were there any other ingredients or staples that you needed for your meal prep this week?",
