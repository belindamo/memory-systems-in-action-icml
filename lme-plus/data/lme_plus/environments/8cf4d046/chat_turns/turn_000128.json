  "content": "The type of pool you are describing is:\nB. Fiberglass.\n\nFiberglass pools are prefabricated and do not require any framing construction. They are pre-molded into set shapes and sizes and are made from a fiberglass composite material that is durable and resistant to fading and cracking. To install a fiberglass pool, a hole is dug, plumbing is installed, and a sand base is laid. The pool is then lowered into the hole and leveled. Fiberglass pools have a higher initial cost than vinyl pools but may be more durable and require less maintenance over time. Concrete, above ground, and gunite pools are all different types of pools that may have different characteristics and installation processes.",
