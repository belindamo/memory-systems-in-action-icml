  "content": "The production of chemical NPK fertilizers is associated with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential 300 times higher than carbon dioxide per pound, and is a byproduct of the production process of NPK fertilizers. According to a study, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers components represent more than 200 million tonnes of production annually and share a large portion of the costs and emissions of GHGs, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) [[3](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c00238)]. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of different nitrogen fertilizers, including NPK, on soil quality and N2O emissions from paddy fields in India found that agricultural soils are an important source of N2O emission, with conventional fertilizer (NPK) being among the fertilizers tested that contributed to N2O emissions [[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31975013/)]. Another study reported that fertilizers can contribute to GHG emissions, including N2O, and other potential nutrient losses in the environment, such as through leaching [[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32987233/)]. Finally, a recent study revealed that anthropogenic N2O emissions have increased by 30% over the past four decades, with nitrogen fertilizers being one of the major sources of N2O emissions [[5](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2020/10/the-fertilizer-solution-has-become-a-major-climate-problem/)]. Unfortunately, we couldn't find a source that defines the GHG emissions related to chemical NPK fertilizer per kilogram of fertilizer produced.",
