Here's why:\n\n1. **Swimming is the most technical discipline**: Swimming requires the most technique and efficiency to conserve energy and reduce fatigue. Improving your swimming technique takes time and practice.\n2. **Swimming is the shortest leg**: The swim leg is typically the shortest part of the triathlon (around 750m), but it's also the most intense. You'll want to make sure you're comfortable and efficient in the water to set yourself up for a strong bike and run.\n3. **Swimming sets the tone for the rest of the race**: A strong swim can give you a confidence boost and set you up for a successful bike and run. A weak swim can leave you feeling drained and struggling to catch up.\n\nThat being said, you shouldn't neglect your biking and running training entirely. Aim to allocate your training time as follows:\n\n* **Swimming: 40-50% of your training time**\n* **Biking: 30-40% of your training time**\n* **Running: 20-30% of your training time**\n\nFocus on building your endurance and efficiency in each discipline, and don't forget to include brick workouts (back-to-back bike and run sessions) to simulate the transition between disciplines.\n\nRemember to also prioritize rest and recovery, as this will help your body adapt to the demands of triathlon training.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any other questions about prioritizing your training?",
