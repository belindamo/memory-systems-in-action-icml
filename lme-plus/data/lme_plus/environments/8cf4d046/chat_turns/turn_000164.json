It's a great starting point to see how the story was initially translated to the screen.\n2. **The Omega Man (1971)**: This Charlton Heston-starring film takes creative liberties with the novel, but it's an interesting exploration of the themes in a more action-oriented way.\n3. **I Am Legend (2007)**: The Will Smith-starring blockbuster offers a more modern take on the story, with significant changes to the plot and characters.\n\nWatching the adaptations will allow you to:\n\n* Compare and contrast the different interpretations of the novel\n* Analyze how the story has been adapted to fit different genres, tones, and eras\n* Appreciate the evolution of special effects, cinematography, and storytelling techniques\n\n**Combining both**\n\nIf you want to get the most out of your \"I Am Legend\" experience, I recommend reading the novel and then watching the adaptations. This will give you a deeper understanding of the story, its themes, and its influences.\n\nBy reading the novel first, you'll be able to appreciate the adaptations on a deeper level, recognizing the changes, additions, and omissions made in each film. You'll also be able to compare the different interpretations and understand how they reflect the time period, genre, and creative vision of each adaptation.\n\n**Tips and recommendations**\n\n* Take your time: Read the novel and watch the adaptations at a comfortable pace, allowing yourself to absorb and process each experience.\n* Keep an open mind: Be prepared for differences between the novel and the adaptations, and try to appreciate each interpretation on its own merits.\n* Analyze and discuss: Take notes, discuss with friends or online communities, and explore the themes, motifs, and symbolism present in the novel and adaptations.\n\nEmbark on this journey, and you'll discover why \"I Am Legend\" remains a timeless classic in the world of science fiction and horror!",
