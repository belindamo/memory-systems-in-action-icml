Trail Mix Variations: Yes, nuts and fruits are a great start, but you can add some excitement by incorporating other ingredients like seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, or chia), dried fruit (cranberries, apricots, or raisins), and even a few chocolate chips or cinnamon-coated almonds.\n3. Yogurt Parfait: Layer Greek yogurt with fresh berries, granola, and a drizzle of honey for a protein-packed snack that's easy to prepare and customize.\n4.

Edamame: Steam or cook edamame and season with sea salt for a tasty and protein-rich snack that's easy to take on the go.\n7. Mini Muffins: Whip up a batch of healthy muffins using whole wheat flour, fruits, and nuts, and store them in an airtight container for up to 5 days.\n8. Cut Veggies with Hummus: Carrot sticks, cucumber slices, and cherry tomatoes pair perfectly with a protein-rich hummus dip.\n9. Protein Smoothie Packs: Prepare individual smoothie packs by freezing your favorite fruits, spinach, and protein powder in small bags. Simply add milk or yogurt and blend when you're ready.\n10.
