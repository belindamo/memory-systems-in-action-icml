  "content": "I understand, the scenario I provided may be seen as unrealistic. Here's a more realistic example:\n\nRecently, I had a group of guests celebrating a milestone birthday. One of the guests had a gluten allergy and was having a hard time finding something on the menu that she could eat. As a server, I noticed this and I wanted to help. So, I took the initiative to speak with the chef and we were able to create a special gluten-free dish just for her.\n\nThis small act of kindness made a huge impact on the guest, who was very touched by the club's willingness to accommodate her dietary needs. It was a privilege to be a part of something that made such a positive impact on the guest, who was celebrating a special occasion. It was a heartwarming moment for me and the guests who witnessed it. This small act of kindness made a big difference to that guest and it was a proud moment for me to be able to help.",
