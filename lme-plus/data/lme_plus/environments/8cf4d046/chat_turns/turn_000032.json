  "content": "I recently had the opportunity to help a group of veterans who were visiting our club for a golf tournament. One of the veterans, who was a double amputee, had a hard time maneuvering his wheelchair on the course. As a server, I noticed this and I wanted to help. So, I took the initiative to speak with the club's management and we were able to provide a golf cart with special modifications to make it easier for him to move around the course.\n\nThis small act of kindness made a huge impact on the veteran, who was very touched by the club's willingness to accommodate him. It was a privilege to be a part of something that made such a positive impact on the veteran, who had sacrificed so much for our country. It was a heartwarming moment for me and the guests who witnessed it. This small act of kindness made a big difference to that veteran and it was a proud moment for me to be able to help.",
