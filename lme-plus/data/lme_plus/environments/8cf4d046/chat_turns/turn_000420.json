  "content": "Excellent choices! \"The Story of Kites\" and \"God Found Us You\" will surely be treasured by Lily and her family.\n\nRegarding meal delivery gift cards or local restaurants, I'm happy to help! However, I would need a bit more information from you. Could you please provide me with the following details:\n\n1. **City or zip code**: Where does Sarah and her family live? This will help me suggest restaurants that deliver to their area.\n2. **Cuisine preferences**: Does Sarah or her family have any specific cuisine preferences (e.g., Chinese, Italian, Mexican, etc.)?\n3. **Meal delivery services**: Are you open to meal delivery services like Grubhub, UberEats, or DoorDash, or would you prefer a gift card to a specific local restaurant?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized suggestions for meal delivery gift cards or local restaurants that deliver to their area.\n\nIn the meantime, you could also consider gift cards to popular meal delivery services like Blue Apron, HelloFresh, or Sun Basket, which offer a variety of cuisines and meal options. These services can be a great way to help new parents enjoy a break from cooking and focus on spending time with their little one.",
