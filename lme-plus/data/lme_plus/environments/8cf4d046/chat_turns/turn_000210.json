You could opt for blends like truffle salt, infused peppercorns, or custom seasoning mixes.\n2. **Handcrafted Cookies or Biscotti**: Freshly baked, artisanal cookies or biscotti in unique flavors like lemon rosemary, cranberry orange, or chocolate chunk would be a lovely addition to the basket.\n3. **Infused Honey**: A jar of artisanal honey infused with flavors like lavender, lemon, or eucalyptus would add a touch of elegance to the gift. Your sister could use it in baking or as a topping for yogurt or oatmeal.\n4. **Small-Batch Jams or Preserves**: A selection of handcrafted jams or preserves in unique flavors like strawberry balsamic, spiced apple, or quince would complement the vase nicely.\n\n**Handmade Candles:**\n\n1. **Herbal or Botanical Candles**: A candle infused with herbs like rosemary, thyme, or lemongrass would pair nicely with the earthy, natural vibe of the ceramic vase.\n2. **Food-Inspired Candles**: Candles with scents like vanilla bean, caramel, or citrus would evoke the warm, comforting feelings associated with baking and cooking.\n3. **Garden-Inspired Candles**: A candle with a fresh, floral scent like lavender, geranium, or rose would bring a sense of serenity and calm to the gift basket.\n\nWhen selecting the treats and candles, consider your sister's personal preferences and the overall aesthetic you want to create. You could also include a few recipe cards or a small cookbook with ideas for using the artisanal treats and ingredients.\n\nRemember, the key is to create a thoughtful, curated selection that shows you care about your sister's interests and hobbies.",
