  "content": "To achieve equal rise and fall time for a NAND gate in a 0.35um process, the width of the pMOS and nMOS transistors should be properly matched. Typically, the width of the pMOS transistor should be about 4-5 times the width of the nMOS transistor. This can be adjusted based on the specific requirements and performance goals of the circuit. It is also important to take into consideration the threshold voltage of the transistors and the load capacitance on the output of the gate when determining the widths.",
