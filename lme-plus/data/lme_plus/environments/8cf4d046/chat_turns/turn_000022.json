  "content": "Another example, I realized that many of our guests were not aware of the various services offered by the club, such as tennis courts, swimming pool and spa, etc. As a server, I have a lot of interaction with guests and I thought I could use this to my advantage to help them discover all the benefits of being a member of the club. So, I took the initiative to create a brochure that highlighted all the services and amenities offered by the club, and I distributed it to guests during my shifts. Many guests appreciated the information and it helped increase the usage of these facilities. It's a small step, but it helped the guests to have a better experience and I was glad to play a small part in that.",
