  "content": "To define a 0.35um process in Electric VLSI Design System (a binary tool for IC design) you need to set up the process parameters and technology file that contains information about the characteristics of the transistors in the process. Here are the general steps to define the process in Electric:\n\n1. Create a new technology file by going to the \"Technology\" menu and selecting \"New Technology\".\n2. Set the minimum feature size of the process to 0.35um by going to the \"Technology\" menu and selecting \"Edit Technology\" and then entering the value in the \"Minimum Feature Size\" field.\n3. Set the other process parameters such as the threshold voltage, mobility, oxide thickness, etc. by going to the \"Technology\" menu and selecting \"Edit Technology\" and then entering the values in the appropriate fields.\n4. Define the transistors in the process by going to the \"Technology\" menu and selecting \"Edit Transistor Layers\".\n5. To define the transistors in the process, you should assign the appropriate layers for the source, drain, gate and substrate terminals of the transistors.\n6. To define the NAND gate, you can use the pre-defined NAND gate schematic symbol or create your own. You can use the \"Schematic Editor\" to create a new schematic symbol for the NAND gate using the transistors you have defined in the technology file.\n7. Once the process is defined, you can use Electric's layout editor to design the layout of your NAND gate and other circuits.\n\nPlease note that this is a high level overview of the process and there are many other details that you should consider, like parasitic resistances, capacitances and other things that may affect your design.",
