Recently, I noticed that many of our guests were leaving behind their water bottles on the course. I suggested to my manager that we set up a recycling program for plastic water bottles at the club, to reduce waste and promote sustainability. My manager loved the idea and we implemented it right away. It may seem like a small change, but it has had a big impact on reducing the amount of plastic waste at our club and promoting environmentally-friendly practices.",
