  "content": "One type of metal fence that is not as common as others is:\nA. Copper.\n\nCopper is a type of metal that is known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and attractive appearance. However, it is generally less commonly used for fencing than other types of metal such as steel, aluminum, or cast iron. Copper fences are typically more expensive than other types of metal fences due to the cost of the material and the time and labor required to fabricate and install them. They may be used in certain applications where their unique properties or appearance are desired, but they are not as commonly used as other types of metal fences. Steel, cast iron, and aluminum are all more common types of metal fences that are used in a variety of applications due to their strength, durability, and versatility.",
