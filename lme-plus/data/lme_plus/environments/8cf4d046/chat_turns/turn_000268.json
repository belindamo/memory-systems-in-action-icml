While I don't have personal experiences, I can offer some general advice and options:\n\n1. **Local Tailors**: Look for local tailors or seamstresses in your area who specialize in alterations. They can provide professional hemming services, and you can discuss the details in person. You can search online, check Yelp, or ask friends and family for recommendations.\n2. **Dry Cleaners**: Many dry cleaners offer alteration services, including hemming. They might not be as specialized as a tailor, but they can still do a good job.\n3. **Department Stores**: Some department stores, like Nordstrom or Bloomingdale's, offer free or low-cost hemming services for items purchased in their store. Check with your local store to see if they offer this service.\n4. **Online Hemming Services**: There are several online services that allow you to send in your garments for hemming. Some popular options include:\n\t* Hemster: Offers a range of hemming services, including denim and leather.\n\t* The Hemming Co.: Specializes in denim hemming and offers a variety of styles and finishes.\n\t* Tailor4Less: Provides a range of alteration services, including hemming, and offers a price match guarantee.\n\nBefore choosing a service, make sure to:\n\n* Check reviews and ratings to ensure the service is reputable and does quality work.\n* Ask about their experience with denim or specific fabric types.\n* Inquire about their hemming techniques and options (e.g., blind hem, visible hem, etc.).\n* Get a quote and ask about any additional fees or services.\n* Check their turnaround time and whether they offer rush services.\n\nIf you're not satisfied with your DIY hemming job, consider taking your jeans to a professional for a redo. A good hem can make a big difference in the overall look and fit of your pants!",
