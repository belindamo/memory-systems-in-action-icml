  "content": "Algae can be used as a bio-stimulant in agriculture and has various benefits over chemical fertilizers. Algae can be a rich natural source of compounds with high biological activity against stress factors and fit very well into recent strategies for the chemical industry, including the production of fertilizers and pesticides [[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74703-3_10)]. Chemical fertilizers are intended to improve crop quality and yield, but they have a negative impact on the environment and human health, while organic fertilizers with algae are less likely to reach water bodies and other places where it should not be [[3](https://www.alganex.com/insights/algae-as-an-alternative-to-chemical-fertilizers-in-agriculture/)]. Furthermore, extensive research is going on in this field to develop sustainable fertilizers that are non-toxic to the environment, and algal bio-fertilizers are among the best sustainable options [[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327143811_Algal_Biofertilizers_and_Plant_Growth_Stimulants_for_Sustainable_Agriculture)]. Algal microflora has also been found to promote biomass productivity and improve soil fertility. Thus, using algae as a bio-stimulant instead of chemical fertilizers can be environmentally favorable and pollution-free [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X22001759)].",
