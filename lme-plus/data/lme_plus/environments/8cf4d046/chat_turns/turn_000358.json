  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the Batman franchise are two separate and distinct universes. Marvel is owned by Disney, while Batman is part of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) owned by Warner Bros.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for Marvel movies that share a similar tone and style to the Batman franchise, I can try to suggest some options:\n\n1. **Captain America: The Winter Soldier** (2014) - This movie has a similar espionage and conspiracy tone to some Batman films, with a focus on political intrigue and moral complexity.\n2. **Iron Man** (2008) - The first Iron Man movie has a similar \"origin story\" feel to the 2005 Batman Begins film, with a focus on the protagonist's transformation from a wealthy playboy to a hero.\n3. **Daredevil** (2015) - While not a movie, the Netflix series Daredevil has a dark and gritty tone similar to some Batman adaptations, with a focus on street-level heroics and moral ambiguity.\n4. **The Punisher** (2017) - Another Netflix series, The Punisher has a similar tone to some Batman films, with a focus on a gritty, grounded, and violent world.\n\nKeep in mind that these suggestions are based on tone and style, but the stories and characters are still unique to the Marvel Universe.\n\nIf you're looking for movies to prepare for the new Batman film, I'd recommend re-watching some of the previous Batman movies, such as:\n\n1. **Batman Begins** (2005)\n2. **The Dark Knight** (2008)\n3. **The Dark Knight Rises** (2012)\n\nThese films will give you a better understanding of the Batman character and the tone of the franchise. Enjoy your movie marathon!",
