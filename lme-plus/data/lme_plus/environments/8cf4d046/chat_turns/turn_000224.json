After conducting some research, I couldn't find any information on the \"Midwest Auto Racking Championship\" or a racing competition by that name held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on June 17-19. It's possible that it was a private event or a fictional competition.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for general tips on how to prepare for a racing competition, I'd be happy to provide some advice:\n\n1. **Get familiar with the track**: Study the track layout, learn the turns, straights, and braking points. If possible, walk or drive the track to get a feel for the layout and identify areas where you can improve.\n2. **Tune your vehicle**: Make sure your car is in top condition. Check the engine, suspension, brakes, and tires to ensure they're functioning properly. Consider making any necessary adjustments or upgrades to improve performance.\n3. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more seat time you have, the more comfortable and confident you'll be on the track. Practice your driving skills, such as braking, acceleration, and cornering.\n4. **Physical conditioning**: Racing can be physically demanding. Make sure you're in good physical shape by exercising regularly, focusing on cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility.\n5. **Mental preparation**: Racing is just as much a mental game as it is physical. Work on your mental toughness, focus, and concentration. Visualize yourself performing well on the track and overcoming challenges.\n6. **Review safety procedures**: Make sure you're familiar with safety protocols, such as flag signals, emergency procedures, and safety equipment.\n7. **Get comfortable with your gear**: Familiarize yourself with your racing gear, including your helmet, suit, and gloves. Make sure everything fits properly and you're comfortable wearing it.\n8. **Analyze your performance**: Review data from your previous races or practice sessions to identify areas for improvement. Work on correcting any mistakes and refining your driving technique.\n9. **Stay hydrated and fueled**: Take care of your body by staying hydrated and fueled with a balanced diet. Avoid heavy meals before racing, and opt for light, easy-to-digest foods.\n10. **Get plenty of rest**: Make sure you're well-rested before the competition. Lack of sleep can impair your reaction time and decision-making skills.\n\nRemember, preparation is key to performing well in a racing competition. Focus on improving your skills, physical condition, and mental toughness, and you'll be ready to take on the track!",
