As a server, I have a good knowledge of the club's schedule and I thought I could use this to my advantage to help our guests plan their visits. So, I took the initiative to create a weekly newsletter that highlighted the upcoming activities and events at the club, as well as any special deals or promotions. I distributed it to guests during my shifts and it was well received. Many guests appreciated having all the information in one place and it helped them to make the most of their visit.",
