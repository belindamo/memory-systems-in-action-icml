Squats: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and lower your hips back and down as if you're about to sit in a chair. Make sure your knees don't go beyond your toes. Do 10-15 reps.\n\n2. Lunges: Take a step forward with your left leg and lower your hips until your left thigh is parallel to the ground, keeping your right heel lifted. Push back up with your left leg and repeat on the other side. Do 10-15 reps on each leg.\n\n3. Push-ups: Get into a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down to the ground while keeping your back straight, then push back up. Do as many reps as you can.\n\n4. Plank: Get into a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart, and hold for 30-60 seconds.\n\n5. Jumping jacks: Stand with your feet together and arms at your sides. Jump your feet apart while raising your arms overhead. Jump back to the starting position. Do 20-30 reps.\n\nRemember to warm up before you start, and cool down and stretch afterwards. You can also mix and match these exercises to create a quick, full-body workout. Good luck!",
