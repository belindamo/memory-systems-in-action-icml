Something like: \"Dear [Sister's Name], I hope you love this gift basket as much as I loved putting it together for you! I've included some of my favorite artisanal treats, along with a few of my own homemade goodies. I still remember how much fun we had baking together when we were kids, and I hope this gift inspires you to keep exploring your passion for cooking. Love, [Your Name]\". Do you think that sounds good?",
