As biomass, excluded from primary raw materials, and a rich natural source of compounds with high biological activity against stress factors, algae fit very well into recent European strategies for the chemical industry, including production of fertilizers and pesticides.\"\nURL: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74703-3\\_10\n\n[2] \"1. Introduction. Modern agricultural practices and future perspectives for agro-industries are of current relevance, and are faced with two challenges: i) improving crops quality and yield as a result of growing world population, whilst preventing losses due to biotic and abiotic stresses which are currently 30-40% and 60-70% respectively and ii) minimising the impact on the environment and human health caused by the widespread use of mineral fertilisers and chemical products intended for ...\"\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975021000604\n\n[3] \"The advantages of organic fertilizers with algae Because the organic fertilizer takes a longer time to decompose, and does not simply flood the soil, it is less likely to reach water bodies and other places where it should not be. In addition, the organic material, when decomposed, provides nutrients for the entire soil fauna.\"\nURL: https://www.alganex.com/insights/algae-as-an-alternative-to-chemical-fertilizers-in-agriculture/\n\n[4] \"Therefore, extensive research is going on in this field to develop sustainable fertilizers that are non-toxic to the environment.

However, algal microflora has also been found as a true bio-based fertilizer for agricultural techniques that are both environmentally favorable and pollution-free.\"\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X22001759\nCurrent date: 3/1/2023\n\nInstructions: Using the provided web search results, write a comprehensive reply to the given query.
