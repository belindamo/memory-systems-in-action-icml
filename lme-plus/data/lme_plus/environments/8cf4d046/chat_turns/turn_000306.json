  "content": "If you rotate a capital \"N\" by 90 degrees clockwise, it would look most similar to the letter \"Z\" (in uppercase form).\n\nThe capital \"N\" consists of two diagonal lines that intersect at a right angle, with the longer line pointing downwards to the right. When you rotate it by 90 degrees, the longer line will point to the left instead of downwards, and the shorter line will point upwards instead of to the left. This shape closely resembles the letter \"Z\", which is also a diagonal letter consisting of two lines that intersect at a right angle, with the longer line pointing downwards to the right.\n\nSo, if you rotate a capital \"N\" by 90 degrees clockwise, it would look most similar to a capital \"Z\".",
