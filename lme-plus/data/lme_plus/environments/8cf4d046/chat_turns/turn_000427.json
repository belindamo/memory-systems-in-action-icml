I recently completed a charity 5K run at Riverside Park in 27 minutes and 12 seconds, which is a personal best for me. By the way, have you got any advice on how to transition from running to playing badminton? I've noticed my endurance helped me in the office badminton tournament, where my team reached the semifinals and I won 3 out of 4 doubles matches.",
