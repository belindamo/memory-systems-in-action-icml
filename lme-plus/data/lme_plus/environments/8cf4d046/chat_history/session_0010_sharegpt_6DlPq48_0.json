Introduction. Modern agricultural practices and future perspectives for agro-industries are of current relevance, and are faced with two challenges: i) improving crops quality and yield as a result of growing world population, whilst preventing losses due to biotic and abiotic stresses which are currently 30-40% and 60-70% respectively and ii) minimising the impact on the environment and human health caused by the widespread use of mineral fertilisers and chemical products intended for ...\"\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975021000604\n\n[3] \"The advantages of organic fertilizers with algae Because the organic fertilizer takes a longer time to decompose, and does not simply flood the soil, it is less likely to reach water bodies and other places where it should not be.

Algae can be a rich natural source of compounds with high biological activity against stress factors and fit very well into recent strategies for the chemical industry, including the production of fertilizers and pesticides [[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74703-3_10)]. Chemical fertilizers are intended to improve crop quality and yield, but they have a negative impact on the environment and human health, while organic fertilizers with algae are less likely to reach water bodies and other places where it should not be [[3](https://www.alganex.com/insights/algae-as-an-alternative-to-chemical-fertilizers-in-agriculture/)]. Furthermore, extensive research is going on in this field to develop sustainable fertilizers that are non-toxic to the environment, and algal bio-fertilizers are among the best sustainable options [[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327143811_Algal_Biofertilizers_and_Plant_Growth_Stimulants_for_Sustainable_Agriculture)]. Algal microflora has also been found to promote biomass productivity and improve soil fertility. Thus, using algae as a bio-stimulant instead of chemical fertilizers can be environmentally favorable and pollution-free [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X22001759)]."

      "content": "The production of chemical NPK fertilizers is associated with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential 300 times higher than carbon dioxide per pound, and is a byproduct of the production process of NPK fertilizers. According to a study, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers components represent more than 200 million tonnes of production annually and share a large portion of the costs and emissions of GHGs, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) [[3](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c00238)]. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of different nitrogen fertilizers, including NPK, on soil quality and N2O emissions from paddy fields in India found that agricultural soils are an important source of N2O emission, with conventional fertilizer (NPK) being among the fertilizers tested that contributed to N2O emissions [[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31975013/)]. Another study reported that fertilizers can contribute to GHG emissions, including N2O, and other potential nutrient losses in the environment, such as through leaching [[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32987233/)]. Finally, a recent study revealed that anthropogenic N2O emissions have increased by 30% over the past four decades, with nitrogen fertilizers being one of the major sources of N2O emissions [[5](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2020/10/the-fertilizer-solution-has-become-a-major-climate-problem/)]. Unfortunately, we couldn't find a source that defines the GHG emissions related to chemical NPK fertilizer per kilogram of fertilizer produced."
