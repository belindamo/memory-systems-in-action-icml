It was a huge success, not only in terms of raising funds for the hospital, but also in bringing the community together for a great cause. We had over 100 participants and were able to raise over $10,000 for the hospital. The event was so successful that we received a letter of appreciation from the hospital's CEO and we are planning on making it an annual event. It was truly a privilege to be a part of something that made such a positive impact on the community."

Recently, I noticed that many of our guests were leaving behind their water bottles on the course. I suggested to my manager that we set up a recycling program for plastic water bottles at the club, to reduce waste and promote sustainability. My manager loved the idea and we implemented it right away. It may seem like a small change, but it has had a big impact on reducing the amount of plastic waste at our club and promoting environmentally-friendly practices."

So, I took the initiative to create a brochure that highlighted all the services and amenities offered by the club, and I distributed it to guests during my shifts. Many guests appreciated the information and it helped increase the usage of these facilities. It's a small step, but it helped the guests to have a better experience and I was glad to play a small part in that."

As a server, I have a good relationship with many of the local vendors and I thought I could use this to my advantage to help our guests. So, I took the initiative to create a list of recommended vendors in the area, including their contact information and specialties, and I made it available to guests upon request. This helped many of our guests to find the right vendors for their events and I was glad to play a small part in making their event special. It was a"

One of the veterans, who was a double amputee, had a hard time maneuvering his wheelchair on the course. As a server, I noticed this and I wanted to help. So, I took the initiative to speak with the club's management and we were able to provide a golf cart with special modifications to make it easier for him to move around the course.\n\nThis small act of kindness made a huge impact on the veteran, who was very touched by the club's willingness to accommodate him. It was a privilege to be a part of something that made such a positive impact on the veteran, who had sacrificed so much for our country. It was a heartwarming moment for me and the guests who witnessed it. This small act of kindness made a big difference to that veteran and it was a proud moment for me to be able to help."

One of the guests had a gluten allergy and was having a hard time finding something on the menu that she could eat. As a server, I noticed this and I wanted to help.
