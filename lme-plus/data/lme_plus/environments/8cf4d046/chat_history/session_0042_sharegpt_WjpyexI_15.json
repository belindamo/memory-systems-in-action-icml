The code filters the data to only include 2012, groups the data by store, calculates the mean of weekly sales for each store, and then prints the summary statistics.\n\n1.

It also adds a vertical line in red to show where Store number 10 is in the plot.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions."
