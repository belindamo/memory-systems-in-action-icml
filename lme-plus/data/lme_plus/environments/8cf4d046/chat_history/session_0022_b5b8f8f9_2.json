Here are some tips to help you keep your burgundy dress shoes looking their best:\n\n1. **Clean them regularly**: Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe away dirt and dust from the shoes. For tougher stains, use a gentle cleaning product specifically designed for leather shoes. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the leather.\n2. **Condition the leather**: Use a leather conditioner or leather oil to moisturize and protect the leather.

Do not hang it, as this can cause stretching or distortion.\n5. **Brush to restore texture**: Once your wool garment is dry, use a soft-bristled brush or a wool comb to restore its natural texture and prevent pilling.\n6. **Store properly**: When storing your wool garments, keep them away from direct sunlight, moisture, and pests. Consider storing them in a breathable cloth bag or a cedar-lined storage box.\n7. **Avoid over-drying**: Wool fibers can felt (shrink or become distorted) if exposed to excessive heat or agitation. Avoid using hot water, high heat, or harsh chemicals, as these can cause felting.\n8. **Dry cleaning**: If your wool garment requires dry cleaning, make sure to use a reputable dry cleaner who specializes in cleaning wool. Always check the care label to ensure the dry cleaner uses the recommended cleaning method.\n9. **Spot cleaning**: For small stains, you can try spot cleaning with a gentle detergent and cold water. Blot the stain gently, working from the outside in.
