However, in the past, there have been instances when Ubisoft didn't address player feedback. One recent example is the launch of Ghost Recon Breakpoint, which received criticism for several issues like weak storytelling, microtransactions, loot system, AI companions and technical glitches. Though Ubisoft acknowledged the criticism, it took a while for them to release updates to address the issues, leading some players to feel ignored. However, Ubisoft has since made several changes and improvements to Ghost Recon Breakpoint based on player feedback.",
