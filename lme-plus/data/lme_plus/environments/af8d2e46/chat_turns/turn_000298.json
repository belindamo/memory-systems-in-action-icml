  "content": "Rousseau's artwork did gain some recognition during his lifetime but it was mainly through his writings that he had a significant impact on society.\n\nRousseau was primarily known as a philosopher and writer, and while he produced a number of impressive works of art, they did not receive the same level of recognition as his writings.\n\nHowever, Rousseau's art was influential in its own right and helped to shape the aesthetic sensibilities of the Romantic movement. His use of rich colors and bold brushstrokes, for example, anticipated some of the techniques that would be used by the Romantic artists of the following century.\n\nMoreover, while Rousseau's art may not have received the same level of recognition as his writings, his experience in the art world helped to shape his philosophical and political beliefs, and his ideas about the value of manual labor and the dignity of work would become important themes in his writings.\n\nOverall, while Rousseau's art may not have been his primary claim to fame during his lifetime, it was an important part of his creative output and helped to shape the aesthetic and philosophical sensibilities of his era.",
