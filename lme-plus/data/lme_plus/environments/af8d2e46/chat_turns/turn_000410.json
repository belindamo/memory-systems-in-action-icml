These events are generally geared towards families and younger kids.\n2. **Amarillo Zoo's Boo at the Zoo:** The Amarillo Zoo hosts an annual \"Boo at the Zoo\" event, which offers trick-or-treating, games, and animal encounters. It's a fun and not-too-spooky event suitable for younger kids.\n3. **Haunted houses with \"lights-on\" options:** Some haunted houses in the area offer \"lights-on\" or \"family-friendly\" options, which are less intense and more suitable for younger kids.
