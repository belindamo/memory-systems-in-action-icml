  "content": "I'm in the 90210 zip code, and it's a local residential move from my current apartment to the new townhouse I'm purchasing. It's a 3-bedroom move, and I'd say the volume of items is moderate - not too much furniture, but a lot of boxes and miscellaneous stuff. By the way, I've been preparing for this move for a while now, started looking for a new home about 3 months ago, so I'm hoping to get this all sorted out soon!",
