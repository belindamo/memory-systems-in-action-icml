  "content": "Yes, Brahms' approach to composition had a significant impact on his contemporaries and other composers who came after him. Many composers of the late Romantic period were influenced by Brahms' use of traditional forms and techniques, as well as his emphasis on craftsmanship and attention to detail.\n\nOne composer who was particularly influenced by Brahms was Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, who was inspired by Brahms' use of folk music and incorporation of nationalistic elements into his works. Other composers such as Gustav Mahler and Jean Sibelius also looked to Brahms as a model for their own compositions, incorporating his use of rich orchestration and complex thematic development.\n\nIn addition to his influence on other composers, Brahms' approach to composition also had a broader impact on the development of classical music as a whole. His emphasis on balance, proportion, and unity helped to establish a new standard of craftsmanship and musical refinement that would be influential for generations to come.",
