  "content": "It's true that for some people, listening to classical music that adheres to traditional structures and styles can become repetitive or predictable. However, it's important to remember that there is a great deal of variation within the classical repertoire, and that composers like Brahms were able to achieve a tremendous amount of artistic innovation and expression within the confines of those structures.\n\nFurthermore, there are a number of factors that can keep the audience engaged and excited even within a traditional framework. For one, performers can bring their own interpretation and expression to the music, giving each performance its own unique character and flavor. Additionally, listeners can bring their own attention and focus to the nuances of the music, such as following the development of a particular melody or theme, or appreciating the interplay between different instruments or sections of the orchestra.\n\nFinally, some composers may choose to incorporate elements of surprise, contrast, or unpredictability within a traditional framework, keeping audiences on their toes and creating moments of excitement or astonishment. For example, Brahms himself often used unexpected chord progressions or rhythmic shifts to add tension or create new emotional effects within his music.\n\nOverall, while traditional structures and styles may not be for everyone, there are many ways to keep audiences engaged with classical music and appreciate the unique qualities and expressive power that it has to offer.",
