  "content": "A transgender person's sexual orientation is not defined by their gender identity. For example, a transgender woman (a person who was assigned male at birth but identifies as a woman) who is attracted to men would be considered heterosexual. On the other hand, a transgender man (a person who was assigned female at birth but identifies as a man) who is attracted to men would be considered gay. It's important to remember that sexual orientation is not determined by a person's physical characteristics, but rather by who they are attracted to emotionally, romantically, and sexually. Therefore, a transgender person's sexual orientation is the same as anyone else's, regardless of their gender identity or sex assigned at birth.",
