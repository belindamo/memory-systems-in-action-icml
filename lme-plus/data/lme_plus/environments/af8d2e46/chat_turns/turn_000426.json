Here are some pros and cons to help you decide:\n\n**Try out new jokes:**\n\nPros:\n\n* **Test new material**: Open mics are a great way to test new jokes and see how they land with an audience.\n* **Experiment and take risks**: Trying out new jokes can help you develop your unique voice and style.\n* **Keep your set fresh**: If you're performing regularly, trying out new jokes can keep your set fresh and prevent you from getting stale.\n\nCons:\n\n* **Risk of bombing**: New jokes may not be as polished, and there's a risk of bombing on stage.\n* **Lack of confidence**: You may not feel as confident with new material, which can affect your performance.\n\n**Stick with familiar jokes:**\n\nPros:\n\n* **Confidence and comfort**: You're more likely to feel confident and comfortable with jokes you've worked on for a while.\n* **Polished material**: Familiar jokes are often more polished and refined, which can lead to a stronger performance.\n* **Crowd-pleasers**: You know which jokes work well with audiences, so you can rely on them to get laughs.\n\nCons:\n\n* **Stagnation**: Relying too heavily on familiar jokes can lead to stagnation and prevent you from growing as a comedian.\n* **Lack of creativity**: Sticking to the same old jokes can make your set feel stale and unoriginal.\n\n**Ultimate advice:**\n\n* **Mix it up**: Consider trying out 1-2 new jokes alongside some of your tried-and-true material. This will allow you to test new material while still having a safety net.\n* **Know your audience**: If you're performing at an open mic with a familiar crowd, you may be able to get away with trying out more new material. If it's a new audience, you may want to stick with more familiar jokes.\n* **Be prepared to adapt**: Be prepared to adjust your set on the fly based on the audience's response. If a new joke bombs, be ready to pivot to a familiar joke to get the audience back on your side.\n\nRemember, open mics are a great opportunity to experiment and try out new things. Don't be too hard on yourself if not every joke kills, and use the experience to learn and grow as a comedian. Good luck!",
