However, it is worth mentioning that both Rousseau's artwork and his political writings were important in their own right and had a significant impact on European society.\n\nRousseau's artwork was influential in the development of the Romantic movement, and his use of bold colors and vivid imagery helped to shape the aesthetic sensibilities of many artists of the following century.\n\nAt the same time, Rousseau's political writings, particularly The Social Contract and Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, had a profound impact on French and European society, influencing everything from the French Revolution to the development of modern democratic theory.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether Rousseau would have made a greater impact by focusing solely on his artwork or solely on his political writings. Both were important in their own way, and both helped to shape the intellectual and cultural landscape of Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the end, it was the combination of his artwork and political writings that helped to make Rousseau one of the most important thinkers of his era.",
