Overpacking is a common mistake, especially when we're excited about a trip or worried about not having the right clothes.\n\nIt's fantastic that you have a concrete example from your last trip to work with. Analyzing what you actually wore versus what you packed can be a great way to refine your packing strategy.\n\nHere are a few takeaways from your experience:\n\n1. **You likely need fewer tops:** 3 out of 7 shirts is a pretty low usage rate. Consider packing 2-3 versatile tops that can be mixed and matched with your bottoms.\n2. **You can get by with fewer bottoms:** 2 out of 5 pairs of shorts is a similar story. Think about packing 2-3 pairs of bottoms that can be dressed up or down and are suitable for your activities.\n3. **Focus on essentials:** Instead of packing \"just in case\" items, focus on bringing essentials that you know you'll need and use. For example, if you're going to Costa Rica, you might prioritize packing:\n\t* 1-2 lightweight, quick-drying shirts\n\t* 1-2 pairs of comfortable shorts or pants\n\t* 1-2 swimsuits\n\t* 1 lightweight rain jacket or poncho\n\t* Undergarments and socks\n\t* Comfortable walking shoes or sandals\n4. **Pack clothes that can multitask:** Look for items that can serve multiple purposes. For example, a scarf can be used as a blanket, a dressy accessory, or a sarong.\n5. **Consider a packing list:** Write down the activities you plan to do and the clothes you think you'll need for each activity. This can help you identify what's essential and what's not.\n\nRemember, the key to packing efficiently is to strike a balance between bringing what you need and avoiding overpacking. With practice, you'll get better at judging what's essential and what's just \"nice to have.\"",
