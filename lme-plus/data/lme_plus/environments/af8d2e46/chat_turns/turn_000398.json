I've got some tips that might help you manage your projects and reduce that overwhelmed feeling:\n\n1. **Prioritize tasks**: Make a list of all your tasks and prioritize them based on urgency and importance. Focus on completing the high-priority tasks first, and then move on to the others.\n2. **Break tasks into smaller chunks**: Large projects can be overwhelming, but breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks can make them feel more achievable. Create a task list with specific, actionable steps.\n3. **Use a task management system**: Find a task management tool that works for you, such as Trello, Asana, or Todoist. These tools can help you organize tasks, set deadlines, and track progress.\n4. **Set realistic deadlines**: Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day or a week. Set achievable deadlines, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't meet them.\n5. **Avoid multitasking**: Try to focus on one task at a time. Multitasking can lead to distractions and decreased productivity.\n6. **Take breaks**: It's essential to take breaks throughout the day to recharge and refocus. Schedule breaks into your day, and use that time to do something enjoyable or relaxing.\n7. **Communicate with your team**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance from your team or manager. Communicate your concerns and work together to find solutions.\n8. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your progress, and adjust your approach as needed. Be willing to pivot if something isn't working, and don't be afraid to ask for help.\n\nSome additional tips to help you stay focused:\n\n* Minimize distractions by turning off notifications or finding a quiet workspace.\n* Use the Pomodoro Technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.\n* Set a \"stop doing\" list to help you avoid non-essential tasks.\n* Practice time-blocking: schedule specific tasks for specific times of the day.\n\nRemember, everyone gets overwhelmed at times, and it's okay to ask for help. By implementing these tips, you can better manage your projects, reduce stress, and stay focused.\n\nI hope these tips help you feel more organized and focused at work!",
