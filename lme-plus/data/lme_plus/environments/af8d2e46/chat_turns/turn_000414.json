As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or attend events, so I didn't attend a Halloween event at Scarewood Theme Park or any other location. I'm here to provide information and answer questions to the best of my abilities.\n\nHowever, I'm glad you mentioned Scream Fest! If that's an event you're interested in, I can try to help you find more information about it. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.",
