However, various reports indicate that some of the initiatives have been successful in attracting new businesses and creating jobs, while others may still be in the early stages and their impact on economic growth is yet to be seen.\n\nFor example, according to a report by the Scranton Plan, a non-profit that promotes economic development in the region, the KOZ program has been successful in attracting businesses to Scranton and other parts of Lackawanna County. In 2019, the program generated over $20 million in new investment and created more than 1,200 jobs.\n\nSimilarly, the Scranton Enterprise Center has helped new businesses get off the ground and has been instrumental in creating over 300 new jobs in the region, according to a report by the University of Scranton.\n\nHowever, the impact of other initiatives such as workforce development programs and infrastructure projects may still be in the early stages and their long-term impact on economic growth is yet to be determined.",
