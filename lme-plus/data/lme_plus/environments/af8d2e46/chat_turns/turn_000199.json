I've noticed that on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, I wake up 1 hour earlier than usual to work on my side project, but on Wednesdays, I only manage to use 30 minutes of that extra time productively, while on Thursdays and Fridays, I use the full hour. Do you have any suggestions on how I can improve my morning routine to make better use of my time?",
