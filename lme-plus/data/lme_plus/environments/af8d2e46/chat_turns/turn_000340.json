  "content": "**Average time frame for final quote:**\n\nAfter an on-site estimate, the moving company typically provides a final quote within 1-3 business days. This allows them to review the estimate, calculate the costs, and prepare a detailed quote. However, some companies might provide a quote on the spot or within a few hours, depending on their processes.\n\n**Questions to ask during the on-site estimate:**\n\nTo ensure you receive a comprehensive quote, ask the following questions during the on-site estimate:\n\n1. **What is the total estimated weight of my shipment?**\n\t* This will help you understand the basis for the pricing and ensure the company is accurate in their estimation.\n2. **What is the estimated number of hours for the move?**\n\t* This will give you an idea of the labor costs and the overall duration of the move.\n3. **What is the crew size and composition?**\n\t* Find out how many movers will be assigned to your job, their experience, and their supervision structure.\n4. **What is the type and size of the moving truck?**\n\t* Ensure the truck is suitable for your move, and ask about any special equipment requirements (e.g., elevator reservations).\n5. **What is the estimated fuel surcharge?**\n\t* Ask about the fuel surcharge policy and how it will be calculated.\n6. **What is the insurance coverage and liability?**\n\t* Understand the company's insurance coverage, liability limits, and the process for filing claims.\n7. **Are there any additional fees or charges?**\n\t* Ask about potential extra costs for services like packing, storage, or special item handling.\n8. **What is the payment structure and method?**\n\t* Clarify the payment terms, including the deposit, balance due, and accepted payment methods.\n9. **What is the cancellation or rescheduling policy?**\n\t* Understand the company's policies for changes to the move date or cancellation, including any associated fees.\n10. **Can I get a binding estimate?**\n\t* A binding estimate guarantees the price, whereas a non-binding estimate is an approximation.\n11. **What is the process for handling claims or damages?**\n\t* Understand the company's process for addressing any damages or issues during the move.\n12. **Are there any discounts or promotions available?**\n\t* Ask about any available discounts, promotions, or special offers that might apply to your move.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Make sure to get a written estimate that includes all the details discussed during the on-site visit.\n* Verify the company's licenses, insurance, and certifications before signing any agreements.\n* Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek clarification on any points you're unsure about.\n* Be wary of low-ball estimates or companies that seem too good to be true. A reputable moving company will provide a detailed, realistic quote based on your specific needs.\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll be better equipped to compare quotes, ensure you're getting a comprehensive estimate, and avoid any potential surprises on moving day.",
