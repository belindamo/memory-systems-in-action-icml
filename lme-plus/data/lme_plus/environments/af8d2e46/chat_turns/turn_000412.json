  "content": "Scarewood Theme Park is a great choice! Unfortunately, I have some bad news: Scarewood Theme Park is not a real theme park in Amarillo, Texas. It seems I made an error earlier.\n\nHowever, I'm glad you had a great experience at a Halloween event last year! If you're looking for a similar experience for your niece and nephew, I'd recommend checking out the Halloween events I mentioned earlier, such as Wonderland Park's Halloween-themed events or the haunted houses with \"lights-on\" options.\n\nAdditionally, you can also search online for other Halloween events in the Amarillo area, such as trunk-or-treats, fall festivals, or community Halloween parties. These events are often more family-friendly and suitable for younger kids.\n\nIf you're willing to travel a bit further, you can also explore Halloween events in nearby cities, such as Lubbock or Oklahoma City. Just be sure to check the distance, dates, and times to ensure it's feasible for your outing.\n\nRemember to prioritize your niece and nephew's comfort and enjoyment, and I'm sure you'll find a spook-tacular Halloween event that they'll love!",
