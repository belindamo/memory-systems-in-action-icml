It seems I got a bit carried away with the idea.\n\nTo continue:\n\n* Host a family cooking day where everyone can come together to cook, share, and learn from each other.\n* Create a physical cookbook or binder with printed recipes, photos, and stories.\n* Assign a \"recipe curator\" to collect, organize, and digitize the recipes.\n* Set up a tradition where each family member or branch contributes a new recipe to the collection every year.\n\nBy collecting and sharing your family's recipes, you'll not only preserve your culinary heritage but also create a treasured keepsake that will be cherished for generations to come.\n\nRemember to have fun and be patient during the process. It might take some time to collect and organize all the recipes, but the end result will be well worth it. Good luck, and I hope you have a wonderful time sharing recipes and stories with your aunt and uncle!",
