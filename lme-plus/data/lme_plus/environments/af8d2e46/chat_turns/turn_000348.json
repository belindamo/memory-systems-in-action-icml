  "content": "The construction of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome began in 1506 and was not completed until 1626, making it a 120-year-long construction project. The project was undertaken by several different architects and popes during this time, with each one adding their own unique style and vision to the building's design. The basilica went through several design modifications and challenges were also encountered during construction, which resulted in some significant delays in the project. Nevertheless, St. Peter's Basilica stands today as one of the most iconic religious landmarks in the world, attracting millions of visitors every year.",
