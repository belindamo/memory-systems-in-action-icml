I also posted about it on social media, which helped spread the word. I didn't have to do anything too crazy, but it was still a great feeling to see the donations roll in.\n\nAnd yeah, I'm definitely thinking of doing another charity event soon. I've been trying to do at least one a month, so I'm already looking for something to do in April. Maybe a charity bike ride or a volunteer day at a local animal shelter. I'm open to anything that'll make a difference!",
