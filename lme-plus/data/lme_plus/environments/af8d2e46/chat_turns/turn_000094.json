I have a close friend who's been supportive throughout my journey, and I think I'll reach out to her and ask if she'd be willing to be my \"accountability buddy.\" We could check in with each other regularly and share our progress, which could help us both stay on track.\n\nI also think it would be helpful to have someone to talk to who understands what I'm going through. Sometimes, it feels like my friends and family don't fully understand what it's like to live with anxiety and depression, and it can be isolating. But with a friend who's going through similar struggles, I feel like I can be more open and honest about my feelings and experiences.\n\nThanks for the suggestion! I'll definitely reach out to my friend and see if she's interested in being my accountability buddy.\n\nWhat do you think about journaling as a way to track",
