  "content": "Yes, there were several major setbacks and obstacles during the construction of St. Peter's Basilica. One of the biggest challenges was the death of the original architect, Donato Bramante, in 1514. This led to several different architects being hired to complete the project, including Raphael, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Michelangelo, all of whom made significant changes to the original design. \n\nAdditionally, Pope Julius II, who commissioned the project, died in 1513, and work on the basilica slowed down drastically in the years that followed. \n\nThere were also financial problems, including embezzlement and mismanagement of funds, which resulted in a lack of funds to continue the construction work. \n\nMoreover, the unstable Roman soil caused some technical difficulties during construction, especially when they started building the large dome, which required an innovative design to support its weight. \n\nDespite these obstacles, construction continued with the backing of several popes over a period of more than a century until the basilica was finally completed in 1626.",
