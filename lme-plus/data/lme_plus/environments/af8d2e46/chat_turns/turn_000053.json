  "content": "Starch is a carbohydrate made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with the molecular formula (C6H10O5)n. It is typically derived from plants, such as corn or potatoes, and is used in a variety of applications, including as a source of food for humans and animals, and as a raw material for the production of biodegradable plastics and other materials.\n\nSugarcane, on the other hand, is a plant that is primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with smaller amounts of other elements such as nitrogen and sulfur. The exact elemental composition of sugarcane can vary depending on factors such as the specific variety of sugarcane and the conditions under which it is grown.\n\nBoth starch and sugarcane are plant-based materials that can be used to produce compostable packaging, which can add valuable organic matter and nutrients to compost when properly composted.",
