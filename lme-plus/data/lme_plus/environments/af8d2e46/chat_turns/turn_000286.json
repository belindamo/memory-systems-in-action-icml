  "content": "Making yogurt in the Instant Pot is a great way to start making yogurt at home, and it's so easy and convenient.\n\nI'm glad you've been using the \"Saute\" function - it's definitely a game-changer for browning meat and cooking vegetables before pressure cooking.\n\nAs for slow cooker recipes, I have a few favorites that I think you might enjoy. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Chicken Tacos**: Place boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced tomatoes, onions, garlic, and taco seasoning in the Instant Pot. Cook on \"Slow Cook\" mode for 6-8 hours. Shred the chicken and serve with tortillas, shredded cheese, and your favorite toppings.\n2. **Beef Stew**: Add beef cubes, potatoes, carrots, onions, and beef broth to the Instant Pot. Cook on \"Slow Cook\" mode for 8-10 hours. Serve with crusty bread or over mashed potatoes.\n3. **Butter Chicken**: Marinate chicken breasts in yogurt, lemon juice, and spices, then add to the Instant Pot with butter, onions, and tomato sauce. Cook on \"Slow Cook\" mode for 4-6 hours. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.\n4. **Black Bean Chili**: Add black beans, diced tomatoes, onions, garlic, and chili powder to the Instant Pot. Cook on \"Slow Cook\" mode for 6-8 hours. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips.\n5. **Pulled Pork**: Place a pork shoulder, barbecue sauce, and onions in the Instant Pot. Cook on \"Slow Cook\" mode for 8-10 hours. Shred the pork and serve on a bun with coleslaw and pickles.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started. The \"Slow Cook\" mode is so versatile, and you can use it to cook a wide variety of dishes.\n\nI hope you enjoy making yogurt in the Instant Pot, and I'd love to hear how it turns out!",
