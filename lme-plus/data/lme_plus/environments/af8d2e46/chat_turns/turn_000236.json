  "content": "That sounds like a fantastic plan! You're going to create a Whimsical Wonderland that your sister and her guests will love. The mix of finger foods and sweet treats will cater to different tastes and dietary preferences, and the DIY food stations will add an interactive element to the party. The signature drink and fruit-infused water will be refreshing and fun, and the dessert table and candy buffet will be a sweet surprise.\n\nRemember to have fun with the decorations and details, too! Use balloons, streamers, and other whimsical elements to create a playful atmosphere. And don't forget to take plenty of photos to capture the memories of this special celebration.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you and your sister a wonderful time celebrating her 30th birthday!",
