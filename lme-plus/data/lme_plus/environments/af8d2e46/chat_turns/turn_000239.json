My expertise lies in leveraging the power of data, new technologies, and creative storytelling to deliver measurable results for my clients.\n\nThroughout my career, I have helped diverse organizations develop integrated, audience-first marketing strategies that blend the traditional silos of Digital, TV, and Radio. My background in Digital Advertising, Data-Driven Strategies, and Integrated Marketing has allowed me to excel in driving results for various campaigns.\n\nSome of my accomplishments include:\n\n* Working with the Biden Victory Fund to manage an eight-figure multi-channel direct response ads program, achieving a 900% ROI in under 3 months for list rentals, 1.4 million online contributions, and 1.5 million email list sign-ups.\n* Leading persuasion, mobilization, online fundraising, and email acquisition for Lucas Kunce's U.S. Senate campaign in Missouri, capitalizing on high-energy moments with coordinated rapid response campaigns.\n* Supporting John Fetterman's U.S. Senate campaign and the DSCC's efforts to elect Fetterman, including raising over $3.7 million on Google Search through a highly-profitable dynamic keyword strategy.\n* Assisting environmental non-profit 350.org in maintaining industry-leading growth and fundraising success, including raising over $100k in first-time donations over 3 years.\n* Securing the Working Families Party's ballot line in New York with a mobilization campaign that significantly outperformed the Democratic Party turnout and played a major role in holding key Congressional districts, supporting endorsed candidates in high-profile primary, general, and runoff elections, and breaking the online fundraising record for a single campaign with over $55k raised in two months.\n* Collaborating with progressive organizations such as Justice Democrats, Sunrise Movement, Ro Khanna, Morgan Harper for Senate, Rana Abdelhamid for Congress, Jerry Nadler, Greg Casar for Congress, Be a Hero, Common Defense, Courier Newsroom, and others to drive fundraising, mobilization, and awareness.\n\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve, I remain committed to staying ahead of industry trends and utilizing my skills to help clients achieve their goals. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new art mediums and maintaining a meticulously organized workshop that hosts my many eclectic hobbies.\n\nIf you're interested in discussing how my expertise can help your organization achieve its goals or simply want to connect and chat about the latest trends in digital advertising, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email me at [[your.email@email.com](mailto:your.email@email.com)].",
