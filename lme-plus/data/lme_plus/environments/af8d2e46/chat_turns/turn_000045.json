  "content": "Organic matter is any material that comes from living organisms or is the result of the decomposition of living organisms. This includes plant and animal residues such as leaves, branches, roots, and animal manure, as well as soil organisms like bacteria, fungi, and insects.\n\nOrganic matter is an important component of healthy soil because it helps to improve soil structure, increase water holding capacity, and provide nutrients for plants. When organic matter is added to soil, it can increase the population and diversity of soil microorganisms, which are crucial for breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients that plants can use.\n\nOrganic matter is also a key component of compost, which is made from decomposed plant and animal material. Compost can be used as a soil amendment to improve soil health, and is often used as a natural fertilizer in organic gardening.\n\nIn summary, organic matter refers to any material that comes from living organisms or is the result of the decomposition of living organisms, and is an important component of healthy soil and compost.",
