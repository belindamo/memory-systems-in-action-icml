Even though it went through several design changes and delays, it's a testimony to the skill of the architects who worked on the project and the determination of the popes who continued to support it. It's a testament to the faith of the Catholic Church that they were willing to invest so much time, effort, and resources to create such a stunning and symbolic edifice. \n\nOver time, the basilica has been adorned with some of the most significant works of art in Western history, including Michelangelo's Piet\u00e0, and Bernini's Baldacchino, which adds to the stunning beauty of the basilica. Today, millions of visitors flock to St. Peter's Basilica every year to admire its architecture, learn about its history, and appreciate its religious significance.",
