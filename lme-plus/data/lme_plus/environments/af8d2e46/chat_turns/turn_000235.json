  "content": "I think I'll go with a mix of finger foods and sweet treats, and set up a few food stations like a DIY taco bar and a build-your-own-sundae station. For drinks, I'll create a signature drink like an \"Aquamarine Spritzer\" and offer fruit-infused water and iced tea. I love the idea of a dessert table with aquamarine-colored desserts and a candy buffet. And, of course, I'll use colorful serving dishes and utensils to add to the whimsical atmosphere. Thanks for the ideas!",
