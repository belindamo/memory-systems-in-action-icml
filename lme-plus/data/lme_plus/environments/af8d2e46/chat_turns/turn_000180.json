Use within 3 to 4 days.\n3. **Freezing:** Wrap cooled chicken tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place in a freezer-safe bag. Frozen chicken can be stored for 4 months. When reheating, make sure it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n4. **Reheating:** Reheat cooked chicken to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).
