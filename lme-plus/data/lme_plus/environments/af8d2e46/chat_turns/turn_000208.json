By dedicating time to both, you'll be able to make progress on your main tasks while also nurturing your side project.\n\nRemember, the key is to be flexible and adapt to your needs. As you implement this new routine, pay attention to how it's working for you. If you find that you need to adjust the time allocations or focus on different tasks, don't hesitate to make changes.\n\nIt's also essential to celebrate your small wins, even if it's just 30 minutes of progress on your side project. Acknowledge the effort you're putting in and the progress you're making, no matter how small it may seem. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue working towards your goals.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help. Good luck with your new routine, and I hope it brings you the productivity and fulfillment you're looking for!",
