  "content": "Gender identity refers to a person's subjective sense of their own gender, which may be different from the sex they were assigned at birth. Sexual orientation, on the other hand, refers to a person's emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attraction to others. While gender identity and sexual orientation are related in that they both have to do with a person's relationship to gender and sexuality, they are distinct concepts that are not necessarily directly related to each other. A person's gender identity may be one of many factors that influence their sexual orientation, but it does not determine it.",
