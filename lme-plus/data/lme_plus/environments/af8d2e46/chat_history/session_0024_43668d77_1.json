      "content": "What a lovely gesture! I'd be happy to help you with decoration ideas that match your sister's style.\n\nFirst, let's start with the aquamarine necklace. Aquamarine is a beautiful, calming gemstone often associated with the ocean, so I'll suggest some ideas that incorporate those elements:\n\n**Theme Ideas:**\n\n1. **Under the Sea**: Create an ocean-inspired setting with shades of blue and green. Use balloons, streamers, and tablecloths in soft aqua hues. Add some seashells, starfish, and fish-shaped decorations to create a whimsical atmosphere.\n2. **Coastal Chic**: Go for a more sophisticated, beachy vibe with a color palette of whites, creams, and blues. Use natural elements like driftwood, sea glass, and nautical ropes to add texture and interest.\n3. **Garden Party**: If your sister loves the outdoors, consider a garden party theme. Use a mix of blues and greens to evoke a sense of serenity. Add some floral arrangements, lanterns, and a few strategically placed garden benches to create a charming setting.\n\n**Decoration Ideas:**\n\n1. **Aquamarine Accents**: Incorporate aquamarine-hued decorations, such as table runners, napkin rings, or even a custom banner with her name and age in aquamarine-colored letters.\n2. **Personalized Elements**: Use photos of your sister from throughout her life to create a beautiful photo booth or a customized birthday banner.\n3. **Lighting**: String lights or fairy lights in soft blue and white hues can add a warm, magical ambiance to the party.\n4. **Centerpieces**: Use glass vases or mercury glass containers filled with aquamarine-colored flowers, like delphiniums or forget-me-nots, to add a pop of color to the tables.\n5. **Special Touches**: Set up a \"30 and Fabulous\" or \"Pearls and Aquamarine\" dessert table with ocean-inspired treats, like sea-salt caramel brownies or aqua-colored macarons.\n\n**Budget-Friendly Tips:**\n\n1. Repurpose items you already have, like vases, candles, or decorative items in blue and green hues.\n2. Shop for decorations during post-holiday sales or use DIY projects to save money.\n3. Consider a smaller, intimate gathering to keep costs down.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to make the party a celebration of your sister's special day!"
