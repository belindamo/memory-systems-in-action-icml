      "content": "Based on your height, weight, and body type, you may want to consider the following fashion style tips:\n\n1. Emphasize your upper body: To balance out your lower body, try emphasizing your upper body with tops that have interesting details such as ruffles, bows, or statement sleeves. This will draw attention away from your lower body and create a more balanced look.\n2. A-line dresses and skirts: A-line dresses and skirts are a great choice for people with a pear-shaped body. They skim over the hips and thighs, creating a more balanced silhouette. You can also try wearing dresses and skirts with a high waistline to elongate your legs.\n3. Dark-colored pants and skirts: Dark colors are slimming and can help create a more streamlined look. Try wearing dark-colored pants and skirts to slim down your lower half. You can also wear patterned or bright-colored tops to draw attention to your upper body.\n4. High-waisted pants and skirts: High-waisted pants and skirts can help create a more defined waistline and elongate your legs. You can pair high-waisted pants with a fitted top to create a more balanced look.\n5. Avoid clingy fabrics: Avoid wearing clingy fabrics such as jersey or spandex as they can accentuate your lower body. Instead, opt for fabrics that drape well such as cotton, linen, or silk.\n\nRemember, fashion is all about expressing yourself and feeling confident in what you wear. These tips are just suggestions, and ultimately, it's up to you to decide what works best for your style and body type."

      "content": "For a clean, professional look that is also comfortable, you may want to consider the following fashion style tips:\n\n1. Tailored pieces: Opt for tailored pieces such as blazers, trousers, and pencil skirts. These pieces will create a streamlined look and are usually made from comfortable, stretchy fabrics that won't restrict your movement.\n2. Classic colors: Stick to classic colors such as black, navy, and gray for a timeless, professional look. These colors are also versatile and easy to mix and match with other pieces in your wardrobe.\n3. Comfortable shoes: Choose comfortable shoes that can handle a lot of movement such as loafers or low-heeled pumps. Avoid shoes that are too high or too tight as they can be uncomfortable and may cause blisters.\n4. Simple accessories: Keep your accessories simple and understated. A classic watch or a simple necklace can add a touch of elegance to your outfit without overpowering it.\n5. Breathable fabrics: Look for breathable fabrics such as cotton, linen, or silk. These fabrics will keep you cool and comfortable throughout the day, especially if you work in a warm environment.\n\nRemember, a clean and professional style doesn't have to be boring. You can add interest to your outfit with a patterned blouse, a statement necklace, or a colorful scarf. The most important thing is to feel confident and comfortable in what you're wearing, so you can focus on delivering a great lecture."
