      "content": "Bell peppers, zucchini, and onions will roast beautifully and complement the Chicken Fajitas nicely. \n\nFor a simple salad, I recommend a **Cilantro Lime Salad**, which is a refreshing and light side dish that pairs well with the bold flavors of the fajitas.

      "content": "That sounds great! I think I'll also use some of the canned beans I stocked up on at the local supermarket chain in the salad, maybe black beans or kidney beans, to add some protein and fiber. Do you have any suggestions on how to incorporate them into the salad?"

      "content": "What a fantastic idea! Adding canned beans to the salad is a great way to boost the protein and fiber content, making it a more filling and nutritious side dish. Both black beans and kidney beans would work well in the Cilantro Lime Salad. Here's how you can incorporate them:\n\n**Incorporating Canned Beans into the Salad:**\n\n1. **Drain and Rinse**: Drain the liquid from the canned beans and rinse them with cold water to remove excess sodium.\n2. **Add to the Salad**: Mix the drained and rinsed beans into the salad along with the mixed greens, chopped cilantro, diced red onion, and diced tomatoes.\n3. **Season with Lime Juice and Cumin**: Add a squeeze of fresh lime juice and a sprinkle of ground cumin to the beans before mixing them into the salad. This will help bring out their natural flavor and complement the other ingredients.\n4. **Use as a Topping**: Alternatively, you can use the canned beans as a topping for the salad, rather than mixing them in. This way, each person can add as much or as little of the beans as they like.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Choose low-sodium or no-salt-added canned beans to reduce the overall sodium content of the salad.\n* If using kidney beans, you may want to chop them slightly to distribute their flavor and texture more evenly throughout the salad.\n* Consider adding some diced bell peppers or diced jalape\u00f1os to the salad to add more flavor and crunch.\n\nBy incorporating canned beans into the Cilantro Lime Salad, you'll not only add protein and fiber but also texture and flavor. This salad will now provide a nice contrast to the savory, spicy flavors of the Chicken Fajitas and Roasted Vegetables.\n\nYou've got a well-rounded, delicious, and nutritious meal prepared! Enjoy your Chicken Fajitas with Roasted Vegetables and Cilantro Lime Salad, featuring canned beans!"
