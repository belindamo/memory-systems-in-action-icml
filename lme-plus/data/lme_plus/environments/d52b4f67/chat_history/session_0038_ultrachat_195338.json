The project includes plans to build two new stands - the Lock and the Pavilion - which will increase the capacity of the ground to over 28,000. The Lock Stand will be the largest architectural and engineering project in the history of The Oval, with a design that will incorporate a curved 360-degree cantilever roof. The Pavilion Stand will also be rebuilt, providing additional hospitality and office spaces, a new gym, and an extended Members' Pavilion. The redevelopment project also includes the refurbishment of the existing Peter May and OCS Stands, improving the facilities for players and members of the media. The project is expected to be completed by 2023, ahead of the 100th Test match at the ground."
