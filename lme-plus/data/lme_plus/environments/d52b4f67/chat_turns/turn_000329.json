  "content": "I'm trying to plan a fantasy basketball team and I need some advice on who to pick for my starting lineup. I've been watching a lot of sports lately, especially basketball and football. By the way, I watched some of the Australian Open tennis tournament today, including Novak Djokovic's straight-sets win over Daniil Medvedev. Anyway, back to basketball - can you give me some suggestions on top point guards to choose from?",
