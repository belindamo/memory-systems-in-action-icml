Could you please share your city or state/province with me? That way, I can provide you with more targeted recommendations.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general resources that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Event calendars**: Websites like Eventbrite, Meetup, and Lanyrd often feature sustainable energy-related events, conferences, and workshops. You can filter by location, topic, and date to find something that suits your interests.\n2. **Industry associations**: Look for local or national associations focused on sustainable energy, such as the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) or the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). They often host events, conferences, and webinars on various topics related to sustainable energy.\n3. **Universities and research institutions**: Many universities and research institutions have departments or centers focused on sustainable energy. They may host seminars, lectures, or conferences that are open to the public.\n4. **Local government websites**: Your city or state's government website may list upcoming events, workshops, or conferences related to sustainable energy initiatives or policies.\n5. **Social media**: Follow local organizations, companies, or individuals involved in sustainable energy on social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook.
