  "content": "I think I'll start with my main character, Emily, and see how she responds to some of these questions. I might even try to do a few interviews with her at different points in the story to see how she changes and grows. Thanks for the tips on dialogue too, I'll definitely keep those in mind as I'm writing. By the way, I've been thinking about the writing workshop I took back in October, and how it really helped me focus on my writing goals. I'm hoping this character interview exercise will have a similar effect on my character development.",
