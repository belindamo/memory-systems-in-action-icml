Here's a quick recipe:\n\n**Cilantro Lime Salad Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 4 cups mixed greens (lettuce, spinach, arugula, or a combination)\n* 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro\n* 1/2 cup diced red onion (thinly sliced or diced)\n* 1/2 cup diced fresh tomatoes ( cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes work well)\n* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice\n* 1 teaspoon olive oil\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine the mixed greens, chopped cilantro, diced red onion, and diced tomatoes.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice and olive oil.\n3. Pour the lime juice mixture over the salad and toss to coat.\n4. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n5. Serve immediately.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use fresh, high-quality ingredients for the best flavor and texture.\n* Adjust the amount of lime juice and olive oil to your taste.\n* Add some crumbled queso fresco or shredded cheese for extra flavor, if you like.\n* This salad is best made just before serving, as the cilantro can wilt quickly.\n\nThis Cilantro Lime Salad is a great way to add some freshness and brightness to your meal.
