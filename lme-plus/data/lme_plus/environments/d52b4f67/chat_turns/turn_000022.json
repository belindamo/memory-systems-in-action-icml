I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my workload lately, especially with this big campaign I'm working on. I've been putting in around 40 hours a week, but sometimes I have to stay late to meet deadlines or attend meetings. I've completed my undergraduate studies about 2 years ago, and I've been working in the industry for a bit now, but I still feel like I could use some tips on staying organized.",
