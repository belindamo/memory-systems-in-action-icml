I'll give it a shot and see what kind of insights I can gain from my characters. By the way, I've been doing daily journaling since my mindfulness workshop in February, and it's really helped me clarify my thoughts and feelings. I'm hoping this character interview exercise will have a similar effect on my writing.",
