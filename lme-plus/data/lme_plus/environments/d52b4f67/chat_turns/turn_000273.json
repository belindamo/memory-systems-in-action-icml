This method is called \"cloching\" or \"bagging,\" and it's a popular technique among succulent enthusiasts.\n\n**Benefits of using a propagation tray with a clear plastic dome:**\n\n1. **Humidity:** The clear plastic dome creates a humid microclimate, which helps to:\n\t* Reduce transpiration (water loss) from the cuttings.\n\t* Encourage root development.\n\t* Prevent drying out of the cut ends.\n2. **Temperature control:** The dome helps to maintain a consistent temperature, which is ideal for root development.\n3. **Light protection:** The clear plastic allows for filtered light to reach the cuttings, while protecting them from intense direct sunlight.\n4. **Pest control:** The dome creates a barrier against pests, reducing the risk of infestation.\n5. **Moisture retention:** The dome helps to retain moisture in the soil, reducing the need for frequent watering.\n\n**Tips for using a propagation tray with a clear plastic dome:**\n\n1. **Choose the right size:** Select a tray that fits your cuttings comfortably, with enough space for air circulation.\n2. **Use a well-draining mix:** Ensure your potting mix is designed for cacti and succulents, and has good drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.\n3. **Water carefully:** Water your cuttings sparingly, as the dome can create a humid environment. Check the soil moisture by gently sticking your finger into the soil.\n4. **Monitor temperature:** Keep an eye on the temperature inside the dome, and ensure it's within the suitable range for your succulent species (usually between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F or 18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n5. **Ventilation:** After 1-2 weeks, start to vent the dome by slightly opening it or removing it for a few hours a day to allow for air exchange and prevent the buildup of condensation.\n6. **Watch for condensation:** Check the dome regularly for condensation, and wipe it off with a clean cloth to prevent water droplets from dripping onto the cuttings.\n\nBy using a propagation tray with a clear plastic dome, you'll create an ideal environment for your succulent cuttings to thrive. Just remember to monitor temperature, humidity, and moisture levels, and you'll be well on your way to successful propagation!",
