However, it's common for large organizations like OTIS to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their programs and policies regularly continually. OTIS may have processes in place to analyze employee feedback or other metrics such as absenteeism rates, employee engagement surveys or retention rates, to assess the effectiveness of such initiatives regularly. Feedback from employees can provide insights into what initiatives have been helpful and which ones may need improvement or changes. Based on the results of these evaluations, OTIS could then make adjustments to their initiatives to meet the changing needs of their workforce while maintaining an appropriate balance between work and personal life.",
