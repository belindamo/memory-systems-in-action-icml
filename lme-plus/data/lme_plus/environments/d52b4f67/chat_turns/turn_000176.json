Make lifestyle changes: To prevent craving and manage stress, try to incorporate healthy habits into your life, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress-relieving activities like meditation or yoga. 6. Avoid triggers: Try to avoid situations or people that trigger smoking cravings, such as bars or social events with smokers. 7.
