  "content": "Todoist is a great choice for quickly capturing tasks while you're on the go, and it offers several ways to add tasks easily. Here are some suggestions for using Todoist to quickly add tasks to a running list and sync with your other organizing apps:\n\n1. Mobile app: Use the Todoist app on your smartphone to quickly add tasks anytime, anywhere. You can easily open the app, tap the \"+\" button, and type or dictate your task. The app will automatically sync with your Todoist account and other devices.\n2. Widgets: If you're using an Android or iOS device, you can add a Todoist widget to your home screen for even quicker task entry. This way, you can add tasks without even opening the app.\n3. Email: Todoist allows you to create tasks by sending an email to a unique address associated with your account. Save this email address in your contacts for easy access, and simply send an email with the task in the subject line when you're on the go.\n4. Voice assistants: If you have a voice assistant like Google Assistant, Siri, or Amazon Alexa, you can connect Todoist to these services and add tasks using voice commands. For example, you can say, \"Hey Google, add 'buy milk' to my Todoist.\"\n5. Browser extension: If you're using a computer, you can install the Todoist browser extension for quick task entry. This allows you to add tasks from your browser without needing to open the Todoist app or website.\n\nTo sync your tasks between Todoist and your other organizing apps, you can explore the following options:\n\n1. Integration services: Use services like Zapier or IFTTT to create automated workflows that sync tasks between Todoist and your other apps, such as Skedpal, Sunsama, or Routinely App. These services offer various triggers and actions that can be customized to suit your needs.\n2. Native integrations: Todoist offers native integrations with some apps, so check if any of your organizing apps have built-in Todoist support. For example, you can integrate Todoist with Google Calendar or Trello directly from the Todoist settings.\n3. Manual syncing: If there's no direct integration or automation available, you can manually transfer tasks between Todoist and your other apps during your daily or weekly reviews. This process can be time-consuming, but it ensures your tasks are up-to-date across all your organizing tools.\n\nRemember to review and adjust your task management workflow periodically to make sure it remains effective and efficient for your needs.",
