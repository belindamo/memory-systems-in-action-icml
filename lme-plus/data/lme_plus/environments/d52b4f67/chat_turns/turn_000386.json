You can always start with a lighter resistance and adjust as needed.\n* Make sure to anchor the resistance band or cable handle securely to prevent it from slipping or moving during the exercise.\n* Keep in mind that resistance bands can stretch over time, so you may need to adjust the tension or replace the band periodically.\n\nRemember to focus on proper form and technique when performing the Pallof press, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or need guidance on the exercise.",
