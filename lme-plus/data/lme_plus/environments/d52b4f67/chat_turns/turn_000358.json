With the addition of the Lock and Pavilion stands, there will be an increase in the overall capacity of the ground, making it possible to host larger events with more people. The new stands will also provide state-of-the-art facilities for players, officials, and members of the media, which will make it possible to host international events such as cricket world cups, athletics championships, concerts, and many other sporting and cultural events. The Oval has a rich history of hosting world-class events, and the redevelopment project will ensure that the ground continues to be an important part of London's sporting and cultural landscape for many years to come.",
