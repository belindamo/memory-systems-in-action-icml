Here are some healthy fats that pair well with chicken and veggies:\n\n**Healthy Fat Suggestions**\n\n1. **Avocado**: Diced or sliced avocado adds creaminess and a boost of healthy fats, fiber, and various vitamins.\n2. **Nuts and Seeds**: Chopped nuts like almonds, walnuts, or pecans provide crunch and a dose of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. You can also use seeds like chia, flax, or hemp for added nutrition.\n3. **Olive Oil**: While we've already used olive oil for cooking, you can also add a drizzle of high-quality olive oil on top of the dish for extra flavor and healthy fats.\n4. **Feta Cheese**: Crumbly feta cheese adds a tangy flavor and a boost of protein, calcium, and healthy fats. Look for a low-sodium, high-fat version.\n\n**Revised One-Pot Chicken and Veggies Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs\n* 2 cups mixed veggies (choose 3-4 from the previous list)\n* 1 tbsp olive oil\n* 1 tsp chicken seasoning (choose one from before)\n* 1 tsp veggie seasoning (choose one from before)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* 1/2 cup quinoa or brown rice\n* 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth\n* 1/4 cup chopped nuts or seeds (optional)\n* 1/4 cup diced avocado or crumbled feta cheese (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.\n2. Add the chicken and cook until browned, about 5-6 minutes. Remove from pot and set aside.\n3. Add more oil if needed, then add the mixed veggies. Cook until they start to soften, about 3-4 minutes.\n4. Add the chicken back into the pot, along with the chicken seasoning, veggie seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.\n5. Add quinoa or brown rice and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through, veggies are tender, and quinoa is cooked.\n6. Stir in chopped nuts or seeds and diced avocado or crumbled feta cheese (if using).\n\nBy reducing quinoa and adding healthy fats, we've made the dish more balanced and satisfying. The healthy fats will also help keep you full and energized throughout the day!",
