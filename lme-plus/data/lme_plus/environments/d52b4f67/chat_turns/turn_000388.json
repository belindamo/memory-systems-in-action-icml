However, I think there might be some confusion - I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or habits, so I didn't mention meal prepping on the weekends. But I'd be happy to help you with healthy snack ideas that are easy to prepare and take on-the-go!\n\nHere are some nutritious and convenient snack options:\n\n1. **Fresh Fruits**: Apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, or any other seasonal fruits are easy to grab and go.\n2. **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or trail mix are rich in healthy fats and protein.\n3. **Energy Balls**: Oat-based energy balls with nuts, seeds, and dried fruits are a no-bake, healthy snack option.\n4. **Veggie Sticks with Hummus**: Carrot, celery, and cucumber sticks with a protein-rich hummus dip make for a satisfying snack.\n5. **Protein-rich Snack Bars**: Look for natural ingredient-based bars like RXBAR, Quest Bar, or Kind Bar.\n6. **Hard-Boiled Eggs**: Boil a dozen eggs on the weekend and keep them in the fridge for a quick protein-packed snack.\n7. **Yogurt Parfait**: Layer Greek yogurt with fresh berries, granola, and a sprinkle of spinach for a healthy and filling snack.\n8. **Cut Veggies with Guacamole**: Prepare a batch of guacamole on the weekend and store it in an airtight container.
