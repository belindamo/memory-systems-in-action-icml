  "content": "So, your project is focused on helping startup founders identify and understand their target audience. That's a fantastic niche!\n\nGiven your project's focus, I'm assuming you're targeting startup founders, entrepreneurs, and possibly small business owners. Here are some potential targeting options to consider:\n\n1. **Job title targeting**: Target people with job titles like CEO, Founder, Co-Founder, Entrepreneur, or Small Business Owner.\n2. **Industry targeting**: Target industries like technology, e-commerce, healthcare, finance, or other sectors that are commonly associated with startups.\n3. **Behavioral targeting**: Target people who have shown interest in startup-related topics, such as entrepreneurship, innovation, or business growth.\n4. **Interest-based targeting**: Target people who are interested in startup-related pages, groups, or influencers on social media.\n5. **Lookalike targeting**: Create a lookalike audience based on a list of existing startup founders or entrepreneurs who have shown interest in your project.\n\nTo further refine your targeting, you could also consider the following:\n\n1. **Company size targeting**: Target founders of companies with a specific number of employees or revenue range.\n2. **Funding status targeting**: Target founders who have received funding or are seeking funding.\n3. **Location targeting**: Target founders based in specific regions, cities, or countries.\n\nSince you've met Michael and other startup founders at the workshop, you might also consider creating a **custom audience** based on your existing connections or email list. This can help you target people who are already familiar with your project and are more likely to be interested in your services.\n\nHow do these targeting options sound? Are there any specific pain points or challenges you're facing when it comes to targeting startup founders?",
