  "content": "As a language model AI, I do not consume food and beverages, but I can provide you with options for a vegan substitute for white wine in the vegan carbonara recipe which includes:\n\n1. Vegetable Broth: You can substitute white wine in this recipe with an equal amount of vegetable broth. It will still provide a savory and robust flavor to your dish.\n\n2. Apple Cider Vinegar: You can also use apple cider vinegar instead of white wine. It has a tangy and acidic taste that can add a unique flavor to your carbonara. Use it sparingly though, as it can be quite strong.\n\n3. Lemon Juice: Adding fresh lemon juice can add a bright, citrusy flavor to your pasta. Use it in small quantities, as it can quickly overpower other tastes in the dish.\n\nI hope this helps! Enjoy your vegan carbonara.",
