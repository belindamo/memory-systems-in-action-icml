You can also use brown sugar or honey as alternatives.\n* **Add flavorings**: You can add a pinch of nutmeg or cinnamon powder to enhance the flavor.\n* **Experiment with milks**: Try using different types of milk, like almond milk or coconut milk, to create a creamier or dairy-free Pongal.\n* **Make it sweet or savory**: You can adjust the amount of jaggery to make a sweeter or savory Pongal.\n\nRemember, the key to making a delicious Pongal is to cook the rice and dal together, use the right amount of jaggery, and simmer the mixture slowly to develop the flavors.
