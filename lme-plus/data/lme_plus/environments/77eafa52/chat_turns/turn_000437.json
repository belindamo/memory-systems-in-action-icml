  "content": "While it is true that the ruling class has often prioritized their own interests over the needs of the people throughout history, it is worth noting that not all leaders and elites have acted solely out of self-interest. There have been leaders who have recognized the importance of addressing the needs and rights of the common people and have taken steps towards creating a more just and equal society. Additionally, it is worth examining the structural factors that have contributed to the concentration of power and resources in the hands of the few.\n\nOverall, while the actions of the ruling class throughout history may be seen as selfish and shortsighted, it is important to consider the nuances of how power and privilege operate and to understand that change is possible when people come together to demand it.",
