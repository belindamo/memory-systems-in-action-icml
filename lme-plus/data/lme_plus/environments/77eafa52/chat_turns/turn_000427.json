  "content": "The Congress of Vienna's legal framework did not specifically recognize or protect any human rights. Instead, its main goals were to establish a balance of power, maintain peace, and restore the pre-revolutionary political order in Europe. It aimed to achieve these goals by promoting the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states. The Congress of Vienna did not prioritize the protection of individual human rights or civil liberties, as these concepts were not central to the European diplomatic and political agenda at the time.",
