Chew toys: Puppies love to chew, so it's important to have a few toys that are specifically designed for this purpose. Some popular options include rope toys, rubber chew toys, and durable chew toys. 2. Interactive toys: These toys are designed to mentally stimulate your puppy and keep them engaged. Examples include puzzle toys, treat-dispensing toys, and interactive balls. 3. Plush toys: Soft and cuddly toys can provide comfort and companionship for your puppy, and many come with squeakers or other features that make for an engaging playtime. When choosing toys for your puppy, make sure they are appropriate for your puppy's age and size, and avoid toys that have small parts that can be chewed off and swallowed. Also, remember that no toy is completely indestructible, so be sure to supervise your puppy during playtime to avoid any accidents.",
