I recommend checking the Bellagio's website or the Fountains of Bellagio's Twitter account for the most up-to-date schedule.\n\nSince you're having dinner at Spago, you can catch a show before or after your meal. If you time it right, you can enjoy the fountains from Spago's patio seating area. Make sure to request a table with a view when you arrive.\n\nHave a wonderful dinner and enjoy the concert!",
