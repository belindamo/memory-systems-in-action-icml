Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Typically, tire rotation is recommended every 5,000 to 8,000 miles (8,000 to 13,000 km).\n* Some vehicles may have specific recommendations, so it's best to check your owner's manual or the manufacturer's website.\n* If you drive aggressively, carry heavy loads, or drive in harsh weather conditions, you may need to rotate your tires more frequently.\n* Additionally, if you notice uneven tire wear, it's a good idea to rotate your tires as soon as possible to ensure even wear and extend the life of your tires.\n\nAs for your registration renewal, $120 per year seems like a reasonable cost. It's great that you took care of that online \u2013 convenient and time-saving!\n\nSince you're due for an oil change soon, you might consider combining it with a tire rotation and a quick vehicle inspection to ensure everything is in good condition.
