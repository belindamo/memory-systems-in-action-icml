If you're not getting a response from Sakura Travel Agency, it's prudent to explore alternative flight options to ensure you have a backup plan in place.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Check with airlines directly**: Reach out to airlines that operate flights to Japan, such as Japan Airlines, ANA, or Delta, to see if they have any available seats on your preferred travel dates.\n2. **Use flight comparison websites**: Websites like Expedia, Kayak, or Skyscanner can help you compare prices and find alternative flights.\n3. **Consider different airports**: If you have multiple airport options, check prices and availability for each airport to see if you can find a better deal.\n4. **Be flexible with your travel dates**: If possible, consider flying a day or two earlier or later to see if you can find better options.\n5. **Look into travel agencies with 24/7 customer support**: If you're concerned about Sakura Travel Agency's responsiveness, you might want to explore agencies with 24/7 customer support.\n\nRemember to also check the cancellation policies and fees associated with any new bookings, in case you need to make changes or cancel your trip.\n\nWhile it's unsettling to deal with uncertainty, having a backup plan can give you peace of mind and ensure you're prepared for any eventuality.\n\nFingers crossed that Sakura Travel Agency gets back to you soon, but it's always better to be safe than sorry!",
