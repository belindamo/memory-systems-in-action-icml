  "content": "What a great combo! The Bellagio is a fantastic venue, and you'll have a blast with your friends! There are plenty of amazing dining options around the Bellagio, so I'd be happy to recommend some top-notch restaurants for dinner before the show. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Wolfgang Puck's Spago**: A celebrity chef's flagship restaurant, located right inside the Bellagio. Spago offers farm-to-table California cuisine with a focus on seasonal ingredients. Make a reservation for their patio seating to enjoy the Fountains of Bellagio view.\n2. **Le Cirque**: Another Bellagio gem, this AAA Five Diamond award-winning restaurant serves contemporary French cuisine with an exquisite atmosphere. Their tasting menu is a great option if you want to try a little of everything.\n3. **Picasso**: This Michelin-starred restaurant, also inside the Bellagio, offers a unique dining experience with a focus on Spanish-inspired cuisine. The menu is designed to pair perfectly with their extensive wine list.\n4. **Carbone**: If you're in the mood for Italian-American cuisine, head to Carbone at the Aria Resort & Casino, just a short walk from the Bellagio. This retro-styled restaurant serves up classic dishes like veal parmesan and lobster fra diavolo.\n5. **Eataly**: Located at Park MGM, about a 10-minute walk from the Bellagio, Eataly is a massive Italian market and restaurant complex. Choose from various dining options, including seafood, pasta, and pizza, or grab some quick bites at their market counters.\n6. **The Cosmopolitan's** **Scarpetta**: If you're willing to venture a bit further (about a 15-minute walk), Scarpetta at The Cosmopolitan offers creative Italian cuisine with a focus on seasonal ingredients. Their outdoor patio has a great view of the Strip.\n\nReservations are highly recommended for these popular restaurants, especially on a concert night. You can use online reservation platforms like OpenTable or call the restaurants directly to book your table.\n\nEnjoy your dinner and the concert!",
