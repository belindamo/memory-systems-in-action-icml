Based on your experience on the 4-day trip to Yosemite, I think you're right to question whether a 40L pack would be sufficient for your needs.\n\nA 40L pack is a great size for shorter trips or for hikers who pack very lightly. However, if you're planning to carry all your gear for a multi-day trip, including camping equipment, clothing, and food, you might find a 40L pack to be a bit cramped.\n\nConsidering you had to carry all your gear on your 4-day trip to Yosemite, I would recommend considering a larger pack size, such as 50-60L. This would give you more room to pack all your essentials, including:\n\n* Camping gear (tent, sleeping bag, pad, etc.)\n* Clothing and layers for varying weather conditions\n* Food and cooking gear\n* Personal hygiene items\n* First aid kit\n* Map, compass, and other navigation tools\n* Headlamp, flashlight, or other lighting sources\n* Emergency shelter and warmth layers (in case of unexpected weather changes)\n\nA larger pack size will also give you more flexibility to pack items that might not be essential but are still nice to have, such as a book, a portable chair, or a camp shoe.\n\nThat being said, it's also important to remember that a larger pack size can be heavier and more cumbersome to carry. You'll need to balance your desire for extra space with the need to keep your pack weight and size manageable.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider the following:\n\n* Take inventory of your gear and estimate the total volume you need.\n* Think about the types of trips you plan to take and the gear you'll need for each.\n* Consider packing lists from other hikers or online resources to get an idea of what you might need to carry.\n* If possible, try on different pack sizes with your gear loaded to see what feels comfortable and manageable for you.\n\nUltimately, the right pack size will depend on your specific needs and preferences. I hope this helps you make a more informed decision!",
