  "content": "I see what you mean about \"Street Art Revolution\" and \"Art in Bloom\" being fictional. Thanks for the general info, though! I was really impressed by the level of detail and creativity in the floral arrangements at \"Art in Bloom\", which were inspired by impressionist paintings. I'm hoping to see something similar in terms of creativity and attention to detail at \"Street Art Revolution\". Do you think I'll be able to take photos at the exhibition, or are there usually restrictions on photography at these types of events?",
