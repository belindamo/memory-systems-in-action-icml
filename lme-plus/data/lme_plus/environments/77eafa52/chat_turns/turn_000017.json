I can only provide general information and advice.\n\nIf you're concerned about your hotel booking and the outstanding balance, I recommend checking your email or the Expedia website to confirm the exact deadline for payment. You can also contact Expedia's customer service directly to clarify the situation and get an update on your booking.\n\nTo find out the current date, you can simply check your calendar, phone, or computer. If you're unsure about the date, you can also ask a friend or family member to confirm it for you.\n\nRemember to prioritize your travel arrangements and take care of any outstanding payments or bookings to avoid any potential issues or cancellations. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
