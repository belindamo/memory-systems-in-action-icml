Your friend Sarah's experience with Allianz might be a good lead to explore.\n\nWhen you're researching, make sure to ask the right questions, such as:\n\n* What's the coverage period and duration?\n* What's the policy limit and deductible?\n* Are there any exclusions or pre-existing condition clauses?\n* How do they handle claims and customer support?\n* Are there any additional fees or charges?\n\nIt's also essential to read reviews and ratings from multiple sources, not just one person's experience. This will give you a more comprehensive understanding of the insurer's reputation and service.\n\nRemember, the cheapest option might not always be the best. Be sure to weigh the cost against the coverage and benefits provided.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could also consider consulting with a licensed insurance agent or broker who specializes in travel insurance. They can help you navigate the options and find the best fit for your needs.\n\nGood luck with your research, and I hope you find the perfect travel insurance policy for your trip to Japan!",
