  "content": "Here's a vegan carbonara recipe that replaces the eggs and bacon with plant-based ingredients:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 pound pasta (spaghetti, bucatini, or fettuccine)\n- 1 cup raw cashews\n- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk\n- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast\n- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\n- 1 tablespoon cornstarch\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 onion, diced\n- 3 garlic cloves, minced\n- 8 ounces mushrooms, sliced\n- 1/4 cup white wine\n- 1/2 cup frozen peas\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain and set aside.\n\n2. In a blender, combine the cashews, almond milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Blend until smooth.\n\n3. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and mushrooms, and saut\u00e9 for another 5 minutes.\n\n4. Pour in the white wine and let it cook until the liquid has reduced by half.\n\n5. Add the frozen peas and the blended cashew sauce to the pan. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Cook for a couple of minutes until the sauce thickens.\n\n6. Add the cooked pasta to the pan with the sauce, and toss well to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add a little bit of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.\n\n7. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately. Enjoy your vegan carbonara!",
