  "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I don't have any information about a neuroscientist named Eran Stark. It's possible that he has become prominent in his field since then, or he might be an emerging figure in neuroscience.\n\nElectrophysiological recording combined with optogenetic stimulation is an advanced technique used to study the activity of neurons and neural circuits in the brain. Electrophysiological recordings involve measuring the electrical activity of neurons, while optogenetics involves using light to control genetically modified neurons that have been made to express light-sensitive proteins called opsins. This combination allows researchers to precisely control and monitor neural activity, enabling a deeper understanding of brain function and the mechanisms underlying various neurological and psychiatric disorders.",
