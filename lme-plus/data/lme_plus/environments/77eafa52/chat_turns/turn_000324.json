  "content": "I've been thinking about getting a backpack that's similar to my friend's, who has a 40L pack. But I'm not sure if that's the right size for me. I've been on a few camping trips recently, including a 4-day trip to Yosemite, where we hiked to the top of Vernal Falls, and I had to carry all my gear. I slipped and fell on the rocks near the waterfall, but luckily, I didn't get hurt badly. Anyway, I think a 40L pack might be a bit too small for me, considering all the gear I need to carry. What are your thoughts?",
