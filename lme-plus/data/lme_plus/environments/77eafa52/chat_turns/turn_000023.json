  "content": "I'm glad you're taking steps to review your booking details and clarify the costs. However, I want to reiterate that I'm concerned about the legitimacy of Sakura Travel Agency and the $2,800 price quote.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I suspect that Sakura Travel Agency might be a fictional or non-existent agency. I would advise you to exercise extreme caution and not proceed with any further payments or arrangements with this agency.\n\nInstead, I recommend focusing on verifying the legitimacy of your Expedia hotel booking and paying the outstanding balance directly to Expedia. You can review your booking details on the Expedia website or contact their customer service to get a clear breakdown of the costs.\n\nRemember to prioritize your safety and security when making travel arrangements and financial transactions online. Be cautious of potential scams or fraudulent activities, and always verify the legitimacy of any travel agencies or companies you're dealing with.",
