Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nWhat is Repudiation of a Contract?\n\nRepudiation of a contract occurs when a party to the contract shows an unwillingness or inability to perform substantial obligations under the contract. This conduct is often referred to as renunciation. For instance, if a builder tells a homeowner that they will not complete work on the agreed completion date or that they will not complete work as agreed, then they may be repudiating the contract.\n\nContract Repudiation is considered a breach of contract because it goes against the fundamental principle of a contract, which is to carry out the agreed terms. When a party repudiates a contract, they are not fulfilling their contractual obligations.\n\nAs a result, the other party is entitled to terminate the contract and seek damages for any losses suffered.\n\nRepudiation of contract is not the same as termination, but it can lead to termination. Termination can occur through contractual provisions or the common law right of termination for repudiation.",
