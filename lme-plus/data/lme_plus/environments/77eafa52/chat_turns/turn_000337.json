Look for sales and discounts: Many brands and stores offer discounts and sales throughout the year, so keep an eye out for these to save money on your workout clothes. 2. Check out outlet stores: Outlets stores may have last season\u2019s styles or slightly imperfect items at discounted prices. 3. Shop online: Many online stores offer lower prices than brick-and-mortar stores because they have lower overhead costs. 4. Consider buying basics: Basic pieces like plain tanks or leggings can often be found at a lower price and can be mixed and matched with different pieces. 5. Check out discount stores: Stores like TJ Maxx, Ross or Marshall\u2019s often have workout clothes at a discounted price. Remember, price is not the only factor when it comes to quality workout clothes. It's important to choose clothes made with high-quality materials that will last and perform well during your workouts.",
