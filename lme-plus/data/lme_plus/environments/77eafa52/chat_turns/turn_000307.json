I don't know when you last had your oil changed.\n\nBut don't worry! You can easily find out when you're due for an oil change by checking your:\n\n1. **Oil change sticker**: Look for a sticker on the upper driver-side corner of your windshield or on the inside of the driver-side doorjamb. This sticker usually indicates the date and mileage of your last oil change, as well as the recommended mileage for the next oil change.\n2. **Vehicle's maintenance schedule**: Check your vehicle's owner's manual or the manufacturer's website for the recommended oil change interval. This is usually based on the vehicle's make, model, and year.\n3. **Odometer reading**: If you know the current mileage of your vehicle, you can estimate when you're due for an oil change based on the recommended interval. For example, if your vehicle recommends oil changes every 5,000 to 7,500 miles, and your current mileage is around 12,000 miles, you might be due for an oil change soon.\n\nRemember to always follow the recommended oil change interval for your specific vehicle to ensure its longevity and performance. If you're still unsure, you can consult with a trusted mechanic or oil change service center for guidance.",
