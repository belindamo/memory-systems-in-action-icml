  "content": "Pinot Grigio is a fantastic choice for Summer Sangria.\n\nNow, let's talk about the fruits! A good mix of fruits will add depth, texture, and flavor to your Sangria. Here are some classic and delicious options:\n\n**Must-haves:**\n\n1. **Apples**: Thinly slice 1-2 apples (Granny Smith or Gala work well) and add them to the pitcher. Apples provide a nice crunch and a touch of sweetness.\n2. **Oranges**: Slice 1-2 oranges (Navels or Blood oranges add a nice pop of color) and add them to the pitcher. Oranges bring a nice citrus flavor and aroma.\n3. **Berries**: Add 1 cup of mixed berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries. Berries add natural sweetness, color, and a burst of flavor.\n\n**Nice additions:**\n\n1. **Peaches**: Slice 1-2 ripe peaches and add them to the pitcher. Peaches bring a sweet, juicy flavor and a soft texture.\n2. **Pineapple**: Add chunks of fresh pineapple (about 1 cup) to the pitcher. Pineapple adds a tropical flavor and a nice sweetness.\n3. **Grapes**: Add 1 cup of red or green grapes, halved or quartered, to the pitcher. Grapes provide a sweet and juicy texture.\n4. **Citrus fruits**: Consider adding slices of lemons, limes, or grapefruits to the pitcher for added citrus flavor and aroma.\n5. **Other fruits**: Feel free to experiment with other fruits like kiwi, mango, or apricots to create your unique flavor profile.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a variety of fruits to create a colorful and visually appealing Sangria.\n* Adjust the amount of fruits based on your personal taste preferences.\n* Let the fruits macerate in the wine for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.\n* You can also add a splash of fruit juice, such as pineapple or orange, to enhance the flavor.\n\nNow that you have your wine and fruits, it's time to assemble your Summer Sangria! Simply combine the wine, fruits, and a splash of citrus juice (like lemon-lime soda or a squeeze of fresh lime juice) in a large pitcher. Chill it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.\n\nHow's your Sangria shaping up? Do you have any other questions or need further assistance?",
