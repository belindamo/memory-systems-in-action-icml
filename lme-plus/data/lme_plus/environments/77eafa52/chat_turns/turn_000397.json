  "content": "Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of tiny particles such as atoms, electrons, photons, and their behavior. It is a subfield that examines the way particles interact with each other in the quantum realm and how they can be described by wavefunctions. Some of the key concepts included in quantum mechanics are superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty principle, among others. The field of quantum mechanics has led to the development of many technologies, such as transistors, lasers, and quantum computing, that are now part of our daily lives.",
