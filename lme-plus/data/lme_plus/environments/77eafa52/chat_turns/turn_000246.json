A tart crust should be neutral or slightly sweet to let the fruit shine.\n2. **Texture**: Whole wheat flour can produce a denser, heavier crust due to its coarser texture and higher protein content. This might make the crust more prone to cracking and less flaky.\n3. **Gluten content**: Whole wheat flour has a higher gluten content than all-purpose flour, which can make the dough more challenging to work with, especially when you're aiming for a flaky crust.\n\nFor a tart crust, it's better to use a flour with a lower protein content and a finer texture. Here are some options:\n\n1. **All-purpose flour**: This is a classic choice for tart crusts, as it provides a good balance of strength, tenderness, and flavor.\n2. **Pastry flour**: This type of flour has a lower protein content than all-purpose flour, making it ideal for delicate pastries and tart crusts. It will produce a tender, flaky crust with a more delicate texture.\n3. **Cake flour**: This is an even more delicate flour with an extremely low protein content. It's perfect for making tender, flaky crusts, but it can be more challenging to work with due to its low gluten content.\n\nIf you still want to experiment with whole wheat flour, you can try blending it with all-purpose flour or pastry flour to create a hybrid flour with a balanced flavor and texture. A 50:50 ratio of whole wheat to all-purpose flour might work well, but keep in mind that the crust might still be slightly denser and heavier.\n\nRemember, the key to a great tart crust is to keep the ingredients cold, handle the dough gently, and don't overwork it. Whichever flour you choose, make sure to follow these tips to achieve a flaky, buttery crust that will complement your strawberries beautifully!",
