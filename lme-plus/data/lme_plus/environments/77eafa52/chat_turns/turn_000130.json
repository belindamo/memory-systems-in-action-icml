  "content": "The University of Wisconsin has implemented a robust testing and tracing program to identify and isolate individuals with COVID-19. The program includes regular testing of students and staff who are at higher risk of exposure to the disease.\n\nThe testing program is divided into two categories: surveillance testing and symptomatic testing. Surveillance testing involves testing individuals who are not showing symptoms of COVID-19 but are at higher risk of exposure due to their on-campus activities or living situation. Symptomatic testing is conducted on individuals who exhibit symptoms of the disease.\n\nSurveillance testing is conducted on a weekly basis for students living in campus housing, attending in-person classes, or participating in on-campus activities. Staff who come into close contact with students or work in high-risk areas are also tested on a regular basis. The frequency of testing for staff and faculty may differ based on their level of exposure and risk.\n\nSymptomatic testing is available to students and staff who are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. The university has established a testing site on campus where individuals can be tested quickly and easily.\n\nIn addition to testing, the university is conducting contact tracing to identify and isolate individuals who have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. This includes working with the local health department to identify and isolate individuals who may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nOverall, the University of Wisconsin's testing and tracing program is designed to identify and isolate individuals who may have COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the disease within the university community.",
