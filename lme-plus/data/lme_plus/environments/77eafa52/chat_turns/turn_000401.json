I just wanted to mention that I didn't hear anything about the OCBC/RBC expenses like you mentioned earlier. No big deal, but I just wanted to suggest that maybe we can check things together before sharing info to avoid any confusion. That way we can keep each other in the loop and build more trust as a team. Thanks again for your help!\"",
