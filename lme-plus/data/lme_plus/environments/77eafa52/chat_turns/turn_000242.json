  "content": "Fruit tarts are always a great idea!\n\nThe availability of fruits in season can vary depending on your location, climate, and time of year. However, I can give you a general idea of what fruits are typically in season during the spring and summer months in the Northern Hemisphere:\n\n**Spring (March to May)**\n\n1. Strawberries: One of the first fruits to arrive in spring, strawberries are sweet and flavorful. They're perfect for a tart, and their sweetness pairs well with a hint of sugar and a crumbly crust.\n2. Rhubarb: While often paired with strawberries, rhubarb is a great solo act in a tart. Its tartness is balanced by the sweetness of sugar and the crust.\n3. Lemons: While available year-round, spring is a great time to use fresh lemons in a tart. A lemon tart with a layer of frangipane (almond cream) is a delicious combination.\n4. Raspberries: As spring transitions into summer, raspberries start to appear. They're perfect for a tart, with their sweetness and tartness balanced by the crust and a drizzle of honey.\n\n**Summer (June to August)**\n\n1. Blueberries: Sweet and juicy, blueberries are a summer staple. They're perfect for a tart, especially when paired with a hint of lemon or orange zest.\n2. Peaches: As summer heats up, peaches arrive, bringing their sweetness and juiciness to the table. They pair well with a crumbly crust and a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg.\n3. Apricots: Sweet and slightly tangy, apricots are a great choice for a summer tart. They're especially delicious when paired with a hint of almond extract or frangipane.\n4. Plums: As summer transitions into fall, plums start to appear. They're perfect for a tart, with their sweetness and tartness balanced by the crust and a drizzle of honey.\n\nChoose a fruit that you enjoy, and feel free to mix and match different fruits to create a unique flavor combination. Remember to adjust the amount of sugar and spices according to the fruit's natural sweetness and flavor profile.\n\nWhich fruit catches your eye (or taste buds)?",
