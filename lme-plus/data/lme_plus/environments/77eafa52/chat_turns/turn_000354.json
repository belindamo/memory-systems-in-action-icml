  "content": "This is an information about repudiating a building contract. Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nHow Do You Prove a Repudiatory Breach?\n\nIs not a straightforward formula on whether or not conduct gives rise to a repudiatory breach.\n\nRepudiation needs to be considered in the context of the particular time and events. If a person intends to terminate for repudiation, the safer option would be to provide the at fault party as many opportunities as reasonable as possible to rectify the breach. This is because repudiation has the effect of terminating the contract.\n\nIf you fail to lawfully terminate the contract because the evidence does not constitute a repudiation then the other party may accept your repudiation. That is, your unlawful termination gives rise to a repudiation of the contract entitling the other party to terminate.\n\nIt is common that when a party terminates a contract, the other party replies with an acceptance of repudiation response. This would leave the issue of who lawfully terminated the contract up to the courts or tribunal to determine.\n\nThis is an important warning for any party who wishes to terminate a contract for repudiation.\n\nIf you purport to terminate a contract by relying on someone\u2019s repudiation and it is found that you have not done enough to establish that repudiation, then it is easy enough for the other party to say that your conduct of purporting to terminate the contract is a repudiation of the contract.",
