  "content": "I'm glad you enjoyed the fictional \"Art in Bloom\" exhibition!\n\nRegarding photography at \"Street Art Revolution,\" since it's a fictional event, there's no real answer to this question. However, in general, photography policies vary from exhibition to exhibition. Some exhibitions might allow non-flash photography for personal, non-commercial use, while others might prohibit photography altogether or have specific restrictions.\n\nIt's common for exhibitions to have signs or staff members indicating whether photography is allowed or not. If you're unsure, you can always ask a staff member or check the exhibition's website or social media for guidance.\n\nIf you do get to attend a real street art exhibition, you might find that some artists or exhibitors might have specific requests or restrictions on photography, especially if their work is fragile, sensitive, or features copyrighted materials.\n\nRemember to always respect the artists, their work, and the exhibition's policies when it comes to photography. Enjoy the exhibition, and I hope you get to take some amazing photos to share with your friend!",
