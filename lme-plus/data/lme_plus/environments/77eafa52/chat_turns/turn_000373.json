  "content": "You're welcome!\n\nI understand your hope that Sakura Travel Agency will come through, especially since you got a good deal initially. $2,500 for the entire trip does seem like a reasonable price, but it's essential to prioritize your travel plans and be prepared for any eventuality.\n\nRemember to stay vigilant and keep following up with Sakura Travel Agency. If you don't hear back from them soon, you may want to consider reaching out to your credit card company or bank to see if they can assist with resolving the issue or providing guidance on how to proceed.\n\nIn the meantime, exploring alternative flight options will give you a sense of control and preparedness. You can always cancel or modify your backup plans if Sakura Travel Agency comes through with your original booking.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress, and I'll be here to offer any further assistance or advice you may need!",
