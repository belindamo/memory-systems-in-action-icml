Cheese and crackers are a classic combination, but here are some other snack suggestions that would pair nicely with your refreshing drink:\n\n**Fruit-based snacks:**\n\n1. **Fresh fruit skewers**: Skewer fresh grapes, strawberries, and pineapple chunks for a sweet and healthy snack that complements the fruit flavors in the Sangria.\n2. **Dried fruit and nuts**: Offer a mix of dried cranberries, apricots, and nuts like almonds or pistachios for a sweet and salty snack.\n3. **Fresh fruit salad**: Prepare a light and refreshing fruit salad with a mix of seasonal fruits, such as berries, grapes, and melon.\n\n**Savory snacks:**\n\n1. **Crostoni or bruschetta**: Toasted bread with olive tapenade, hummus, or goat cheese spread pairs nicely with the crisp acidity of the Pinot Grigio.\n2. **Spicy roasted nuts**: Spicy roasted nuts like almonds or pecans add a nice crunch and a touch of heat to balance the sweetness of the fruit.\n3. **Prosciutto-wrapped melon**: A classic combination that pairs the sweetness of melon with the salty, savory flavor of prosciutto.\n\n**Other snack ideas:**\n\n1. **Mini quiches or savory tartlets**: Bite-sized quiches or tartlets filled with cheese, herbs, or ham are easy to make and pair nicely with the wine.\n2. **Grilled or roasted vegetables**: Grilled or roasted vegetables like asparagus, bell peppers, or zucchini can provide a refreshing crunch and a pop of color.\n3. **Chocolate-dipped fruit**: Dip fresh or dried fruit like strawberries, bananas, or cranberries in melted chocolate for a sweet and indulgent treat.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep things light and refreshing, as you want the Summer Sangria to be the star of the show!\n\nWhich snack options appeal to you, or do you have any other ideas in mind?",
