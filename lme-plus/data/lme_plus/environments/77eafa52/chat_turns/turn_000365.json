Sometimes, important emails might end up in your spam folder, so double-check before reaching out to them.\n2. **Contact the agency directly**: Reach out to Sakura Travel Agency via phone, email, or their website's contact form. Be polite and concise, and reiterate your inquiry about the status of your ticket confirmation and payment.\n3. **Specify your concerns**: Clearly state your concerns, such as the lack of response or uncertainty about the payment deadline. This will help the agency understand your perspective and respond accordingly.\n4. **Request a confirmation number or reference**: Ask the agency to provide a confirmation number or reference for your booking. This can help you track the status of your booking and ensure that everything is in order.\n5. **Verify the agency's credibility**: If you're unsure about the agency's responsiveness or credibility, you can check online reviews, ratings, or ask for referrals from friends or family members who have used their services before.\n6. **Be prepared to escalate**: If you're not getting a response or resolution, ask to speak with a supervisor or manager. They may be able to assist you more efficiently.\n7. **Consider alternative payment options**: If the agency is not responding, you might want to explore alternative payment options, such as paying through a secure online payment gateway or using a credit card that offers travel-related protections.\n8. **Keep a paper trail**: Keep a record of all your communications with the agency, including emails, phone calls, and any written correspondence. This can be helpful in case of any disputes or issues.\n\nRemember to stay calm and patient when communicating with the travel agency. It's essential to be respectful and professional, even if you're experiencing frustration or concern.\n\nI hope these tips help you get a response from Sakura Travel Agency and finalize your flight ticket payment successfully!",
