It's possible that it's a fictional or non-existent agency.\n\nIf you've paid for a trip and haven't received your flight tickets or any confirmation, I would recommend taking immediate action to protect yourself from potential fraud. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Contact your bank or credit card company**: Reach out to your bank or credit card company to report the issue and ask if they can help you dispute the charge or put a hold on the payment.\n2. **Check for online reviews and ratings**: Look up Sakura Travel Agency online to see if there are any reviews or ratings from other customers. If it's a scam, there might be warnings or negative reviews from others who have had similar experiences.\n3. **Contact local authorities**: If you believe you've been scammed, you can file a report with your local authorities, such as the police or consumer protection agency.\n4. **Seek assistance from a travel expert**: Consider reaching out to a reputable travel agency or a travel expert who can help you plan your trip to Japan and book your flights and accommodations safely.\n\nRegarding the price of $2,800, I would be cautious about proceeding with the payment until you've verified the authenticity of the travel agency and the trip details.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your safety and security when making travel arrangements online.

However, it's still essential to take action to try to recover your money and protect yourself from potential fraud.\n\nBefore contacting Sakura Travel Agency again, I would recommend taking a step back and assessing the situation. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Verify the agency's legitimacy**: Try to find more information about Sakura Travel Agency, such as their physical address, phone number, and email address. Check if they have a professional website, social media presence, or any online reviews.\n2. **Check for red flags**: Look for signs of a potential scam, such as poor communication, lack of transparency, or unprofessional behavior.\n3. **Review your communication**: Go through your email or message history with Sakura Travel Agency. Check if they provided any concrete details about your trip, such as flight numbers, hotel reservations, or itinerary.\n\nIf you're still unsure about the agency's legitimacy or have concerns about your trip, I would advise against contacting them again. Instead, consider the following options:\n\n1. **Contact your bank**: Reach out to your bank to report the incident and ask if they can help you trace the payment or provide any assistance.\n2. **Report to the authorities**: File a report with your local authorities, such as the police or consumer protection agency, to report the potential fraud.\n3. **Seek help from a travel expert**: Consult with a reputable travel agency or a travel expert who can help you plan your trip to Japan and book your flights and accommodations safely.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with unfamiliar companies, especially when it comes to financial transactions.\n\nIf you do decide to contact Sakura Travel Agency again, be cautious and don't provide any additional personal or financial information. Instead, ask specific questions about your trip, such as:\n\n* Can you provide the flight numbers and booking references for my tickets?\n* Can you confirm the hotel reservations and accommodation details?\n* Can you give me a detailed itinerary for my trip?\n\nBe prepared for the possibility that Sakura Travel Agency might not respond or provide unsatisfactory answers. In that case, it's essential to take action to protect yourself and your finances.",
