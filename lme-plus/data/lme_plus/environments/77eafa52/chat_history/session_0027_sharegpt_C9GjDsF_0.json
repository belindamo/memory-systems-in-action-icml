      "content": "(The setting is an escape room. The Queen, Biden, Trump, Batman, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are all trapped inside.)\n\nQueen: (frustrated) How on earth did we end up in this blasted escape room?\n\nBiden: (calmly) It's okay, Your Majesty. We just need to keep our heads and work together to find a way out.\n\nTrump: (agitated) Yeah, well, I would have found a way out by now if I were in charge. I'm the best at escape rooms, believe me.\n\nBatman: (serious) I agree with President Biden. We need to stay focused and use our unique skills to solve the clues and find a way out.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy: (excited) This is just like in my TV show! I know how to escape from any situation!\n\nQueen: (sarcastically) Well, this should be easy then. Let's get started.\n\n(As they begin to solve the clues and try to escape, chaos ensues. Trump keeps insisting he knows the best way out, but his ideas lead them in circles. The Queen becomes increasingly frustrated, while Biden tries to keep the peace. Volodymyr Zelenskyy keeps cracking jokes, and Batman remains focused and serious. Eventually, after much bickering and missteps, they finally find the key to unlock the door and escape.)\n\nQueen: (exasperated) Thank goodness that's over. I never want to do that again.\n\nBiden: (smiling) At least we made it out together. That's all that matters.\n\nTrump: (pouting) I could have gotten us out of there a lot faster if you all just listened to me.\n\nBatman: (serious) It's not about who gets us out the fastest. It's about teamwork and using our individual strengths to find a solution.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy: (laughing) And it was also a lot of fun! Can we do it again sometime?\n\n(The group looks at him in disbelief before slowly making their way out of the escape room, shaking their heads and muttering to themselves.)"
