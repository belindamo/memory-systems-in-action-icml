      "content": "The Terror Tram is not a year-round attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood. It's actually a part of the Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) event, which takes place on select nights from mid-September to early November.\n\nThe Terror Tram is a unique experience that's only available during HHN. It's a terrifying journey that takes you through a haunted area of the backlot, featuring scare zones, live actors, and special effects. The tram ride itself is a big part of the experience, as it's designed to create a sense of unease and fear.\n\nSince you attended HHN on October 22nd and 29th, you might have already experienced the Terror Tram! If so, you know how intense and frightening it can be. If you didn't get a chance to ride it, don't worry \u2013 you can always come back next year and experience it again.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Universal Studios Hollywood during the day, you can explore the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, ride thrilling attractions like the Revenge of the Mummy roller coaster, and experience behind-the-scenes looks at movie magic. However, the Terror Tram is exclusive to Halloween Horror Nights and won't be available during the day.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"

      "content": "The House of Horrors is a year-round attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood, so you can definitely experience it during your daytime visit.\n\nThe House of Horrors is a walk-through attraction that's located in the lower lot of the park. It's a dark and eerie experience that takes you through a series of themed rooms and corridors, featuring iconic horror characters and scenes from various Universal horror movies.\n\nThe attraction is designed to create a sense of unease and fear, with special effects, lighting, and sound design all working together to create a spooky atmosphere. You'll encounter characters from classic Universal monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolf Man, as well as more modern horror icons.\n\nThe House of Horrors is a self-guided experience, so you can take your time and explore the different rooms at your own pace. It's a great attraction for horror fans, and it's a good option if you're looking for a more low-key, non-ride experience.\n\nKeep in mind that the House of Horrors is a relatively small attraction, and it's not as intense or scary as some of the mazes you might have experienced during Halloween Horror Nights. However, it's still a fun and atmospheric experience that's worth checking out if you're a horror fan or just looking for something a little different.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with."
