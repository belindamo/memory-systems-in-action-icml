One day, he decides to reach out to his friend Emily, who always seems to be on top of things.\n\nJohn: Hey Emily, I'm really behind on my assignments and I can't seem to catch up. Do you have any tips for me?\n\nEmily: Sure John, have you tried breaking up your tasks into smaller pieces? It can be overwhelming to tackle everything at once.\n\nJohn: That's a good idea, I'll give it a shot. But even when I sit down to work, I get distracted so easily.\n\nEmily: I hear you. Maybe you should log off social media and put your phone away while you study. That way you won't be tempted to scroll through your feed or answer texts.\n\nJohn: Yeah, I guess I should go all in and commit to my studies. But sometimes I feel like I'm in over my head.\n\nEmily: Don't worry, John, you've got this. Just take it one step at a time and don't give up. I believe in you!\n\nJohn: Thanks Emily, you're right. I need to knuckle down and stay focused if I want to succeed.\n\nEmily: Absolutely, John. You can't coast through life, sometimes you need to put in the hard work and grind it out to achieve your goals.\n\nJohn: You're so right. Thanks for your encouragement, Emily. I feel more motivated already."
