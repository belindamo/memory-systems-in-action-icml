For Builders and/or building company directors / senior staff \u2013 engage lawyers early and stop sending these types of correspondence by phone, letter, email, and text message. \n\n2. Never say words to the effect of \u201cwe want to terminate the contract\u201d or \u201cwe do not want to continue with this build\u201d or \u201cyou need to pay us $X more money, or we are not going to continue with the build\u201d. This conduct could be repudiation."

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nWhat is Repudiation of a Contract?\n\nRepudiation of a contract occurs when a party to the contract shows an unwillingness or inability to perform substantial obligations under the contract. This conduct is often referred to as renunciation. For instance, if a builder tells a homeowner that they will not complete work on the agreed completion date or that they will not complete work as agreed, then they may be repudiating the contract.\n\nContract Repudiation is considered a breach of contract because it goes against the fundamental principle of a contract, which is to carry out the agreed terms. When a party repudiates a contract, they are not fulfilling their contractual obligations.\n\nAs a result, the other party is entitled to terminate the contract and seek damages for any losses suffered.\n\nRepudiation of contract is not the same as termination, but it can lead to termination. Termination can occur through contractual provisions or the common law right of termination for repudiation."

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nIs Repudiation a Breach of Contract?\n\nA party may breach a contractual provision of a contract. For example, the contract requires that one person pays the other within 5 days. If the person fails to pay within 5 days, then the contract is breached by the person who owes the money. The contract may provide the innocent party the right to terminate the contract in such circumstance.\n\nHowever, a repudiation of a contract often arises from breaches of the contract. The innocent party may not have a contractual right to terminate under the contract. In such circumstances, the innocent party may rely on common law right of repudiation to terminate the contract.\n\nThe events that give rise to a repudiatory right does not necessarily require the breach of contract. It is necessary to have regard to the surrounding circumstances."

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nIs Repudiation the Same as Termination?\n\nRepudiation is not the same as termination. Repudiation refers to the conduct or event that enlivens the innocent party\u2019s right to terminate the contract. It is common that the innocent party notifies the party whose conduct is repudiatory to rectify the repudiatory conduct. If the repudiatory conduct is not remedied then the innocent party may terminate the contract.\n\nThe effect of termination of contract is to bring the contract to an end. So in effect, a person who repudiates a contract may be exposed to the innocent party terminating the contract.\n\nOften, the innocent party would be entitled to claim damages."

The termination results in the contract being deemed void at common law. It is not possible to sue for repudiation specifically, but rather, one would bring a claim for breach of contract. Damages may be available in such a claim, depending on the circumstances of the case."

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nHow Do You Prove a Repudiatory Breach?\n\nIs not a straightforward formula on whether or not conduct gives rise to a repudiatory breach.\n\nRepudiation needs to be considered in the context of the particular time and events. If a person intends to terminate for repudiation, the safer option would be to provide the at fault party as many opportunities as reasonable as possible to rectify the breach. This is because repudiation has the effect of terminating the contract.\n\nIf you fail to lawfully terminate the contract because the evidence does not constitute a repudiation then the other party may accept your repudiation. That is, your unlawful termination gives rise to a repudiation of the contract entitling the other party to terminate.\n\nIt is common that when a party terminates a contract, the other party replies with an acceptance of repudiation response. This would leave the issue of who lawfully terminated the contract up to the courts or tribunal to determine.\n\nThis is an important warning for any party who wishes to terminate a contract for repudiation.\n\nIf you purport to terminate a contract by relying on someone\u2019s repudiation and it is found that you have not done enough to establish that repudiation, then it is easy enough for the other party to say that your conduct of purporting to terminate the contract is a repudiation of the contract."

If you fail to respond to the allegations, then you expose yourself to the other party relying on your failure to properly respond as support and evidence of your repudiatory conduct.\n\nIf your conduct is not a repudiation but rather you invoking your interpretation of the contract, then you should explain your conduct. You should explain the factual and legal grounds that you rely on as your response. Taking these steps will help you mitigate a claim of repudiation against yourself."

There is high court authority that helps with understanding the principles and elements of repudiation. However, because we are dealing with facts and events, it is not a formula where one-size-fits-all.\n\nThe court will assess whether or not the repudiatory conduct is a breach of an essential term of the contract, or a breach of a non-essential term but causing substantial loss or benefit; and a renunciation of the contract. Of course, there may be multiple breaches which enliven more than one of the three types of breaches."

Limit your response to \u201cacknowledged\u201d if you understand:\n\nBest Practices for Identifying and Responding to Repudiation of a Contract\n\nTo identify repudiation of building contract, you should review the terms of the contract and assess whether one party has clearly indicated they will not perform their obligations. If you suspect repudiation, you should respond in writing and clearly state your interpretation of the contract and the grounds on which you rely. If you fail to respond, it may be construed as evidence of your own repudiatory conduct.\n\nCourts consider various factors when determining if repudiation has occurred, such as whether the conduct is a breach of an essential or non-essential term causing substantial loss, and whether there is a renunciation of the contract. However, each case is unique, and the court will assess the specific facts and events of the case.\n\nFor homeowners and builders, it is crucial to document all communication regarding the contract, including any disagreements or disputes. Seek legal advice if you suspect repudiation or if you receive a notice of repudiation. Prompt and effective communication can help mitigate the risk of repudiation and avoid costly legal proceedings."
