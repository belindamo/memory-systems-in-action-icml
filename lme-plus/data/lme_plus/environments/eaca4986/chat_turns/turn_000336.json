Hold the border yarn in your non-dominant hand, with the end of the yarn closest to the main body of the blanket.\n3. Insert the crochet hook into the stitch where you want to join the border yarn.\n4. Yarn over with the border yarn and pull the yarn through the stitch. You should now have one loop on the hook.\n5. Yarn over again with the border yarn and pull the yarn through both loops on the hook. This will create an invisible join.\n6. Pull the yarn tail gently to tighten the join.\n\n**Method 2: Slip Stitch Join**\n\n1. Fasten off the main body of the blanket, leaving a long tail.\n2.
