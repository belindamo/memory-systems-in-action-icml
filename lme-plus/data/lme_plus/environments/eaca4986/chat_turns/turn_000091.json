Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Greek mythology.\n\n2. \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon & Garfunkel - The song's lyrics reference the Greek legend of Narcissus and the biblical story of Simon and Garfunkel.\n\n3. \"The Trooper\" by Iron Maiden - The song is inspired by the Charge of the Light Brigade, a battle of the Crimean War, which was later immortalized by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in his poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade.\"\n\n4. \"Thor\" by Manowar - The song is about the Norse god Thor and his mythological battles.\n\n5. \"The Curse of the Black Pearl\" by Alestorm - The song draws inspiration from pirate and nautical folklore.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many more songs inspired by mythology and folklore in different genres of music.",
