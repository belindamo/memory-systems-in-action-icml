If the voice command is \"turn on the LED\", the sketch turns on the LED and updates the `/ledStatus` path in Firebase. If the voice command is \"turn off the LED\", the sketch turns off the LED and updates the `/ledStatus` path in Firebase.\n\nTensorFlow Code (Voice Recognition):\n\nFor voice recognition, you can use TensorFlow to train a model that recognizes specific voice commands. Here's an example code that shows how to train a TensorFlow model to recognize the voice command \"turn on the LED\":\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport librosa\n\n# Load audio file\naudio_file = '/path/to/turn_on_led.wav'\naudio, sample_rate = librosa.load(audio_file)\n\n# Extract features\nmfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=13)\nmfccs = mfccs.reshape(1, -1)\n\n# Load model\nmodel = tf.keras.models.load_model('/path/to/model.h5')\n\n# Predict label\nlabel = model.predict(mfccs)[0]\nif label == 1:\n  print('The voice command is \"turn on the LED\"')\n\n```\nThis code loads an audio file that contains the voice command \"turn on the LED\", extracts features using the librosa library, and predicts the label using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.\n\nNote that this is just an example and the actual code may vary depending on your specific use case.",
