What do you think about exploring the intersection of sustainable energy and urban planning? Are there any specific aspects of this space that interest you, such as energy efficiency, green infrastructure, or transportation?\n\nOr, if you'd like to pivot and explore other areas, I'm happy to help with that as well. Perhaps we could discuss the future of work, education, or healthcare in urban areas?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts, and we can continue to build upon each other's ideas!",
