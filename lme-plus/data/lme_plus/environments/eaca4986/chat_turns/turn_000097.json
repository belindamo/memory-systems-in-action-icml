  "content": "Yes, several rappers have used contemporary cultural references that have their roots in ancient myths. For example:\n\n1. Kanye West's \"Ultralight Beam\" - The song features a reference to the biblical story of Noah's Ark, in which Kanye asks God to \"deliver us serenity, deliver us peace.\"\n\n2. Kendrick Lamar's \"HUMBLE.\" - The song features a reference to the Greek myth of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun and fell to his death. In the song, Kendrick warns against becoming too prideful and falling from grace.\n\n3. Jay-Z's \"The Story of O.J.\" - The song features a reference to the Uncle Tom character from Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" a novel that has been compared to a modern-day Greek tragedy.\n\n4. Childish Gambino's \"Me and Your Mama\" - The song features a reference to the Egyptian god Osiris, a figure associated with rebirth and resurrection.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but many rappers use cultural references that have their roots in ancient myths and stories to add depth and richness to their lyrics.",
