With your friends Tom and Alex by your side, you'll surely have a blast reeling in some nice catches.\n\nSince you're targeting both species, I'll provide you with some general tips to get you started:\n\n**Salmon and Trout Fishing in Lake Michigan**\n\n* **Salmon:** Look for salmon in deeper waters (50-150 ft) near structures like reefs, weed beds, and drop-offs. Use lures that imitate baitfish, such as spoons, spinners, or plugs, in sizes and colors that match the baitfish found in Lake Michigan.\n* **Trout:** Target trout in shallower waters (10-30 ft) near structures like rocky shorelines, weed beds, or piers. Use smaller lures that imitate small baitfish, insects, or crustaceans, such as small spoons, spinners, or soft plastics.\n\n**General Tips**\n\n* **Tackle:** Use medium to heavy action rods and reels with a suitable line weight (10-20 lb test) and type (monofilament or fluorocarbon).\n* **Timing:** Fish during dawn and dusk when the water is usually calmer and there's less boat traffic.\n* **Location:** Pay attention to the lake's structure and look for areas with good water quality, as both salmon and trout are sensitive to water conditions.\n* **Presentation:** Vary your presentation and retrieval speeds to find what works best for the fish you're targeting.\n\n**Additional Reminders**\n\n* **Safety first:** Make sure you and your friends are wearing life jackets and following all safety guidelines while on the water.\n* **Respect the environment:** Handle the fish gently and release them quickly to ensure their survival.\n* **Check local regulations:** Familiarize yourself with Lake Michigan's fishing regulations, including bag limits, size restrictions, and any closed areas.\n\nWith these tips, you'll be well-prepared for a fun and successful fishing trip with Tom and Alex. Don't forget to take plenty of photos and enjoy the beautiful scenery Lake Michigan has to offer!",
