  "content": "The imagination has two forms: synthetic and creative. Synthetic imagination combines existing concepts, ideas, or plans into new arrangements, while creative imagination is the direct communication with Infinite Intelligence, where new ideas and inspirations are received. The creative imagination is stimulated through strong desire, and becomes more alert and receptive with use, just like any muscle or organ in the body. The great leaders and artists have developed the faculty of creative imagination. Desire is just a thought and of no value until it has been transformed into its physical form. The concepts of creative visualization, manifesting, and the law of attraction also use imagination to create success.",
