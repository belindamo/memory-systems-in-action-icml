Adding a border to a partially completed blanket can be a bit more challenging than adding one to a finished blanket, but it's still doable with some planning and patience.\n\nHere are some steps to help you add a border to your partially completed blanket with minimal redoing:\n\n1. **Choose a border pattern that works with your stitch pattern**: Select a border pattern that complements the stitch pattern you've used for the main body of your blanket. This will help the border blend seamlessly with the rest of the blanket. If you're unsure, you can try swatching the border pattern alongside your main stitch pattern to see how they look together.\n2. **Identify the border's starting point**: Decide where you want the border to start and end. Typically, you'll want to start the border at the beginning of a row or round, so you can easily join the border to the main body of the blanket.\n3. **Join the border to the main body**: Use a stitch marker or a piece of scrap yarn to mark the starting point of the border. Then, use a slip stitch or a single crochet stitch to join the border yarn to the main body of the blanket at the marked point. Make sure to join in the same stitch as the main body's stitch pattern.\n4. **Work the border in rows or rounds**: Depending on the border pattern, you'll work either in rows or rounds. If you're working in rows, you'll typically work one row of the border, then turn your work and come back to the starting point. If you're working in rounds, you'll complete one round of the border, then join to the starting point.\n5. **Work the border around the entire blanket**: Continue working the border around the entire blanket, joining each row or round to the previous one. As you work, make sure to maintain the correct tension and stitch count to ensure the border lies flat and even.\n6. **Adjust the border as needed**: As you work the border, you may need to adjust the tension or stitch count to ensure it lies flat and even. You can also adjust the border pattern if you find it's not working with the main body of the blanket as expected.\n7. **Weave in ends and block the blanket**: Once you've completed the border, weave in the ends and block the blanket to give it a professional finish.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Try to maintain the same yarn weight and color for the border as the main body of the blanket, unless you intentionally want a contrasting border.\n* Use a stitch marker or a piece of scrap yarn to mark the starting point of the border, so you can easily find it as you work.\n* If you're working a border with a specific repeat, make sure to count your stitches carefully to ensure you're maintaining the correct repeat.\n* Don't be afraid to frogging (rip out) the border if it's not working out as expected. It's better to redo a small section than to compromise the entire blanket.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you should be able to add a beautiful border to your partially completed blanket with minimal redoing. Good luck, and happy crocheting!",
