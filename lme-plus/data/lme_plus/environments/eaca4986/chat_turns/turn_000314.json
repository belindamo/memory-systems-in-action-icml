  "content": "It is difficult to say definitively what FDR's gender identity was, as we do not have direct insight into his personal experiences and feelings about gender. However, based on the available historical record, FDR was widely recognized and referred to as a male during his lifetime and beyond. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, gender identity is a personal and subjective experience, and individuals should have the freedom to identify and express their gender in the way that feels most authentic and comfortable to them. While it is possible that FDR may have identified as something other than male, we cannot know for certain without direct insight into his personal experiences and feelings about gender.",
