I'll definitely start sharing my weekly walk updates, including photos and videos. By the way, my friend Mike who joined me for the 5K walk at the local park has been a great motivator and has offered to join me for some of my training walks. Do you have any tips on how to involve friends and family in my fundraising efforts?",
