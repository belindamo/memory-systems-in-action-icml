Local directories: Many cities have local directories of farmers' markets that can be found online, such as the USDA Farmers Market Directory or Local Harvest. These directories provide information on the location, products sold, and times of operation. 2. Local newspapers and magazines: Local newspapers and magazines often have a calendar of events section that features farmers' markets in the area. 3. Social media: Many farmers' markets create social media pages (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) to keep their customers updated on their latest products, events and schedules. 4. Check with local organizations: Some local organizations such as Chamber of Commerce, have a list of farmers' markets. Contact these organizations to find out about farmers' markets in your area. 5. Ask farmers: If you have already connected with a farmer or someone who runs a CSA program, they may have information about local farmers' markets. By shopping at farmers' markets, you not only get fresh, locally grown produce, but you also contribute to your local economy, support your community's farmers, and help reduce the carbon footprint of transporting food long distances.",
