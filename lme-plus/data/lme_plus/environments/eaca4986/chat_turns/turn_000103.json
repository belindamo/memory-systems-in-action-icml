  "content": "Great job on packing lunch consistently! I'd be happy to help you with some healthy lunch ideas for the upcoming week.\n\nSince you mentioned you had quinoa salad for lunch on multiple days last week, I'll suggest some new ideas to mix things up. Here are a few options:\n\n**Monday**\n\n* Whole grain pita stuffed with roasted turkey breast, avocado, lettuce, and tomato\n* Carrot and celery sticks with hummus for a crunchy snack\n\n**Tuesday**\n\n* Lentil soup with a side of whole grain crackers and a mixed green salad\n* Sliced apple with almond butter for a sweet treat\n\n**Wednesday**\n\n* Grilled chicken breast with mixed greens, sliced cucumber, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing, served on top of a bed of brown rice\n* Edamame for a protein-rich snack\n\n**Thursday**\n\n* Tuna salad (made with canned tuna, low-fat mayo, and diced onions) served on top of a bed of mixed greens with whole grain crackers on the side\n* Sliced bell peppers with guacamole for a healthy dip\n\n**Friday**\n\n* Veggie wrap with roasted vegetables (such as zucchini, eggplant, and red bell pepper) and hummus, wrapped in a whole grain tortilla\n* Greek yogurt with berries and a sprinkle of granola for a satisfying snack\n\n**Other ideas**\n\n* Grilled chicken or tofu with mixed greens and whole grain wraps\n* Soup and sandwich combos (e.g., black bean soup with a side of a turkey and avocado sandwich)\n* Leftovers! Use last night's dinner as a packable lunch by reheating it in the morning and packing it in a thermos or microwave-safe container.\n\nFeel free to mix and match these ideas or add your own favorite ingredients to keep things interesting. You can also experiment with different seasonings and spices to give your meals a flavor boost.\n\nHope this helps, and happy packing!",
