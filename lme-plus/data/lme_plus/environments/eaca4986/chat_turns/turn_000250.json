  "content": "A drain screen or filter can be a simple and effective way to catch hair and debris before they clog your pipes. You can find various types of drain screens and filters on the market, but here are a few options:\n\n1. **Mesh screens**: These are usually made of metal or plastic mesh with small holes that allow water to flow through while catching hair and debris. You can place them over the drain or attach them to the drainpipe.\n2. **Pop-up drain guards**: These are small, usually circular, devices that fit over the drain and have small holes or slots to allow water to flow through. They're often made of plastic or silicone and are easy to clean.\n3. **Drain catchers**: These are usually larger, basket-like devices that fit over the drain or attach to the drainpipe. They have larger holes or slots to catch more debris and are often made of metal or plastic.\n4. **Adhesive drain stickers**: These are small, adhesive strips that you can attach to the inside of the drainpipe. They have small holes or slots to catch hair and debris, and are disposable.\n\nWhen choosing a drain screen or filter, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Size**: Make sure it fits your sink drain size.\n* **Material**: Choose a material that's easy to clean and resistant to corrosion (e.g., stainless steel or silicone).\n* **Hole or slot size**: Smaller holes or slots will catch more debris, but may require more frequent cleaning.\n* **Ease of cleaning**: Look for screens or filters with easy-to-clean designs, such as removable parts or smooth surfaces.\n\nYou can find drain screens and filters at most hardware stores, home goods stores, or online marketplaces. Prices vary depending on the type and quality, but you can expect to pay between $5 to $30 or more.\n\nRemember to clean your drain screen or filter regularly to ensure it continues to work effectively.",
