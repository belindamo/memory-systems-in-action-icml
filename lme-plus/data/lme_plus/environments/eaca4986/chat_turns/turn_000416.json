Lake Michigan is an excellent spot for catching salmon, and with the right tips and techniques, you and your friends Tom and Alex are bound to have a successful day on the water. Here are some tips to help you catch those salmon:\n\n**Location and Timing**\n\n* Lake Michigan's salmon fishing is generally best in the southern part of the lake, particularly around the harbors and piers. Mike's Marina is a great starting point, as it's close to some prime fishing spots.\n* Salmon are most active during dawn and dusk when the water is usually calmer and there's less boat traffic. Try to plan your trip during these times for the best chances of catching fish.\n\n**Tackle and Lures**\n\n* Use medium to heavy action rods and reels with a minimum of 15-20 lb test line. Salmon can put up quite a fight, so you'll want gear that can handle their strength.\n* Choose lures that imitate baitfish, such as spoons, spinners, or plugs. Some popular lures for Lake Michigan salmon include:\n\t+ Spoons: Luhr-Jensen Kokanee King, Acme Kastmaster, or Hopkins Shorty\n\t+ Spinners: Blue Fox Vibrax, Mepps Aglia, or Rooster Tail\n\t+ Plugs: Rapala Deep Tail Dancer, Storm Thunderstick, or Rebel Deep Wee-R\n* Don't forget to use a good quality downrigger or trolling weight to get your lures to the desired depth.\n\n**Fishing Techniques**\n\n* Trolling is a popular method for catching salmon in Lake Michigan. Try trolling at speeds between 2-4 mph, and adjust your speed based on the water conditions and fish activity.\n* Use a variety of presentations, such as:\n\t+ Trolling spoons or spinners near the surface (10-20 ft deep) to target coho salmon.\n\t+ Trolling deeper (50-100 ft deep) with plugs or spoons to target chinook salmon.\n\t+ Using a downrigger to target specific depths and structures, such as drop-offs or weed beds.\n* Be prepared to adjust your presentation and location based on the fish's activity and the changing conditions.\n\n**Boat Handling and Safety**\n\n* Make sure you and your friends are familiar with the boat's operation and safety equipment before heading out.\n* Always wear life jackets and keep a first aid kit on board.\n* Be mindful of your surroundings, including other boats, swimmers, and weather conditions.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Pay attention to the water temperature, as salmon are more active in certain temperature ranges (usually between 40-55\u00b0F).\n* Keep an eye on your fish finder or sonar to locate schools of fish and structures.\n* Be prepared for a fight! Salmon can be strong fighters, so make sure you're ready to reel them in.\n\nI hope these tips help you, Tom, and Alex have a successful and enjoyable fishing trip on Lake Michigan! Don't hesitate to ask Mike's Marina staff for any additional advice or guidance when you pick up your rental boat. Good luck, and tight lines!",
