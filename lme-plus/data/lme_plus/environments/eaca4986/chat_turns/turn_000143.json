However, some features might require firmware updates or specific camera settings.\n\n**Budget:**\n\n* Canon Speedlite 320EX II: Around $200\n* Canon Speedlite 430EX III-RT: Around $300\n* Canon Speedlite 470EX-AI: Around $400\n\nUltimately, the best Speedlite for you depends on your specific needs, budget, and preferences. If you're looking for a high-end option with advanced features, the 470EX-AI is a great choice. If you're on a tighter budget, the 430EX III-RT or 320EX II might be a better fit.",
