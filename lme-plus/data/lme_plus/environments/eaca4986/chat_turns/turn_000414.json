You can sit back, enjoy your drink, and reflect on the great ride you just had.\n\nI think you've got a solid plan in place for a fun and relaxing ride. You've got your route, your gear, and your post-ride treat all lined up. All that's left to do is get out there and enjoy the ride!\n\nHave a great time on your ride, and I hope the weather and scenery are perfect for you!",
