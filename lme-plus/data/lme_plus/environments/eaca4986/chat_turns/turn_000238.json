Kafka was a highly introverted and reserved person, often keeping his writings private and only sharing them with a few close friends. Despite his literary achievements, he held a day job as a civil servant and struggled with maintaining his writing as his main priority. He also suffered from various health issues, including migraines, boils, and insomnia, which greatly affected his productivity. Kafka's works have also been highly influential in shaping the literary and cultural landscape of the 20th century. His unique blend of psychological introspection, surrealism, and social commentary has inspired a wide range of writers and artists across various genres and mediums. His legacy continues to be explored and interpreted through scholarship, exhibitions, and even adaptations into new forms of media.",
