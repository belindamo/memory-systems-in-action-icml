  "content": "That sounds like a great plan! Taking breaks to enjoy the views and rest your legs is a great way to pace yourself and make the ride more enjoyable. And it's always exciting to check out a new bike shop, especially if it's near the beach. You might be able to get some local tips on the best routes or trails in the area, or even pick up some new gear or accessories.\n\nIt's also a good idea to support local bike shops, as they can be a great resource for the cycling community. Who knows, you might even meet some other cyclists or make some new friends who share your passion for riding.\n\nAre you planning on treating yourself to a post-ride snack or coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9 or restaurant? You've earned it after a 30-mile ride!",
