Two weeks is a great amount of time to add a lovely border, and I'm sure your sister will appreciate the thought and effort you're putting into this special gift.\n\nHere are some popular and timeless border patterns that might inspire you:\n\n1. **Single Crochet (SC) Border**: A classic and simple border that adds a clean finish to your blanket. You can work it in the same yarn weight and color as your blanket or use a contrasting color for a pop of interest.\n2. **Shell Border**: A beautiful, elegant border that features shell stitches, which resemble seashells. This border adds a romantic touch to your blanket and can be worked in various yarn weights and colors.\n3. **Chevron Border**: A modern and trendy border that features inverted and regular chevrons. This border adds a fun and playful touch to your blanket and can be worked in bold, contrasting colors for a statement look.\n4. **Herringbone Border**: A reversible border that features a herringbone pattern, which gives your blanket a unique, woven look. This border is perfect for a more rustic or bohemian-themed blanket.\n5. **Picot Border**: A delicate and feminine border that features small, intricate picot stitches. This border adds a touch of whimsy and elegance to your blanket and can be worked in lightweight yarns and pastel colors.\n6. **C2C (Corner-to-Corner) Border**: A great option if you want to add a border that complements a C2C blanket. This border features a diagonal pattern that flows seamlessly from one corner to the next.\n7. **Bobble Border**: A fun and textured border that features bobbles, which are small, rounded clusters of stitches. This border adds a playful touch to your blanket and can be worked in bold, contrasting colors.\n8. **Trellis Border**: A beautiful, lace-inspired border that features a trellis pattern. This border adds a delicate, airy feel to your blanket and can be worked in lightweight yarns and pastel colors.\n\nBefore choosing a border pattern, consider the following factors:\n\n* The style and theme of your blanket (e.g., modern, traditional, bohemian)\n* The yarn weight and color(s) you're using\n* The complexity level you're comfortable with (some borders may require more concentration or experience)\n* The time you have available to complete the border (some borders may be quicker to work up than others)\n\nYou can find many free crochet border patterns online, including tutorials and videos, to help you get started. If you're short on time, you can also consider a simple border like the Single Crochet Border or a border with a repetitive pattern, like the Chevron Border.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on choosing the perfect border for your sister's birthday blanket!",
