  "content": "Critics of today generally view Kafka's works as timeless and highly influential. His writings are still considered to be ground-breaking and continue to inspire writers in various genres. Kafka's works are highly regarded for his acute portrayal of the absurdity of modern life and the individual's struggle against the system.\n\nRecent developments in understanding Kafka's legacy have focused on the role of his Jewish identity in his work. Scholars have examined how his Jewishness influenced his writings and how it played a role in his experiences as a writer. Additionally, there has been a renewed interest in Kafka's political beliefs and how they may have influenced his writing, particularly in relation to his critiques of bureaucracy, modernity, and totalitarianism. Some scholars have also approached Kafka's work through the lens of trauma studies, examining how his personal experiences of trauma may have been reflected in his writing. Overall, Kafka's legacy continues to evolve, with new readings and interpretations emerging as readers continue to engage with his work.",
