  "content": "The imaginative faculty functions in two forms. One is known as \u201csynthetic imagination,\u201d and the other as \u201ccreative imagination.\u201d\nSynthetic Imagination\nThrough this faculty, one may arrange old concepts, ideas, or plans into new combinations. This faculty creates nothing. It merely works with the material of experience, education, and observation with which it is fed.\nIt is the faculty used most by the inventor, with the exception of the who draws upon the creative imagination, when he cannot solve his problem through synthetic imagination.\nCreative Imagination\nThrough the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.\nIt is the faculty through which \u201chunches\u201d and \u201cinspirations\u201d are received. Through this skill all basic, or new ideas are handed over to man.\nIt is through this faculty that thought vibrations from the minds of others are received. Through this power one individual may \u201ctune in,\u201d or communicate with the subconscious minds of other men.\nThe creative imagination works automatically. This faculty functions ONLY when the conscious mind is vibrating at an exceedingly rapid rate, as for example, when the conscious mind is stimulated through the emotion of a strong desire.\nThe creative faculty becomes more alert, more receptive to vibrations from the sources mentioned, in proportion to its development through USE. This statement is significant! Ponder over it before passing on.\nThe great leaders of business, industry, finance, and the great artists, musicians, poets, and writers became great, because they developed the faculty of creative imagination.\nBoth the synthetic and creative faculties of imagination become more alert with use, just as any muscle or organ of the body develops through use.\nDesire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is abstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical counterpart.\nCreative visualization, manifesting, and the law of attraction use the imagination to create success.",
