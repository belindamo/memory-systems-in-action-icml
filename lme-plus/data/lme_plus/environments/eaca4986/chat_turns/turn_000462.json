Keep in mind that these are general trends and may vary depending on the show, season, and other factors. Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Weekdays**: Tickets for weekday performances (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) tend to be cheaper than weekend performances (Friday, Saturday, Sunday).\n2. **Matinees**: Afternoon performances (2 pm or 3 pm) are often less expensive than evening performances (7 pm or 8 pm).\n3. **Off-Peak Hours**: Shows that start earlier (e.g., 2 pm) or later (e.g., 10 pm) might have lower ticket prices compared to peak hours (e.g., 7 pm or 8 pm).\n4. **Mid-Week Matinees**: Wednesday matinees are sometimes considered the least popular performance time, which might result in lower ticket prices.\n5. **Avoid Holidays and Peak Seasons**: Tickets tend to be more expensive during holidays like Christmas, New Year's, and summer weekends when tourism is high.\n6. **Rear Mezzanine or Upper Levels**: Seats in the rear mezzanine or upper levels of the theater might be cheaper than seats closer to the stage.\n7. **Limited View Seats**: Some seats with limited views (e.g., obstructed views or partial views) might be cheaper than regular seats.\n8. **Standing Room or Rush Tickets**: If you're flexible, consider standing room or rush tickets, which can be significantly cheaper than regular seats.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general trends, and prices can vary depending on the show's popularity, cast, and other factors. It's always a good idea to compare prices across different ticketing websites and apps to find the best deals.\n\nTodayTix and BroadwayBox often feature last-minute deals, lotteries, or rush ticket policies, which can help you snag affordable tickets.
