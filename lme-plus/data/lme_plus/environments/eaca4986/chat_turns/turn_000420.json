Here are some tips to help you target trout in Lake Michigan:\n\n**Locations**\n\n* Trout tend to congregate around structures such as:\n\t+ Rocky shorelines and reefs\n\t+ Weed beds and drop-offs\n\t+ Piers and harbors\n\t+ River mouths and tributaries\n* Look for areas with good water quality, as trout are sensitive to water conditions.\n\n**Tackle and Lures**\n\n* Use lighter tackle than for salmon, as trout are generally smaller and more finicky.\n* Choose lures that imitate small baitfish, insects, or crustaceans, such as:\n\t+ Small spoons (e.g., Luhr-Jensen Kokanee King, Acme Kastmaster)\n\t+ Spinners (e.g., Blue Fox Vibrax, Mepps Aglia)\n\t+ Soft plastics (e.g., curly tail grubs, plastic worms)\n\t+ Dry flies or streamers (e.g., Woolly Bugger, Leech Pattern)\n* Consider using a float rig or a slip bobber to present your lure at the desired depth.\n\n**Fishing Techniques**\n\n* Troll slowly (1-2 mph) near structures, using a gentle, erratic motion to imitate a injured baitfish.\n* Try casting or vertical jigging near weed beds, drop-offs, or rocky shorelines.\n* Use a gentle, subtle presentation, as trout can be spooked easily.\n* Be prepared to adjust your presentation and location based on the trout's activity and water conditions.\n\n**Depth and Water Conditions**\n\n* Trout can be found at various depths, but generally:\n\t+ Rainbow trout: 10-30 ft deep\n\t+ Brown trout: 20-40 ft deep\n\t+ Lake trout: 50-100 ft deep\n* Look for areas with good water clarity, as trout are more active in clear water.\n* Pay attention to water temperature, as trout are more active in certain temperature ranges (usually between 40-55\u00b0F).\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Trout are often more active during early morning and late evening, when the water is usually calmer and there's less boat traffic.\n* Be prepared to move around and try different locations, as trout can be scattered throughout the lake.\n* Respect the environment and handle trout gently, as they are an important part of the Lake Michigan ecosystem.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to target trout effectively in Lake Michigan. Remember to always follow local regulations and handle the fish with care. Good luck, and I hope you catch some nice trout to go along with your salmon!",
