Since you'll be targeting two different species, you'll want to adjust your tackle and techniques accordingly. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your fishing trip:\n\n**Salmon Fishing**\n\n* Use the Ci4+ rod with a medium to heavy action to handle the strength of salmon.\n* Choose lures that imitate baitfish, such as spoons, spinners, or plugs, in sizes and colors that match the baitfish found in Lake Michigan.\n* Troll at speeds between 2-4 mph, and adjust your speed based on the water conditions and fish activity.\n* Use a downrigger or trolling weight to get your lures to the desired depth, which is usually between 50-150 ft for salmon in Lake Michigan.\n\n**Trout Fishing**\n\n* Switch to a lighter action and smaller lures when targeting trout.\n* Use lures that imitate small baitfish, insects, or crustaceans, such as small spoons, spinners, or soft plastics.\n* Troll slowly (1-2 mph) near structures like rocky shorelines, weed beds, or piers.\n* Consider using a float rig or slip bobber to present your lure at the desired depth, which is usually between 10-30 ft for trout in Lake Michigan.\n\n**Rod Setup**\n\n* Use a suitable line weight and type for both salmon and trout fishing. A monofilament or fluorocarbon line with a minimum of 10-15 lb test weight should work well for both species.\n* Adjust the drag system according to the species you're targeting. For salmon, set the drag to about 1/3 to 1/2 of the line's breaking strength. For trout, set the drag to about 1/4 to 1/3 of the line's breaking strength.\n* Make sure to check your knots and connections regularly to ensure they're secure.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Pay attention to the water conditions and adjust your tactics accordingly. Salmon and trout behave differently in different water conditions, so be prepared to adapt.\n* Keep an eye on your fish finder or sonar to locate schools of fish and structures.\n* Be gentle when handling trout, as they are more delicate than salmon.\n* Don't hesitate to ask for advice from local fishermen or guides if you're new to fishing on Lake Michigan.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to have a successful and enjoyable fishing trip on Lake Michigan with your Shimano Stradic Ci4+ rod. Good luck, and I hope you catch some nice salmon and trout!",
