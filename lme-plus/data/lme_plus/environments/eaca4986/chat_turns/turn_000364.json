  "content": "Indeed, it is important to explore alternatives to economic sanctions because such policies can have negative consequences for people who are unrelated to the targeted country's policies. Often, the citizens of the affected countries suffer the most, especially in terms of their access to basic necessities like food, medicine, and humanitarian aid.\n\nBy exploring other diplomatic measures, such as targeted sanctions, dialogue, and engagement, the international community can hold governments accountable without harming the citizens of the targeted country. These approaches may involve more patience and persistence than economic sanctions, but they can help create more sustainable solutions that promote peace, stability, and the well-being of all people involved.\n\nIt is essential for international actors to engage in dialogue and diplomacy with target governments and to take measures to minimize the impact of policies on non-combatants, especially on the most vulnerable populations. Through these efforts, we can meaningfully address problematic behaviors from governmental institutions and ensure that innocent individuals do not become collateral damage.",
