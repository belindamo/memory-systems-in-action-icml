  "content": "Yes, classic literature and poetry have been a long-standing source of inspiration for musicians. Here are a few examples of artists who have used classic literature in their lyrics:\n\n1. Kate Bush's \"Wuthering Heights\" - Bush's song is inspired by Emily Bront\u00eb's novel of the same name, and its lyrics are written from the perspective of the novel's protagonist, Catherine Earnshaw.\n\n2. The Doors' \"The End\" - The song's lyrics reference the myth of Oedipus and Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Mask of the Red Death.\"\n\n3. David Bowie's \"Diamond Dogs\" - The song's lyrics are inspired by George Orwell's novel \"1984.\"\n\n4. The Smiths' \"Cemetry Gates\" - The song references several classic poets, including William Shakespeare and John Keats.\n\n5. The Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" - The song's title is an acronym for LSD, but the surreal imagery of the lyrics is said to have been inspired by Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples, but many musicians draw inspiration from classic literature, incorporating themes and imagery from a range of sources to add depth and complexity to their music.",
