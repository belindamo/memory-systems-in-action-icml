I'll also try to make personal appeals to my friends and family, sharing how their donation will make a direct impact on the charity and the people it supports. By the way, I've been thinking about sharing some fun facts and statistics about the American Cancer Society and the impact of their research on social media. Do you have any tips on how to find and share engaging and credible information?",
