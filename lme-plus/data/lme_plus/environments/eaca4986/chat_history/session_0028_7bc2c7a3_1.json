Two weeks is a great amount of time to add a lovely border, and I'm sure your sister will appreciate the thought and effort you're putting into this special gift.\n\nHere are some popular and timeless border patterns that might inspire you:\n\n1. **Single Crochet (SC) Border**: A classic and simple border that adds a clean finish to your blanket.

This border adds a romantic touch to your blanket and can be worked in various yarn weights and colors.\n3. **Chevron Border**: A modern and trendy border that features inverted and regular chevrons.

      "content": "I completely understand! Adding a border to a partially completed blanket can be a bit more challenging than adding one to a finished blanket, but it's still doable with some planning and patience.\n\nHere are some steps to help you add a border to your partially completed blanket with minimal redoing:\n\n1. **Choose a border pattern that works with your stitch pattern**: Select a border pattern that complements the stitch pattern you've used for the main body of your blanket. This will help the border blend seamlessly with the rest of the blanket. If you're unsure, you can try swatching the border pattern alongside your main stitch pattern to see how they look together.\n2. **Identify the border's starting point**: Decide where you want the border to start and end. Typically, you'll want to start the border at the beginning of a row or round, so you can easily join the border to the main body of the blanket.\n3. **Join the border to the main body**: Use a stitch marker or a piece of scrap yarn to mark the starting point of the border. Then, use a slip stitch or a single crochet stitch to join the border yarn to the main body of the blanket at the marked point. Make sure to join in the same stitch as the main body's stitch pattern.\n4. **Work the border in rows or rounds**: Depending on the border pattern, you'll work either in rows or rounds. If you're working in rows, you'll typically work one row of the border, then turn your work and come back to the starting point. If you're working in rounds, you'll complete one round of the border, then join to the starting point.\n5. **Work the border around the entire blanket**: Continue working the border around the entire blanket, joining each row or round to the previous one. As you work, make sure to maintain the correct tension and stitch count to ensure the border lies flat and even.\n6. **Adjust the border as needed**: As you work the border, you may need to adjust the tension or stitch count to ensure it lies flat and even. You can also adjust the border pattern if you find it's not working with the main body of the blanket as expected.\n7. **Weave in ends and block the blanket**: Once you've completed the border, weave in the ends and block the blanket to give it a professional finish.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Try to maintain the same yarn weight and color for the border as the main body of the blanket, unless you intentionally want a contrasting border.\n* Use a stitch marker or a piece of scrap yarn to mark the starting point of the border, so you can easily find it as you work.\n* If you're working a border with a specific repeat, make sure to count your stitches carefully to ensure you're maintaining the correct repeat.\n* Don't be afraid to frogging (rip out) the border if it's not working out as expected. It's better to redo a small section than to compromise the entire blanket.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you should be able to add a beautiful border to your partially completed blanket with minimal redoing. Good luck, and happy crocheting!"

      "content": "The Single Crochet (SC) border is a fantastic choice, especially when you're short on time. Joining the border yarn to the main body of the blanket can be a bit tricky, but with some tips and tricks, you can do it seamlessly. Here's how to join the border yarn without bulkiness:\n\n**Method 1: Invisible Join**\n\n1. Fasten off the main body of the blanket, leaving a long tail.\n2. Hold the border yarn in your non-dominant hand, with the end of the yarn closest to the main body of the blanket.\n3. Insert the crochet hook into the stitch where you want to join the border yarn.\n4. Yarn over with the border yarn and pull the yarn through the stitch. You should now have one loop on the hook.\n5. Yarn over again with the border yarn and pull the yarn through both loops on the hook. This will create an invisible join.\n6. Pull the yarn tail gently to tighten the join.\n\n**Method 2: Slip Stitch Join**\n\n1. Fasten off the main body of the blanket, leaving a long tail.\n2. Hold the border yarn in your non-dominant hand, with the end of the yarn closest to the main body of the blanket.\n3. Insert the crochet hook into the stitch where you want to join the border yarn.\n4. Yarn over with the border yarn and pull the yarn through the stitch. You should now have one loop on the hook.\n5. Slip stitch to the first stitch of the main body of the blanket. This will join the border yarn to the main body.\n6. Pull the yarn tail gently to tighten the join.\n\n**Tips to avoid bulkiness:**\n\n* Make sure to hold the yarns at the same tension when joining to avoid bulkiness.\n* Use a yarn needle to weave in the ends of both yarns to create a neat and tidy join.\n* Try to join the border yarn to the main body of the blanket at a stitch that's not too tight or too loose. This will help the border lie flat and even.\n* If you're using a variegated or self-striping yarn for the border, try to join the yarn at a color change to minimize the visibility of the join.\n\nBy following these methods and tips, you should be able to join the border yarn to the main body of the blanket without bulkiness. Remember to work slowly and gently, as you want to maintain the same tension throughout the join.\n\nGood luck, and I hope your sister loves the finished blanket!"

Having a dedicated space for your craft supplies can really help boost your creativity and productivity.\n\nHere are some tips on how to keep your craft supplies organized and dust-free:\n\n1. **Categorize and group similar items together**: Store supplies by type, such as yarns, fabrics, papers, paints, etc. This will make it easy to find what you need when you need it.\n2. **Use storage containers and bins**: Label each container or bin with its contents, and consider using clear or transparent bins so you can see what's inside without having to dig through everything.\n3. **Assign a home for each item**: Once you've categorized and grouped your supplies, assign a specific spot for each item. This will help maintain order and make it easier to put things back where they belong.\n4. **Keep frequently used items accessible**: Store your most frequently used supplies in easy-to-reach locations, like the top shelf or in a convenient drawer.\n5. **Store small items in small containers**: Use small containers or jars for small items like buttons, beads, or embroidery floss to keep them organized and prevent them from getting lost.\n6. **Keep dust-prone items in sealed containers**: Store items like paper, fabric, or yarn in sealed containers or bins to keep them dust-free.\n7. **Label everything**: Labels are your friends! Use labels to identify what's inside each container or bin, and consider color-coding similar items.\n8. **Dust regularly**: Set aside time each week to dust your craft room, paying attention to shelves, containers, and surfaces where dust tends to accumulate.\n9. **Consider vertical storage**: Make the most of your wall space by using wall-mounted shelves, hooks, or pegboards to store items like yarn, ribbons, or scissors.\n10. **Maintain your space**: Set aside time each month to maintain your organized space. Go through your supplies, tidy up, and make sure everything is still organized and easily accessible.\n\nFor your new shelving unit, consider the following:\n\n* **Measure your shelves**: Measure the shelves to ensure you're making the most of the space. You can use shelf dividers or baskets to maximize storage.\n* **Use shelf liners**: Line your shelves with paper, fabric, or shelf liner to prevent items from slipping or scratching the surface.\n* **Store heavy items at the bottom**: Place heavier items, like books or large containers, on the bottom shelves to prevent them from falling and causing a mess.\n\nRemember, organizing your craft room is a process, and it might take some time to get everything just right. But with these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a space that's functional, efficient, and inspiring!\n\nGood luck with your organization project, and I hope you have a blast setting up your new shelving unit!"
