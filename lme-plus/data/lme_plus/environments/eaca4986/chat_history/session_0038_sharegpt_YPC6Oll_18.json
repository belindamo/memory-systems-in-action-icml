      "content": "Answer: d. Increasing restrictions on tobacco sales so that cigarettes are modestly harder to obtain.\n\nExplanation: This option is the most likely to have the greatest effect on the health of a population because it addresses a major contributor to chronic disease and mortality, which is tobacco use. By making cigarettes harder to obtain, there is a potential to reduce the number of people who take up smoking and the number of smokers who continue to smoke. This can lead to a reduction in tobacco-related health issues such as lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.\n\nOption a is not correct because it only addresses a specific group of patients with high blood pressure, and not the entire population. Option b is not incorrect, but its effect on health is likely to be smaller compared to the other options. Option c is not incorrect, but it only addresses a specific genetic condition and does not have a widespread impact on the population.\n\nLevel of Bloom's Taxonomy: Evaluation"

      "content": "Answer: b. Strategy\n\nExplanation: A strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve a particular goal. It outlines how an organization will use its resources to achieve its objectives. A resource refers to any asset or capability that can be used to achieve an organization's goals. The value chain refers to the sequence of activities that an organization undertakes to deliver a product or service to customers. A vision is a statement of an organization's aspirations for the future, which provides guidance for decision-making and goal-setting.\n\nLevel of Bloom's Taxonomy: Comprehension (understanding the meaning of a concept)"

      "content": "Answer: a. Experts in the field of study are involved in the editorial process.\n\nExplanation: Peer-reviewed journals go through a rigorous evaluation process where experts in the field of study review the article for quality, accuracy, and relevance. This ensures that the information published in the journal is reliable and trustworthy. Non-peer-reviewed journals may not undergo this type of evaluation, so the information they publish may not be as reliable. The other answer options are not correct because journal editors are not necessarily selected from more prestigious institutions (b), randomized controlled studies are not the only studies that can be published in peer-reviewed journals (c), and peer-reviewed journals do not necessarily require publication of all raw data (d).\n\nLevel of Bloom's Taxonomy: Knowledge/Comprehension"

This distinguishes them from other medical care providers such as nurses, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners who may hold different degrees or certifications. While physicians may also be sued for medical malpractice, perform complex surgical operations, and complete continuing education courses, these characteristics are not unique to physicians and may also apply to other healthcare professionals.\n\nBloom's Taxonomy Level: Knowledge"

      "content": "Answer: a. Competitor's share of market\n\nExplanation: Make-or-buy decision involves evaluating whether to produce goods or services in-house or purchase them from an external supplier. The factors that affect this decision include the cost and quality of the product, level of expertise and availability of resources in-house, and availability and cost of external resources. Competitor's share of the market is not a relevant factor in this decision as it does not directly impact the cost or quality of the product or service.\n\nBloom's Level: Application"
