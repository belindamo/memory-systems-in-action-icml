Here are some tips to make a big batch of lentil soup that you can reheat throughout the week:\n\n**Basic Lentil Soup Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup dried green or brown lentils, rinsed and drained\n* 4 cups vegetable broth\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 carrots, chopped\n* 2 celery stalks, chopped\n* 1 can diced tomatoes (14.5 oz)\n* 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n* 1 teaspoon dried rosemary\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Optional: spinach, kale, or other leafy greens for added nutrition\n\n**Tips for Making a Big Batch**\n\n1. **Use a large pot**: Choose a pot that can hold at least 6-8 quarts (5.7-7.6 liters) of liquid to allow for easy stirring and to accommodate the lentils' expansion during cooking.\n2. **Soak the lentils (optional)**: While not necessary, soaking the lentils for 30 minutes to an hour can help reduce cooking time and improve digestibility. Drain and rinse the lentils after soaking.\n3. **Saute the aromatics**: Cook the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery in a bit of olive oil until they're tender to bring out their natural sweetness and depth of flavor.\n4. **Add the lentils and broth**: Add the lentils, vegetable broth, diced tomatoes, thyme, and rosemary to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.\n5. **Let it cook**: Let the soup simmer for 30-40 minutes or until the lentils are tender. You can also use a pressure cooker to reduce cooking time to about 20 minutes.\n6. **Season and adjust**: Add salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings you like. Taste and adjust the flavor as needed.\n7. **Let it cool**: Allow the soup to cool completely before refrigerating or freezing.\n8. **Portion and store**: Divide the soup into individual portions (e.g., 1-2 cups per serving) and store them in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months.\n\n**Reheating and Serving Tips**\n\n* Reheat the soup in the microwave or on the stovetop until hot and steamy.\n* Add a splash of water or broth if the soup becomes too thick after refrigeration.\n* Serve with a side of whole grain crackers, a mixed green salad, or some crusty bread for a satisfying meal.\n* Consider adding some protein like grilled chicken, turkey, or tofu for added nutrition.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll have a delicious and healthy batch of lentil soup to enjoy throughout the week. Happy cooking!"
