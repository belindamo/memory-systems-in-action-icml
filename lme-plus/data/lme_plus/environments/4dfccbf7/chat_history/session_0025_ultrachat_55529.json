Clean Them Regularly: Dirt and dust can damage the leather of shoes by clogging pores and causing cracks over time. Wipe your shoes down with a damp cloth or a soft-bristled brush to remove dirt and debris.\n\n2. Condition Your Leather Shoes: Applying a leather conditioner to your shoes can help prevent them from drying out and cracking. Always test any new product on a small, inconspicuous spot of the shoe first to ensure it won't cause any discoloration or damage.\n\n3. Store Them Properly: Leather shoes should be stored in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. It's also best to store them with shoe trees or stuff them with newspaper to help them retain their shape.\n\n4. Avoid Water: Leather shoes should not be exposed to water or excess moisture. If your shoes do get wet, wipe them down and let them air dry at room temperature.\n\n5. Polish Them Regularly: Polishing your leather shoes not only makes them shine, but it also helps protect the leather. Avoid using too much polish or using polish that's too dark for your shoes, as this can cause discoloration and damage.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid:\n\n1. Using harsh detergents or chemical cleaners that can damage the leather.\n\n2. Scrubbing vigorously with a rough sponge or brush, which can scratch and harm the leather.\n\n3. Failing to condition your leather shoes, which can lead to dryness and cracking.\n\n4. Storing leather shoes in humid or damp areas, which can promote the growth of mold and mildew.\n\n5.

      "content": "One more question - how often should I be conditioning my leather shoes?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The frequency of conditioning your leather shoes depends on how often and in what conditions you wear them. As a general rule of thumb, leather shoes should be conditioned every three to six months with regular wear. However, if you wear your shoes more frequently or in harsh conditions, such as rainy or snowy weather, they may require conditioning more often. On the other hand, if you wear your shoes infrequently or store them in a cool, dry place away from sunlight, they may not require conditioning as often. It's essential to pay attention to the condition of the leather and look for signs of dryness or cracking. If you notice any issues, it's best to condition your shoes sooner rather than later to prevent further damage."
