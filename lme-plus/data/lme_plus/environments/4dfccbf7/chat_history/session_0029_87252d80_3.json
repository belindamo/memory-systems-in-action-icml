      "content": "The Finch is a lovely spot. Yes, they do have outdoor seating! They have a small patio area in the back of the restaurant, which is perfect for enjoying their delicious food and drinks on a nice day. It's a cozy spot to people-watch and take in the neighborhood vibe.\n\nKeep in mind that the outdoor seating area is limited, so it's first-come, first-served. If you're planning to sit outside, I recommend getting there early or being prepared to wait for a table.\n\nIf you did walk by The Finch during your stay, you might have noticed their charming exterior, which features a beautiful mural and a few outdoor tables. Even if you didn't stop in, I'm sure you would have noticed the bustling atmosphere and enticing aromas wafting from the kitchen!\n\nDid you consider stopping in, or was there another spot that caught your attention during your walk?"
