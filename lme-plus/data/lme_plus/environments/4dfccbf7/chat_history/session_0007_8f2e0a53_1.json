Sarah Polley's vision and execution are truly remarkable.\n\nRegarding the film's release plans, \"Women Talking\" is currently in a limited theatrical release, but it's expected to expand to more theaters in the coming weeks. The film's distributor, United Artists Releasing, has announced plans to gradually expand the film's release to around 1,000 theaters across the United States and Canada.\n\nAs for streaming platforms, there hasn't been an official announcement yet, but it's likely that the film will be available on various streaming services in the future. Given the film's critical acclaim and awards buzz, it's possible that it might be available on Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, or other premium streaming platforms.\n\nIn an interview, Sarah Polley mentioned that she hopes the film will have a long and slow burn, allowing audiences to discover it and have conversations about its themes and ideas. She also expressed her desire for the film to be seen on the big screen, where it can have the most impact.\n\nIt's worth noting that the film's distributor, United Artists Releasing, is a subsidiary of MGM, which has a deal with Amazon Prime Video to distribute its films on the platform.

The way the camera captured the women's conversations and interactions was so nuanced and sensitive, it really added to the film's emotional impact. The use of close-ups, medium shots, and long takes created a sense of intimacy and immediacy, making you feel like you were part of the conversation.\n\nAnd the score was indeed subtle yet powerful. Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir's composition was perfect for the film, adding depth and emotion to the scenes without overpowering them. The way the music swelled during the more tense moments was breathtaking, and it really added to the overall emotional resonance of the film.\n\nI think one of the things that makes \"Women Talking\" so effective is its ability to balance the intimate, character-driven moments with the larger themes and ideas. The film never feels too small or too big, and the cinematography and score play a huge role in achieving that balance.\n\nIt's great to hear that you felt like you were holding your breath during some of the more tense scenes!
