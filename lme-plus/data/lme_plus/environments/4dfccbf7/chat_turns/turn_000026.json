  "content": "I'm looking to spend around $1,000 to $1,500 for a 55-inch TV. I mainly use Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, but I also occasionally watch Hulu and Disney+. I'd like a TV with good picture quality, HDR, and a user-friendly interface. Oh, and I recently upgraded my Wi-Fi setup to a mesh network system, so I want to make sure the TV can take full advantage of the improved connectivity.",
