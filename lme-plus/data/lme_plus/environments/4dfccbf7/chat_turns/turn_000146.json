  "content": "I'm planning to create a bit of a whimsical layout with my sunflowers and zinnias. I want to plant the sunflowers in a loose circle around my raised bed, with the zinnias scattered throughout the bed in a colorful, random pattern. I think it'll add a playful touch to my garden and create a sense of movement and energy. Plus, it'll be fun to see the sunflowers towering above the zinnias and my other vegetables!\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any suggestions for creating a visually appealing garden layout?",
