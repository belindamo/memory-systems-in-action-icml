  "content": "Lexical semantics is a branch of linguistics that studies the meaning of words and how they relate to each other in a language. It is concerned with the analysis of the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences, as well as the relationships between them. Lexical semantics focuses on the different aspects of word meaning, such as the denotation (literal meaning), connotation (associative meaning), and collocation (words that tend to co-occur together). This field of study is important for understanding how language works and how people use language to communicate meaning. It is also useful for tasks such as natural language processing and machine translation, as well as for language learning and teaching.",
