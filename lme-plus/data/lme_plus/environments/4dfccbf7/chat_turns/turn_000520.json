  "content": "Certainly, here's a basic example of using TensorFlow and Keras to build a simple machine learning model for a real estate MVP:\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\n\n# Define the model\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),\n    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(1)\n])\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)\nprint('Test loss:', test_loss)\n```\nIn this example, we're using the `Sequential` class from the `keras` module to define a simple neural network with three dense layers. The first layer has 64 units and uses the ReLU activation function, and the second and third layers also have 64 units each.\n\nNext, we compile the model using the `compile` method, specifying the `mean_squared_error` loss function and the `adam` optimizer.\n\nFinally, we train the model using the `fit` method, specifying the training data `X_train` and target values `y_train`, and training for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32. After training, we evaluate the model using the `evaluate` method on the test data `X_test` and target values `y_test`.\n\nThis is a very basic example, but it gives you an idea of how to build and train a simple machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras. Of course, in a real-world scenario, you would need to preprocess and prepare your data, split it into training and test sets, and experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to get the best results.",
