  "content": "I try to turn the compost pile every week or two. I've definitely noticed some changes in the soil already. It seems more fertile and easier to work with. The plants seem to be growing healthier and stronger too. I'm excited to see how it will continue to improve over time. I've also been thinking about adding some flowers to my garden to attract more pollinators. Do you have any recommendations for flowers that are good for attracting bees and butterflies?",
