  "content": "While the use of symbolism can add depth and complexity to a film, it is not necessarily a requirement for a film to be considered great. A great film can achieve greatness through a variety of elements, such as compelling performances, masterful direction, an engaging storyline, or a unique visual style.\n\nThere are many films that are considered great but do not necessarily use symbolism, such as \"Casablanca\" (1942), \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994), and \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" (1977).\n\nAt the same time, symbolism is just one of many techniques that filmmakers can utilize to create deeper meaning and convey complex ideas. So while it's not a requirement for a great film, it can certainly enhance the overall quality and impact of a movie.",
