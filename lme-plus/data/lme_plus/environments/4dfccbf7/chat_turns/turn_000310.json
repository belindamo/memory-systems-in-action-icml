  "content": "The best way to travel between historical landmarks in Zaragoza would be to use public transportation, such as buses or trams, as they connect the majority of the main tourist attractions. Alternatively, you can walk or rent bicycles as Zaragoza has a good network of bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly streets. Taxis are also available, but they can be expensive compared to other transport options. It is recommended to plan out the itinerary beforehand to optimize the travel experience.",
