I'd be happy to help you find a great 4K TV that works well with your streaming service.\n\nBefore I provide some recommendations, can you please tell me:\n\n1. What is your budget for the TV?\n2. What is your preferred screen size?\n3. Which streaming services do you use the most (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, etc.)?\n4. Do you have any specific features in mind (e.g., OLED or LED, HDR, Dolby Vision, smart TV platform, etc.)?\n5. Do you plan to use the TV for gaming or just for watching movies and TV shows?\n\nBased on your input, here are some popular 4K TV options that work well with various streaming services:\n\n**Budget-friendly options:**\n\n1. **TCL 4-Series** (starts at $350 for 43\"): A great value for the price, with Roku TV built-in for seamless streaming.\n2. **Vizio P-Series** (starts at $400 for 50\"): Offers good picture quality and smart TV features at an affordable price.\n\n**Mid-range options:**\n\n1. **Samsung QLED 4K TVs** (starts at $800 for 49\"): Excellent picture quality, wide color gamut, and supports HDR10+.\n2. **LG NanoCell SM9X Series** (starts at $900 for 49\"): Great color accuracy, wide viewing angles, and supports Dolby Vision.\n\n**High-end options:**\n\n1. **Sony A9G OLED** (starts at $2,000 for 55\"): Outstanding picture quality, infinite contrast ratio, and supports Dolby Vision.\n2. **LG C9 OLED** (starts at $2,000 for 55\"): Excellent picture quality, wide viewing angles, and supports Dolby Vision.\n\nAll of these TVs are compatible with popular streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. However, if you're invested in a specific ecosystem (e.g., Apple TV+), you may want to consider a TV that supports that platform's features (e.g., AirPlay 2).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements, and I can provide more tailored recommendations!",
