Sarah Polley's vision and execution are truly remarkable.\n\nRegarding the film's release plans, \"Women Talking\" is currently in a limited theatrical release, but it's expected to expand to more theaters in the coming weeks. The film's distributor, United Artists Releasing, has announced plans to gradually expand the film's release to around 1,000 theaters across the United States and Canada.\n\nAs for streaming platforms, there hasn't been an official announcement yet, but it's likely that the film will be available on various streaming services in the future. Given the film's critical acclaim and awards buzz, it's possible that it might be available on Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, or other premium streaming platforms.\n\nIn an interview, Sarah Polley mentioned that she hopes the film will have a long and slow burn, allowing audiences to discover it and have conversations about its themes and ideas. She also expressed her desire for the film to be seen on the big screen, where it can have the most impact.\n\nIt's worth noting that the film's distributor, United Artists Releasing, is a subsidiary of MGM, which has a deal with Amazon Prime Video to distribute its films on the platform. So, it's possible that \"Women Talking\" might eventually find its way to Amazon Prime Video, but no official announcement has been made yet.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're interested in seeing the film again or want to encourage others to watch it, you can support its theatrical release by spreading the word and buying tickets. The more people who see it in theaters, the more likely it is to get a wider release and eventually make its way to streaming platforms.\n\nWhat did you think of the film's cinematography and score? The way the film was shot and scored added so much to its emotional impact, in my opinion.",
