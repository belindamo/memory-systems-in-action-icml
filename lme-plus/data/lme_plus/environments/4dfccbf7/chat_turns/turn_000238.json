  "content": "I can help you track Luna's medication refills.\n\nLet's add a new section to your pet expense tracker for Luna's medication. Since you need to refill the prescription every 30 days, we can assume the refills will be approximately monthly.\n\n**Luna's Medication Refills**\n\n* Refill Date: [Insert Date]\n* Cost: [Insert Cost]\n\nSince you mentioned Luna's been taking the medication since January, let's start tracking from there. Can you tell me the cost of the first refill and the date you refilled it? We can work from there to track the subsequent refills.\n\nAlso, do you know the approximate cost of each refill? That way, we can estimate the monthly cost and add it to your total pet expenses.\n\nLet me know, and I'll help you get started!",
