However, Insight Timer is a popular app with a large library of guided meditations, talks, music tracks, and ambient sounds that are available for free. It also has a timer feature that you can use for unguided meditation practice. Many users enjoy the app's diverse selection of meditations, as well as its community features that enable you to connect with other meditators and get support from teachers. Overall, Insight Timer is definitely worth trying out, especially if you're on a tight budget or prefer a free app.",
