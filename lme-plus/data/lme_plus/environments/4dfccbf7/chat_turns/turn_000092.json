  "content": "Congratulations on your new smart speaker with Alexa! Controlling your devices with voice commands can be very convenient. While Alexa doesn't directly support controlling printers, you can use IFTTT (If This Then That) applets or smart printer skills to create custom voice commands for your printer. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n**IFTTT Applets:**\n\n1. **Print a document:** \"Alexa, trigger print document\" - This applet can send a document to your printer via email or Google Drive.\n2. **Print a photo:** \"Alexa, trigger print photo\" - This applet can print a specific photo from your Google Photos library or Facebook album.\n\n**Smart Printer Skills:**\n\n1. **HP Printer Skill:** \"Alexa, ask HP to print a document\" - This skill allows you to print documents, photos, and more using Alexa voice commands.\n2. **Canon Printer Skill:** \"Alexa, ask Canon to print a photo\" - This skill enables voice printing for Canon printers.\n\n**Routines:**\n\n1. **\"Goodnight\" routine:** \"Alexa, goodnight\" - This routine can turn off your printer, along with other devices, when you're done using them.\n2. **\"Print and coffee\" routine:** \"Alexa, start my day\" - This routine can print a daily schedule or news briefing while you're getting your morning coffee.\n\nTo set up these voice commands and routines, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Link your printer to IFTTT:** Connect your printer to IFTTT using the printer's API or email address.\n2. **Create an IFTTT applet:** Design a custom applet using the IFTTT platform, specifying the trigger (Alexa voice command) and action (printing a document or photo).\n3. **Enable the smart printer skill:** Enable the HP or Canon Printer Skill in the Alexa app, and link your printer account to Alexa.\n4. **Create an Alexa routine:** Set up a routine in the Alexa app, specifying the trigger phrase and the actions (printing and other devices).\n\nRemember to customize the voice commands and routines to fit your specific needs and printer model. Happy printing with Alexa!",
