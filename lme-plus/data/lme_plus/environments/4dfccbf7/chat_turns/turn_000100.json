Safety should always be your top priority, and if you're concerned about carrying a tripod, it's perfectly understandable.\n\nWhile a tripod is incredibly useful for landscape photography, it's not always necessary. You can still capture great shots handheld, especially with a lens like the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS III USM, which has image stabilization (IS).\n\nHere are some scenarios where you might be able to get away with handheld shots:\n\n1. **Bright lighting**: If you're shooting during the golden hour or in bright, overcast conditions, you'll have more flexibility to shoot handheld. You can use faster shutter speeds to freeze the action and compensate for camera shake.\n2. **Wide apertures**: Since your lens has a wide aperture of f/2.8, you can create a shallow depth of field, which can help separate your subject from the background. This can be useful for creating a sense of intimacy or isolating specific elements in the landscape.\n3. **Fast shutter speeds**: If you're shooting in good light, you can use faster shutter speeds (1/500th of a second or faster) to freeze the action and reduce camera shake.\n4. **IS and lens stabilization**: As mentioned earlier, your lens has image stabilization, which can help reduce camera shake and blur. This feature can be especially useful when shooting handheld.\n\nHowever, there are situations where a tripod is still recommended:\n\n1. **Low light**: If you're shooting during the early morning, evening, or in low-light conditions, a tripod is essential. You'll need to use slower shutter speeds, and a tripod will help prevent camera shake and blur.\n2. **Slow shutter speeds**: If you want to create creamy water effects, blur clouds, or convey a sense of movement, you'll need to use slower shutter speeds. A tripod is necessary in these situations to prevent camera shake.\n3. **Composition and precision**: A tripod allows you to take your time, compose your shot precisely, and make adjustments without worrying about camera shake.\n\nIf you're still concerned about carrying a tripod, consider the following:\n\n1. **Look for lightweight tripods**: There are many lightweight and compact tripods available that can be easily carried on hikes.\n2. **Use a monopod**: A monopod can provide additional stability without the bulk of a tripod.\n3. **Find a stable surface**: If you don't have a tripod, look for a stable surface to rest your camera on, such as a rock, log, or wall.\n\nRemember, safety should always come first. If you're not comfortable carrying a tripod, focus on capturing the best handheld shots you can, and consider using the techniques mentioned above to minimize camera shake.",
