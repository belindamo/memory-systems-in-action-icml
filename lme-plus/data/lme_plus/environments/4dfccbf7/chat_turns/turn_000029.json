It's designed to reduce the decrease in picture quality that occurs when viewing the screen from a wide angle, which is a common issue with traditional LED/LCD TVs.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Wider viewing angles:** X-Wide Angle technology uses a unique panel structure that minimizes the decrease in contrast and color accuracy when viewing the screen from the side. This means you can sit anywhere in the room and still enjoy a great picture.\n2. **Reduced color shift:** When you view a traditional LED/LCD TV from the side, the colors can shift and become less accurate. X-Wide Angle technology reduces this color shift, ensuring that the colors remain vibrant and true-to-life, even when viewed from a wide angle.\n3. **Improved contrast:** X-Wide Angle technology also helps to maintain a higher contrast ratio when viewed from the side, which results in a more immersive viewing experience with deeper blacks and more vivid colors.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\nThe benefits of X-Wide Angle technology are clear:\n\n* **Wider seating arrangements:** With X-Wide Angle, you can have a more flexible seating arrangement in your living room. You can sit anywhere and still enjoy a great picture, without having to worry about being directly in front of the TV.\n* **Improved color accuracy:** The reduced color shift and improved contrast ratio ensure that the picture remains accurate and engaging, even when viewed from the side.\n* **Enhanced immersion:** The improved picture quality and wider viewing angles create a more immersive viewing experience, making you feel like you're part of the action.\n\n**Real-world impact:**\n\nIn real-world usage, X-Wide Angle technology makes a noticeable difference. You'll appreciate the improved picture quality and wider viewing angles when:\n\n* Watching movies or TV shows with family and friends\n* Playing video games with friends or family members sitting beside you\n* Enjoying sports events or concerts with a group of people\n\nOverall, X-Wide Angle technology is a significant advantage of the Sony X950G, and it will enhance your overall viewing experience.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the benefits of X-Wide Angle technology!
