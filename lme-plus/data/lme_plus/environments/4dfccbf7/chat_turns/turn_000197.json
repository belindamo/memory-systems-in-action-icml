  "content": "Architects have to balance both aesthetics and functionality while designing a building. However, when deciding which aspect to prioritize, it depends on the client's needs, the building's purpose, and the site's constraints. \n\nFor example, if the client is a fashion company, they may prioritize aesthetics over functionality to showcase their brand's style and identity. In contrast, a hospital building requires functionality to ensure the safety and health of its patients. \n\nSimilarly, if the building is in a historic site, architects may prioritize aesthetics to create a design that harmonizes with the surrounding environment. However, if the site has environmental constraints, such as high seismic activity or strong winds, architects have to prioritize functionality to ensure the building's safety and longevity.\n\nIn summary, architects make a decision on prioritizing aesthetics or functionality based on the client's needs, the building's purpose, and the site constraints. They aim to achieve a balance between the two aspects to create a design that is visually appealing and practical.",
