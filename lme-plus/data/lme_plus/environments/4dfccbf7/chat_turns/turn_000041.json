  "content": "Certainly! The prevalence of illegal music downloading not only impacted the revenue for artists and labels, but it also devalued music by making it more easily accessible and less exclusive.\n\nBefore the rise of digital music and downloading, owning physical copies of music was the only way to access music beyond the radio, which made it more exclusive and valuable. With the ease of illegal downloading, the value of music decreased, as access to it only required a computer and internet connection.\n\nAdditionally, the prevalence of illegal music downloading also led to a decline in the perceived value of music, as many consumers believed they could access it for free without regard for its actual value or the hard work that went into creating it.\n\nThis, in turn, led to a shift in how music is monetized, as artists and labels had to find new ways to generate revenue in the face of declining album sales and illegal downloading.",
