You're making excellent choices for your garden!\n\n**Zucchini:**\n\nZucchini is a fantastic addition to any garden, and it's wonderful that you've already planted the seeds. Zucchini is a warm-season crop, so it should thrive in the current weather. Make sure to provide it with well-draining soil, full sun, and consistent watering. You can expect to harvest your zucchini in about 35-45 days.\n\n**Sunflowers:**\n\nSunflowers are indeed an excellent choice for providing shade and attracting pollinators. They're also a great addition to any garden, as they can grow quite tall (up to 12 feet or more!) and provide a dramatic pop of color. Sunflowers are relatively easy to grow, but they do require full sun and well-draining soil. They'll bloom in about 60-90 days, and you can harvest the seeds for a tasty snack or save them for next year's planting.\n\n**Zinnias:**\n\nZinnias are one of the easiest flowers to grow, and they come in a stunning array of colors and varieties. They're perfect for adding a splash of color to your garden, and they're also great for attracting pollinators. Zinnias prefer well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. They're relatively low-maintenance and can bloom in as little as 60 days.\n\n**Tips for Growing Sunflowers and Zinnias:**\n\n1. **Provide support:** Sunflowers can grow quite tall, so make sure to provide support using stakes or a trellis to keep them upright. Zinnias can also benefit from support, especially if they're top-heavy with blooms.\n2. **Deadhead:** Remove spent blooms from both sunflowers and zinnias to encourage more flowering and prevent seed production.\n3. **Water consistently:** Both sunflowers and zinnias prefer consistent watering, but make sure not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot.\n4. **Fertilize:** Feed your sunflowers and zinnias with a balanced fertilizer once a month to promote healthy growth and blooming.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to enjoy a bountiful harvest of zucchini and a stunning display of sunflowers and zinnias in your garden.\n\nHow's your garden layout looking? Are you planning to create a specific design or theme with your sunflowers and zinnias?",
