Here's a cleaned-up version of your list:\n\n**February 2023**\n\n* Date: 02/25/2023\n* Item: Dog Food\n* Cost: $60.00\n* Date: 02/25/2023\n* Item: Dental Chews\n* Cost: **unknown (20% off sale)**\n\n**March 2023**\n\n* Date: 03/07/2023\n* Item: Cat Tree\n* Cost: $120.00\n* Date: 03/10/2023\n* Item: Dog Bed\n* Cost: $80.00\n\nTo estimate the cost of the dental chews, can you tell me the original price before the 20% discount? That way, we can calculate the discounted price.\n\nAlso, I categorized the expenses by month to make it easier to track your pet expenses over time. Let me know if you have any other expenses to add or if you'd like me to help with anything else!",
