  "content": "The frequency of conditioning your leather shoes depends on how often and in what conditions you wear them. As a general rule of thumb, leather shoes should be conditioned every three to six months with regular wear. However, if you wear your shoes more frequently or in harsh conditions, such as rainy or snowy weather, they may require conditioning more often. On the other hand, if you wear your shoes infrequently or store them in a cool, dry place away from sunlight, they may not require conditioning as often. It's essential to pay attention to the condition of the leather and look for signs of dryness or cracking. If you notice any issues, it's best to condition your shoes sooner rather than later to prevent further damage.",
