People's emotions, thoughts, and actions are complex and often influenced by a multitude of factors such as past experiences, mental and emotional health, personal values, and individual personality. If you are looking for answers, it may be helpful to reach out to the person and have a direct and honest conversation about your experiences and how you feel.
