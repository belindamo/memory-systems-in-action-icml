  "content": "I was really moved by the film's portrayal of women's voices and agency. During the Q&A, Sarah Polley mentioned that she wanted to create a film that centered around women's conversations and decision-making, and I think she achieved that beautifully. I'm curious, do you know if there are any plans for the film to be released on streaming platforms or if it'll have a wider theatrical release?",
