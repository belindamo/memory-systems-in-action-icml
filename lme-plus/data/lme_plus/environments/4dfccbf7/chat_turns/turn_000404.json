  "content": "You are right that in practice, people do not always apply logic and critical thinking in their decision-making processes, and biases or emotions can often drive decisions. However, this does not mean that logic is useless in such situations.\n\nIn fact, logic and critical thinking can help us to become more aware of our own biases and emotions, and to better understand how they might be affecting our decision-making processes. By breaking down our arguments and assessing them based on their logical structure and evidence, we can identify areas where emotional or biased reasoning might be influencing our perspectives, and work to mitigate those biases.\n\nAdditionally, by providing a shared framework for evaluating arguments, logic can also help to facilitate more productive dialogue and debate. When people apply logical principles to evaluate arguments, and are willing to engage in constructive debate and discussion, it can lead to better decision-making and greater understanding of different perspectives.\n\nFinally, logic can help us develop strategies for mitigating the influence of emotions on decision-making. This includes techniques such as examining the evidence objectively, considering the trade-offs involved, and seeking out alternative perspectives.\n\nOverall, while it is true that emotions and biases can often drive decision-making in the real world, logic and critical thinking can provide a valuable counterbalance to these influences, helping us to make more informed decisions and engage in more productive dialogue and debate.",
