You'll definitely get notified about upcoming sales and promotions.\n\nAs for checking out their spring collections, it's worth taking a look, but it depends on your needs and priorities. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros of checking out their spring collections:**\n\n* You'll get to see the latest styles and trends, which can help you plan your wardrobe updates for the season.\n* You might find some great pieces that you can wear now or later, depending on your personal style and the weather in your area.\n* Both Madewell and J.Crew are known for their high-quality clothing, so even if you don't find something on sale, you'll still get a sense of their latest offerings.\n\n**Cons of checking out their spring collections:**\n\n* You might not find any significant discounts or sales on the new collections, especially if they're just launching.\n* You could end up wanting to buy something that's not on sale, which might blow your budget.\n* If you're not looking to update your wardrobe right now, it's easy to get tempted by new arrivals and overspend.\n\n**Waiting for a bigger sale:**\n\n* You'll likely get a better discount on the spring collections if you wait for a sale or promotion.\n* You'll have more time to think about what you really need or want, which can help you make more intentional purchasing decisions.\n* You might be able to score a better deal on past-season styles or clearance items.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n* Do you need any specific pieces for the upcoming season, like a new pair of jeans or a lightweight jacket?\n* Are you looking to update your wardrobe with some trendy items, or do you prefer timeless, classic pieces?\n* How's your budget looking right now? Can you afford to splurge on something new, or do you need to wait for a sale?\n\nIf you do decide to check out their spring collections, try to focus on the items that really catch your eye and fit your needs. Make a mental (or actual) list of what you like, and then wait to see if they go on sale or if you can find a better deal elsewhere.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to prioritize your needs, budget, and personal style when shopping. Happy browsing, and I hope you find some great deals!",
