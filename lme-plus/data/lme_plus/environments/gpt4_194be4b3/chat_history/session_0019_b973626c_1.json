Think burgers, sandwiches, salads, and finger foods that are easy to share.\n2. **Italian or Mexican**: These cuisines are often crowd-pleasers and offer a variety of options to suit different tastes and dietary needs. Plus, they're often relatively affordable and can accommodate larger groups.\n3. **Trendy Brunch Spot**: If you're planning a daytime outing, a trendy brunch spot can be a great option. You can enjoy a leisurely meal together and take advantage of Instagram-worthy decor and outdoor seating (if available).\n4. **Restaurant with a Patio**: A restaurant with a patio or outdoor seating area can be a great choice, especially if the weather cooperates. It's a nice way to enjoy each other's company in a more relaxed setting.\n5. **Private Room or Area**: If you're expecting a larger group, consider a restaurant that can accommodate a private room or area. This can help you stay together and enjoy each other's company without feeling too crowded or overwhelmed.\n\nSome popular chain options that might fit the bill include:\n\n* The Cheesecake Factory\n* BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse\n* California Pizza Kitchen (CPK)\n* Olive Garden\n* On The Border\n\nOf course, you could also consider local, independent restaurants or eateries that are specific to your area.\n\nDo any of these suggestions resonate with you, or would you like more ideas?"

I'm happy to help you with some tips to improve your skills.\n\n**Timing and Rhythm:**\n\n1. **Practice to Music**: Listen to salsa music regularly and practice your basic steps, footwork, and body movement to the rhythm. This will help you develop your internal rhythm and timing.\n2. **Count the Music**: Learn to count the music in salsa rhythms (e.g., 1-2-3, 5-6-7, or 1-2-3-4, 5-6-7-8). Focus on the strong beats (1 and 5) and weak beats (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8).\n3. **Feel the Pulse**: Instead of focusing on individual beats, try to feel the overall pulse of the music. This will help you connect with the rhythm and timing more naturally.\n4. **Slow Down**: Practice to slower songs or slower tempos to focus on your technique, control, and timing. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually increase the speed.\n5. **Body Isolation**: Work on isolating different body parts (e.g., hips, arms, shoulders) to improve your overall movement and timing.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Take Private Lessons**: Consider taking private lessons with an experienced instructor to address specific areas of improvement, such as timing, leading/following, or styling.\n2. **Practice with a Partner**: Regularly practice with a partner to develop your leading and following skills, as well as your timing and coordination.\n3. **Focus on Footwork**: Mastering your footwork is essential for good timing and overall technique. Practice your basic steps, turns, and footwork patterns regularly.\n4. **Watch and Learn from Others**: Observe other dancers, both in class and at social events. Analyze their technique, timing, and movement, and incorporate what you learn into your own practice.\n5. **Relax and Have Fun**: Remember to enjoy the process of learning and improving. Don't be too hard on yourself, and focus on having fun while dancing.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n1. **YouTube Channels**: Check out popular salsa YouTube channels like Salsa Addiction, Salsa with Silvia, or DanceWithMe Studios for instructional videos and tips.\n2. **Apps and Online Courses**: Utilize apps like Salsa Dance Academy, Salsa Masterclass, or online courses like MasterClass or Codarts to supplement your learning.\n3. **Social Dance Events**: Attend social salsa events, parties, or congresses to practice with different partners, learn from others, and improve your timing and rhythm in a dynamic environment.\n\nRemember, improving your salsa dancing takes time, patience, and practice. Focus on building a strong foundation, and with consistent effort, you'll see progress and improvement over time.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these tips or areas you'd like to focus on?"
