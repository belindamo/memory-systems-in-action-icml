  "content": "The protein you choose can definitely elevate or change the flavor profile of your Thai Basil Stir-Fry. Here are some popular protein options that pair well with Thai Basil:\n\n**Chicken**: Chicken breast or thighs work well in Thai Basil Stir-Fry. It's a classic combination and a crowd-pleaser. You can marinate the chicken in a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and chili flakes before adding it to the stir-fry.\n\n**Tofu**: Extra-firm tofu is a great option for vegetarians and vegans. Press and drain the tofu before cutting it into small cubes. You can marinate the tofu in a mixture of soy sauce, lime juice, and chili flakes for added flavor.\n\n**Shrimp**: Shrimp is a popular protein in Thai cuisine, and it pairs well with the bold flavors of Thai Basil. You can use fresh or frozen shrimp, and add them to the stir-fry towards the end of cooking to prevent overcooking.\n\n**Pork**: Thinly sliced pork, such as pork loin or pork belly, can add a rich flavor to your Thai Basil Stir-Fry. You can marinate the pork in a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and chili flakes before adding it to the stir-fry.\n\n**Beef**: Beef can be used in Thai Basil Stir-Fry, but it's not as traditional as other proteins. You can use thinly sliced beef, such as ribeye or sirloin, and marinate it in a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and chili flakes.\n\n**Other Options**:\n\n* **Turkey**: Similar to chicken, turkey breast or thighs can be used in Thai Basil Stir-Fry.\n* **Lamb**: Lamb can add a strong, gamey flavor to your Thai Basil Stir-Fry. Use thinly sliced lamb, such as lamb shoulder or lamb loin.\n* **Vegetarian options**: If you want to skip meat altogether, you can use a variety of mushrooms, such as shiitake or cremini, or add extra vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, and broccoli.\n\n**Tips for Cooking Protein**:\n\n* **Marinate**: Marinating your protein in a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and chili flakes can add depth and flavor to your dish.\n* **Cook protein separately**: Cook your protein separately from the vegetables to prevent overcooking or undercooking.\n* **Add protein towards the end**: Add your cooked protein towards the end of the stir-fry to prevent it from becoming tough or dry.\n\nI hope that helps you decide on the perfect protein for your Thai Basil Stir-Fry!",
