  "content": "\"Crime Scene\" is a great choice! It's awesome that you've been loyal to the podcast since the beginning, and it's even more impressive that you're committed to catching up on old episodes. The hosts' dynamic can really make or break a podcast, and it sounds like \"Crime Scene\" has got it right.\n\nNow, about those hiking trails... I'm glad you're getting back into outdoor activities! As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, but I can suggest some ways for you to find great hiking trails in your area.\n\n1. **Google search**: Simply type \"best hiking trails near me\" or \"hiking trails in [your city/region]\" and see what comes up. You can filter the results by distance, difficulty level, and reviews.\n2. **AllTrails**: This website and app have a vast collection of hiking trails, complete with user reviews, photos, and detailed information about the trails. You can search for trails in your area and filter by factors like distance, elevation gain, and difficulty.\n3. **Local outdoor groups**: Look for local hiking or outdoor groups on social media platforms like Facebook or Meetup.com. These groups often organize hikes and outdoor activities, and you can connect with like-minded people who know the area.\n4. **National parks or recreation departments**: If you have national parks or recreation departments in your area, they usually have websites or visitor centers that provide information on hiking trails, difficulty levels, and any regulations.\n\nRemember to always prioritize safety, bring necessary gear, and check the weather forecast before heading out on a hike.\n\nWhat kind of yoga retreat did you attend, by the way? Was it a relaxing experience, and did you learn any new techniques or practices that you've incorporated into your daily routine?",
