  "content": "When it comes to essential oils, it's always better to start with a small amount and adjust to your liking. This is because essential oils can be very potent, and too much of a good thing can be overwhelming.\n\nFor a diffuser, a good starting point is 5-7 drops of essential oil per 100ml of water. This is a relatively gentle amount that can help you gauge your sensitivity to the oils. You can always increase the amount later if you find it's not strong enough for your liking.\n\nFor the \"Sleepy Time\" blend, you could start with a combination of:\n\n* 2-3 drops of lavender oil (for its calming and relaxing properties)\n* 2-3 drops of chamomile oil (for its soothing and calming effects)\n* 1-2 drops of vetiver oil (for its grounding and calming properties)\n\nRemember to adjust the amount based on your personal preferences and the size of your diffuser. If you're new to essential oils, it's better to start with a smaller amount and gradually increase as needed.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that essential oils can be quite strong, so it's a good idea to dilute them in a carrier oil if you plan to apply them topically. A general rule of thumb is to use 1-2% essential oil concentration, which means 1-2 drops of essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil.\n\nWhen using essential oils, it's essential (pun intended!) to listen to your body and adjust accordingly. If you experience any discomfort, irritation, or allergic reactions, stop using the oils and consult with a healthcare professional.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for you to try out the \"Sleepy Time\" blend!",
