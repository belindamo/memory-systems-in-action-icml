  "content": "I'd say my monthly income after taxes is around $4,500. My fixed expenses include rent which is $1,800, utilities around $150, car payment of $300, insurance of $200, and minimum credit card payments of $500. As for variable expenses, I'd say I spend around $500 on groceries, $300 on dining out, $200 on entertainment, and $500 on travel. I also spend a lot on clothing and accessories, as you know, like that Gucci handbag I just got. I'd like to prioritize saving up for a down payment on a house, so I'd like to allocate a significant amount towards that.",
