Crafting a good email or message is important to make a good impression and increase the likelihood of getting a response. Here are some tips to help you craft a good email or message:\n\n**1. Research and personalize**: Research the academic's work and interests, and personalize your email or message by mentioning something specific about their research or publications that resonates with you.\n\n**2. Introduce yourself**: Briefly introduce yourself, including your background, interests, and goals. This will help the academic understand your context and why you're reaching out.\n\n**3. Clearly state your purpose**: Clearly state your purpose for reaching out, e.g., seeking advice on preparing for a doctoral program in their field.\n\n**4.
