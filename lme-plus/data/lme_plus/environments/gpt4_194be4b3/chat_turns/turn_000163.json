  "content": "Pandemic is considered a moderately complex game, but it's still accessible to new players. The difficulty level is around 6-7 out of 10, with 10 being the most complex.\n\nIn Pandemic, you'll work together with your teammates to stop the spread of diseases, treat infected areas, and find cures. The game has a few key mechanics that might take some time to get used to:\n\n1. **Action points**: Each player has a limited number of actions they can take on their turn, which adds a layer of strategy and resource management.\n2. **Infection deck**: The game has a deck of cards that represents the spread of diseases, which can be unpredictable and challenging to manage.\n3. **Cooperative gameplay**: You'll need to communicate and work together with your teammates to succeed, which can be a new experience for players who are used to competitive games.\n\nHowever, the game comes with a beginner-friendly tutorial, and the rules are well-explained. If you're new to cooperative games, Pandemic is a great introduction to the genre. The game also has a gentle learning curve, and you can start with the easier difficulty level and gradually move to more challenging modes as you become more comfortable with the game.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could start with a simpler cooperative game like Forbidden Island or Forbidden Desert, which are both great introductions to cooperative gameplay. They're easy to learn, and you can play them with 2-4 players.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and be willing to learn!",
