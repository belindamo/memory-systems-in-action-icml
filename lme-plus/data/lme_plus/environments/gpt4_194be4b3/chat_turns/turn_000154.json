  "content": "It is understandable to feel disappointed if Disney's handling of the Star Wars franchise does not live up to one's expectations. Long-time fans of the original trilogy may feel that the new movies lack the same sense of wonder and adventure, and that the storylines have become repetitive. Additionally, a focus on profitability may create a perception that the franchise is being rushed out instead of focused on in-depth and powerful storytelling. However, it is worth noting that some fans do enjoy the new movies and appreciate the new directions that the franchise has taken. Nonetheless, it is important for Disney to continue to listen to fan feedback and incorporate constructive criticism into its storytelling moving forward.",
