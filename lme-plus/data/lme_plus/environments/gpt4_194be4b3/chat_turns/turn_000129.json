Here's my revised response:\n\nI'm not really sure about the specifics of my credit card rewards program. I just know that I earn points for every dollar I spend, and I can redeem those points for cashback or travel rewards. I think I earn 2% cashback on groceries and 1% on everything else. I'm not really sure how to redeem my points or what the minimum redemption amount is. Can you help me understand how to get the most out of my credit card rewards program?",
