Amy Poehler's humor and storytelling are infectious, and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud and nodding along in agreement.\n\nRegarding podcasts, I've got some excellent recommendations that offer a serialized storytelling experience, focusing on true crime, mystery, and history themes:\n\n1. **Serial**: A pioneering true crime podcast that investigates a single case per season. The storytelling is meticulous, and the narrative is engaging and suspenseful.\n2. **S-Town**: A true crime podcast that's more like a novel, with a complex, layered story that unfolds over seven episodes. It's a fascinating exploration of small-town secrets and mysteries.\n3. **My Favorite Murder**: A true crime comedy podcast (yes, you read that right!) that's both informative and entertaining. Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark share their own personal experiences and discuss famous and lesser-known cases.\n4. **Lore**: A podcast that delves into the darker side of history and folklore, exploring strange and unusual stories from the past. Aaron Mahnke's narration is captivating, and the production quality is top-notch.\n5. **Hardcore History**: A history podcast that's not for the faint of heart. Dan Carlin's in-depth explorations of historical events are engaging, thought-provoking, and often disturbing.\n6. **Crime Junkie**: A true crime podcast hosted by two self-proclaimed \"crime junkies\" who dive deep into famous and lesser-known cases. The podcast has a strong focus on victim advocacy and awareness.\n7. **The Dollop**: A comedy-history podcast that explores strange and unusual stories from the past. The hosts, Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds, have a great dynamic, and their humor adds a lighthearted touch to the often-dark stories they cover.\n8. **The Black Tapes**: A serialized fiction podcast that follows a journalist investigating paranormal activity. The storytelling is engaging, and the production quality is excellent, making it feel like you're listening to a radio drama.\n\nThese podcasts offer a mix of true crime, mystery, and history, with a focus on storytelling and atmosphere.
