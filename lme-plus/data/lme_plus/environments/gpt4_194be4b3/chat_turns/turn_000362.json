  "content": "I think there might be some confusion here! As we discussed earlier, the Korg B1 is a digital piano, not an acoustic piano, so it doesn't require the same type of maintenance as an acoustic piano.\n\nSince you're experiencing issues with sticking keys, I'd recommend contacting Korg's customer support or a authorized Korg dealer for assistance. They can help diagnose the problem and provide guidance on how to resolve it.\n\nIt's unlikely that a professional piano technician would be needed for a digital piano like the Korg B1. However, if you're not comfortable troubleshooting the issue yourself, you could consider consulting with a professional who specializes in electronic keyboard and digital piano repair.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general troubleshooting steps you can take:\n\n1. **Turn it off and on again**: Sometimes, simply restarting the piano can resolve the issue.\n2. **Clean the keys**: Dirt, dust, and other debris can cause keys to stick. Try cleaning the keys with a soft cloth and gentle cleaning solution.\n3. **Check for firmware updates**: Ensure that your Korg B1 is running the latest firmware. Updates can often resolve issues and improve performance.\n4. **Consult the user manual**: Refer to the user manual or online documentation to see if there are any troubleshooting steps specific to your issue.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there's a hardware problem that requires professional attention. In that case, contacting Korg's customer support or a authorized dealer would be the next step.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance and troubleshooting procedures to ensure your digital piano continues to function properly.",
