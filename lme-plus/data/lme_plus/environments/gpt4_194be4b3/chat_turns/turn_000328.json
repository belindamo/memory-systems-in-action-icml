  "content": "Chicken breast is a fantastic protein for Thai Basil Stir-Fry, and marinating it will definitely help to add flavor and tenderize it.\n\n**Cooking Chicken Breast to Perfection:**\n\nTo achieve the perfect texture, you'll want to cook the chicken breast to a safe internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Here are some tips to help you cook the chicken breast to perfection:\n\n1. **Slice the chicken thinly**: Slice the chicken breast into thin strips, about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick. This will help the chicken cook quickly and evenly.\n2. **Cook in a hot wok or skillet**: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat, then add a small amount of oil (about 1-2 tablespoons). Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until it reaches the desired internal temperature.\n3. **Don't overcrowd the pan**: Cook the chicken in batches if necessary, to prevent overcrowding the pan. This will ensure that the chicken cooks evenly and prevents steam from building up, which can make the chicken tough.\n4. **Don't overcook**: Cook the chicken until it reaches the safe internal temperature, but avoid overcooking it. Overcooking can make the chicken dry and tough.\n5. **Let it rest**: Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes. This will help the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender and juicy.\n\n**Alternative Cooking Methods:**\n\nIf you prefer, you can also cook the chicken breast in a different way, such as:\n\n* **Grilling**: Grill the chicken breast over medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes per side, or until it reaches the desired internal temperature.\n* **Baking**: Bake the chicken breast in a preheated oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, or until it reaches the desired internal temperature.\n* **Pan-searing**: Pan-sear the chicken breast in a hot skillet with a small amount of oil, then finish cooking it in the oven.\n\nI hope that helps you cook the perfect chicken breast for your Thai Basil Stir-Fry!",
