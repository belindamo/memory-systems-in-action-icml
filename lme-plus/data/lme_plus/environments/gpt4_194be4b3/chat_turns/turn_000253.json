Meeting Elsa will surely be a highlight of her birthday celebration!\n\nAnd haha, I think we've had this conversation before! You mentioned earlier that you went to the Spring Break Bash at Knott's Berry Farm and had an amazing strawberry funnel cake. I'm glad you enjoyed it! Funnel cakes are always a great treat at amusement parks.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you and your family have a fantastic time at Disneyland, and your niece has a birthday to remember!",
