  "content": "I've been meaning to read more non-fiction books about the entertainment industry, especially old Hollywood. I've heard great things about \"Hollywood Babylon\" by Kenneth Anger, so I might add that to my list. I've also been listening to audiobooks during my daily walks, and I've been enjoying \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. Do you have any recommendations for more audiobooks that are engaging and easy to listen to?",
