  "content": "DM Ben: Ah, I see! I apologize for the confusion earlier. Matt, as you are dragged under the water by the kraken, you find yourself in a desperate fight for survival. You feel the pressure of the water crushing your body and the kraken's tentacles squeezing the air out of your lungs. But as you begin to lose consciousness, you remember a crucial fact: you are a skilled hunter, and you know how to hold your breath for a long time underwater.\n\nRoll a Constitution saving throw to see if you can withstand the pressure and survive.\n\nMatt rolls a 15.\n\nDM Ben: You manage to hold your breath and keep your wits about you as the kraken drags you deeper and deeper into the depths. You can see the blurry outlines of the kraken's tentacles flailing around you, and you feel your body being twisted and turned in all directions. But you are a hunter, and you know how to survive in the wilderness. You focus on your instincts and your training, and you manage to find a weak spot in the kraken's grip.\n\nRoll a Strength check to see if you can break free.\n\nMatt rolls an 18.\n\nDM Ben: You use all your strength and leverage to pry the kraken's tentacle open, and you swim upwards with all your might. You can feel the pressure of the water easing as you get closer to the surface, and you see a faint light shining from above. Finally, with a burst of effort, you break the surface of the water and gasp for air.\n\nMatt: (gasping for breath) \"I made it...I can't believe I made it!\"\n\nDM Ben: You see James and Jacob standing on the beach, their weapons drawn and their faces filled with relief.\n\nJames: \"Matt! You're alive!\"\n\nJacob: \"Praise be to the gods! I thought we had lost you.\"\n\nDM Ben: You manage to swim to shore, your body battered and bruised, but still alive. You collapse on the sand, feeling the warmth of the sun on your face. You survived a deadly encounter with a kraken, and you know that you are now stronger and more resilient than ever before. What do you do next?",
