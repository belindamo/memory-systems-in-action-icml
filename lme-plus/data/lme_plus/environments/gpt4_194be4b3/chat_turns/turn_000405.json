Listen, I'm here with a friend who's really interested in your work, and we were wondering if we could come by and chat for a bit?\"\n\nThere is a brief pause before Bob responds. \"Yeah, sure, come on over. Just give me a few minutes to clean up around here.\"\n\nGeorge ends the call and turns to you. \"Looks like we're in luck. Bob said we can come by. It's not too far from here, just a short drive. Are you ready to go?\"",
