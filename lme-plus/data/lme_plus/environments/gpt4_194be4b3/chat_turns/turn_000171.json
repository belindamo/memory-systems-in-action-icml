Outmaneuvering opponents in Settlers of Catan can be very satisfying, and it's a big part of the game's appeal.\n\nAs for Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert, they're both excellent choices! They're part of a series of cooperative games designed by Matt Leacock, and they're known for being easy to learn, yet challenging to win.\n\nForbidden Island is a great introduction to cooperative games, and it's a fantastic choice for new players. The game is all about working together to retrieve four treasures from an island that's sinking, and it's a lot of fun. It's a relatively short game, and it's easy to learn, but it still requires communication and strategy to win.\n\nForbidden Desert is the sequel to Forbidden Island, and it builds upon the same mechanics. Instead of an island, you're stranded in a desert, and you need to work together to survive the harsh conditions and find a way out. It's a bit more challenging than Forbidden Island, but it's still a great game for new players.\n\nBoth games are highly rated, and they're great examples of cooperative gameplay. They're also relatively short, so you can play multiple games in a single session. If you're new to cooperative games, I think you'll find that they're a great way to experience the genre.\n\nSince you're interested in exploring different genres, I'd also recommend checking out other types of games, like worker placement games (e.g., Carcassonne, Agricola), deck-building games (e.g., Dominion, Ascension), or engine-building games (e.g., Splendor, 7 Wonders). There are so many great games out there, and it's always exciting to discover new ones!\n\nWhat do you think about trying out a game like Pandemic, which I mentioned earlier? It's a cooperative game where you work together to stop the spread of diseases and save the world. It's a bit more complex than Forbidden Island or Forbidden Desert, but it's still a great game for new players.",
