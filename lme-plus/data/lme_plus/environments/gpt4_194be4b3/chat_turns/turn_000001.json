Stick to the facts: One of the most important ways for media outlets to maintain their credibility is to stick to the facts. This means verifying information before publishing it and being transparent about sources and evidence. In a time of fake news, it's more important than ever to be accurate and truthful.\n\n2. Be transparent: Media outlets should be open and honest about their methods and practices. They should make it clear to their audience how they gather and verify information, and provide context for their reporting. By being open and transparent, media outlets can gain trust from their audience.\n\n3. Avoid sensationalism: Sensationalism is a common tactic in media coverage, but it can often lead to exaggeration and misinformation. Media outlets should avoid sensationalism and instead focus on providing accurate and balanced coverage.\n\n4. Acknowledge biases: Everyone has biases, including journalists and media outlets. Acknowledging these biases and taking steps to mitigate them can help maintain credibility. Media outlets should strive for a diverse newsroom and be open to feedback and criticism.\n\n5. Fact-check and correct mistakes: Mistakes are inevitable, but it's important for media outlets to take responsibility for them. This means fact-checking and correcting mistakes as soon as possible. Corrections should be made prominently and transparently, and media outlets should apologize if necessary.\n\nOverall, maintaining credibility in the era of fake news requires a commitment to accuracy, transparency, balance, and accountability. By following these principles, media outlets can earn the trust of their audience and continue to report on sensitive and contested issues with integrity.",
