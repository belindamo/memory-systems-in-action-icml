Think burgers, sandwiches, salads, and finger foods that are easy to share.\n2. **Italian or Mexican**: These cuisines are often crowd-pleasers and offer a variety of options to suit different tastes and dietary needs. Plus, they're often relatively affordable and can accommodate larger groups.\n3. **Trendy Brunch Spot**: If you're planning a daytime outing, a trendy brunch spot can be a great option. You can enjoy a leisurely meal together and take advantage of Instagram-worthy decor and outdoor seating (if available).\n4. **Restaurant with a Patio**: A restaurant with a patio or outdoor seating area can be a great choice, especially if the weather cooperates. It's a nice way to enjoy each other's company in a more relaxed setting.\n5. **Private Room or Area**: If you're expecting a larger group, consider a restaurant that can accommodate a private room or area. This can help you stay together and enjoy each other's company without feeling too crowded or overwhelmed.\n\nSome popular chain options that might fit the bill include:\n\n* The Cheesecake Factory\n* BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse\n* California Pizza Kitchen (CPK)\n* Olive Garden\n* On The Border\n\nOf course, you could also consider local, independent restaurants or eateries that are specific to your area.\n\nDo any of these suggestions resonate with you, or would you like more ideas?",
