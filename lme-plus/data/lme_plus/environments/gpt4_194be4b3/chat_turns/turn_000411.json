  "content": "As you and George Knapp drive towards United Nuclear, you take in the beautiful desert scenery of the region. You arrive at the facility, which looks like a warehouse on the outside. You park the car and approach the entrance.\n\nAs you walk towards the entrance, a security guard stops you and asks for identification. You explain that you're here to see Bob Lazar, and show him the picture of the rod as proof of your connection to the UFO research community.\n\nThe security guard scrutinizes the picture for a moment, then nods and lets you through. You and George enter the warehouse, and you notice that there are several people milling about, working on various projects.\n\nYou ask one of the workers if they know where Bob is, and they point you towards a door at the back of the warehouse. You thank them and walk towards the door.\n\nAs you approach the door, you see a man with thick black hair and glasses emerge from it. He looks up and sees you, then smiles and walks over.\n\n\"Hey there,\" he says, extending his hand. \"I'm Bob Lazar. What can I do for you?\"",
