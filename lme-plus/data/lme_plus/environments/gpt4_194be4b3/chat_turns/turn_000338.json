Here are some key features to consider and a general idea of what to expect in terms of price:\n\n**Key Features to Consider:**\n\n1. **UV-C wavelength:** Look for a UV light that emits UV-C light at 254 nanometers, which is the most effective wavelength for killing bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.\n2. **UV intensity:** A higher UV intensity (measured in milliwatts or \u03bcW) will provide faster treatment times and more effective killing of microorganisms.\n3. **Treatment time:** Consider a UV light with a treatment time of 30 seconds to 1 minute, which is a good balance between effectiveness and convenience.\n4. **Battery life:** Choose a UV light with a battery life that meets your needs, especially if you're planning a multi-day trip.\n5. **Water volume:** Consider a UV light that can treat a sufficient volume of water for your needs, typically 1-2 liters.\n6. **Certifications:** Look for UV lights that are certified by reputable organizations such as NSF International or the Water Quality Association.\n7. **Durability:** Choose a UV light with a durable construction and a waterproof design.\n8. **Size and weight:** Consider a UV light that is compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry on your hikes.\n\n**Price Range:**\n\n* **Basic UV lights:** $20-$50 - These models usually have a shorter battery life and may not be as effective against all microorganisms.\n* **Mid-range UV lights:** $50-$100 - These models offer a good balance of effectiveness, battery life, and price.\n* **High-end UV lights:** $100-$200 - These models often feature advanced technology, longer battery life, and higher UV intensities.\n* **Premium UV lights:** $200-$300 - These models typically offer top-of-the-line features, high UV intensities, and long battery life.\n\n**Recommended Brands:**\n\n* SteriPen\n* LifeStraw\n* MSR\n* Sawyer Products\n* Katadyn\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* **Read reviews:** Check online reviews from other hikers and outdoor enthusiasts to get a sense of the UV light's performance in real-world conditions.\n* **Check the warranty:** Look for a UV light with a good warranty that covers repairs or replacements.\n* **Consider a UV light with a built-in timer:** This feature can help ensure you treat the water for the correct amount of time.\n\nBy considering these factors and features, you can find a UV light that meets your needs and provides reliable water treatment for your hikes.",
