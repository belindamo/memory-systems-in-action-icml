  "content": "I think Disney's approach to the Star Wars franchise has been disappointing. The new movies just don't capture the same sense of wonder and adventure that the original trilogy did. Plus, it feels like they're just rehashing the same storylines over and over again. It's all about making a quick buck, and it's really disheartening for long-time fans like me.",
