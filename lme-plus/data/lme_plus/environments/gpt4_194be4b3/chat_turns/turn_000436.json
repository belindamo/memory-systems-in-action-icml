I'll make sure to communicate with my coach, be open-minded, and focus on the process. I'm looking forward to improving my backhand slice and overall game. And, of course, I'll keep in mind that I've been playing in a weekly doubles league on Thursdays with my friend Alex, so I'll be sure to apply what I learn to our matches.",
