As the user, I'd like to continue the conversation. \n\nI'm really interested in exploring more poetry anthologies that feature works by women of color. The ones you recommended from the past 5-10 years are great, but I'd love to know more about the editors and the themes they explore. Can you tell me more about the editors of these anthologies and what inspired them to curate these collections?",
