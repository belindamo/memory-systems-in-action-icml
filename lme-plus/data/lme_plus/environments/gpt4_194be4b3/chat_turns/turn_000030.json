  "content": "I've actually been trying to establish a consistent bedtime routine for the past two months, and it's been helping me wind down before sleep.

I've also started reading a book for at least 20 minutes before lights out, which has helped me reduce my screen time. Do you think I could use essential oils in addition to my herbal tea to enhance my relaxation?",
