Exam anxiety can be a challenging issue to overcome, but with the right resources and support, you can learn to manage it. Here are some additional tips that may be helpful:\n\n1. Identify the source of your anxiety: It's important to understand what is causing your anxiety so that you can take specific steps to address it.

Talk to your teacher or counselor, or consider seeing a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders. They can help you develop a personalized plan for managing your exam anxiety.\n\nRemember that overcoming exam anxiety is a process that takes time and effort.
