  "content": "It is true that with such a valuable property as Star Wars, there is naturally a strong focus on profitability. However, it is also possible that the quality of the storytelling has been impacted by this profit-driven approach. While it may be profitable to produce a large quantity of Star Wars content, fans may feel disappointed if the stories and characters are not given the attention and care they deserve. Additionally, selling merchandise can also detract from the authenticity of the story and characters, as marketing considerations may take priority over creative choices. In the end, it is up to each individual viewer to decide whether they believe that Disney's approach to the Star Wars franchise has hit the right balance between profitability and quality storytelling.",
