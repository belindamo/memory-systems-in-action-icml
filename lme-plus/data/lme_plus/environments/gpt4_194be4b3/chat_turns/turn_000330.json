Here are some tips to help you cook the vegetables to perfection:\n\n1. **Choose the right vegetables**: Select a variety of colorful vegetables that cook at different rates, such as bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, and Thai basil. This will ensure that some vegetables are tender while others still have a bit of crunch.\n2. **Cut vegetables into uniform sizes**: Cut the vegetables into uniform sizes so that they cook evenly. For example, slice bell peppers into thin strips, and cut broccoli into florets.\n3. **Cook in batches**: Cook the vegetables in batches, starting with the harder vegetables like carrots and broccoli, and then adding the softer vegetables like bell peppers and Thai basil.\n4. **Use high heat**: Stir-fry the vegetables over high heat to quickly cook them and preserve their texture.\n5. **Don't overcook**: Cook the vegetables until they're tender-crisp, but avoid overcooking them. Overcooking can make the vegetables mushy and unappetizing.\n6. **Add aromatics first**: Add aromatics like garlic and ginger to the pan before adding the vegetables to add flavor and aroma.\n7. **Use the right oil**: Use a neutral-tasting oil like vegetable or peanut oil to cook the vegetables, as they have a high smoke point and won't burn easily.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Don't overcrowd the pan**: Cook the vegetables in batches to prevent overcrowding the pan, which can lead to steaming instead of stir-frying.\n* **Stir constantly**: Stir the vegetables constantly to ensure they cook evenly and prevent burning.\n* **Add a splash of liquid**: Add a splash of liquid like soy sauce or oyster sauce (if using) towards the end of cooking to add flavor and moisture to the vegetables.\n\nI hope these tips help you cook the perfect vegetables for your Thai Basil Stir-Fry!",
