I'd be happy to help you pack wisely and avoid overpacking.\n\n**Essential Gear:**\n\n1. **Navigation tools:** Map, compass, GPS device or a GPS-enabled smartphone with a hiking app (and a paper map as a backup).\n2. **First aid kit:** A basic kit should include items like bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and any medications you may need.\n3. **Hydration:** Water bottle or hydration bladder, and a water treatment method (e.g., water filter, purification tablets, or UV light).\n4. **Shelter and warmth:** Lightweight tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, and a warm hat.\n5. **Clothing:** Pack layers for varying weather conditions, including a base layer, insulating layer, and waterproof jacket. Don't forget extra socks and underwear.\n6. **Footwear:** Sturdy hiking boots or trail running shoes with good tread and ankle support.\n7. **Lighting:** Headlamp or flashlight, and extra batteries.\n8. **Fire starter:** Matches, lighter, or a fire starter kit (if you plan to have a campfire).\n9. **Food and snacks:** Pack energy-rich foods, trail mix, and a water bottle or hydration bladder.\n10. **Personal hygiene items:** Biodegradable soap, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer.\n\n**Tips to Avoid Overpacking:**\n\n1. **Plan your meals:** Decide on your meals and snacks beforehand to avoid packing too much food.\n2. **Pack multipurpose items:** Choose gear that serves multiple purposes, like a jacket with a built-in hood or a sleeping bag with a built-in pad.\n3. **Limit luxuries:** Be honest with yourself about what you really need vs. what's nice to have.\n4. **Pack clothes that can be layered:** This will help you adjust to changing temperatures and reduce the amount of clothing you need to bring.\n5. **Use a packing list:** Write down everything you plan to bring and check items off as you pack them to avoid forgetting anything important.\n6. **Pack gear that can be easily replaced:** If you're near a town or a store, you can always purchase items you need instead of carrying them with you.\n\n**Snack Tips:**\n\n1. **Pack snacks that are high in energy and low in weight:** Dried fruits, nuts, and energy bars are great options.\n2. **Avoid perishable items:** Fresh fruits, sandwiches, and dairy products can spoil quickly and add weight to your pack.\n3. **Buy snacks at a local store:** As you experienced, it's often easier to buy snacks at a local store near the trailhead instead of carrying them from home.\n\nRemember to check the weather forecast and adjust your packing list accordingly. It's also a good idea to check with local park rangers or trailheads for any specific regulations or recommendations.\n\nHave a safe and enjoyable hike!",
