  "content": "The North Cascades National Park is a stunning destination! I'd be happy to help you with route suggestions.\n\nFirst, congratulations on your solo trip to San Francisco! That's a great experience to have under your belt. The drive from Portland to San Francisco is a beautiful one, and Ashland is a lovely stopover.\n\nFor your trip to North Cascades National Park, I'll assume you're starting from Portland again. Here are a few route suggestions:\n\n**Option 1: The Direct Route**\n\n* From Portland, take I-5 North towards Seattle (approx. 3 hours)\n* Continue on I-5 North and merge onto US-2 East towards Wenatchee (approx. 2 hours)\n* From Wenatchee, take WA-20 East towards North Cascades National Park (approx. 1.5 hours)\n\n**Option 2: The Scenic Route**\n\n* From Portland, take US-26 East towards Mount Hood (approx. 1.5 hours)\n* Continue on US-26 East and merge onto OR-35 North towards Hood River (approx. 1 hour)\n* Cross the Columbia River on I-84 East and enter Washington state\n* Take US-2 East towards Wenatchee (approx. 2 hours)\n* From Wenatchee, take WA-20 East towards North Cascades National Park (approx. 1.5 hours)\n\n**Option 3: The Coastal Route**\n\n* From Portland, take US-30 West towards Astoria (approx. 2 hours)\n* Continue on US-101 North along the Oregon coast towards Aberdeen, WA (approx. 2.5 hours)\n* From Aberdeen, take US-12 East towards Yakima (approx. 2 hours)\n* From Yakima, take US-97 North towards Wenatchee (approx. 1 hour)\n* From Wenatchee, take WA-20 East towards North Cascades National Park (approx. 1.5 hours)\n\nAll of these routes will take you to the park's western entrance, which is the most accessible point. Keep in mind that the scenic route and coastal route may take longer due to the winding roads and potential traffic.\n\nBefore you go, make sure to:\n\n* Check the park's website for any road closures or construction updates\n* Fill up on gas and snacks, as services can be limited in the park\n* Bring layers, as the weather in the North Cascades can be unpredictable\n* Consider downloading the park's visitor guide and map to help plan your trip\n\nWhich route are you leaning towards, or do you have any specific preferences (e.g., scenery, time, attractions along the way)?",
