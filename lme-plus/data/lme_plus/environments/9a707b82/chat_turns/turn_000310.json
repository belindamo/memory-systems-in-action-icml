For example, the half-life of amoxicillin is around 1-2 hours, while azithromycin's half-life is around 2-4 days.\n2. **Dosage and frequency**: The amount and frequency of antibiotic doses you took can impact how long the drug stays in your system. A higher dose or more frequent dosing can lead to a longer elimination period.\n3. **Individual factors**: Your body's metabolism, liver and kidney function, and overall health can influence how quickly antibiotics are eliminated.\n\nIn general, most antibiotics are fully eliminated from the body within 7-10 days after the last dose. However, some antibiotics can take longer to clear. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* **Penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin)**: 1-2 days\n* **Macrolides (e.g., azithromycin)**: 2-4 days\n* **Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)**: 3-5 days\n* **Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline)**: 3-5 days\n* **Cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin)**: 2-4 days\n\nConsidering you finished your antibiotics on September 1st, it's possible that the medication is no longer in your system. However, the lingering effects of antibiotics can still impact your body for a few weeks.\n\nThe cough you're experiencing could be related to the antibiotics, but it's also possible that it's caused by another factor, such as:\n\n* **Antibiotic-associated diarrhea**: This can lead to changes in your gut microbiome, which may trigger a cough.\n* **Post-antibiotic syndrome**: Some people experience a lingering cough, fatigue, or other symptoms after completing a course of antibiotics.\n* **Underlying infection or condition**: The antibiotics may not have fully cleared the underlying infection, or you may have developed a new infection.\n* **Other factors**: Allergies, acid reflux, or environmental irritants could also be contributing to your cough.\n\nIt's a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of action. They can help you identify the underlying cause of your cough and recommend appropriate treatment.",
