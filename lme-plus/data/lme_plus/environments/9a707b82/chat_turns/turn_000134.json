The caramelized sugar on top will add a nice textural element.\n2. **Matcha Tiramisu**: Build on your espresso powder experience with a Japanese-inspired dessert.

This unique flavor combination is sure to impress.\n4. **Salted Caramel Chocolate Tart**: Take your chocolate game to the next level with a rich, salted caramel filling in a flaky pastry crust.
