  "content": "I love it! A relaxed and casual coastal vibe sounds perfect for a San Diego wedding. You can incorporate elements like driftwood, sea glass, or nautical accents to give your decor a beachy feel without going overboard (pun intended!).\n\nSince you're still in the process of venue hunting, I'd recommend considering a spot that already has a natural beauty to it, like a beachside park, a garden with ocean views, or even a private estate with a coastal feel. This will make it easier to incorporate your desired aesthetic and reduce the amount of decor you need to bring in.\n\nWhen you do visit the venues in person, pay attention to the natural light, the layout, and the overall ambiance. Ask yourself: Does it feel like the right fit for your relaxed and casual vibe? Are there any specific features that stand out to you, like a beautiful tree, a stunning view, or a charming patio area?\n\nIn terms of decor, you might consider using a mix of natural elements like succulents, eucalyptus, or ferns to bring in that coastal feel. You could also incorporate soft, calming colors like blues, whites, and sandy neutrals to evoke the feeling of the ocean.\n\nWhat's your favorite part about planning your wedding so far? Is there anything that's been the most exciting or challenging for you?",
