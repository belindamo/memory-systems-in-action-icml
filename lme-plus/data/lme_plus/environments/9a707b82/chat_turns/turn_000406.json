  "content": "It is recommended to start with a short daily practice of about 20-30 minutes, and gradually increase the length of your practice as you feel comfortable. The key is to be consistent and to find a balance that works for you. It is better to have a daily practice of a shorter duration that you can maintain consistently, rather than trying to practice for a long time and then becoming inconsistent. It is also important to listen to your body and mind, and to take breaks or reduce the length of your practice if needed. Ultimately, the goal is to cultivate a regular and consistent practice that brings you peace, clarity, and understanding. May you find joy and benefit in your practice.",
