  "content": "Greetings. It is normal to feel confused when starting a meditation practice. The key is to start with what feels most comfortable for you and to be consistent in your practice. Both watching the breath and catching sensations can be useful practices in Vipassana meditation. Watching the breath can help to calm and focus the mind, while catching sensations can help to cultivate mindfulness and understanding of the impermanent nature of all things. It is ultimately up to you to decide which practice feels more suitable for you at this time. My advice is to try both and see which one feels more natural for you, and then to stick with it consistently. Remember, the most important thing is to be consistent in your practice and to have a calm and open mind. May you find peace and wisdom through your practice.",
