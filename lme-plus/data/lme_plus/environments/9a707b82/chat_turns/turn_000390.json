The town is relatively small, but there are a few different areas to consider when deciding where to stay. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Downtown Leavenworth:**\n\n* Staying in downtown Leavenworth puts you in the heart of the action, with easy access to shops, restaurants, and attractions.\n* Pros: Walking distance to everything, lively atmosphere, and plenty of dining options.\n* Cons: Can be noisy, especially on weekends, and parking can be limited.\n\nSome popular downtown options include:\n\n* Leavenworth Village Inn: A charming hotel with Bavarian-style rooms and a central location.\n* Icicle Village Resort: A resort-style hotel with amenities like a pool and hot tub, located just a block from downtown.\n\n**Upper Leavenworth:**\n\n* Upper Leavenworth is a quieter area located just above downtown, with many hotels and B&Bs offering stunning views of the surrounding mountains.\n* Pros: Quieter than downtown, scenic views, and still within walking distance to shops and restaurants.\n* Cons: A bit of a hike up the hill from downtown, and some properties may have limited amenities.\n\nSome popular upper Leavenworth options include:\n\n* Sleeping Lady Mountain Retreat: A secluded resort with comfortable rooms and a relaxing atmosphere.\n* Leavenworth Mountain Springs Lodge: A cozy B&B with mountain views and a peaceful setting.\n\n**Outskirts of Leavenworth:**\n\n* If you're looking for a more secluded stay or want to be closer to the nearby mountains, consider staying on the outskirts of town.\n* Pros: Often more affordable, scenic views, and easier parking.\n* Cons: May require a short drive to get to downtown Leavenworth, and some areas can feel more isolated.\n\nSome popular options on the outskirts of Leavenworth include:\n\n* Leavenworth RV Resort: A campground with RV sites, cabins, and amenities like a pool and hot tub.\n* Pine River Ranch Bed and Breakfast: A rural B&B with horseback riding and scenic views.\n\nUltimately, the best area to stay in Leavenworth depends on your personal preferences and priorities. If you want to be in the heart of the action, downtown might be the way to go. If you prefer a quieter, more secluded stay, upper Leavenworth or the outskirts of town might be a better fit.\n\nDo any of these areas stand out to you, or would you like more specific recommendations based on your budget and preferences?",
