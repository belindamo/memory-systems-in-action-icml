  "content": "Excellent choice on the matcha tiramisu and salted caramel chocolate tart! They'll provide a nice contrast to each other in terms of texture and flavor.\n\nFor a savory dish to complement your sweet treats, I'd recommend something with bright, fresh flavors to cut through the richness of the desserts. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken**: Marinate chicken breasts in a mixture of lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and herbs like thyme and rosemary. Grill to perfection and serve with a side of roasted vegetables or a light salad.\n2. **Pan-Seared Scallops with Citrus-Ginger Beurre Blanc**: Scallops pair beautifully with the sweetness of desserts. A citrus-ginger beurre blanc sauce will add a nice brightness to the dish, cutting through the richness of the scallops.\n3. **Roasted Vegetable Tart with Goat Cheese**: A savory tart can be a great contrast to the sweet treats. Roast a variety of vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes, and top a flaky crust with them, along with crumbled goat cheese and fresh herbs.\n4. **Grilled Asparagus with Lemon-Parmesan Vinaigrette**: Asparagus is a natural pairing with rich desserts. Grill it to perfection and serve with a light, zesty vinaigrette made with lemon juice, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese.\n5. **Herbed Quinoa Salad with Grilled Chicken and Citrus**: Cook quinoa and let it cool, then mix it with chopped fresh herbs like parsley, basil, and mint. Add diced grilled chicken, cherry tomatoes, and a squeeze of citrus juice for a refreshing, light salad.\n6. **Roasted Beet Salad with Walnuts and Feta**: Beets are a great match for sweet desserts, and their earthy flavor pairs well with the brightness of citrus. Roast beets, then top them with crumbled feta cheese, toasted walnuts, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze.\n7. **Grilled Shrimp Skewers with Spicy Mango Salsa**: Shrimp are a great protein to pair with sweet desserts, and a spicy mango salsa will add a nice kick to the dish. Simply grill the shrimp and serve with the salsa and a side of crusty bread or grilled vegetables.\n\nThese ideas should provide a nice balance to your sweet treats. You can't go wrong with a classic grilled chicken or scallops, but if you want to offer something a bit more adventurous, the roasted vegetable tart or herbed quinoa salad could be great options.",
