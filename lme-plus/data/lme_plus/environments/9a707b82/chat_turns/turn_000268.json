Please follow along:\n\n**Step 1: Gather information**\n\n* Think about all the online shopping platforms you frequently use (e.g., Amazon, Zara, ASOS, eBay, etc.).\n* Make a list of these platforms and any login credentials you might need to access your order history.\n* Check your email inbox and spam folder for order confirmations, shipping updates, and receipts from online purchases.\n\n**Step 2: Collect order history**\n\n* Log in to each platform and access your order history or purchase history section.\n* Take note of the following information for each order:\n\t+ Date of purchase\n\t+ Item(s) purchased\n\t+ Total cost (including shipping and taxes)\n\t+ Any discounts or promo codes used\n* You can either write this information down in a notebook or create a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel) to organize your data.\n\n**Step 3: Categorize and analyze**\n\n* Group your purchases by category (e.g., clothing, electronics, home goods, etc.).\n* Calculate the total amount spent in each category.\n* Identify any patterns or areas where you might be overspending.\n\n**Step 4: Set a budget and goals**\n\n* Based on your analysis, set a realistic budget for online shopping.\n* Determine what you want to achieve with your new budget (e.g., reduce spending by 20%, save money for a specific goal, etc.).\n* Consider setting up a separate savings account or using an app like Qapital or Digit to help you reach your goals.\n\n**Step 5: Track going forward**\n\n* Going forward, make it a habit to log each online purchase in your spreadsheet or notebook.\n* Set reminders to review your spending regularly (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to ensure you're staying on track.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* Consider using browser extensions like CamelCamelCamel (for Amazon) or Keepa (for multiple platforms) to track price history and receive alerts when items go on sale.\n* Look into cashback apps like Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates), TopCashback, or BeFrugal to earn rewards on your online purchases.\n* If you find it difficult to resist impulse purchases, consider implementing a 30-day waiting period before buying non-essential items.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you ready to get started and take control of your online shopping habits?",
