Here are some recommendations for painting the exterior:\n\n**FS 36118 Medium Gray**\n\nFor the F-15E's primary color, FS 36118 Medium Gray, I recommend using Vallejo Model Air 71.051 Medium Gray (US). This color is a good match for the real aircraft's medium gray tone.\n\n**Other colors**\n\nYou'll also need the following colors for the exterior:\n\n* FS 30277 Radome Tan ( Vallejo Model Air 71.053 Sand Yellow): For the radome and some smaller details.\n* FS 36375 Dark Gray ( Vallejo Model Air 71.054 Dark Gray): For the aircraft's leading edges, wing roots, and some smaller details.\n* FS 37038 Black ( Vallejo Model Air 71.057 Black): For the anti-glare panel, exhaust nozzles, and some smaller details.\n* FS 37875 Dark Green ( Vallejo Model Air 71.060 Dark Green): For the camouflage pattern on the upper surfaces.\n\n**Tips for painting with Vallejo Model Air**\n\n1. **Thin your paint**: Vallejo Model Air paints are quite thick, so make sure to thin them with Vallejo Thinner or a similar product. This will help improve flow and prevent clogging your airbrush.\n2. **Use a primer**: Apply a primer coat to the entire model to ensure a strong bond between the paint and the plastic. Vallejo Primer ( Vallejo Model Air 71.601) is a good choice.\n3. **Airbrush settings**: Use a medium-to-low air pressure (around 10-15 PSI) and a fine needle (0.2-0.3 mm) to achieve a smooth, even coat.\n4. **Layering**: Apply thin, gradual layers to build up the color. This will help prevent pooling and ensure a smooth finish.\n5. **Masking**: Use masking tape or liquid mask to protect areas you don't want to paint. Make sure the tape is pressed firmly onto the model to prevent paint from seeping underneath.\n\n**Additional resources**\n\nIf you're new to painting with Vallejo Model Air, I recommend checking out some online tutorials or videos to get a better understanding of the products and techniques. Some excellent resources include:\n\n* Vallejo's official YouTube channel: Offers tutorials and product demonstrations.\n* Vallejo's website: Provides detailed product information, tutorials, and FAQs.\n* Scale Modeling forums and communities: Websites like Scalemates, Hyperscale, and Model Mayhem have many experienced modelers sharing their experiences and tips on painting with Vallejo Model Air.\n\nRemember to take your time, work in a well-ventilated area, and enjoy the process!",
