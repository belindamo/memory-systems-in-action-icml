Speaking of which, I've been trying to prioritize exercise and fresh air on the weekends too. Last weekend, I walked to the nearby park on Saturday and biked to the local farmer's market on Sunday. Do you have any tips on how I can make sure I keep up this habit, especially on weekends when I tend to sleep in later?",
