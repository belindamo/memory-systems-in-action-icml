  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! You mentioned you attended your cousin's wedding last weekend, and now you're saying you attended it today? Either way, I'm glad you got to be a part of the celebration and that it's got you thinking about your own special day!\n\nI love the sound of a small, intimate ceremony in the San Diego area! The mix of flowers and greenery for the aisle and altar decorations is a great idea. It adds a lot of texture and visual interest to the overall aesthetic. For a smaller, more intimate ceremony, you might consider using more delicate or whimsical elements, like baby's breath, wildflowers, or even pampas grass.\n\nSince you're planning a smaller ceremony, you might also consider using more personal or sentimental elements in your decor. For example, you could incorporate family heirlooms, special photos, or meaningful objects that hold significance for you and Alex.\n\nWhat's the vibe you're going for with your ceremony? Is it more formal and elegant, or relaxed and casual? Are there any specific colors or themes that you're drawn to?\n\nAlso, have you thought about the type of venue you're looking for in the San Diego area? Are you considering a beachside ceremony, a garden, or something more rustic?",
