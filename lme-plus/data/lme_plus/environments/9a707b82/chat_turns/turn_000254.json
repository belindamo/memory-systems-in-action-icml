  "content": "I can see why you feel this way, but it's worth remembering that, despite the automatic qualification, the host nation still has to face tough competition in the World Cup.\n\nFurthermore, while the other teams work hard to qualify for the tournament, they do so knowing that the host nation is guaranteed a spot. That is a known factor, and thus it's part of their competition.\n\nIt's also worth noting that recent World Cups have shown that the host nation's home-field advantage is not guaranteed. In the 2010 World Cup, for instance, South Africa did not make it past the group stage despite being the host nation. And in the 2018 World Cup, Russia advanced to the quarterfinals but was eliminated by Croatia.\n\nIn the end, while there may be valid arguments for and against the host nation's automatic qualification, the practice appears to have become firmly entrenched in the tradition of the World Cup, and its merits and drawbacks will continue to be debated among fans and pundits alike.",
