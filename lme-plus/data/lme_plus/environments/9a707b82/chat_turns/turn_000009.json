My current fitness goal is actually a combination of weight loss and overall health. I've been stuck at the same weight for a while now, and I'd like to drop a few pounds to feel more confident and energetic. I've also been experiencing some stress and anxiety lately, and I've heard that exercise can really help with that. Do you think HIIT can help with stress relief, or is there another type of exercise that might be more beneficial for that?\"",
