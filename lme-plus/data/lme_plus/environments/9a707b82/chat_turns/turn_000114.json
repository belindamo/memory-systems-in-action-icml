  "content": "To integrate the pest and disease component into the database, we need to create a new table for the component in the database. The table should include columns for the following data:\n\n* `id`: unique identifier for each record in the table\n* `pest_or_disease`: string value indicating whether the record is for a pest or a disease\n* `name`: name of the pest or disease\n* `description`: description of the pest or disease\n* `symptoms`: common symptoms associated with the pest or disease\n* `causes`: common causes of the pest or disease\n* `treatments`: common treatments for the pest or disease\n* `prevention`: common prevention measures for the pest or disease\n\nWe can use SQL to create the table:\n```vbnet\nCREATE TABLE pest_disease (\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n  pest_or_disease TEXT NOT NULL,\n  name TEXT NOT NULL,\n  description TEXT,\n  symptoms TEXT,\n  causes TEXT,\n  treatments TEXT,\n  prevention TEXT\n);\n```\nOnce the table is created, we can modify the backend code to allow for inserting, updating, and deleting records in the table. We can also modify the frontend UI to allow users to search for pests or diseases and display the relevant information for each record in the table.\n\nFor example, the backend code for inserting a new record might look like this:\n```javascript\napp.post('/pests_diseases', function(req, res) {\n  var pest_or_disease = req.body.pest_or_disease;\n  var name = req.body.name;\n  var description = req.body.description;\n  var symptoms = req.body.symptoms;\n  var causes = req.body.causes;\n  var treatments = req.body.treatments;\n  var prevention = req.body.prevention;\n\n  var sql = \"INSERT INTO pest_disease (pest_or_disease, name, description, symptoms, causes, treatments, prevention) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n  var params = [pest_or_disease, name, description, symptoms, causes, treatments, prevention];\n\n  db.run(sql, params, function(err) {\n    if (err) {\n      console.log(err);\n      res.status(500).send(err);\n    } else {\n      res.send(\"Record inserted\");\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\nThis code takes in the data for a new pest or disease record and inserts it into the `pest_disease` table in the database. We can similarly modify the code for updating and deleting records.\n\nFor the frontend UI, we can create a search bar that allows users to search for pests or diseases by name. When a user searches for a pest or disease, the app can query the backend to get the relevant information from the `pest_disease` table and display it on the screen. We can also add sorting and filtering options to the UI to make it easier for users to find the information they need.",
