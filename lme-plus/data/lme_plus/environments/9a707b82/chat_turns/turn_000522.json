Churros: These popular deep-fried pastry dough sticks covered in cinnamon sugar are vegan-friendly as they are usually made without eggs or dairy. 2. Paletas: These are traditional Mexican popsicles made with fresh fruit and water or fruit juice. You can easily find vegan-friendly flavors like mango, lime, or hibiscus. 3. Arroz con leche: A rice pudding made with rice, coconut milk or almond milk, sugar, and cinnamon. This can be served warm or cold, depending on your preference. 4. Flan: A type of dessert custard that is traditionally made with egg yolks and milk, but you can easily make a vegan version with coconut milk, arrowroot powder, and a sweetener. 5. Tres leches cake: A cake soaked in a sweet creamy sauce made with three types of milk (usually evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream), but you can make a vegan version by using coconut milk or almond milk, sweetened condensed coconut milk, and coconut cream. 6. Bu\u00f1uelos: Fried dough balls covered in cinnamon sugar, you can make it vegan-friendly by using a plant-based milk and oil instead of eggs and butter. Remember, not all Mexican desserts are vegan-friendly, so it's important to double-check the ingredients before ordering. Alternatively, you can also try making some of these traditional Mexican desserts at home with vegan substitutes.",
