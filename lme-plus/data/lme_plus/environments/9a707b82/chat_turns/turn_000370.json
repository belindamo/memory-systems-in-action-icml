Only partner with brands that align with their values and brand image.\n2. Disclose their partnership with a brand to their audience to maintain transparency.\n3. Only promote products or services they genuinely believe in, and that they have personally used.\n4. Create unique and original content that showcases their authentic voice and perspective.\n5. Avoid spamming their followers with numerous sponsored posts and maintain a balance with organic content.\n6. Strike a balance between promotional content and their general content to avoid looking like they are just pushing products.\n7. Engage with their followers, listen to feedback, and adapt accordingly.",
