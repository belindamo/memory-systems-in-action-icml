  "content": "The United Nations General Assembly works to prevent and respond to acts of aggression and terrorism committed by state and non-state actors through various mechanisms and initiatives. \n\n1. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide: The UN General Assembly adopted this convention in 1948, which criminalizes acts of genocide committed against national, ethnic, racial or religious groups. This convention establishes an international legal framework to prevent and punish the crime of genocide.\n\n2. UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy: In 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. This strategy aims to prevent and combat terrorism by addressing the conditions that promote its spread, building the capacity of nations to prevent and counter terrorism, and ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law.\n\n3. UN Security Council resolutions: The UN General Assembly can refer cases of aggression and terrorism to the UN Security Council, which can impose sanctions, authorize the use of force, and take other measures to address threats to international peace and security.\n\n4. Counter-terrorism committees: The UN General Assembly has established specialized committees and bodies to deal with various aspects of counter-terrorism, including the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), which monitors the implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by member states, and the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee which oversees the sanctions regime against individuals and groups associated with Al-Qaida and the Taliban.\n\n5. Capacity building: The UN General Assembly provides technical assistance and capacity-building support to member states to help them prevent and counter terrorism, including training on risk assessment, border management, and bomb detection.\n\nOverall, through these mechanisms, the UN General Assembly works to prevent and respond to acts of aggression and terrorism committed by state and non-state actors.",
