Remember to use a light hand when adding the oil, as it can quickly overpower the other flavors in the dish.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy the process of cooking and experimenting with new flavors. Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like more recipe ideas or cooking tips in the future.\n\nHappy cooking, and I hope your Vegetable Korma turns out delicious!",
