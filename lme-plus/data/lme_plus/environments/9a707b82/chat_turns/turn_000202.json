Here are some tips to help you achieve them:\n\n**Reduce Food Waste:**\n\n1. **Meal planning**: Plan your meals for the week, and make a grocery list accordingly. This will help you avoid buying unnecessary items and reduce waste.\n2. **Shop your fridge and pantry first**: Before going grocery shopping, take stock of what you already have at home. This will help you avoid duplicate purchases and use up ingredients that are near expiration.\n3. **Use up leftovers**: Get creative with leftovers by turning them into new meals. For example, use last night's dinner as a packable lunch or turn leftover veggies into a soup or stir-fry.\n4. **Freeze it**: Freeze items like meat, bread, and vegetables when they're approaching expiration. You can also freeze cooked meals like soups, stews, and casseroles for later use.\n5. **Store food properly**: Keep your fridge and pantry organized, and store food in a way that helps it last longer. For example, keep your fridge at the right temperature, and store fruits and veggies in breathable bags.\n\n**Save Money on Groceries:**\n\n1. **Plan your shopping trip**: Make a list and stick to it. Avoid impulse buys, and shop the sales.\n2. **Buy in bulk**: Purchasing items like rice, pasta, and canned goods in bulk can save you money in the long run. Just be sure to store them properly to maintain their freshness.\n3. **Shop at discount stores**: Consider shopping at discount stores or dollar stores for non-perishable items like canned goods, pasta, and snacks.\n4. **Use cashback apps**: Apps like Ibotta and Fetch Rewards offer cashback on certain grocery items.\n5. **Buy imperfect produce**: Many grocery stores now offer \"ugly\" or \"imperfect\" produce at a lower price. This can be a great way to save money on fruits and veggies while reducing food waste.\n6. **Avoid processed and pre-packaged foods**: Processed and pre-packaged foods tend to be more expensive than whole ingredients. Opt for whole foods and cook meals from scratch to save money.\n7. **Shop in season**: Produce that's in season is often cheaper than out-of-season produce. You can also find seasonal produce at farmer's markets or through a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program.\n\n**Tracking Your Spending:**\n\n1. **Use a budgeting app**: Apps like Mint, You Need a Budget (YNAB), and Personal Capital can help you track your spending and stay on top of your budget.\n2. **Set a budget**: Determine how much you want to spend on groceries each week and stick to it.\n3. **Review your receipts**: Take a closer look at your receipts to identify areas where you can cut back. Are you spending too much on meat or dairy? Can you find cheaper alternatives?\n\nYou're already doing a great job by tracking your spending and meal prepping. Keep up the good work, and remember, small changes can add up over time!\n\nHow do these tips sound? Do you have any specific questions about reducing food waste or saving money on groceries?",
