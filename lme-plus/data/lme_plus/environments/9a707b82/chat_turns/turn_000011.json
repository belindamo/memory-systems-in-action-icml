However, it's also important to listen to your body and allow yourself some flexibility. If you're feeling exhausted or need an extra hour or two of sleep on the weekends, that's okay! The key is to find a balance that works for you and your lifestyle.\n\nOne approach could be to try setting a 'sleep window' for yourself, where you aim to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night, but allow yourself to sleep in a bit later on weekends if needed. This way, you're still prioritizing rest and recovery, but also giving yourself some flexibility to adjust to your needs.\n\nWhat do you think about that approach? And how have you been feeling about your sleep quality lately? Are you getting enough restful sleep, or do you find yourself waking up feeling groggy or tired?\"",
