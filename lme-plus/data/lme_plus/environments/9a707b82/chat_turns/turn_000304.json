  "content": "That's so wonderful to hear! The venue hunt can be a really exciting part of the wedding planning process, and it's great that you and Alex are enjoying it together. It's a great way to bond and get a sense of what you both want for your special day.\n\nIt's also fantastic that you're finding it a fun and collaborative experience. Wedding planning can sometimes bring out stress and disagreements, but it sounds like you two are approaching it with a positive and united attitude.\n\nImagining your special day coming together must be so exciting! Are there any specific moments or aspects of the wedding that you're particularly looking forward to? Is there a certain part of the ceremony or reception that you're most excited about?\n\nAlso, I have to ask: How did Alex propose to you? Was it a romantic and surprise-filled moment, or a more low-key and intimate proposal?",
