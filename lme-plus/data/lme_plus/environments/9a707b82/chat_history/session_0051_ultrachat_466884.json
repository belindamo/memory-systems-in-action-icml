The server may know more about the vegan options available at the restaurant and can suggest some items that are not on the menu. This can help you get a better idea of what you can eat, and also make the ordering process easier. Just remember to always ask if certain dishes contain any animal products or are cooked with them."

Suggest a vegan-friendly restaurant: Before the outing, suggest a restaurant that offers vegan options or be sure to check the restaurant's menu beforehand to ensure there are vegan options available.\n\n2. Speak up: When ordering, don't be afraid to speak up and ask for modifications to make a dish vegan-friendly.\n\n3. Be proactive: Look up the restaurant's menu online beforehand or call ahead of time to ask about vegan options. This can help avoid any awkward situations at the restaurant and make ordering easier.\n\n4. Share: If you're with a group of friends, suggest sharing some vegan dishes so that everyone can try them. Who knows, they may be impressed with how tasty vegan dishes can be!\n\n5. Bring your own food: If the restaurant doesn't offer any vegan options, you can always pack your own food or snacks to eat. This ensures that you have something to eat and can still enjoy the company of your friends.\n\nRemember, dining out with non-vegan friends doesn't have to be a struggle, and there are always ways to make it work. Communication is key, so don't hesitate to speak up and let your friends know about your dietary restrictions. It's also a great opportunity to introduce them to vegan cuisine and show them how delicious and satisfying it can be."
