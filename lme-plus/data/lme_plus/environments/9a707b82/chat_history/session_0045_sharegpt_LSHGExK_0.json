Create a LinkedIn company page if you haven't already done so.\n2. Invite your employees to follow your company page by sending them a link and a brief message encouraging them to stay up-to-date with company news and updates.\n3. Regularly post content on your company page, including industry news, company announcements, and employee spotlights. Be sure to include engaging visuals and calls-to-action to encourage engagement.\n4. Set up an employee advocacy program that rewards employees for sharing your company's LinkedIn posts on their own profiles. This could include incentives like gift cards, company swag, or recognition in company meetings or newsletters.\n5. Use a social media management tool like Hootsuite or Buffer to schedule and post content on a regular basis.
