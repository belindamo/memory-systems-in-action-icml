      "content": "No, a file in a Unix-like file system can have only one inode. An inode (short for index node) is a data structure used by the file system to store information about a file or directory, such as ownership, permissions, timestamps, and the location of the data blocks that make up the file.\n\nEach file or directory in a file system is represented by a unique inode number. The inode number is used by the file system to access the inode and retrieve information about the file or directory.\n\nWhile a file can have multiple hard links, each hard link refers to the same inode. Hard links are multiple names for the same file, and all hard links share the same inode number, which means they point to the same data blocks on disk. In other words, all hard links to a file are equivalent and interchangeable; there is no \"primary\" or \"original\" name for the file."
