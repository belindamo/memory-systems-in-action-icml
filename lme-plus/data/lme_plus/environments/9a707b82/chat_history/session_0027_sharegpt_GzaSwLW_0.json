Here are some key points regarding these topics, as discussed in the articles on Arts Professional and The Audience Agency websites:\n\nArts Professional:\n\n* Cultural placemaking is the process of creating or enhancing cultural spaces, often in public places, to make them more welcoming, inclusive, and engaging for local communities and visitors.\n* A cultural place-based strategy is a long-term plan that aims to use arts and culture to improve the economic, social, and environmental aspects of a particular place or community.\n* Cultural placemaking can help to create a sense of identity and pride in a place, as well as encourage community participation and social cohesion.\n* A successful cultural place-based strategy requires collaboration and partnership between local stakeholders, including artists, cultural organizations, community groups, and local authorities.\n* The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of cultural placemaking and the need to adapt to new ways of engaging audiences, such as outdoor events and digital experiences.\n\nThe Audience Agency:\n\n* Cultural placemaking can help to attract visitors and increase footfall to local areas, which can have positive economic impacts.\n* To be successful, cultural placemaking initiatives should be tailored to the specific needs and interests of the local community, and should involve co-creation and co-production with local residents.\n* Arts professionals can play a key role in cultural placemaking by facilitating collaborations and partnerships, and by providing expertise in areas such as audience development and engagement.\n* Evaluation and monitoring are important components of cultural placemaking initiatives, to ensure that they are having the desired impacts and to learn from successes and failures.\n* There is a need for more research and data on the impacts of cultural placemaking, both in terms of economic and social outcomes, and in terms of audience engagement and participation."
