She's been a great source of guidance and support, and I think she'll be able to offer some valuable insights and advice on how to approach this initiative. I'm also considering reaching out to our HR department to see if they have any existing resources or programs in place that we can build upon. Do you think it's a good idea to also involve some of my colleagues who have expressed interest in diversity and inclusion initiatives in the past?",
