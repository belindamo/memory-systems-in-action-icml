  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have information on the latest numbers, but I can provide some general information. Untreated anemia is relatively common, especially in developing countries with limited access to healthcare. In these areas, lack of proper nutrition and limited access to healthcare can lead to a high prevalence of anemia, particularly in women and children. Some other groups that are at higher risk for anemia include pregnant women, those with chronic medical conditions, and those with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or heavy menstrual bleeding. Additionally, those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet may also be at a higher risk for anemia due to a lack of iron-rich foods in their diet. It is important to note that many cases of anemia can be treated with proper medical care and dietary changes.",
