  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future with certainty, but it appears that the trend towards developing young talent instead of signing high-priced free agents is likely to continue among big market teams in the future. \n\nOne reason for this is the increased emphasis on analytics in baseball. Teams are now able to analyze player performance more accurately and identify young players who have the potential to be successful in the major leagues. This allows teams to save money on salaries and invest in developing their own players.\n\nAnother reason is the luxury tax threshold, which penalizes teams for spending over a certain limit on player salaries. This makes it more difficult for teams to sign multiple high-priced free agents without incurring significant financial penalties.\n\nFinally, there is also a growing recognition among teams that building a strong core of homegrown players can lead to sustained success over the long term. Teams like the Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs have had success in recent years by focusing on developing young talent and building strong teams around them.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the trend towards developing young talent will continue among big market teams in the future, as it allows teams to build successful, sustainable teams while simultaneously managing their financial resources.",
