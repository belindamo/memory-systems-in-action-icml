  "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the spending of big market teams in the MLB. With no fans in attendance and reduced revenue from TV deals, teams have had to operate on a reduced budget, which has made many teams more cautious in their spending on top free agents.\n\nFor example, the New York Yankees, who are typically big spenders, have been relatively quiet in terms of free-agent signings due to the financial uncertainty caused by the pandemic. The Los Angeles Dodgers, another big-market team, have also been more cautious in their spending, focusing on bringing back their own free agents rather than signing new players.\n\nHowever, some teams have still been willing to invest in top free agents despite the pandemic. For instance, the New York Mets signed free agent pitcher Trevor Bauer to a record-breaking contract. The San Diego Padres also made several high-profile signings, including trading for outfielder Blake Snell and signing free-agent pitcher Yu Darvish.\n\nOverall, while the pandemic has made big market teams more cautious in their spending on top free agents, some teams have still been willing to invest heavily in order to improve their rosters. As the financial impacts of the pandemic continue to be felt, it remains to be seen how this will impact the spending of big market teams moving forward.",
