  "content": "Yes. One example of how market research can be biased is through the selection of participants for surveys or focus groups. If a company only chooses participants from a certain age range or geographic location, the results may not be representative of the entire target market. This can lead to incorrect assumptions or conclusions about consumer preferences and behaviors. Another example is using language or terminology that is not familiar or accessible to certain groups, which can lead to responses that do not accurately reflect their opinions or insights. This can result in product offerings that are not inclusive or relevant to all consumers.",
