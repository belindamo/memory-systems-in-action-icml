Coins from this mint are highly prized among collectors.\n3. **Short Production Run**: The 1889-CC Morgan dollar was only produced for a short period, from February to June 1889, which contributed to its limited mintage.\n4. **Hoarding**: Many 1889-CC Morgan dollars were hoarded by collectors and investors at the time of their release, which reduced the number of coins that entered circulation.\n5. **Condition Rarity**: Due to their age and handling, many 1889-CC Morgan dollars are found in lower grades. Finding one in high grades (MS-60 and above) is extremely rare, making them highly valuable.\n\nAs a result, the 1889-CC Morgan dollar is considered one of the rarest and most valuable coins in the Morgan dollar series. Here are some value ranges for the 1889-CC Morgan dollar:\n\n* Good (G-4) to Fine (F-12): $1,000-$5,000\n* Very Fine (VF-20) to Extremely Fine (EF-40): $5,000-$20,000\n* About Uncirculated (AU-50) to Mint State (MS-60): $20,000-$100,000\n* Gem Condition (MS-65 and above): $100,000-$500,000+\n\nKeep in mind that these values are estimates and can vary depending on the coin's condition, rarity, and market demand.\n\nThe 1889-CC Morgan dollar is a true numismatic treasure, and owning one is a dream for many collectors.
