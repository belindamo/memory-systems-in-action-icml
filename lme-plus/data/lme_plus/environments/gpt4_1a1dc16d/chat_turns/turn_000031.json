We must remember that the Olympics are not just about winning medals, but also about inspiring and bringing people together from all over the world. Therefore, it is vital for all athletes to compete in the true spirit of the games, to respect their opponents, and adhere to the strict anti-doping regulations set by the Olympic Committee.
