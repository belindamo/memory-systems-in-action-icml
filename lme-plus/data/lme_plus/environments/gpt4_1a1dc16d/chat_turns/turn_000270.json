  "content": "Harlequin rasboras are relatively easy to care for, and they can thrive in a well-maintained community tank. Here are the ideal water parameters for harlequin rasboras:\n\n**Water Temperature:**\n\n* Ideal temperature range: 72\u00b0F - 82\u00b0F (22\u00b0C - 28\u00b0C)\n* Avoid sudden temperature changes, as they can be sensitive to temperature fluctuations\n\n**pH:**\n\n* Ideal pH range: 6.5 - 7.5\n* They can tolerate a slightly acidic to neutral pH, but avoid extreme pH levels\n\n**Water Hardness:**\n\n* Ideal water hardness: Soft to moderately hard water (dGH 5-15)\n* They can adapt to harder water, but soft water is preferred\n\n**Water Flow:**\n\n* They prefer gentle to moderate water flow, as they're native to slow-moving streams and rivers\n\n**Water Quality:**\n\n* Regular water changes (25-50% every 1-2 weeks) are essential to maintain good water quality\n* Monitor ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels, and perform regular water tests to ensure a healthy environment\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n* Harlequin rasboras are schooling fish and prefer to be in groups of 6-10 or more. This will help them feel secure and reduce stress.\n* They're active swimmers and prefer open swimming areas, but also appreciate plants and decorations to hide and rest.\n* Avoid keeping them with fin-nippers or aggressive fish, as they can be stressed or injured.\n\nSince you're already monitoring your water closely, you're on the right track! Just make sure to maintain a stable and consistent environment, and your harlequin rasboras should thrive.\n\nIf you're unsure about your current water parameters or have any concerns, feel free to share your water test results or ask for guidance. I'm here to help!",
