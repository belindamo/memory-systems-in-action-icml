  "content": "Yes, here are some stretches you can do before and after running to prevent injury:\n\nBefore Running:\n\n1. Leg swings: Stand with one hand on a wall or tree for balance. Swing one leg forward and backward, then side to side, for 10-15 repetitions. 2. Walking lunges: Take a big step forward with one leg and lower your body until your knee is parallel to the ground. Hold for a few seconds, then step forward with your other leg and repeat. 3. High-knee march: March in place, lifting your knees high towards your chest. After Running:\n\n1. Standing quad stretch: Stand on one foot and bend the other leg behind you, holding onto your ankle. Hold for 20-30 seconds and then switch legs. 2. Standing hamstring stretch: Place one foot on a bench or step, keeping your leg straight. Lean forward from your hips until you feel a stretch in the back of your thigh. Hold for 20-30 seconds and then switch legs. 3. Glute stretch: Sit with one leg straight and the other leg bent, foot flat on the floor. Cross your straight leg over your bent leg and gently pull your knee towards your chest until you feel a stretch in your glutes. Hold for 20-30 seconds and then switch legs. Remember to stretch gently and don't push yourself too hard. If you feel any pain, stop immediately. Stretching after running can help prevent muscle soreness and improve flexibility.",
