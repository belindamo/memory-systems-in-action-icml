Using a generic message like \"Welcome to the family, little one\" and adding the baby's name and birth date later is a thoughtful and practical approach.\n\nAs for the card, it's a wonderful way to express your congratulations and well-wishes to the new parents. Here are some ideas for what to write in the card:\n\n1. **Heartfelt Congratulations**: \"Congratulations on the arrival of your little miracle! Wishing you all the joy, love, and sleep you can get.\"\n2. **Personalized Message**: \"Welcome to the family, little one! I'm so thrilled to meet you and watch you grow. [Your Name]\"\n3. **Inspirational Quote**: \"A baby is born with a heart full of love and a life full of promise. Wishing you a lifetime of happiness, love, and adventure together.\"\n4. **Funny and Lighthearted**: \"Congratulations on surviving the first few weeks of parenthood! Now, get ready for the best adventure of your life.\"\n5. **Sincere and Sentimental**: \"As you begin this new chapter in your life, remember that you're not alone. You have each other, and you have me, cheering you on every step of the way.\"\n6. **Words of Wisdom**: \"Parenthood is a journey, not a destination. Cherish every moment, even the sleepless nights and dirty diapers.\"\n7. **Simple and Sincere**: \"I'm so happy for you both! Wishing you all the best as you start this new chapter in your lives.\"\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be genuine and sincere in your message. Express your excitement, love, and support for the new parents, and they'll treasure the card and the gift forever.\n\nHow do these ideas sound? Do you need any more help or guidance?",
