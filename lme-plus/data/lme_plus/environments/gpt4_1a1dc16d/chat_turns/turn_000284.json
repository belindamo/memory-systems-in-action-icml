Mastering a complex routine is definitely something to be proud of!\n\nIn a production of Hamlet, sword fighting is an essential element, particularly in the final act. Hamlet's duel with Laertes is a pivotal moment in the play, and having proficiency in sword fighting will undoubtedly make you a more competitive candidate for the role.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider when showcasing your stage combat skills in an audition:\n\n1. **Highlight your skills wisely**: Make sure to mention your stage combat training and experience in your resume and cover letter. You might also consider including a special skills section or a separate page for your combat skills.\n2. **Be prepared to demonstrate**: Be ready to showcase your sword fighting skills at the audition, if requested. Bring your own sword or be prepared to use a prop provided by the audition team.\n3. **Focus on safety**: Remember that safety is paramount in stage combat. Demonstrate your ability to execute the routine safely and efficiently, and be mindful of your opponent's (or partner's) safety as well.\n4. **Integrate it into the scene**: If you're performing a scene that involves sword fighting, make sure to integrate the combat into the overall performance. Focus on the dramatic purpose of the fight and how it serves the scene, rather than just showcasing your technical skills.\n5. **Be prepared to adapt**: Be flexible and willing to adapt your routine to the specific needs of the production. The director or fight choreographer may have specific requirements or preferences, so be prepared to modify your routine accordingly.\n\nBy showcasing your stage combat skills, you'll not only demonstrate your physical abilities but also your commitment to the role and the production. Break a leg, and I hope you get to wield a sword on stage soon!",
