  "content": "There are many dietary changes that can help treat anemia. One of the most important steps for those with anemia is to increase their intake of iron-rich foods. Examples of foods that are high in iron include red meat, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, fortified cereals, whole grains, spinach, and other dark, leafy greens. Foods high in vitamin C, such as oranges, strawberries, tomatoes, and bell peppers, can also be helpful as vitamin C can increase the absorption of iron. \n\nIn some cases, iron supplements may be necessary for treatment. This is particularly true for those with severe anemia or those who are not able to get enough iron from their diet. However, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider before taking an iron supplement as too much iron can be harmful. Additionally, iron supplements can cause constipation and other side effects in some people, so it is important to take them as directed by a healthcare provider.",
