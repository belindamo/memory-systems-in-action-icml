  "content": "It's certainly possible that the pandemic could lead to a more long-term shift in how big market teams approach their spending in the MLB, even after the pandemic is over. \n\nOne reason for this is the increased importance of financial stability, as teams look to ensure their long-term viability in the wake of the pandemic. This could lead to more caution in spending on high-priced free agents, even as revenue sources recover.\n\nAdditionally, the increased emphasis on analytics and player development may continue to drive teams to focus on developing young talent rather than signing expensive free agents. This could lead to more teams building strong cores of homegrown players, as teams recognize the long-term benefits of investing in player development.\n\nFinally, the luxury tax threshold will continue to be a factor, potentially leading to more teams being wary of spending over the limit and incurring significant financial penalties.\n\nOverall, while it remains to be seen exactly how the pandemic will impact the spending habits of big market teams in the MLB over the long term, it's likely that the effects of the pandemic will continue to be felt even after the pandemic has subsided.",
