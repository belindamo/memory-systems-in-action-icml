  "content": "That's really helpful. I think I'll definitely try to incorporate some improv exercises into my preparation. Speaking of exercise, I've been taking classes at a local studio for the past two months to improve my stage combat skills. Our instructor, Mike, is a professional stuntman and has been teaching us some amazing techniques. I've been practicing my sword fighting skills and recently mastered a complex routine that I'm really proud of. Do you think that would be useful in a production of Hamlet? Wait, I already mentioned that. Anyway, I also attended a theater workshop on improvisation at the local community center three weeks ago, which was a lot of fun. Maybe I can use some of those skills to help with the audition too.",
