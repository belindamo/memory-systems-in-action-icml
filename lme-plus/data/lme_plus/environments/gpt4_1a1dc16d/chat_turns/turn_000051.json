  "content": "Yes, I can provide some examples of big market teams that have become more cautious in their spending on top free agents. One such example is the New York Yankees, who historically have been known to spend big money on top free agents. In recent years, however, they have become more cautious and are focusing on developing young talent and staying under the luxury tax threshold.\n\nAnother example is the Los Angeles Dodgers, who used to be one of the biggest spenders in the league but have become more efficient in their spending. They have been able to build a strong team without necessarily breaking the bank on top free agents.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox are another team that has become more cautious in their spending. After winning the World Series in 2018, they traded away some of their high-priced players in an effort to get under the luxury tax threshold.\n\nOverall, many big market teams have become more mindful of their spending in recent years due to financial considerations and a desire to build sustainable success through developing young talent.",
