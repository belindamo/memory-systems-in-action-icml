Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Etsy**: Etsy is a great platform to find unique, handmade, and customized items. Use keywords like \"customized wooden baby tree,\" \"engraved baby tree,\" or \"personalized baby tree\" to find relevant sellers. Make sure to check reviews, prices, and shipping times before making a purchase.\n2. **Amazon**: Amazon offers a range of customized baby trees, including wooden ones with engraving options. You can filter search results by price, customer reviews, and Prime shipping eligibility.\n3. **Zibbet**: Zibbet is an online marketplace that features handmade and unique items. Use the search term \"custom wooden baby tree\" or \"engraved baby tree\" to find sellers who offer customization options.\n4. **Local Artisans**: Consider visiting local craft fairs, markets, or boutiques in your area that feature handmade wooden items. You might find an artisan who can create a custom baby tree with engraving.\n\nAs for when to gift it, it's entirely up to you! Here are some pros and cons of each option:\n\n**Gifting at the Baby Shower:**\n\n* Pros: It's a beautiful, unique gift that will stand out among other presents. It can also serve as a lovely centerpiece or decoration for the baby shower.\n* Cons: The baby's name or birth date might not be known yet, so you might need to wait for that information before ordering.\n\n**Gifting After the Baby is Born:**\n\n* Pros: You can include the baby's name, birth date, and other personal details, making it an even more special gift. It's also a thoughtful way to celebrate the baby's arrival.\n* Cons: You might miss the opportunity to present it at the baby shower, and it might not be as timely.\n\nUltimately, it depends on your personal preference and the timing of the baby shower. If you're unsure, you could consider ordering the tree without the engraving and then adding the personalization details after the baby is born.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you like me to help you find a seller or provide more information on these options?",
