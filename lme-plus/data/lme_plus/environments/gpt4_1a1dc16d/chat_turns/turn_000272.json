  "content": "The photoperiod you're currently running might be a bit unconventional, but it's not necessarily bad. However, for harlequin rasboras, a more traditional photoperiod might be beneficial.\n\nHarlequin rasboras, like most fish, have a natural circadian rhythm that's influenced by the day-night cycle. In the wild, they're adapted to a more consistent and gradual change in light intensity and duration.\n\nA 10-hour photoperiod with a 2-hour break in the middle might be a bit jarring for them. The sudden change in light intensity and the mid-day break could cause some stress and disrupt their natural behavior.\n\nFor harlequin rasboras, I would recommend a more traditional photoperiod, such as:\n\n* 8-10 hours of light, with a gradual increase and decrease in intensity to simulate dawn and dusk\n* 2-4 hours of subdued or low-light conditions to mimic the natural twilight period\n* 10-12 hours of darkness or complete darkness to allow for rest and sleep\n\nThis photoperiod will help create a more natural environment and give your harlequin rasboras a sense of security and consistency.\n\nYou can achieve this by adjusting your lighting schedule as follows:\n\n* Turn on the lights in the morning, gradually increasing the intensity over 30 minutes to 1 hour\n* Maintain the maximum light intensity for 8-10 hours\n* Gradually decrease the light intensity over 30 minutes to 1 hour to simulate dusk\n* Turn off the lights or switch to low-light conditions for 2-4 hours\n* Maintain complete darkness for 10-12 hours\n\nRemember, this is just a general guideline, and you can adjust the photoperiod based on your specific tank's needs and the behavior of your fish. Observe your harlequin rasboras' behavior and adjust the lighting schedule accordingly.\n\nKeep in mind that plants also benefit from a more natural photoperiod, so this change will likely benefit your java moss and hornwort as well!",
