  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to current 'news' or any recent data related to the reactions of big market teams to the increase in salaries for top free agents. However, I can provide a general idea based on historical data.\n\nIn the past, big market teams have generally been willing to pay top salaries for free agents to strengthen their rosters and increase their chances of winning championships. However, with increased scrutiny on team spending and revenue sharing, some big market teams have become more cautious in their spending.\n\nMany teams are now focusing on building through their farm systems and developing young talent rather than signing high-priced free agents. Additionally, some teams have also become hesitant to sign long-term contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, preferring to sign players to shorter, more flexible deals.\n\nOverall, the reactions of big market teams to the increase in salaries for top free agents vary depending on the team's financial situation, their priorities, and their long-term goals.",
