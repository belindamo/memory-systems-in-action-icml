Scheduling your Q&A session during their most active period can increase engagement and participation.\n\nThe 12 pm - 3 pm EST time slot is a great choice, considering the following factors:\n\n1. **Lunch break**: Many people take a break during this time, and your Q&A session can be a welcome distraction or a way to relax during their lunch hour.\n2. **Mid-day slump**: The post-lunch period can be a slow time for many people. Your Q&A session can provide a much-needed energy boost and mental break.\n3. **Work-from-home audience**: With the rise of remote work, many people might be working from home during this time. Your Q&A session can be a refreshing break from their daily tasks.\n\nHowever, keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **Time zones**: If your audience is global, consider the time zones and adjust accordingly. You might want to consider a time that works for your primary audience or schedule multiple sessions to cater to different time zones.\n2. **Competition**: Be aware of other popular Q&A sessions, webinars, or live events that might be happening during the same time slot. You want to avoid conflicting with similar content that might attract your target audience.\n3. **Consistency**: Choose a time that you can commit to regularly, so your audience knows when to expect your Q&A sessions.\n\nTo further optimize your Q&A session, consider the following:\n\n1. **Promote in advance**: Announce your Q&A session at least a week in advance to build anticipation and encourage followers to submit questions.\n2. **Use Instagram's features**: Utilize Instagram's features like \"Question Sticker\" in your Stories to collect questions and create a sense of excitement around the event.\n3. **Create a branded hashtag**: Designate a branded hashtag for your Q&A session, so followers can share their questions, thoughts, and takeaways on social media.\n\nBy scheduling your Q&A session during your followers' most active period and promoting it effectively, you'll set yourself up for a successful and engaging event!",
