  "content": "Yes, it's important to have some fuel in your body before a run to give you the energy you need to perform at your best. Here are some pre-run snack options:\n\n1. Banana with nut butter: Bananas are a good source of carbohydrates and potassium. Adding some nut butter can add protein and healthy fats.\n\n2. Oatmeal with fruit: Oatmeal is a high-fiber, slow-to-digest carbohydrate that can provide sustained energy. Adding some fruit can provide extra carbohydrates to fuel your run.\n\n3. Toast with avocado: Whole-grain toast is a good source of carbohydrates, and adding avocado can provide healthy fats for sustained energy.\n\n4. Smoothie: A smoothie made with fruit, yogurt, and milk or plant-based milk can provide carbohydrates, protein, and electrolytes to help fuel your run.\n\n5. Energy bars: Energy bars made with whole foods like nuts, dried fruit, and oats can provide carbohydrates and healthy fats to fuel your run.\n\nRemember to eat your snack 1-2 hours before your run to give your body time to digest. Avoid foods that are high in fat or fiber, which can slow down digestion and cause stomach discomfort during exercise.",
