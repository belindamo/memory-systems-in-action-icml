It was found that ideal L2 self and L2 learning experience had a mediating effect between self-efficacy and English proficiency, but self-efficacy could not have a significant effect on English proficiency through ought-to L2 self. The research participants of this study have a wide distribution of majors, involving science, engineering, and liberal arts, and thus are representative. In addition, in a small number of master's theses, all of which were conducted with high school students in urban areas, and questionnaires were used to explore learners' levels of L2MSS and self-efficacy, and some of the studies explored the pathways of influence among the three variables.\nIt is worth mentioning that the findings of these studies are not all the same. In terms of the levels of the L2MSS, Zhao (2021) and Chen (2022) agreed that the learners have a high level of the L2MSS, with the three dimensions in the order of ideal L2 self > L2 learning experience > ought-to L2 self. But Zhou (2021) found that the levels of the L2MSS are at an average level, and the L2 learning experience is the highest. The findings are not entirely consistent in terms of the correlation between the dimensions of L2MSS and English achievement. Besides, the dimensions of self-efficacy examined differed from studies.\nIn summary, the previous studies had the following shortcomings. Firstly, research variables are single. There are more studies on the relationship between L2MSS and English achievement or self-efficacy and English achievement, but there are very few studies on the relationship and impacts among L2MSS, self-efficacy and English achievement at the same time. Secondly, in the studies on the relationship between L2MSS, self-efficacy and English learning achievement, the research methods used are almost all quantitative analysis using questionnaires as instrument, which is unitary. Lastly, the research participants of previous studies are unitary, mainly focusing on non-English major college students and high school students in urban areas, with no attention paid to students in rural areas, thus their generalizability needs to be improved. This study selects students from rural areas as the research participants, which can increase the diversity of the sample and make this type of research more comprehensive.\nTherefore, based on previous studies, this study selects high school students in a rural school in Yibin, Sichuan Province as the research participants and combines questionnaires and interview as the research instruments to investigate the correlation between self-efficacy, L2MSS and English academic achievement and their influence on learners' English academic achievement."

However, few studies have examined the relationship between these three variables simultaneously. Only a few domestic studies have been found, mostly in the form of master's theses (Zhao Wei, 2021; Zhou Huijuan, 2021; Chen Weilin, 2022).\n\nHuo and Rui (2020) conducted a survey of 239 junior and senior non-English majors in a university in North China, investigating the interactions between self-efficacy, L2MSS, and English academic proficiency.

This study's participants had a wide distribution of majors, including science, engineering, and liberal arts, making them representative of the student population.\n\nA few master's theses have explored the pathways of influence among the three variables, all conducted with high school students in urban areas using questionnaires to explore learners' levels of L2MSS and self-efficacy.\n\nHowever, the findings of these studies are not entirely consistent, with some studies indicating that learners have a high level of L2MSS, with the three dimensions in the order of ideal L2 self > L2 learning experience > ought-to L2 self, while others found that the levels of L2MSS are at an average level, and L2 learning experience is the highest. Additionally, the dimensions of self-efficacy examined varied among studies.\n\nOverall, previous studies had several limitations. They focused on a single research variable, used a quantitative analysis method employing questionnaires as the instrument, and focused mainly on non-English major college students and high school students in urban areas. There was no attention paid to students in rural areas, affecting the generalizability of the results.\n\nTo address these limitations, this study selected high school students from a rural school in Yibin, Sichuan Province as research participants. The study used questionnaires and interviews as research instruments to investigate the correlation between self-efficacy, L2MSS, and English academic achievement and their influence on learners' English academic achievement. This selection of participants increased the diversity of the sample, making the research more comprehensive."
