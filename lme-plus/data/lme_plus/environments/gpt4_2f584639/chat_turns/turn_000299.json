  "content": "You can add bubble bath to the water while soaking your feet, but it is important to make sure that the bubble bath you are using does not contain harsh chemicals or fragrances that may irritate or dry out your skin. While bubbles may make the soaking experience more fun and relaxing, they are not necessary for preventing dryness and cracked heels. In fact, some bubble baths and soaps can strip the skin of its natural oils, making dryness worse. If you want to add a scent to the water, consider using natural essential oils instead. A few drops of lavender or peppermint oil can help to soothe and calm your feet while also providing a pleasant aroma.",
