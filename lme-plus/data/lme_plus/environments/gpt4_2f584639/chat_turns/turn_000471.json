  "content": "For this chapter, the relevant information to address during a presentation would be the previous work in the field of visual assistive technology, specifically head wear and smart canes.\n\nIn 2.3.1.1, the previous work discussed is a wearable travel aid for environment perception and navigation of visually impaired people. The system uses a consumer RGB-D camera attached to eyeglasses, along with an IMU and smartphone for commands and feedback. The system can be used in both indoor and outdoor settings and utilizes computer vision technologies for routing and detection. The limitations of this system include difficulty in detecting small obstacles and lack of staircase detection.\n\nIn 2.3.1.2, the previous work discussed is a system that uses video input from a portable camera, which is processed in real-time using the YOLO model for image recognition. The location of the detected object is then converted to 3D audio and sent to the user's wireless earphones. The limitations of this system include only being able to accurately detect and classify objects within 2-5 meters, blocking of surrounding ambient sound when using earbuds, and too much information being sent to the user when multiple objects are detected.\n\nIn 2.3.2.1, the previous work discussed is a smart electronic stick for the visually impaired that uses an Android application and Google's Cloud Vision. The stick has ultrasonic sensors for detecting low-lying and knee-level obstacles and potholes, as well as GPS navigation and face detection capabilities. The stick can also translate traffic lights and roadside signs and has text recognition capabilities. The limitations of this system include short coverage for obstacle detection and only being suitable for indoor use.\n\nIn 2.3.2.2, the previous work discussed is a smart cane called WeWalk, developed by a non-profit organization. The cane has a built-in touchpad for navigation, a built-in ultrasound sensor for detecting above-ground obstacles, and a built-in voice assistant for more straightforward navigation through the application. The cane can also be paired with a user's phone via Bluetooth for additional functionality. The limitations of this system are not specified.",
