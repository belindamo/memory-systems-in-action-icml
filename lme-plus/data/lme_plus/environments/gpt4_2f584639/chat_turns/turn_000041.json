However, I'll explain how dirt and dust can potentially affect your phone's performance:\n\n1. **Dust accumulation**: Dust can accumulate in the phone's charging port, SIM card slot, or other small crevices. This can cause connectivity issues, but it's unlikely to directly impact battery life.\n2. **Screen protector**: If the built-in screen protector is damaged or scratched, it might cause the screen to stay on for a longer period, leading to increased battery consumption. However, if you're careful not to scratch it, this is unlikely to be the cause.\n3. **Case-related issues**: A dirty or damaged phone case can cause the phone to overheat, which might lead to battery drain. However, this is more likely to occur if the case is blocking airflow or if the phone is experiencing thermal issues.\n\nTo rule out any potential issues related to the case or phone cleanliness, you can try the following:\n\n* Clean the phone's charging port and SIM card slot with a soft brush or a can of compressed air to remove any dust or debris.\n* Inspect the screen protector for any scratches or damage. If it's damaged, consider replacing it.\n* Remove the case and see if the battery life improves. If it does, it might indicate that the case is causing some sort of interference or overheating issue.\n\nSince you're already cleaning your phone regularly, it's unlikely that dirt or dust is the primary cause of the battery drain. Let's continue exploring other potential causes.\n\nBased on your usage patterns and the fact that the issue started in early September, I'd like to investigate further:\n\n* Have you installed any new apps or software updates around the time the battery drain started?\n* Have you noticed any changes in your phone's behavior, such as increased heat, slow performance, or unusual battery drain patterns?\n* Are you using any power-hungry features like GPS, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth frequently?\n\nPlease let me know your answers to these questions, and we can continue troubleshooting the issue!",
