It has a bright and vibrant screen with good color accuracy, making it suitable for streaming, gaming, and creative work. The viewing angles are also excellent, with minimal color shifting or brightness loss even when viewed from the sides. HP claims a 178-degree viewing angle, which is impressive for a laptop in this price range.\n* **Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1**: The Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1's display is also a high point, but it's not quite as impressive as the Envy x360's. While it's still a Full HD touchscreen, the colors might not be as vibrant, and the viewing angles aren't as wide. You might notice some color shifting and brightness loss when viewed from the sides, but it's still acceptable for general use. Dell claims a 160-degree viewing angle, which is decent but not as wide as the Envy x360's.\n\nIn terms of display quality, both laptops are suitable for general use, but the HP Envy x360's display is more impressive. If you plan to use your laptop for creative work, gaming, or streaming, the Envy x360's display might be a better fit.\n\n**Other Display Features:**\n\nBoth laptops have some additional display features worth mentioning:\n\n* **HP Envy x360**: The Envy x360's display features HP's \"Micro-Edge\" design, which reduces the bezels and provides a more immersive viewing experience. It also has a feature called \"HP Display Assistant,\" which allows you to adjust the display settings to optimize power consumption and performance.\n* **Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1**: The Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1's display has a feature called \"Dell Cinema,\" which provides a more cinematic viewing experience with enhanced color and sound. It also has a \"ComfortView\" feature, which reduces blue light emission to reduce eye strain.\n\nConsidering your concerns about viewing angles, the HP Envy x360 might be a better fit. Its wider viewing angles and better display quality make it more suitable for use in different environments.\n\nHow do you think these display features will influence your decision?",
