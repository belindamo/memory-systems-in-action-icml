I recently finished \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid, which was a real page-turner. I got the book as a recommendation from my friend Sarah, and I'm so glad I did. Have you got any other recommendations that are more focused on character development and relationships, like \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\"?",
