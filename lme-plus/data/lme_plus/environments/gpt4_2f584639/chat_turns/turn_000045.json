Freeing up space by deleting old photos and videos is a great start, but there are many other ways to optimize your storage. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your phone's storage:\n\n1. **Delete unused apps**: Get rid of apps you no longer use or need. Go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Downloaded apps** and uninstall any apps that are no longer useful.\n2. **Clear app cache and data**: Many apps store cache and data on your phone, which can take up a significant amount of space. Go to **Settings** > **Storage** > **Internal storage** > **Apps** and clear the cache and data for individual apps.\n3. **Use the \"Files by Google\" app**: This app helps you free up space by deleting unnecessary files, such as duplicate files, temporary files, and files you've already backed up.\n4. **Enable \"Smart Storage\"**: Go to **Settings** > **Storage** > **Internal storage** and enable \"Smart Storage.\" This feature automatically deletes unnecessary files, such as thumbnails and other temporary files, when your storage is running low.\n5. **Compress files**: You can compress files and folders to reduce their size. Use an app like \"Files by Google\" or \"WinZip\" to compress files.\n6. **Move files to the cloud**: Consider moving your files, such as photos and videos, to cloud storage services like Google Drive, Google Photos, or OneDrive. This will free up space on your phone and allow you to access your files from anywhere.\n7. **Use a microSD card**: If your phone has a microSD card slot, consider using a microSD card to expand your storage capacity. This is especially useful for storing large files like videos and photos.\n8. **Delete system logs**: System logs can take up space on your phone. Go to **Settings** > **Storage** > **Internal storage** > **System data** and delete system logs.\n9. **Clear browser cache**: Your browser cache can also take up space. Go to your browser's settings and clear the cache and cookies.\n10. **Perform a factory reset**: If you've tried all the above steps and still need to free up space, you can perform a factory reset. This will erase all your data, so be sure to back up your phone before doing so.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to free up a significant amount of space on your phone. Remember to regularly clean up your storage to prevent clutter from building up again.\n\nNow, go ahead and try recalibrating your fingerprint sensor.
