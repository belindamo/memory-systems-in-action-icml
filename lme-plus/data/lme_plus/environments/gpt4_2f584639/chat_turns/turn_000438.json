This system enables players to perform high-damage combos, escape pressure, and even turn the tide of battle.\n\n**How do Roman Cancels work?**\n\nRoman Cancels are performed by inputting a specific button combination during a move's recovery period. When done correctly, the move will be canceled, and you can immediately perform another attack. Here's a breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify cancelable moves**: Not all moves can be Roman Canceled. Look for moves with a \"RC\" icon next to them in the move list or during gameplay. These moves can be canceled.\n2. **Input the cancel command**: During the recovery period of a cancelable move, input the Roman Cancel command: `236H` ( Quarter-circle forward + Heavy Slash). The exact timing is crucial, as you need to input the command before the move's recovery period ends.\n3. **Cancel into another move**: Immediately after inputting the Roman Cancel command, you can perform another attack. This can be a normal move, a special move, or even another Roman Cancel.\n4. **Linking moves**: To create complex combos, you'll need to link multiple moves together using Roman Cancels. This requires precise timing and practice to execute successfully.\n\n**Tips for executing Roman Cancels:**\n\n* **Practice your timing**: Roman Cancels require precise timing. Practice canceling moves during training mode to develop your sense of timing.\n* **Use the correct button**: Make sure to use the Heavy Slash button (H) for Roman Cancels, as it has a longer range and more invincibility frames than the Medium Slash button (M).\n* **Focus on the move's recovery**: Pay attention to the move's recovery period, as this is when you need to input the Roman Cancel command.\n* **Start with simple combos**: Begin with short combos and gradually increase the complexity as you become more comfortable with Roman Cancels.\n* **Experiment with different characters**: Each character has their own unique moveset and Roman Cancel opportunities. Experimenting with different characters will help you develop your skills and adapt to different playstyles.\n\n**Ky Kiske's Roman Cancels:**\n\nAs Ky Kiske, you can Roman Cancel his following moves:\n\n* 5H (Heavy Slash)\n* 2H (Crouching Heavy Slash)\n* j.H (Jumping Heavy Slash)\n* 236H (Quarter-circle forward + Heavy Slash, his special move \"Stun Edge\")\n\nPractice canceling these moves into other attacks, such as his 5M (Medium Slash) or 2M (Crouching Medium Slash), to create simple combos. As you become more comfortable, you can experiment with more complex combos and link multiple Roman Cancels together.\n\nRemember, mastering Roman Cancels takes time and practice. Be patient, stay focused, and you'll be performing complex combos in no time!",
