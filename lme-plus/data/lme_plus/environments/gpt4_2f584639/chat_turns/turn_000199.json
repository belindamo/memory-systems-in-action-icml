I think it's a wonderful way to celebrate your sister's birthday and create a nostalgic atmosphere during the dinner. Including a mix of recent and childhood photos will make the slideshow even more engaging and sentimental.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n**Recent Photos:**\n\n* Include photos from the past year or two, showcasing special moments you've shared with your sister, such as vacations, holidays, or everyday moments that capture your relationship.\n* Consider adding photos of your sister's accomplishments, hobbies, or interests to highlight her passions and personality.\n\n**Childhood Photos:**\n\n* Dig out old family albums or scan old photos to include some childhood memories that will make your sister laugh or feel nostalgic.\n* Choose photos that showcase your sister's personality, milestones, or special moments from your childhood, such as birthdays, holidays, or family vacations.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Keep the slideshow concise, around 5-10 minutes long, to hold everyone's attention.\n* Add captions or short descriptions to provide context for the photos, especially for older photos that might be unfamiliar to younger family members.\n* Set the slideshow to music that resonates with your sister's tastes or nostalgic songs that evoke a sense of nostalgia.\n* Consider creating a special \"title slide\" with a message or a Happy Birthday wish to start the slideshow.\n\nBy including a mix of recent and childhood photos, you'll create a heartwarming and entertaining slideshow that will make your sister feel loved and celebrated on her special day.\n\nHow does that sound?",
