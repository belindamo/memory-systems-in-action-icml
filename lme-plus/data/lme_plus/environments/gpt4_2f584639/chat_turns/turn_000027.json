I've got some tips to help you find shoes that are similar in style to the luxury ones you want, but at a lower price point:\n\n1. **Identify the key features**: Take a close look at the luxury shoes you want and identify the key features that make them special. Is it the unique design, the materials, the color, or the brand's signature details? Make a list of these features to help you find similar shoes.\n2. **Research similar brands**: Look for brands that offer similar styles or aesthetics to the luxury brand you're interested in. You can check out brands that are known for their affordable prices but still offer high-quality products.\n3. **Use online search engines**: Utilize online search engines like Google or Pinterest to search for keywords like \"similar to [brand name] shoes\" or \"[style] shoes under [price point]\". You can also use specific features like \"block heel sandals\" or \"suede ankle boots\" to find similar styles.\n4. **Check out fast fashion retailers**: Fast fashion retailers like Zara, H&M, or ASOS often create affordable versions of trendy shoes. They might not be exact dupes, but they can offer similar styles at a lower price point.\n5. **Discount stores and outlets**: Visit discount stores or outlet malls to find previous seasons' styles from luxury brands at a lower price.

You can find these brands through online marketplaces like Etsy or at local boutiques.\n9. **Read reviews and check the quality**: When shopping for affordable shoes, make sure to read reviews from other customers to ensure the quality is good.
