  "content": "That's great to hear! Toasting the walnuts is a fantastic idea, as it will enhance their flavor and texture. Walnuts can add a wonderful depth and richness to your lemon poppy seed muffins, and the toasted flavor will complement the brightness of the lemon nicely.\n\nRemember to have fun and be flexible during the baking process. Sugar-free baking can be trial-and-error, but it's all about experimenting and finding the right combinations that work for you. Don't be afraid to adjust the recipe as needed, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.\n\nI'm excited to hear how your muffins turn out! If you'd like to share your experience or have any more questions, feel free to reach out anytime. Happy baking!",
