  "content": "Prioritizing players on your cheat sheet involves considering a mix of factors. Here's a breakdown of what to consider for each position:\n\n**Quarterbacks (QBs)**:\n\n1. Past performance: Consistency, total points scored, and yards per game.\n2. Team changes: New coach, system, or receivers can impact QB performance.\n3. Strength of schedule: Easier defenses can boost QB fantasy points.\n4. Rushing ability: Mobile QBs tend to score more fantasy points.\n\n**Running Backs (RBs)**:\n\n1. Workload: Number of carries, targets, and total touches.\n2. Efficiency: Yards per carry, yards per reception, and touchdown rate.\n3. Team's rushing philosophy: Commitment to the run game and goal-line usage.\n4. Injury history: Durability and likelihood of missing games.\n\n**Wide Receivers (WRs)**:\n\n1. Target share: Percentage of team targets and receptions.\n2. Yardage and touchdowns: Total receiving yards and touchdowns.\n3. Quarterback play: Strength of QB play and chemistry with WR.\n4. Team's passing philosophy: Passing volume and play-calling.\n\n**Tight Ends (TEs)**:\n\n1. Target share: Similar to WRs, but with a higher emphasis on red-zone targets.\n2. Quarterback play: TE-friendly QBs can increase TE fantasy production.\n3. Red-zone usage: Goal-line targets and touchdowns.\n4. Blocking ability: TEs who block well tend to see more playing time.\n\n**Kickers (Ks)**:\n\n1. Team's scoring offense: Strong offenses generate more kicking opportunities.\n2. Field goal accuracy: Consistency from various distances.\n3. Extra point attempts: Teams that score more touchdowns provide more XP opportunities.\n4. Strength of schedule: Easier defenses can lead to more scoring chances.\n\n**Defenses/Special Teams (DSTs)**:\n\n1. Strength of schedule: Favorable matchups against weaker offenses.\n2. Defensive stats: Sacks, interceptions, fumble recoveries, and points allowed.\n3. Team's defensive philosophy: Aggressive or bend-but-don't-break approaches.\n4. Home-field advantage: Some teams perform better at home.\n\nWhen creating your cheat sheet, consider the following:\n\n* Tier players: Group players into tiers based on their expected performance. This helps you visualize the drop-off in talent and make more informed decisions during the draft.\n* ADP: Keep an eye on Average Draft Position to ensure you're not reaching for a player too early or waiting too long for a sleeper.\n* Injury risks: Note players with injury concerns or those who have a history of missing games.\n* Sleepers and breakout candidates: Identify players who could exceed expectations and provide value in the mid-to-late rounds.\n\nRemember to stay flexible and adjust your cheat sheet as the preseason unfolds. Injuries, coaching changes, and training camp performances can impact player values, so be prepared to make changes accordingly.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about prioritizing players at a particular position?",
