Here's how to properly perform the exercise:\n\n1. **Leg Press:**\n\t* Sit down on a leg press machine with your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform.\n\t* Push the platform away from you, extending your legs.\n\t* Lower the platform back down to the starting position, squeezing your quadriceps and hamstrings as you do so.\n\t* Repeat for the desired number of reps and sets.\n2. **Leg Extensions:**\n\t* Sit down on a leg extension machine with your legs extended out in front of you.\n\t* Lift the weight up off the ground, keeping your legs straight.\n\t* Lower the weight back down to the starting position, squeezing your quadriceps as you do so.\n\t* Repeat for the desired number of reps and sets.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a weight that allows you to complete the desired number of reps with good form.\n* Keep your back straight and your core engaged throughout the exercise.\n* Focus on squeezing your quadriceps and hamstrings as you extend your legs.\n* Avoid using momentum or jerking the weight up, as this can put unnecessary stress on your joints.\n\n**Deadlifts:**\n\nThe deadlifts exercise targets the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back. Here's how to properly perform the exercise:\n\n1. **Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed straight ahead or slightly outward.**\n2. **Bend down and grasp the weight or barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.**\n3. **Lift the weight up off the ground, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.**\n4. **Stand up, squeezing your glutes and pushing your hips back.**\n5. **Lower the weight back down to the starting position, keeping control throughout the entire movement.**\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a weight that allows you to complete the desired number of reps with good form.\n* Keep your back straight and your core engaged throughout the exercise.\n* Focus on squeezing your glutes and pushing your hips back as you stand up.\n* Avoid rounding your back or using momentum to lift the weight, as this can put unnecessary stress on your joints.\n* Keep the weight close to your body as you lift, avoiding any swinging or jerking motions.\n\nRemember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you build strength and confidence in your form. It's also a good idea to work with a personal trainer or fitness coach to ensure you're performing the exercises correctly and safely.",
