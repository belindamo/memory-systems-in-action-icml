  "content": "Substituting almond flour with coconut flour and reducing the stevia amount are both viable options, but keep in mind that it will affect the final texture and flavor of the muffins.\n\n**Substituting Almond Flour with Coconut Flour:**\n\nCoconut flour is a great option for sugar-free baking, but it absorbs more liquid than almond flour. To make this substitution work, you'll need to:\n\n1. **Increase the liquid content**: Coconut flour can absorb up to 3-4 times its weight in liquid. Start by adding an extra 1-2 tablespoons of milk or yogurt to the recipe and adjust as needed.\n2. **Adjust the ratio of coconut flour**: Use 1 1/4 cups of coconut flour instead of 1 1/2 cups, as coconut flour is more dense.\n3. **Be prepared for a denser texture**: Coconut flour can make baked goods more dense and heavy. This might not be a bad thing, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\n**Reducing Stevia Powder:**\n\nReducing the stevia powder to 1/8 teaspoon is a good idea if you prefer less sweetness. However, keep in mind that stevia can have a bitter or licorice-like aftertaste, especially when used in small quantities. You may want to:\n\n1. **Start with 1/8 teaspoon and adjust**: Taste the batter as you go and add more stevia powder if needed.\n2. **Consider adding a flavor enhancer**: A pinch of salt or a teaspoon of vanilla extract can help balance the flavor and reduce the bitterness of the stevia.\n\n**Revised Recipe:**\n\nHere's the revised recipe with the substitutions and adjustments:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/4 cups coconut flour\n* 1/4 teaspoon stevia powder (or 1 drop stevia liquid extract)\n* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted\n* 2 large eggs\n* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1-2 tablespoons lemon zest\n* 1 1/2 cups plain Greek yogurt (or milk)\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1 tablespoon poppy seeds\n\nInstructions remain the same as before.\n\nRemember to monitor the batter's consistency and adjust the liquid content as needed. The coconut flour will absorb more liquid, so be prepared to add more milk or yogurt.\n\nPlease let me know how your experiment turns out! I'm curious to hear about your experience with coconut flour and reduced stevia in this recipe.",
