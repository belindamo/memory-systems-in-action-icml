Raising the toilet paper holder can be a simple DIY task, but it's great that you want to do it properly to avoid an awkward look.\n\nHere are some tips to help you raise the toilet paper holder successfully:\n\n**1. Measure twice, drill once**: Measure the distance from the floor to the desired height of the toilet paper holder, taking into account the height of the toilet seat and the comfort level of your partner. Make sure to measure carefully to avoid drilling unnecessary holes.\n\n**2. Choose the right screws**: Use screws that are designed for bathroom fixtures and can hold the weight of the toilet paper holder. You may need to get longer screws or special anchor screws for a secure hold.\n\n**3. Mark the spot**: Use a level and a pencil to mark the spot where you want to drill the new hole. Make sure the mark is straight and level.\n\n**4. Drill carefully**: Use a drill bit that's slightly smaller than the screw to create a pilot hole. Then, use a screwdriver or an Allen wrench to screw the holder into place.\n\n**5. Test and adjust**: Once you've installed the toilet paper holder, test it to make sure it's at a comfortable height and doesn't look out of place. Make any necessary adjustments to the position or height.\n\n**6. Consider the style**: If you're replacing the entire toilet paper holder, choose a style that matches the existing fixtures in your bathroom. This will help the new holder blend in and avoid looking awkward.\n\n**7. Add a decorative touch**: If you want to add a decorative touch, consider adding a toilet paper holder with a decorative cover or a unique design. This can help distract from the fact that the holder is higher than usual.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to raise the toilet paper holder to a comfortable height for your partner without it looking awkward or out of place. Remember to communicate with your partner throughout the process to ensure you're both happy with the result.\n\nGood luck, and I hope this helps you achieve toilet paper holder harmony in your bathroom!",
