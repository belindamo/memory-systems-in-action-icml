  "content": "Quasars and AGNs do not pose any direct danger to us here on Earth. They are extremely far away from us and their radiation is highly directional, meaning it is not spread uniformly in all directions. \n\nHowever, the radiation emitted by quasars and AGNs can pose a danger to any spacecraft or satellites that are in their vicinity, as well as to any astronauts that may be traveling near them. The high-energy radiation can damage electronic components and cause malfunctions or even total failures.\n\nAdditionally, studying the high-energy radiation from quasars and AGNs can help us better understand the potential dangers of similar radiation sources that are closer to us, such as the radiation produced by solar flares and coronal mass ejections from the Sun. Understanding and predicting these space weather events can help protect our technology and infrastructure on Earth.",
