Here are some that might particularly interest you:\n\n1. **The Alice Network** by Kate Quinn: This novel has two female protagonists, Charlie and Eve, who are both fiercely determined and brave in their own ways. Charlie is a socialite who joins the Alice Network, a real-life spy ring, and Eve is a spy who becomes her mentor.\n2. **The Lost Girls of Paris** by Pam Jenoff: The main character, Grace, is a young widow who becomes embroiled in a resistance network. She's a strong and resourceful protagonist who drives the story forward.\n3. **The Women in the Castle** by Jessica Shattuck: This novel follows three women, Marianne, Benita, and Ania, each with their own unique experiences during WWII. They're all strong, complex characters who find ways to survive and resist in their own ways.\n4. **The Soldier's Wife** by Pam Jenoff: This novel is told from the perspective of a young German woman, Frieda, whose life is turned upside down when her husband is called to fight on the front lines. It's a powerful exploration of the home front and the struggles women faced during wartime.\n5. **The Red Tent** by Anita Diamant: While not exclusively set during wartime, this novel is a powerful exploration of female experience and identity. Dinah's story is a testament to the strength and resilience of women throughout history.\n\nThese books all feature female protagonists or focus on the female experience during times of war and upheaval. I think you'll find them to be compelling and thought-provoking reads!\n\nAdditionally, if you're interested in more books with strong female characters, you might enjoy:\n\n* **The Girl You Left Behind** by Jojo Moyes (WWI-era novel with a strong female protagonist)\n* **The Women of the Cousins' War** by Philippa Gregory (a collection of short stories about women during the Wars of the Roses)\n* **The Rose Code** by Kate Quinn (a novel about three women codebreakers at Bletchley Park during WWII)\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any other specific preferences!",
