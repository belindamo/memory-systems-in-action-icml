  "content": "It is recommended to soak your feet in warm water for 15-20 minutes, two to three times a week, to prevent dryness and cracked heels. As for the amount of water, you should use enough water to cover your feet up to your ankles. However, you should not soak your feet for too long or use hot water, as this can cause further dryness and damage to the skin.",
