  "content": "Adding chopped walnuts can be a great idea! Walnuts can complement the brightness of the lemon and the crunch of the poppy seeds nicely. However, it's essential to balance the flavors and textures so that the walnuts don't overpower the other ingredients.\n\n**Tips for adding chopped walnuts:**\n\n1. **Use a moderate amount**: Start with 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess walnuts from the batter.\n2. ** Toast the walnuts**: Lightly toasting the walnuts in a 350\u00b0F oven for 5-7 minutes or in a pan over medium heat can enhance their flavor and texture. Let them cool before chopping.\n3. **Choose the right walnut type**: English walnuts or black walnuts can work well in this recipe. English walnuts are milder and sweeter, while black walnuts have a stronger, earthier flavor.\n4. **Fold in the walnuts gently**: After adding the walnuts to the batter, fold them in gently to avoid crushing or breaking them.\n5. **Consider the texture**: If you're using coconut flour, the muffins might be denser. The chopped walnuts can add a nice texture contrast, but be mindful of the overall texture balance.\n\n**Balancing the flavors:**\n\nTo ensure the walnuts don't overpower the lemon and poppy seed flavors:\n\n1. **Don't overdo the walnuts**: Start with a moderate amount and taste as you go.\n2. **Adjust the lemon juice**: If you find the walnuts overpowering the lemon flavor, add a bit more lemon juice to balance it out.\n3. **Emphasize the poppy seeds**: Make sure to use a generous amount of poppy seeds to maintain their presence in the muffins.\n\nBy following these tips, you can successfully incorporate chopped walnuts into your lemon poppy seed muffin recipe and create a delicious, textured, and flavorful treat!",
