However, it's safe to say that there will be a continuation of Kratos and Atreus' story in God of War Ragnarok. The previous game leaves many open questions about Atreus' true identity and his role in the world, so it's likely that the new game will delve deeper into this topic. It's also possible that the game will introduce new gods and creatures from various mythologies, as the previous games focused solely on Greek mythology. Overall, there is a lot of speculation and anticipation among gamers regarding God of War Ragnarok, and it will be interesting to see how the game lives up to the expectations.",
