  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. Here is an alternative option for a late-night dinner and live music experience near the Hilton New Orleans Riverside:\n\n1. Bar Marilou: Located in the Warehouse District, Bar Marilou offers a sophisticated atmosphere with craft cocktails, a selection of small plates, and live music or DJ sets on select nights. The bar is open until midnight or later, depending on the day of the week. While the food menu is limited, you can still enjoy a late-night snack and great music. Check their website or call ahead to confirm live music schedules and hours of operation.\n\nTo include Bar Marilou in your Friday evening itinerary, the adjusted schedule is as follows:\n\n8:00 PM: Join the Ghost Tour with your chosen provider\n9:30 PM: Wrap up the tour and head to Bar Marilou for a late-night snack, drinks, and live music\n11:30 PM - 12:00 AM: Head back to your hotel after enjoying your time at Bar Marilou\n\nAlternatively, you can also check out other bars and clubs in the French Quarter, as many of them offer live music and late-night dining options. Keep in mind that schedules and hours may vary, so it's always a good idea to confirm in advance.",
