  "content": "Using cold water instead of warm water may not be as effective in softening the skin on your feet. Warm water is more effective in opening pores and hydrating the skin. However, you can use lukewarm water which is not too hot or too cold, for the best results. Also, it is not recommended to soak your feet for longer than 20 minutes, as this can strip your skin of its natural oils and cause further dryness. If you need to soak your feet for longer, take a break and let your feet dry completely before soaking them again. Always be gentle while rubbing your feet with a towel or pumice stone to avoid any damage.",
