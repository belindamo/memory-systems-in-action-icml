  "content": "Incorporating lemon zest and adjusting the liquid content are crucial steps in making delicious lemon poppy seed muffins with stevia.\n\n**Incorporating Lemon Zest:**\n\n1. **Choose the right lemons**: Opt for organic, unwaxed lemons for the best flavor and aroma.\n2. **Zest carefully**: Use a microplane or fine grater to zest the lemons, making sure to only grate the outer, colorful layer of the peel. Avoid the white pith, as it can add bitterness.\n3. **Use the right amount**: Use about 1-2 tablespoons of lemon zest for the entire recipe. You can adjust to taste, but this is a good starting point.\n4. **Add zest to the dry ingredients**: Mix the lemon zest with the flour, baking powder, and salt to distribute the flavor evenly.\n\n**Adjusting Liquid Content with Stevia:**\n\n1. **Stevia's sweetness concentration**: Since stevia is much sweeter than sugar, you'll need less liquid in the recipe. Start with a smaller amount of liquid and adjust as needed.\n2. **Start with a lower liquid ratio**: Begin with a 1:1 ratio of eggs to liquid (e.g., 2 eggs and 2 tablespoons of milk or yogurt). You can adjust this ratio based on the batter's consistency.\n3. **Add liquid incrementally**: Mix the wet ingredients separately and add them to the dry ingredients gradually, starting with the eggs and then adding the milk or yogurt. Stop adding liquid when the batter reaches a thick, but still pourable, consistency.\n4. **Consider the stevia's texture**: Stevia can make baked goods more dense. If you find the batter too thick, add a little more liquid. If it's too thin, add a little more flour.\n\n**Lemon Poppy Seed Muffin Recipe (Stevia-based)**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups almond flour\n* 1/2 cup coconut flour\n* 1/4 teaspoon stevia powder (or 2 drops stevia liquid extract)\n* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted\n* 2 large eggs\n* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1-2 tablespoons lemon zest\n* 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt (or milk)\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1 tablespoon poppy seeds\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, coconut flour, stevia powder, baking powder, and salt.\n3. In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract.\n4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.\n5. Add the Greek yogurt (or milk) and mix until the batter reaches the desired consistency.\n6. Fold in the poppy seeds.\n7. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups.\n8. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to adjust the stevia amount to your taste preferences.\n* If using stevia liquid extract, start with 1 drop and adjust to taste.\n* Don't overmix the batter, as this can lead to dense muffins.\n* These muffins will be more dense than traditional muffins due to the sugar-free ingredients.\n\nI hope this helps!
