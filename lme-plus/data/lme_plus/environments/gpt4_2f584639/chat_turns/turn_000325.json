I'm glad I could assist you in getting started with your fantasy football prep.\n\nRemember to stay flexible and adapt to any changes that might occur before the draft. Keep an eye on preseason news, injuries, and training camp performances, as they can impact player values.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to come back and ask. Good luck with your draft, and I hope you dominate your fantasy league!\n\n(And don't worry about the NBA and MLB mix-ups \u2013 we've all been there!)",
