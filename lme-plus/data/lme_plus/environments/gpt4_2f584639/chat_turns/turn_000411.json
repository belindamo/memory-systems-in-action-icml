Set Priorities: Make a list of tasks, and identify which tasks are most important and need to be done first.\n\n2. Use a Schedule: Create a schedule based on priorities with time allotted for each task, goal or objective.\n\n3. Avoid Procrastination: Try to avoid procrastinating and work on the listed tasks as soon as possible.\n\n4. Time Batching Technique: Use time batching, which is a process of grouping similar tasks together and completing them in one go.\n\n5. Pomodoro Technique: Another popular technique is the Pomodoro technique, which involves setting a timer for 25-minute intervals and focusing solely on an assigned task for that time frame.\n\n6. Use Tools: Take advantage of technology and use calendars, alarms, apps, or other tools to set reminders, goals, and deadlines.\n\n7. Time Audit: Conduct a time audit to figure out how much time is spent on various tasks and try to minimize unproductive activities in the day.\n\nOverall, time management is a skill that can be improved through mindful planning, discipline, and consistent effort.",
