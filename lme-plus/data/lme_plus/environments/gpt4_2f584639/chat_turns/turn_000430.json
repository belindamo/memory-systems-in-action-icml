Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master of character-driven stories, and it's great that you're looking for more books that focus on character development and relationships. While I don't have personal recommendations (I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or opinions), I can suggest some books that might fit the bill:\n\n**Character-Driven Sci-Fi and Fantasy:**\n\n1. **The Power** by Naomi Alderman - While you mentioned you're already reading this, it's a great example of a book that combines sci-fi and fantasy elements with a strong focus on character development and relationships.\n2. **The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers - This novel is known for its character-driven storytelling, exploring themes of identity, community, and acceptance in a sci-fi setting.\n3. **The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August** by Claire North - This thought-provoking novel explores reincarnation, time travel, and human connection, with a strong focus on character development and relationships.\n4. **The City of Brass** by S.A.

It's a character-driven story with a strong focus on relationships and identity.\n5. **The House of Shattered Wings** by Aliette de Bodard - This dark fantasy novel is set in a post-apocalyptic Paris and follows a young man who's trying to survive in a world of fallen angels and rival houses. It's a character-driven story that explores themes of identity, power, and relationships.\n\n**Other Recommendations:**\n\n1. **The Night Circus** by Erin Morgenstern - This magical realist novel is a character-driven story that explores the competition and romance between two young magicians in a mystical circus.\n2. **The Golem and the Jinni** by Helene Wecker - This historical fantasy novel is a character-driven story that explores the lives of a golem and a jinni in early 20th-century New York City.\n3. **The Song of Achilles** by Madeline Miller - This historical fantasy novel is a character-driven story that reimagines the Trojan War from the perspective of Achilles' lover, Patroclus.\n4. **The Bear and the Nightingale** by Katherine Arden - This fantasy novel is a character-driven story that explores the life of a young girl with the power to communicate with the spirits of nature in medieval Russia.\n5. **The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang - This fantasy novel is a character-driven story that explores the life of a young orphan who enrolls in a prestigious military academy and discovers her latent powers.\n\nThese books all share elements of character-driven storytelling, relationships, and sci-fi or fantasy elements that you might enjoy.
