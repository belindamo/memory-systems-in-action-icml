I'm happy to help you with some tips and recipe ideas.\n\n**Stevia ratio adjustments:**\nBefore we dive into new recipes, let's discuss stevia ratios. Stevia is approximately 200-300 times sweeter than sugar, so only a small amount is needed to achieve the same sweetness level. A common starting point is to replace 1 cup of sugar with 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of stevia powder or 2 to 4 drops of stevia liquid extract. You can adjust this ratio based on your personal taste preferences. Keep in mind that stevia can have a bitter or licorice-like aftertaste, so it's essential to taste as you go and adjust the sweetness level accordingly.\n\n**Sugar substitutes:**\nIf you're looking to experiment with other sugar substitutes, here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Erythritol**: A sugar alcohol that's virtually calorie-free and doesn't raise blood sugar levels. It can be used 1:1 with sugar.\n2. **Monk fruit sweetener**: A natural sweetener made from a type of melon. It's 150-200 times sweeter than sugar, so use sparingly.\n3. **Yacon syrup**: A sweetener made from the root of the yacon plant. It's low on the glycemic index and contains prebiotic fibers.\n4. **Honey or maple syrup** (in moderation): While still a sugar, these natural sweeteners have a lower glycemic index than refined sugar.\n\n**Sugar-free baked goods recipes:**\n\n1. **Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins (Stevia-based)**\n\t* Replace sugar with 1/4 teaspoon stevia powder or 2 drops stevia liquid extract.\n\t* Add lemon zest, juice, and poppy seeds for a refreshing flavor combination.\n2. **Chocolate Avocado Muffins (Erythritol-based)**\n\t* Use 1:1 erythritol instead of sugar.\n\t* Add mashed avocado for moisture and healthy fats.\n3. **Cinnamon Apple Coffee Cake (Monk Fruit Sweetener-based)**\n\t* Replace sugar with 1/4 teaspoon monk fruit sweetener powder.\n\t* Add diced apples and cinnamon for a delicious fall-inspired flavor.\n4. **Pumpkin Spice Muffins (Yacon Syrup-based)**\n\t* Use yacon syrup in place of sugar (1:1 ratio).\n\t* Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, and nutmeg for a seasonal treat.\n\n**General tips:**\n\n1. **Use a combination of sweeteners**: Blend different sugar substitutes to achieve a balanced flavor.\n2. **Don't overmix**: Sugar-free baked goods can be more dense; mix wet and dry ingredients separately to prevent overmixing.\n3. **Adjust liquid content**: Sugar-free baked goods may require more or less liquid depending on the sweetener used.\n4. **Experiment with spices**: Spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, or cardamom can enhance flavor without adding sugar.\n\nFeel free to experiment with these recipes and tips, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or need further assistance!",
