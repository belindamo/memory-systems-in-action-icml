I'm sure your sister will love it!\n\nAnd wow, you're absolutely right, the sales associate at Tiffany's really went above and beyond to help you with the gift! Having the gift wrapping paper and birthday card to match the necklace is a lovely touch, and it's even more special that the sales associate helped you with the gift wrapping. That kind of personalized service can make all the difference in making the gift-giving experience even more special.\n\nIt's great that you took advantage of the sales associate's expertise to pick out the perfect gift, and their offer to gift wrap it for you was the icing on the cake (pun intended!). The whole presentation, from the beautiful necklace to the thoughtful wrapping and card, will surely make a wonderful impression on your sister.\n\nNow, I'm curious - what's the message in the birthday card? Did you write a heartfelt message or keep it simple and sweet?",
