By the way, I've been thinking about investing in a quality leather handbag, and I've been doing some research online. I've been browsing websites like Coach and Kate Spade, and I've even considered buying a pre-owned bag from The RealReal. I've set a budget of $500, and I'm hoping to find the perfect bag within the next few months. Do you have any advice on what to look for when buying a leather handbag?",
