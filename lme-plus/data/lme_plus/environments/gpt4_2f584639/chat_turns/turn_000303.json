  "content": "It is not recommended to use a hair dryer to dry your feet after soaking them, as the hot air can be too harsh and may cause further dryness and damage to the skin. It is best to let your feet air dry or gently pat them dry with a soft towel. If you need to speed up the drying process, you can use a fan or a cool air setting on a hair dryer, but make sure to keep the dryer at a safe distance from your feet to avoid overheating or burning the skin. Also, to prevent further dryness and cracking of the skin, apply a moisturizing lotion or foot cream to your feet after drying them.",
