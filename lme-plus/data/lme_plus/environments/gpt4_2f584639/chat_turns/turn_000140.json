Clean the mirror regularly**: Try to clean the mirror at least once a week to prevent streaks and spots from building up. You can even make it a part of your daily routine, like when you brush your teeth or wash your face.\n\n**2. Use a microfiber cloth**: Microfiber cloths are amazing for cleaning mirrors because they're gentle and effective at removing streaks and spots. You can use them with or without a cleaning solution.\n\n**3. Dry the mirror after cleaning**: After cleaning the mirror, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe it down and remove any excess moisture. This helps prevent water spots from forming.\n\n**4. Avoid touching the mirror**: Try to avoid touching the mirror with your bare hands, as the oils from your skin can leave streaks and spots. If you need to touch the mirror, make sure your hands are clean and dry.\n\n**5. Use a streak-free glass cleaner**: Look for glass cleaners that are specifically designed to be streak-free or ammonia-free. These products can help reduce streaks and residue.\n\n**6. Avoid using too much cleaning solution**: Using too much cleaning solution can leave behind a residue that can attract streaks and spots. Use a light mist or a small amount of solution to clean the mirror.\n\n**7. Clean the mirror in a circular motion**: When cleaning the mirror, use a circular motion to wipe the surface. This helps prevent streaks from forming.\n\n**8. Consider using a mirror cleaning product with a protective coating**: There are specialized mirror cleaning products that leave a protective coating on the mirror's surface. This coating can help repel streaks and spots, making cleaning easier.\n\nAs for the toilet paper holder, it's great that you're having a discussion with your partner about it! Communication is key in any relationship. Maybe you can find a compromise, like adjusting the holder to a height that works for both of you.\n\nI hope these tips help you keep your mirror streak-free for longer!",
