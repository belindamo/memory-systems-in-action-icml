A high average order value indicates that our customers are purchasing more items or more expensive items, while a low average order value may indicate a need to improve upselling and cross-selling strategies.\n4. Customer acquisition cost: This KPI measures the cost of acquiring a new customer, including marketing and advertising expenses.
