      "content": "Thank you for providing more details!\n\nBased on your description, it's possible that the issue is related to your internet connection or Wi-Fi network. Here are some additional troubleshooting steps you can try:\n\n1. **Check your internet speed**: Use an online speed test tool (e.g. speedtest.net) to check your internet speed during peak hours. Ensure that your internet plan provides a minimum speed of 5 Mbps for HD streaming and 25 Mbps for 4K streaming. If your speed is lower than this, it may cause buffering and pixelation.\n2. **Optimize your Wi-Fi network**:\n\t* Move your router to a central location in your home to improve Wi-Fi coverage.\n\t* Restart your router and modem regularly to ensure they're functioning properly.\n\t* Consider upgrading your router's firmware to the latest version.\n\t* Use a Wi-Fi analyzer app (e.g. WiFi Analyzer) to scan for nearby networks and change your router's channel to one with less interference.\n3. **Check for interference from other devices**:\n\t* Other devices in your home may be causing interference with your Wi-Fi signal. Try moving devices that use the same frequency band (e.g. cordless phones, microwaves) away from your router.\n4. **Reduce device congestion**:\n\t* If you have multiple devices connected to your Wi-Fi network, try disconnecting some of them to reduce congestion.\n5. **Check your smart TV's Netflix app**:\n\t* Ensure that the Netflix app is up to date on your smart TV.\n\t* Try deleting and reinstalling the Netflix app on your TV.\n6. **Contact your internet service provider**:\n\t* Reach out to your ISP to check if there are any outages or maintenance in your area that could be affecting your internet connection.\n\t* Ask if they can check your internet speed and quality to ensure it's meeting the minimum requirements for streaming.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that the problem lies with Netflix's servers or your smart TV's Netflix app. You can try contacting Netflix support directly to report the issue and see if they can assist you further.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"
