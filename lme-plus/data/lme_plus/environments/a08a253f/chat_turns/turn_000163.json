  "content": "The fresh parsley will definitely add a bright, fresh flavor to your garlic bread. It's a great way to elevate the dish and complement the veal Parmesan and saut\u00e9ed spinach.\n\nAnd, haha, I think we've already discussed the carne asada tacos, but I'm glad to hear you enjoyed them! It's always great to find a new spot with delicious food and generous portions. Leftovers can be the best, especially when you can enjoy them for lunch the next day.\n\nNow, back to your Italian feast: I think you've got all the bases covered with the veal Parmesan, saut\u00e9ed spinach, and garlic bread. Buon appetito! If you have any more questions or need any further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a wonderful time cooking and enjoying your meal!",
