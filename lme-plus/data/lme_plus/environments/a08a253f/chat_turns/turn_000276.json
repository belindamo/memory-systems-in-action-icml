  "content": "If people are unable to evacuate during a disaster in Queensland, there are still things they can do to increase their chances of staying safe:\n\n1. Seek shelter: Seek shelter in the strongest and most secure part of your home or building, away from windows and doors. Choose a room with solid walls and a strong roof, such as a bathroom or pantry.\n\n2. Stock up on supplies: If you are unable to evacuate, ensure you have stocked up on essential supplies such as food, water, and first aid supplies. Also, keep a battery-operated radio and torch handy.\n\n3. Stay informed: Stay informed about the disaster by listening to the radio or television for updates and warnings of dangerous conditions.\n\n4. Have a plan: Have a plan in place for how you will communicate with family and friends, and what steps you will take in case of emergency.\n\n5. Stay calm: Stay calm and avoid panic. Panic often leads to poor decision-making, which can put you in even greater danger.\n\nIt's important to remember that these tips are only recommendations for people who find themselves unable to evacuate during a disaster. If it is recommended or ordered to evacuate by the authorities, it is always safer to heed that advice as it may be dangerous to stay behind.",
