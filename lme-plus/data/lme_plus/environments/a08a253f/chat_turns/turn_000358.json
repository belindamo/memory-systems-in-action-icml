Let it cool down to a comfortable temperature for your nasal passages (around 80\u00b0F to 90\u00b0F or 27\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C).\n2. **Measure the salt:** Measure out 1/4 teaspoon of salt into the container. You can use a measuring spoon or a small scale to ensure accuracy.\n3. **Add the salt to the water:** Pour the cooled-down water into the container with the salt. Stir until the salt is fully dissolved.\n4. **Add baking soda (optional):** If you're using baking soda, add 1/2 teaspoon to the solution. Baking soda helps to reduce the acidity of the solution and can make it more comfortable for your nasal passages.\n5. **Stir and mix:** Stir the solution well to ensure the salt and baking soda (if using) are fully dissolved.\n6. **Store the solution:** Store the solution in a clean, sterile container. You can use a glass or plastic bottle with a tight-fitting lid.\n\n**Types of Salt:**\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a salt, you'll want to use a non-iodized and pure salt. Here are some options:\n\n* **Sea salt:** Unrefined sea salt is a good option, as it contains natural minerals and is less processed.\n* **Kosher salt:** Kosher salt is another good option, as it's coarser and less processed than table salt.\n* **Pickling salt:** Pickling salt is a good choice, as it's pure and doesn't contain additives.\n\nAvoid using:\n\n* **Table salt:** Table salt often contains additives like iodine and anti-caking agents, which can irritate your nasal passages.\n* **Rock salt:** Rock salt is too coarse and may not dissolve properly in water.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use sterile or distilled water to reduce the risk of contamination.\n* Make a fresh solution each time you irrigate to ensure the solution is clean and effective.\n* If you're unsure about the type of salt to use or have any concerns, consult with your healthcare provider or ENT specialist.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
