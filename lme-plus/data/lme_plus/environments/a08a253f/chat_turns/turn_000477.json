Here is a simplified paragraph about \"Traffic\" that is suitable for A1 level reading comprehension:\n\nTraffic includes different ways of getting around, such as cars, buses, trains, and bicycles. By reading about traffic, you can learn about traffic rules, safety, and different ways to travel. You can also read about common problems in traffic, like traffic jams and construction, and how to deal with them.
