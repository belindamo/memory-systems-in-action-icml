  "content": "The quote \"never let a good crisis go to waste\" is attributed to Rahm Emanuel, an American politician who served as White House Chief of Staff under President Barack Obama. He made this statement during the early stages of the 2008 financial crisis, when the new administration was preparing to take office in January 2009. The context of Emanuel's quote was to emphasize the idea that crises can create opportunities for significant changes, reforms, or innovations that might otherwise be difficult to achieve under normal circumstances. In this case, the Obama administration was looking to address several major policy issues, including healthcare reform, financial regulation, and clean energy investments.",
