Offering a wider range of sizes: Some brands like New Balance, ASICS, and Brooks offer extended size options for customers with larger or smaller feet. Additionally, some brands like Adidas, use a digital fitting system that can recommend the perfect size and fit for the customer.\n2. Catering to customers with orthotics: Some brands like ASICS, New Balance and HOKA One One, offer shoes that have a removable insole, which allows customers who wear orthotics to use their own inserts. Some other brands also offer shoes that have a wider toe box that can accommodate orthotics.\n3. Creating shoes for specific activities: Some brands like Salomon, Merrell, and La Sportiva, offer shoes that are designed specifically for trail running and other outdoor activities. They have more aggressive tread patterns and better grip, more protection, and more durability.\n\nOther brands have also adopted some of these strategies, such as Nike who have a running shoe line specifically designed for wide feet, or Under Armour that have a line of shoes for orthotics wearers. In general, many brands are becoming more aware of the need to cater to customers with specific needs, as it is a way to differentiate themselves from the competition and attract a wider range of customers.",
