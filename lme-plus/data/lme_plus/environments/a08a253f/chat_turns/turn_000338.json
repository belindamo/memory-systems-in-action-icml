Soup and sandwich: Prep a big batch of soup (e.g., lentil, vegetable, or black bean) and portion it out with whole grain bread or crackers.\n\n**Dinner Ideas**\n\n1. Slow cooker meals: Throw all the ingredients for a meal (e.g., chili, chicken fajitas, vegetable curry) into a slow cooker in the morning, and come home to a ready-to-eat meal.\n2.
