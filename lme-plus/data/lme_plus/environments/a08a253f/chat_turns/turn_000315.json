  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I'll definitely try to incorporate those poses into my yoga routine on Wednesdays. I've been feeling a bit tight in my shoulders and chest lately, so the chest opener and shoulder stretches you mentioned earlier will be really helpful. Also, I've been thinking about trying some new yoga styles, like hot yoga or restorative yoga. Do you have any recommendations for which style would be best for me, considering my weightlifting background and goals?",
