That's a great idea!\n\nIt's fantastic that you've noticed a positive impact on your energy levels when you walk to the office. Incorporating more physical activity into your daily routine can have numerous benefits, such as:\n\n* **Boosting energy levels**: As you've already experienced, walking can help increase your energy levels and wakefulness.\n* **Improving mental health**: Regular physical activity has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health and mood.\n* **Increasing productivity**: Taking a short walk can help clear your mind and prepare you for the workday ahead.\n\nConsidering the benefits, I think it's a great idea to get off the train one stop earlier and walk to the office more often. However, you might want to weigh the pros and cons:\n\n* **Time and schedule**: Will getting off earlier affect your overall commute time or schedule? Make sure you have enough time to walk to the office without feeling rushed.\n* **Weather and safety**: Will you be walking in a safe and well-lit area, and what's the weather like during your commute? You might want to plan accordingly.\n* **Comfort and footwear**: Are you comfortable walking in your usual work attire and shoes? You might need to consider packing a change of shoes or clothes.\n\nIf you're willing to make the slight adjustment to your routine, I think it's a great way to incorporate more physical activity and fresh air into your daily commute.",
