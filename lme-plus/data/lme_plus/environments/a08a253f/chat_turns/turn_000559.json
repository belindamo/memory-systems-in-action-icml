Here's a plan to consider:\n\n1. **Lead classification**: Identify leads that require a longer sales cycle or more education and classify them as \"nurture leads.\" This will help you separate them from leads that are ready to buy immediately.\n2. **Nurture campaign**: Create a targeted nurture campaign specifically designed for these leads. This campaign should provide valuable content, such as whitepapers, webinars, or case studies, that educate them on your product and its benefits.\n3. **Drip marketing**: Use a drip marketing approach to send a series of automated emails or communications to these leads over a set period. This will help keep your product top of mind and provide valuable information to help them move forward in their buying journey.\n4. **Lead scoring**: Implement a lead scoring system to track the lead's engagement with your content and communications. This will help you identify when they're ready to move forward in the sales process.\n5. **Sales touchpoints**: Schedule regular sales touchpoints, such as phone calls or meetings, to check in with the lead and answer any questions they may have. This will help build relationships and trust.\n6. **Content mapping**: Map out the content and communications that will be sent to these leads at each stage of their buying journey. This will ensure that they receive the right information at the right time.\n7. **Sales enablement**: Ensure that your sales team is equipped with the necessary knowledge and resources to effectively communicate with these leads. This may include training on the product, industry trends, and customer pain points.\n8. **Lead recycling**: Have a process in place to recycle leads that are not ready to buy yet. This may include adding them to a lead nurturing program or sending them to a different sales channel, such as an inside sales team.\n\nBy having a plan in place for handling leads that require a longer sales cycle or more education, you can ensure that they receive the right information and attention at the right time, ultimately increasing the chances of conversion.\n\nHow do you plan to handle leads that require a longer sales cycle or more education on your product?",
