However, in general, technology can play a significant role in promoting opera and ballet to wider audiences by providing accessible and engaging ways to participate in performances.

This can be particularly useful for people who are unable to attend in person due to distance or availability.\n\n2. Virtual reality: The use of virtual reality technology can provide immersive experiences that can transport viewers to the Royal Opera House, creating a more engaging and interactive experience.\n\n3. Social media: Social media platforms can be used to promote upcoming performances, share behind-the-scenes content, and engage with audiences through Q&A sessions or live chats.\n\n4. Online education: Technology can be used to provide online courses, workshops, and lectures about opera and ballet, making them more accessible to people who may not have the opportunity to attend in-person classes.\n\nOverall, technology can play a crucial role in making opera and ballet more accessible to wider audiences and help the Royal Opera House reach people who may not have had the opportunity to experience these performances before.",
