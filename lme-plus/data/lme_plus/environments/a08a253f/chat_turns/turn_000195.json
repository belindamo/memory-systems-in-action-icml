  "content": "The dark-haired monkey releases MK and says \"You got past the seal. But you aren't...him.\" MK asks who. The monkey replies \"You aren't...Wukong\", then sudenly drops his staff, grabs his head, and screams as though even saying Wukong's name causes him pain. MK pulls out his own staff, ready to defend himself if he needs to. Let's write that scene.
