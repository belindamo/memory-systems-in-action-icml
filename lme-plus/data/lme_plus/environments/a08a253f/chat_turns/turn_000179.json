The Summit Trail is a challenging but rewarding hike with stunning vistas.\n3. **Wildcat Canyon Regional Park**: In Richmond, about 30 minutes north of Berkeley, this park features the Nimitz Way Trail, which offers spectacular views of the Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the San Francisco skyline.\n4. **Briones Regional Park**: In Lafayette, about 30 minutes east of Oakland, Briones has several trails with scenic views of the surrounding hills, valleys, and the Diablo Range. The Old Briones Road Trail is a popular choice.\n5. **Ring Mountain Open Space Preserve**: In Corte Madera, about 20 minutes north of San Francisco, this preserve features the Ring Mountain Trail, which offers stunning views of Mount Tamalpais, the Bay, and the surrounding hills.\n6. **Sam McDonald County Park**: In Loma Mar, about an hour south of San Francisco, this park has several trails, including the Heritage Grove Trail, which takes you through a stunning redwood forest and offers scenic views of the surrounding hills.\n\nThese trails offer a mix of challenging and easier options, so you can choose one that suits your fitness level and preferences.
