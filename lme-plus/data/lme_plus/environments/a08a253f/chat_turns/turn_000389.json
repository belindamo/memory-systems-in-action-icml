Make sure your tires are properly inflated, as underinflated tires can decrease fuel efficiency.\n2. **Drive smoothly**: Aggressive driving, such as speeding and rapid acceleration, can lower your fuel efficiency. Drive at a moderate pace, and use cruise control on the highway to maintain a constant speed.\n3. **Accelerate gradually**: Avoid sudden acceleration, as it consumes more fuel. Instead, accelerate smoothly and gradually.\n4. **Use the correct gear**: Make sure you're in the correct gear for the speed you're driving. Shifting into higher gears earlier can improve fuel efficiency.\n5. **Avoid idling**: If you're stuck in traffic, turn off your engine if you're going to be stopped for more than 30 seconds. Idling can waste a significant amount of fuel.\n6. **Use air conditioning wisely**: While using the air conditioning can be comfortable on hot days, it can decrease fuel efficiency. Try rolling down your windows at low speeds instead.\n7. **Remove extra weight**: The more weight your car is carrying, the more fuel it'll consume. Remove any unnecessary items from your trunk or back seat.\n8. **Use fuel-efficient driving modes**: Many modern cars come with fuel-efficient driving modes. If your car has this feature, use it to optimize your fuel consumption.\n9. **Plan your route**: Try to avoid routes with heavy traffic, construction, or traffic lights. Use GPS or mapping apps to find the most efficient route.\n10. **Consider carpooling or alternative modes of transportation**: If possible, carpool with colleagues or friends, or explore alternative modes of transportation like public transit, biking, or walking.\n\nTo minimize the impact of disruptions like John's car issue, you can:\n\n1. **Leave early**: Build some buffer time into your commute to account for unexpected delays.\n2. **Stay informed**: Keep an eye on traffic updates and road conditions to plan your route accordingly.\n3. **Be prepared**: Keep an emergency kit in your car, including items like a first-aid kit, jumper cables, and a spare tire.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you should be able to improve your fuel efficiency and navigate through heavy traffic more effectively.",
