  "content": "MK tries to fight back, but his attacker is too strong. He's slammed against the wall, and he feels the attacker's hand wrap around his throat, cutting off his air. He struggles to breathe, trying to pry the hand off, but it's no use.\n\n\"What kind of game are you playing now, Sun Wukong?\" the attacker growls, his voice deep and menacing.\n\nMK's mind races as he tries to understand what's happening. He recognizes the voice, but he can't place it. He tries to speak, but all that comes out is a choke.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he manages to croak out.\n\nThe attacker's grip tightens. \"You don't know?\" he sneers. \"I'm the king, you fool. The true king of this land. The one your father has held prisoner for years.\"\n\nMK's mind reels. This can't be true. His father is the king. He's always been the king. But the chains... the broken chains...\n\n\"Lies,\" he gasps, trying to push the attacker away. \"You're lying.\"\n\nThe attacker releases him, and MK collapses to the ground, coughing and gasping for air. \"You will see the truth, Sun Wukong,\" the attacker says. \"You will see the truth and you will regret ever doubting me.\"\n\nMK's mind is in turmoil as he tries to process what's happening. He thought he was coming here to find the truth, but now he's not sure what to believe. All he knows is that he needs to get out of this cave and figure out what's really going on.",
