You're likely referring to Knott's Bear-y Tales: Return to the Fair, a new hybrid coaster that's part of a larger renovation project at the park. The coaster is set to debut in 2023 and promises to be a family-friendly thrill ride with a nostalgic twist.\n\nFrom what I've heard, the coaster will feature a unique blend of wood and steel elements, with a focus on airtime hills, turns, and drops. The ride's theme is based on the classic Knott's Bear-y Tales dark ride, which was a beloved attraction at the park in the 1970s and 1980s. The new coaster will feature animatronic animals, interactive elements, and special effects to bring the whimsical world to life.\n\nKnott's Berry Farm is known for its rich history and charm, and this new coaster is expected to be a major addition to the park's lineup. I'm sure it'll be a hit with coaster enthusiasts and families alike!\n\nAre you planning to visit Knott's Berry Farm anytime soon to check out the new coaster?",
