However, I can tell you that many opera houses and ballet companies around the world are already using these technologies to reach wider audiences, and the Royal Opera House is likely doing the same. \n\nFor example, the Royal Opera House has its own YouTube channel where they post trailers, behind-the-scenes content, and full-length performances. They also offer online courses and Masterclasses for people to learn more about opera and ballet. Additionally, they have previously live-streamed some of their productions through various platforms, including Facebook and YouTube. \n\nIt is worth noting, however, that the extent of their use of technology may vary, and they may also be experimenting with new technology to further promote opera and ballet.",
