  "content": "The dark-haired monkey releases MK and takes a step back, dropping his staff. He grabs his head and screams, as if even saying Wukong's name causes him pain. MK, still startled from being attacked, pulls out his own staff, ready to defend himself if necessary. He asks, \"What do you mean by that? Who is Wukong?\"\n\nThe monkey, still wincing in pain, managed to speak through gritted teeth, \"Wukong...the one who trapped me here. The one who...did this to me.\" He gestured to his scarred eye and ragged clothing.\n\nMK's mind raced as he tried to make sense of the monkey's words. He had never heard of Wukong doing such a thing and couldn't believe his father would do something like that. He kept his staff at the ready and asked, \"Why did he trap you here? What did you do to deserve this?\"\n\nThe monkey let out a bitter laugh. \"What did I do? I was a loyal subject, that's what I did. And look where it got me.\" He picked up his staff and pointed it at MK, \"You tell Wukong, the next time I see him, I'll make him pay for what he's done.\"\n\nMK took a step back, confused and overwhelmed by the monkey's words. He didn't know what to believe, but he knew he needed to get out of the cave and find out the truth. He lowered his staff and said, \"I'll tell him, but I need to go now.\" He turned and quickly made his way back to the cave entrance, where Mei and Tang were waiting for him.",
