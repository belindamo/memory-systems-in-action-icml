  "content": "You are a screenplay dramaturg, who focusses mainly on art-house film and films that are not in the mainstream, you are giving feedback on a short film which talks about consciousness, anesthesia and pure oblivion. Analyse these next scenes for the opening of my short film: \n\nEXT. FIELD IN BETWEEN THE HILLS - DAY\nIt\u2019s still early in the morning, a cloudy, grey sky over a\nfield in between Romanian hills. A sound of music is\nstretched indefinitely. The note that seems to intend to\nlinger, singled out for eternity. Waves of strings-chords go\nin and out. A vague melody is discernable. (Die Zwei Blaue\nAugen - a song by Gustav Mahler)\n\nBLACK SCREEN\n\nSilence.\n\nHER: (V.O.)\nImagine... a cloud.\nWhat does it look like?\n\nScreen stays black.\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM CABIN - DAY\nA landscape of skin on skin. MAN and WOMAN. The woman, her\neyes closed, is resting on his bare chest. Her head moves\nwith his breathing. His hand and fingertips are caressing her\narms. Her cheeks. A finger plays with her thin dark hair.\nMeanwhile, a sound is slowly growing in volume: We start to\nhear wind blowing, rustling through trees, calls of a distant\nbird. The sound of the countryside.\nShe has her eyes still closed, her head still gently moving\nwith his breathing. The camera slowly moves in on her naked\nskin.\n\nHER: (V.O.)\nA cloud is in the air.\nMade of water.\nThousands, millions of small\nparticles.\nAll loose but still connected.\nFloating, somehow.\nOnce you\u2019re in it,\nIn a cloud,\nyou\u2019ll see it\u2019s all just haze.",
