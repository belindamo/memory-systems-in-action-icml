Here are some suggestions to help you keep track of new episodes and stay organized:\n\n1. **Create a podcast playlist**: Most podcast apps allow you to create custom playlists or folders. Group your podcasts by category (e.g., self-improvement, true crime, news, comedy, etc.), priority (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly listens), or any other system that works for you.\n2. **Prioritize your podcasts**: Identify your \"must-listen\" podcasts and place them at the top of your playlist. This way, you'll ensure you don't miss new episodes from your favorite shows.\n3. **Use a podcast app with customization options**: Consider switching to a podcast app that offers more customization features, such as:\n\t* **Castbox**: Allows you to create custom playlists, set priority levels, and even schedule podcasts for specific times of the day.\n\t* **Overcast**: Offers a \"Priority\" feature, which lets you assign importance levels to your podcasts, and a \"Queue\" feature for managing new episodes.\n\t* **Pocket Casts**: Enables you to create custom filters, set priority levels, and even trim silence from episodes.\n4. **Set up notifications**: Configure your podcast app to send you notifications when new episodes are released from your favorite shows. This way, you'll stay on top of new content without having to constantly check your app.\n5. **Use a podcast management tool**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider using a tool like **Podcast Tracker** (web-based) or **Podcast Buddy** (iOS). These tools allow you to track your subscriptions, mark episodes as played, and even generate statistics on your listening habits.\n6. **Unsubscribe or pause less-frequently listened podcasts**: Be honest with yourself \u2013 if you haven't listened to a podcast in a while, consider unsubscribing or pausing the subscription. This will help declutter your feed and reduce overwhelm.\n7. **Schedule podcast time**: Allocate specific times of the day or week to listen to podcasts. This will help you stay consistent and ensure you have time for all your favorite shows.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you'll be better organized and able to enjoy your podcasts without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nDo you have a preferred podcast app or platform? I can offer more specific tips based on your current setup.",
