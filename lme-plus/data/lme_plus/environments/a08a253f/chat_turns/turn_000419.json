However, there are several ways a new brand can differentiate itself and stand out in the market:\n\n1. Focusing on a specific niche market: By identifying and targeting a specific niche market that is not well served by existing brands, the new brand can provide unique and specialized products to this group of customers. For example, if the new brand focuses on creating running shoes for people with wider feet or for people who wear orthotics, it can attract customers who have been overlooked by other brands.\n2. Offering a unique selling point: By offering a unique selling point, such as a unique technology, design, or material, the new brand can differentiate itself from existing brands and attract customers who are looking for something different.\n3. Building a strong online presence: By building a strong online presence, the new brand can reach a wider audience and engage with customers through social media and online marketing.\n4. Building a strong relationship with local communities or clubs: By building a strong relationship with local communities, clubs, or fitness centers, the new brand can increase its visibility and attract customers who are looking for a brand that is community-focused.\n5. Creating a strong brand identity: By creating a strong brand identity and message, the new brand can differentiate itself from existing brands and create a loyal customer base.\n\nIn summary, a new comer in the running shoe market can differentiate itself by focusing on a specific niche market, offering a unique selling point, building a strong online presence, building a strong relationship with local communities, and creating a strong brand identity. This can help the new brand to stand out in the market and attract customers who are looking for something different.",
