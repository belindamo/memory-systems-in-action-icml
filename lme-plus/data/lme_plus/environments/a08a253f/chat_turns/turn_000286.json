Here are some tips to help you collect, organize, and store all the photos in one place:\n\n**Collection:**\n\n1. **Designate a Photo Collector**: Appoint a family member or two to be in charge of collecting photos from each side of the family. This will ensure that you get photos from multiple sources.\n2. **Create a Shared Folder or Album**: Set up a shared folder or album on a cloud storage platform like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive, where family members can upload their photos.\n3. **Use a Hashtag**: Create a unique hashtag for the family reunion (e.g., #SmithFamilyReunion2023) and ask family members to use it when sharing photos on social media. This will make it easier to collect photos from various sources.\n\n**Organization:**\n\n1. **Create Folders and Subfolders**: Organize photos into folders and subfolders based on categories like:\n\t* Family Reunion 2023\n\t\t* Mom's Side\n\t\t* Dad's Side\n\t\t* Group Photos\n\t\t* Candid Shots\n\t* Activities (e.g., games, food, etc.)\n2. **Use Tags and Keywords**: Add tags or keywords to each photo to make them easily searchable. For example, you can add names, relationships, locations, or events.\n3. **Create a Timeline**: Organize photos in a timeline format, either manually or using a tool like Google Photos or Adobe Lightroom, to showcase the events and activities of the reunion.\n\n**Storage:**\n\n1. **Cloud Storage**: Consider using cloud storage services like Google Photos, Amazon Prime Photos, or Microsoft OneDrive to store your photos. These services offer generous storage space, automatic organization features, and easy sharing options.\n2. **External Hard Drive**: If you prefer to store photos locally, consider using an external hard drive to backup your photos. Make sure to keep the drive in a safe and secure location.\n3. **Photo Management Software**: Use photo management software like Adobe Lightroom, Apple Photos, or Google Photos to organize and store your photos. These tools offer features like tagging, searching, and editing.\n\n**Sharing:**\n\n1. **Create a Shared Album**: Share a link to the shared album or folder with family members, so they can access and view the photos.\n2. **Private Online Gallery**: Create a private online gallery using services like SmugMug, Shutterfly, or Flickr, where family members can view and download photos.\n3. **Physical Photo Book**: Consider creating a physical photo book or scrapbook with selected photos from the reunion. This can be a wonderful keepsake for family members.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Consider creating a family Facebook group or private social media group to share photos and updates.\n* Use a photo scanning service or app to digitize old family photos and add them to your collection.\n* Create a family history book or website to store and share photos, stories, and genealogy information.\n* Set up a regular backup schedule to ensure your photos are safe and secure.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to collect, organize, and store all the photos from your family reunion in one place, making it easy to share and enjoy them with your loved ones.",
