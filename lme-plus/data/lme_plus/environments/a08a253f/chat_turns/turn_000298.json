However, they'll generally be shorter than during the peak summer season.\n\nHere are some tips to help you minimize your wait times for the popular coasters:\n\n1. **Arrive early**: Get to the park as soon as it opens, and head straight to the most popular coasters like Steel Vengeance, Millennium Force, or Top Thrill Dragster.\n2. **Use the Cedar Point app**: The official Cedar Point app offers a \"Ride Wait Times\" feature, which can help you plan your day and avoid long lines.\n3. **Take advantage of Early Entry**: If you're staying at a Cedar Point Resort, you can take advantage of Early Entry, which grants you access to the park an hour before the general public.\n4. **Consider a Fast Lane ticket**: If you're willing to splurge, the Fast Lane ticket option can significantly reduce your wait times for popular attractions.\n5. **Visit during the week**: If possible, plan your visit on a weekday instead of a weekend, as the crowds tend to be smaller.\n\nSome popular coasters at Cedar Point include:\n\n* Steel Vengeance: A hybrid wooden and steel coaster with four inversions\n* Millennium Force: A high-speed steel coaster with an intense drop and airtime hills\n* Top Thrill Dragster: A launch coaster that accelerates from 0 to 120 mph in 4 seconds\n* Maverick: A compact coaster with a 95-degree drop and multiple inversions\n\nMake sure to check the park's website for any special events or closures before your visit.
