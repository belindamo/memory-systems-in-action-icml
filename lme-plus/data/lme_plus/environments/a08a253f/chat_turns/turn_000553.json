  "content": "Excellent approach! Evolving your design and adding a twist will help you build upon your previous success and attract more attendees to your booth.\n\nGiven your success in collecting 200 contact details, it's great that you're thinking about how to build on that momentum. Both lead generation and product demos are crucial for a trade show, but I'd recommend prioritizing **lead generation** at the trade show. Here's why:\n\n1. **Follow-up opportunities**: With 200 interested contacts already in hand, you have a solid foundation for follow-up conversations. Focus on generating more leads to expand your pipeline and increase the chances of converting them into customers.\n2. **Broader reach**: Lead generation allows you to cast a wider net, capturing the attention of attendees who might not have been aware of your products or services before. This can lead to new business opportunities and partnerships.\n3. **Qualify interest**: By prioritizing lead generation, you can qualify the interest of attendees and identify those who are most likely to become customers or partners. This helps you focus your follow-up efforts on the most promising leads.\n\nThat being said, **product demos** are still essential for:\n\n1. **Validation**: Demos provide a hands-on experience, allowing attendees to validate your product's features and benefits, which can increase their interest and confidence in your solution.\n2. **Differentiation**: Demos can help differentiate your products from competitors, showcasing your unique value proposition and features.\n\nTo strike a balance, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Lead-generation-focused activities**: Design interactive experiences, contests, or challenges that encourage attendees to share their contact information in exchange for valuable resources, such as whitepapers, webinars, or exclusive content.\n2. **Product demo stations**: Set up dedicated demo stations where attendees can experience your products firsthand. This will help you attract attendees who are interested in seeing your products in action.\n3. **Hybrid approach**: Combine lead generation and product demos by offering demos in exchange for contact information or as a follow-up to an initial conversation.\n\nBy prioritizing lead generation and incorporating product demos, you'll create a well-rounded experience that caters to different attendee interests and goals. This will help you build upon your existing momentum and generate even more interest in your products and services.\n\nHow do you plan to balance lead generation and product demos at the trade show?",
