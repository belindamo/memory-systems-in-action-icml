The Exorcist maze is definitely a fan favorite, and it's great to hear you enjoyed it.\n\nNow, let's talk about Cedar Point's amazing coasters! Both Steel Vengeance and Millennium Force are incredible rides, but they offer different experiences. Here's a brief comparison to help you decide which one to prioritize:\n\n**Steel Vengeance:**\n\n* A hybrid wooden and steel coaster with a unique twist: it combines the smoothness of steel with the airtime hills and wooden structure of a classic wooden coaster.\n* Features four inversions, including a wooden structure inversion, and a wooden coaster's airtime hills.\n* Has a more intimate, wooded setting, which adds to the ride's atmosphere.\n* Generally considered a more intense, thrilling experience.\n\n**Millennium Force:**\n\n* A high-speed steel coaster with an intense, high-G force experience.\n* Features a 300-foot drop, reaching speeds of 93 mph, and forces of up to 4.5 Gs.\n* Offers a more traditional, sleek steel coaster experience with a focus on speed and turns.\n* Has a more open, lakefront setting, which provides stunning views of Lake Erie.\n\nConsidering you're coming from experiencing mazes at Universal Studios Hollywood, you might want to start with Steel Vengeance. Its unique hybrid design and airtime hills might provide a more unexpected, thrilling experience after the dark, slow-burn tension of the mazes. Additionally, Steel Vengeance's wooded setting and theming are quite immersive, which might appeal to your appreciation for theming and atmosphere.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for a more traditional, high-speed coaster experience, Millennium Force is an excellent choice. Its intense G-forces and stunning lakefront views make it a must-ride for many coaster enthusiasts.\n\nUltimately, you can't go wrong with either choice! Both coasters are world-class and will provide an unforgettable experience. If you have time, consider riding both and comparing your experiences.\n\nWhich one do you think you'll prioritize first?",
