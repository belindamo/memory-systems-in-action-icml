  "content": "Chicken or Veal Parmesan is a classic Italian-American dish that's easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Chicken Parmesan Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 1 tsp garlic powder\n* 1 tsp Italian seasoning\n* 1 cup breadcrumbs (Panko or regular)\n* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 2 cups marinara sauce (homemade or store-bought)\n* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n* Olive oil for frying\n* Fresh basil leaves for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. Prepare the breading station: In one shallow dish, mix together flour, salt, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. In another dish, beat the eggs. In a third dish, mix together breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese.\n3. Prepare the chicken: Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Dip each breast in the flour mixture, coating both sides, then in the eggs, and finally in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere.\n4. Fry the chicken: Heat about 1/2 inch (1 cm) of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the breaded chicken breasts for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a baking dish.\n5. Add the sauce and cheese: Spoon marinara sauce over each chicken breast, followed by a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese.\n6. Bake and melt: Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n7. Serve and enjoy: Garnish with fresh basil leaves and serve with pasta, garlic bread, or a side salad.\n\n**Wine Pairing Recommendation**\n\nFor a classic Italian-American pairing, I recommend a medium-bodied red wine with moderate acidity and tannins. Here are a few options:\n\n* **Chianti**: A Tuscan classic, Chianti is a great match for Chicken Parmesan. Its bright acidity cuts through the richness of the dish, while its moderate tannins complement the chicken and tomato sauce.\n* **Valpolicella**: A Venetian red wine, Valpolicella offers a fruit-forward flavor profile with hints of cherry and plum. Its smooth tannins and moderate acidity make it an excellent pairing for Chicken Parmesan.\n* **Montepulciano**: A southern Italian red wine, Montepulciano is known for its bright acidity and moderate tannins. Its flavors of cherry, plum, and a hint of spice complement the chicken and tomato sauce nicely.\n\nIf you prefer a white wine, a **Pinot Grigio** or **Gavi** could work well, as they both offer crisp acidity and flavors that won't overpower the dish.\n\nRemember, personal taste plays a significant role in wine pairings, so don't be afraid to experiment and find your perfect match!",
