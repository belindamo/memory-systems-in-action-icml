I'll make sure to follow the doctor's instructions and provide her with plenty of rest, comfort, and emotional support. I'll also try to take care of myself too, so I don't burn out. Do you have any recommendations for online resources or apps that can help me manage my mom's medication schedule and keep track of her progress?",
