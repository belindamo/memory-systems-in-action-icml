  "content": "Veal is a wonderful choice for Parmesan! It's a more traditional option, and its tender, delicate flavor pairs beautifully with the crispy breading and melted mozzarella.\n\n**Preparing Veal Cutlets**\n\nWhen working with veal, it's essential to handle it gently to avoid tearing the meat. Here are some tips to help you prepare the veal cutlets:\n\n1. **Select the right cut**: Look for veal cutlets that are about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick and have been pounded to an even thickness. This will help them cook evenly and prevent them from becoming too thick and chunky.\n2. **Season lightly**: Veal is a delicate meat, so it's best to season it lightly to avoid overpowering its natural flavor. Use a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper on both sides of the cutlet.\n3. **Dredge in flour gently**: When dredging the veal cutlets in flour, use a light touch to avoid pressing too hard, which can cause the meat to tear. Gently coat both sides of the cutlet, shaking off any excess flour.\n4. **Don't over-bread**: Veal can be prone to absorbing a lot of breadcrumbs, which can make it heavy and dense. Use a light hand when applying the breadcrumb mixture, and gently press the crumbs onto the meat to adhere.\n\n**Saut\u00e9ed Spinach as a Side**\n\nSaut\u00e9ed spinach is an excellent choice as a side dish! It's a classic Italian combination that pairs beautifully with veal Parmesan. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n* Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\n* Add a handful of chopped garlic (about 2-3 cloves) and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.\n* Add a bunch of fresh spinach leaves (about 1 pound) and cook until wilted, stirring occasionally. Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.\n* Serve the saut\u00e9ed spinach hot, alongside the veal Parmesan.\n\n**Tips for Serving**\n\n* To ensure the veal stays crispy, serve it immediately after baking, while the cheese is still melted and bubbly.\n* Consider serving the saut\u00e9ed spinach in a small mound on top of the veal Parmesan, rather than as a separate side dish. This will help the flavors meld together and create a visually appealing presentation.\n\nI hope these tips help you create a delicious veal Parmesan with saut\u00e9ed spinach! Buon appetito!",
