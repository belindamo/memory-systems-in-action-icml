Typically, most email services have a limit of between 20MB and 25MB on attachments per email. However, some providers may allow larger files to be attached or may use cloud storage to send larger files. Similarly, the number of attachments you can send in one email can also vary depending on the limitations of your email client, internet connection, and the recipient's email service. It's best to check with your email provider for specific limits on file size and number of attachments that you can send or receive.",
