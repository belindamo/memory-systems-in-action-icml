Both road bikes and hybrid bikes can be suitable options, but they have some key differences.\n\n**Road Bike:**\n\n* Designed for speed and efficiency on paved roads\n* Typically lighter and more aerodynamic than hybrid bikes\n* Narrow tires and a more aggressive riding position can make them less comfortable for beginners\n* Often more expensive than hybrid bikes\n\n**Hybrid Bike:**\n\n* A mix of road bike and mountain bike features\n* Designed for comfort and versatility on various terrain (paved roads, bike paths, and light trails)\n* Upright riding position and wider tires can make them more comfortable for beginners\n* Generally less expensive than road bikes\n\nConsidering you're new to cycling and planning to start with a sprint-distance triathlon, a hybrid bike might be a better option for you. Here's why:\n\n1. **Comfort**: Hybrid bikes offer a more upright riding position, which can be more comfortable for beginners and help you build confidence on the bike.\n2. **Versatility**: Hybrid bikes can handle various terrain, including bike paths and light trails, which can be useful for training and exploring different routes.\n3. **Cost**: Hybrid bikes are often less expensive than road bikes, which can be a more budget-friendly option for beginners.\n4. **Ease of use**: Hybrid bikes typically have a more relaxed geometry, making them easier to handle and maneuver, especially for those new to cycling.\n\nHowever, if you're set on getting a road bike, consider the following:\n\n1. **Rent or demo a road bike**: Try out a road bike to see if you enjoy the riding position and feel comfortable on it.\n2. **Get a road bike with a more upright riding position**: Some road bikes, like endurance or comfort road bikes, offer a more upright riding position, which can be more comfortable for beginners.\n\nUltimately, the decision between a road bike and a hybrid bike depends on your personal preferences, budget, and goals. You may also consider visiting a local bike shop, talking to a professional bike fitter, or seeking advice from a triathlon coach to help you make an informed decision.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to find a bike that you're comfortable on and enjoy riding. Happy cycling!",
