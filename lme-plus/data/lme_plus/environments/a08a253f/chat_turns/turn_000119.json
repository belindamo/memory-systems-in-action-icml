However, I can give you some insights on what the art community and experts think about the value of video art and digital installations.\n\nArt is ever-evolving, and contemporary galleries are at the forefront of exhibiting new forms of art that challenge traditional ways of thinking. While video art and digital installations may not require the same technical artistic skills as traditional art forms, they do require technical proficiency with the technology used to create them. Contemporary artists who work in these mediums often use a combination of artistic vision and technological expertise to produce unique and impactful art pieces.\n\nBoth video art and digital installations are considered by many in the art world to be legitimate and valuable forms of expression. They offer artists new ways of communicating their ideas and encourage viewers to engage with art in a different way. Like other contemporary art forms, these mediums often challenge the viewer's perception of what art is and the boundaries that define it.\n\nMoreover, like traditional art forms, video art and digital installations can have meaning and convey emotions and ideas that resonate with the audience. They can also have cultural, political or social commentary that engages viewers in dialogue about important issues.\n\nIn summary, the definition of art is constantly evolving to include new forms of expression as technology advances.
