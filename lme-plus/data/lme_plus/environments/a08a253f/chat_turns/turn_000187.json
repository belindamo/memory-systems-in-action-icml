You might get some signal near the trailhead or at the top of the ridge, but don't count on it. It's always a good idea to download maps and important info beforehand, just in case.\n\n**Downloading Maps:**\nYes, download maps and trail information on your phone or device before you head out. You can use apps like:\n\n* AllTrails: A popular hiking app with interactive maps, trail reviews, and photos.\n* Trailforks: A mountain biking and hiking app with detailed trail maps and GPS tracking.\n* Maps.me: A offline maps app that allows you to download maps for offline use.\n\nDownload the maps for Mount Tamalpais State Park and the Steep Ravine Trail specifically, so you can access them even without cell service.\n\n**Other Essentials:**\nIn addition to your portable charger, consider bringing:\n\n* A paper map and compass (old-school, but always a good backup!)\n* A first-aid kit\n* Plenty of water and snacks\n* Sun protection (sunscreen, hat, sunglasses)\n* Comfortable hiking shoes or boots\n* Layers for changing weather conditions\n\n**Battery Life:**\nTo conserve battery life, consider turning off your phone's cellular data and using airplane mode when not needed. You can also turn off location services and Bluetooth to save power. A portable charger will still come in handy, especially if you're planning an extended hike or using your phone's GPS extensively.\n\nBy being prepared, you'll be able to focus on enjoying the hike and capturing amazing photos without worrying about running out of battery or getting lost!\n\nAre you all set for your hike?",
