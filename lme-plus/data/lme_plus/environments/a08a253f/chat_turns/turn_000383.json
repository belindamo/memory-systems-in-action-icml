  "content": "That sounds like a great plan! I'm sure Maria will appreciate the energetic and upbeat vibes of the playlist. Latin-inspired tracks and pop anthems are always a great combo to get people moving and grooving.\n\nI can almost imagine the energy in the room when you play \"Havana\" or \"Uptown Funk\" - everyone will be dancing and having a blast! And with Maria's enthusiasm and your new playlist, I'm sure your Tuesday and Thursday Zumba classes will be the highlight of the week for everyone.\n\nDon't forget to have fun and be creative with your playlist. You could even consider adding some surprise tracks or throwbacks to keep things fresh and exciting. And who knows, you might just discover some new favorite songs or artists along the way!\n\nIf you need any more help or have any other questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise, get ready to get moving and grooving with your new playlist!",
