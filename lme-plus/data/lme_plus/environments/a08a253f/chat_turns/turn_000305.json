  "content": "I've actually been to Knott's Scary Farm recently with my sister and her boyfriend, and we had a blast! We did the trick-or-treat trail, which was a lot of fun, and we also rode the Calico Mine Ride, which was decorated for Halloween and had some great theming. We didn't get to do as many mazes as we wanted due to long lines, but we still had a great time. I'm definitely looking forward to going back to Knott's Berry Farm and checking out the new coaster when it opens!",
