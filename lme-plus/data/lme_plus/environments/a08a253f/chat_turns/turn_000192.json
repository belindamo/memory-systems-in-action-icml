Why are you here?\"\n\nMK tries to speak, but his voice is hoarse from the monkey's grip on his throat. He manages to croak out, \"I-I'm not here to hurt you. I-I'm here to see the truth for myself.\"\n\nThe monkey's expression softens, but he doesn't release MK. \"The truth? You want to see the truth? Fine. Look around you. This is the truth. I am the demon your father and his guards have been hunting for years. I am the one they've been trying to kill.\"\n\nMK's mind reels as he takes in the chains and the state of the monkey's injuries. He whispers, \"But why? Why are they trying to kill you?\"\n\nThe monkey's expression turns bitter. \"Because I refuse to be their weapon. Because I refuse to be controlled. Because I refuse to be their slave.\"\n\nMK's heart races as he realizes the implications of the monkey's words. He stammers, \"I-I had no idea. I-I'm sorry. I-I'll leave you alone.\"\n\nThe monkey's grip on MK's throat tightens. \"You'll leave? And then what? You'll tell your father where I am? You'll lead him and his guards here to finish me off?\"\n\nMK's eyes widen with realization and fear. He shakes his head frantically. \"No, no, I-I won't tell anyone. I-I swear. Please, let me go.\"\n\nThe monkey studies MK for a long moment before finally releasing him. MK gasps for air and rubs at his throat. The monkey says, \"I'll let you go, but you have to swear to me that you won't tell anyone about me. That you won't lead anyone here to finish me off.\"\n\nMK nods fervently, still rubbing at his throat. \"I swear, I won't tell anyone. I-I'll leave and never come back.\"\n\nThe monkey nods, satisfied. \"Good. Now get out of here before I change my mind.\"\n\nMK doesn't need to be told twice. He turns and runs out of the cave as fast as he can, not stopping until he's back at the village. As he collapses on the ground, he can't help but think about the truth he's uncovered and the implications it has for his relationship with his father.",
