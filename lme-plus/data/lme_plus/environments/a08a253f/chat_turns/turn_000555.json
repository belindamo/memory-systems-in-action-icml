Offering a free consultation or trial of your product in exchange for contact information is a great way to generate leads, and combining it with a demo station is a perfect way to showcase your product's features and benefits. This approach addresses both lead generation and product demos, creating a win-win situation.\n\nHere's why I think this approach will work well:\n\n1. **Value exchange**: By offering a free consultation or trial, you're providing value to attendees in exchange for their contact information. This creates a sense of reciprocity, making them more likely to share their details.\n2. **Qualified leads**: By requiring contact information in exchange for the consultation or trial, you'll generate leads that are more qualified and interested in your product.\n3. **Demonstrated value**: The demo station will allow attendees to see the product in action, demonstrating its value and features. This will help build trust and confidence in your solution.\n4. **Follow-up opportunities**: With the contact information, you'll have a solid lead to follow up with, and the demo experience will give you a conversation starter to discuss their specific needs and interests.\n5. **Reducing friction**: By offering a free consultation or trial, you're reducing the friction associated with buying a product or service. Attendees are more likely to take the next step when they've had a positive experience with your product.\n\nTo further optimize this approach, consider the following:\n\n1. **Clear communication**: Ensure that attendees understand what they'll receive in exchange for their contact information and what the consultation or trial entails.\n2. **Qualifying questions**: Ask qualifying questions during the consultation or trial to better understand the attendee's needs and interests. This will help you tailor your follow-up conversations and increase the chances of conversion.\n3. **Follow-up plan**: Have a clear follow-up plan in place to ensure that leads are nurtured and converted into customers or partners.\n4. **Track and measure**: Track the effectiveness of this approach by measuring the number of leads generated, consultation or trial requests, and conversion rates. This will help you refine your strategy for future events.\n\nOverall, your approach is well-structured, and with a little fine-tuning, it can be highly effective in generating leads and showcasing your product's value.\n\nWhat's your plan for staffing the demo station and handling the lead follow-up process?",
