Remember to take plenty of photos and cherish the memories you're creating with her.\n\nAnd wow, a high school reunion sounds like a blast! It's incredible how quickly time passes, isn't it? One day you're graduating, and the next, you're attending a reunion. I'm sure it was a great opportunity to catch up with old friends and reminisce about the good old days.\n\nAs you prepare for your trip with your niece, don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more advice or recommendations. Have a fantastic time with your niece, and I hope you both create unforgettable memories together!\n\n(And, by the way, I'm happy to hear about your birthday and high school reunion, but I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I don't celebrate birthdays or attend reunions. I'm always here to help, though!)",
