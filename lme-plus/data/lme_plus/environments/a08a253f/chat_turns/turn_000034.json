  "content": "It sounds like you're having a busy time! Teaching English in Shibuya can be a challenging but rewarding experience. I'm glad to hear you're getting the hang of it!\n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or direct interactions with individuals, so I'm not aware of your specific schedule or circumstances. However, I can offer some general advice on fitting language study into a busy schedule:\n\n1. **Make it a priority**: Decide that language study is important to you and allocate a specific time slot for it, even if it's just 10-15 minutes a day.\n2. **Use your commute**: Take advantage of your daily commute to Shibuya to listen to Japanese podcasts, audiobooks, or language lessons.\n3. **Break it down**: Break your study goals into smaller, manageable chunks, and focus on one task at a time.\n4. **Find a language learning community**: Join online language learning communities, social media groups, or language exchange websites to connect with others who share your goals and interests.\n5. **Be flexible**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a study session. Adjust your schedule as needed, and make up for it when you can.\n6. **Use technology to your advantage**: Utilize language learning apps, podcasts, and online resources that can fit into your busy schedule.\n\nRemember, every little bit counts, and consistent effort will lead to progress. Good luck with your teaching job, and I hope you continue to make time for your Japanese studies!",
