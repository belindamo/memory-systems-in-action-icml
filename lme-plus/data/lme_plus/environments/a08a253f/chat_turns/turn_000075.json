  "content": "Before their performance, Madison, one of the members of Harmony Hearts, wrote a song for their incoming performance. The song was called \"Rise Again\" and the lyrics were as follows:\n\nVerse 1:\nWe've been through the storm, we've felt the pain\nBut we're not gonna let it break us, no we'll rise again\nWe'll take all the lessons that we've learned\nAnd we'll use them to make our dreams come true\n\nChorus:\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nWe'll show the world that we're not broken\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nWe'll be the light in the darkness\n\nVerse 2:\nWe'll take all the pieces of our broken dreams\nAnd we'll build them up into something new\nWe'll chase our dreams and we'll make them real\nWe'll be the change that we want to see\n\nChorus:\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nWe'll show the world that we're not broken\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nWe'll be the light in the darkness\n\nBridge:\nWe've got this fire burning in our hearts\nAnd nothing's gonna stop us now\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nAnd we'll make our dreams come true\n\nChorus:\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nWe'll show the world that we're not broken\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nWe'll be the light in the darkness\n\nOutro:\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nWe'll make our dreams come true\nWe'll rise again, we'll shine again\nWe'll be the light in the darkness.",
