      "content": "Liquid provides several built-in date filters that you can use to format dates in your Shopify theme. Here are some commonly used date formats in Liquid:\n\n1. `%a, %d %b %Y`: Outputs the date in the format \"Sat, 20 Mar 2021\".\n2. `%A, %B %d, %Y`: Outputs the date in the format \"Saturday, March 20, 2021\".\n3. `%Y-%m-%d`: Outputs the date in the format \"2021-03-20\".\n4. `%Y%m%d`: Outputs the date in the format \"20210320\".\n5. `%m/%d/%Y`: Outputs the date in the format \"03/20/2021\".\n6. `%d/%m/%Y`: Outputs the date in the format \"20/03/2021\".\n7. `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`: Outputs the date in ISO 8601 format, e.g., \"2021-03-20T14:30:00\".\n\nYou can use these date formats with the `date` filter in Liquid. For example:\n```perl\n{{ \"2021-03-20\" | date: \"%a, %d %b %Y\" }}\n```\nThis would output \"Sat, 20 Mar 2021\". You can also use variables that contain dates, like so:\n```perl\n{{ my_date_variable | date: \"%Y-%m-%d\" }}\n```\nThis would output the date in `my_date_variable` in the format \"2021-03-20\". For more information on Liquid date filters, you can refer to the official Shopify documentation."
