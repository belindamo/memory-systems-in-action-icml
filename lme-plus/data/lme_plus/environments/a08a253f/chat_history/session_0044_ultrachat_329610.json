Creating Safe Spaces: PUSH may create safe spaces where people from marginalized and diverse communities can come together and feel welcome. These spaces can serve as places where people can receive resources, information, and emotional support.\n\n2. Listening to Diverse Voices: PUSH may seek out diverse voices within communities it serves (e.g., people who speak different languages, people with disabilities, people of different genders and sexual orientations) to ensure that their perspectives and experiences are heard.\n\n3. Advocating for Diverse Communities: PUSH may work to advocate for the rights and needs of marginalized communities, such as advocating for better housing and education, access to healthcare, criminal justice reform, and voting rights.\n\n4. Providing Education and Training: PUSH may provide education and training opportunities that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within its own organization, as well as within the communities it serves.\n\n5. Collaborating with Diverse Organizations: PUSH may collaborate with other organizations that serve diverse communities to create a collective impact on issues that affect all communities.\n\n6. Celebrating Diversity: PUSH may celebrate diversity and cultural differences within the communities it serves by hosting events that showcase various cultures, histories, and traditions."
