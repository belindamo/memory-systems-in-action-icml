      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the current practices and efforts of the Royal Opera House. However, in general, technology can play a significant role in promoting opera and ballet to wider audiences by providing accessible and engaging ways to participate in performances. For example:\n\n1. Live streaming: The Royal Opera House can use technology to live stream performances to audiences around the world, creating a virtual experience of the show. This can be particularly useful for people who are unable to attend in person due to distance or availability.\n\n2. Virtual reality: The use of virtual reality technology can provide immersive experiences that can transport viewers to the Royal Opera House, creating a more engaging and interactive experience.\n\n3. Social media: Social media platforms can be used to promote upcoming performances, share behind-the-scenes content, and engage with audiences through Q&A sessions or live chats.\n\n4. Online education: Technology can be used to provide online courses, workshops, and lectures about opera and ballet, making them more accessible to people who may not have the opportunity to attend in-person classes.\n\nOverall, technology can play a crucial role in making opera and ballet more accessible to wider audiences and help the Royal Opera House reach people who may not have had the opportunity to experience these performances before."

      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific information about the Royal Opera House's use of technology to promote opera and ballet. However, I can tell you that many opera houses and ballet companies around the world are already using these technologies to reach wider audiences, and the Royal Opera House is likely doing the same. \n\nFor example, the Royal Opera House has its own YouTube channel where they post trailers, behind-the-scenes content, and full-length performances. They also offer online courses and Masterclasses for people to learn more about opera and ballet. Additionally, they have previously live-streamed some of their productions through various platforms, including Facebook and YouTube. \n\nIt is worth noting, however, that the extent of their use of technology may vary, and they may also be experimenting with new technology to further promote opera and ballet."
