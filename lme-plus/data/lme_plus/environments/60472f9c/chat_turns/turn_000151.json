  "content": "The sample size of this study would depend on the specific research design and statistical analysis plan that is being used. The sample size would be determined based on several factors, such as the desired level of precision, the power of the study, and the variability in the outcome measures.\n\nThe sample size is usually calculated based on the desired level of precision of the study, the power of the study, and the variability in the outcome measures. Researchers use sample size calculator or consult sample size tables to determine the sample size.\n\nIt's also important to consider the practical constraints, such as the availability of children with recurrent ear infections, the budget of the study, and the amount of resources available to recruit and follow a large sample. Ultimately, the sample size should be large enough to detect a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups while also being practical and feasible to recruit and follow.",
