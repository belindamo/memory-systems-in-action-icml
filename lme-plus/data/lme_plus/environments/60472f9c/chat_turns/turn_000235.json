  "content": "The therapist looks at the rod with a mix of curiosity and skepticism. \"So, you're saying that you were abducted by aliens, and this is the only proof you have?\" they ask.\n\nI nod my head, feeling a mix of embarrassment and frustration. \"I know it sounds crazy, but it happened. I just need someone to help me make sense of it all.\"\n\nThe therapist nods sympathetically. \"Okay, let's start with the basics. How did you feel during the experience? Were you scared, anxious, or just confused?\"\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to recall the events as best I can. \"I was terrified at first. I didn't know what was happening or where I was. But then, once I started talking to the aliens, I felt a bit calmer. They seemed to genuinely want to help me. But now that I'm back on Earth, I don't know what to do.\"\n\nThe therapist nods, taking notes on a clipboard. \"And what do you think the aliens wanted from you? Did they say anything specific?\"\n\nI shake my head. \"No, they just said that they wanted to help humanity in some way. I don't know what that means, though. And I don't know if I can trust them.\"\n\nThe therapist nods thoughtfully. \"Well, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty and fear right now. That's completely normal given what you've been through. But let's focus on what we can do to help you feel more in control of the situation.\"\n\nThey proceed to help me work through my feelings and come up with a plan of action for how to move forward. By the end of the session, I feel a little bit better and more grounded. I know that I still have a long way to go, but at least I have a starting point.",
