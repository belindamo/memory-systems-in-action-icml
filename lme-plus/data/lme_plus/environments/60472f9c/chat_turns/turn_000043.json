Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the use of cockpit voice recorders (CVRs) is a regulatory requirement in most countries and the aviation industry and that their primary purpose is to improve aviation safety.\n\nAdditionally, regulations and laws governing access to CVR recordings have strict privacy and confidentiality requirements to protect sensitive information.\n\nFurther, CVRs are maintained by the airlines themselves, so information is not accessible to government entities or outside companies. In fact, access to CVR recordings is usually limited to aviation investigation authorities or other authorized parties with a specific need to know.\n\nIt is understandable that some individuals may be concerned about privacy when it comes to CVR recordings, but they are necessary to ensure aviation safety. Despite the privacy concerns, CVRs have proven to be an invaluable tool in the investigation and prevention of aircraft accidents.",
