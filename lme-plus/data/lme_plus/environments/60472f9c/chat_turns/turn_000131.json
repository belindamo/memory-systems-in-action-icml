  "content": "Climate engineering, also known as geoengineering, refers to intentional and large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system to counteract the effects of climate change. There are two main categories of climate engineering: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM).\n\nThe current state of research on climate engineering is relatively nascent, with many ideas still in the conceptual stage. However, there are several ongoing initiatives and collaborations in this area, including:\n\n1. The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) at Harvard University, which aims to test the feasibility and safety of spraying tiny reflective particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and reduce global warming.\n\n2. The Negative Emissions Technologies and Rapid Climate Change (NETs RCC) initiative, an international collaboration of researchers working on CDR technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\n3. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published several reports on climate engineering, including a special report on the impacts of SRM techniques.\n\n4. The Solar Radiation Management Governance Initiative (SRMGI), which brings together experts, policymakers, civil society organizations, and others to discuss the governance of SRM technologies.\n\n5. The Climate Intervention Biology Working Group, which studies the potential ecological impacts of climate engineering interventions.\n\nDespite these ongoing initiatives, many experts caution against relying too heavily on climate engineering as a solution to climate change, as it could have unintended consequences and may distract from the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
