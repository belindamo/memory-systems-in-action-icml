  "content": "The therapist listens intently as you describe your encounter with the reptilian alien. She asks you to elaborate on what you've heard about the reptilians and why you believe they are one of the \"bad\" ones.\n\nYou explain that you've heard rumors about the reptilians manipulating world governments and consuming human flesh and blood as part of their rituals. You also mention that the other aliens you encountered on the ship seemed to be wary of the reptilians and their intentions.\n\nThe therapist listens carefully to your concerns and offers reassurance that it's normal to feel scared and confused after a traumatic experience like yours. She encourages you to focus on your own feelings and reactions, rather than getting caught up in rumors and hearsay about different alien races.\n\nShe also suggests that you may want to consider reaching out to other people who have had similar experiences or who are knowledgeable about extraterrestrial encounters. She provides you with some resources and contacts for local support groups and researchers who specialize in this area.\n\nAs the session comes to a close, the therapist emphasizes that it's important for you to take the time you need to process your experience and make decisions about how you want to move forward. She reminds you that you are in control of your own choices and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.",
