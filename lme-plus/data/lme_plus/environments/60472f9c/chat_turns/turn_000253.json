  "content": "Deep learning in medical imaging is a fascinating topic. To help you filter your search results, I've got some tips on how to craft specific search queries and use advanced search features to prioritize papers that focus on deep learning in medical imaging:\n\n**Keyword selection:**\n\n1. **Use specific deep learning keywords:** Incorporate keywords related to deep learning, such as \"deep learning,\" \"convolutional neural networks\" (CNNs), \"recurrent neural networks\" (RNNs), \"generative adversarial networks\" (GANs), \"transfer learning,\" and \"image segmentation.\"\n2. **Combine with medical imaging keywords:** Add keywords related to medical imaging, such as \"medical imaging,\" \"computer-aided diagnosis,\" \"image analysis,\" \"MRI,\" \"CT,\" \"PET,\" \"X-ray,\" \"ultrasound,\" and \" mammography.\"\n3. **Specify the application:** Include keywords related to the specific application or disease you're interested in, such as \"tumor detection,\" \"disease diagnosis,\" \"image classification,\" \"segmentation,\" \"registration,\" or \"disease grading.\"\n\n**Search query examples:**\n\n1. `(deep learning OR CNN OR RNN) AND (medical imaging OR computer-aided diagnosis) AND (MRI OR CT)`\n2. `(image segmentation OR object detection) AND (deep learning OR transfer learning) AND (medical imaging OR radiology)`\n3. `(GANs OR generative models) AND (medical imaging OR image synthesis) AND (disease diagnosis OR image classification)`\n\n**Advanced search features:**\n\n1. **Use quotes:** Enclose specific phrases, like \"deep learning\" or \"medical imaging,\" in quotes to search for the exact phrase.\n2. **Boolean operators:** Use AND, OR, and NOT to combine keywords and exclude irrelevant results. For example, `(deep learning AND medical imaging) NOT (natural language processing)`\n3. **Field-specific search:** Use field-specific search operators, like `title:`, `author:`, `abstract:`, or `keyword:`, to search within specific fields. For example, `title:(deep learning AND medical imaging)`\n4. **Date range:** Limit your search to a specific date range, like `2020-2022`, to focus on recent research.\n5. **Journal and conference filters:** Use journal and conference filters to target top-tier publications in the field, such as `journal:Neuroradiology` or `conference:MICCAI`.\n\n**Database-specific tips:**\n\n1. **PubMed:** Use the \"Advanced Search\" feature and select \"MeSH Terms\" to explore the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus. This can help you find relevant papers using standardized keywords.\n2. **Scopus:** Use the \"Advanced Search\" feature and select \"Document type\" to filter by \"Article\" or \"Conference paper.\" You can also use the \"Subject area\" filter to focus on \"Medicine\" or \"Engineering.\"\n3. **IEEE Xplore:** Use the \"Advanced Search\" feature and select \"Content type\" to filter by \"Journal\" or \"Conference.\" You can also use the \"Topic\" filter to focus on \"Biomedical Engineering\" or \"Image Processing.\"\n\nBy combining these tips, you'll be able to craft targeted search queries that prioritize papers focused on deep learning in medical imaging. Happy searching!",
