  "content": "The Lemon Parsley Quinoa Bowl is a fantastic base that can be customized with various proteins to make it more filling and satisfying. Here are some protein options you can consider adding:\n\n1. **Grilled Chicken**: Sliced or diced grilled chicken breast is a classic combination with quinoa and parsley. Simply marinate the chicken in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs, then grill until cooked through.\n2. **Pan-Seared Salmon**: Salmon pairs beautifully with the bright, citrusy flavors of the quinoa bowl. Season the salmon fillet with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice, then sear it in a hot skillet until cooked through.\n3. **Roasted Tofu**: Marinate extra-firm tofu in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs, then roast it in the oven until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.\n4. **Chickpeas**: If you want to keep the dish vegan, you can add cooked chickpeas to the quinoa bowl. You can season them with cumin, paprika, and a squeeze of lemon juice for added flavor.\n5. **Grilled Shrimp**: Shrimp are a great option if you want to add a pop of protein to the dish. Marinate them in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs, then grill until pink and cooked through.\n6. **Edamame**: Boiled or steamed edamame can be added on top of the quinoa bowl, providing a plant-based protein boost. Season with salt and a squeeze of lemon juice.\n7. **Lentils**: Cooked lentils can be added to the quinoa bowl, providing a fiber-rich and protein-packed option. Season with cumin, paprika, and a squeeze of lemon juice.\n\nThese are just a few ideas, but feel free to get creative and experiment with different proteins to find your favorite combination!",
