  "content": "As an AI language model, I am not able to provide specific recommendations for couples therapists in your area. However, you can start by asking for referrals from friends, family members, or your primary care physician. You can also search for therapists online and read reviews and testimonials from previous clients. It's essential to ensure that the therapist is properly licensed, experienced in working with couples, and uses a therapeutic approach that resonates with you and your partner. When you find a therapist, take the time to schedule an introductory session to discuss your needs and goals for therapy and ensure that you feel comfortable and safe with them.",
