What types of recipes are you interested in trying out? Are you looking to experiment with international cuisine, like Indian or Middle Eastern, or do you want to focus on comfort food or vegetarian dishes?\n\nAnd yay for using a grocery list app! Those can be super helpful in keeping track of what you need to buy and avoiding forgotten items. Some apps even allow you to organize your list by aisle or category, which can make shopping more efficient.\n\nIf you're looking to stock up on spices and herbs, here are some essentials to consider:\n\n**Spices:**\n\n* Cumin\n* Coriander\n* Paprika\n* Garam masala (if you're exploring Indian cuisine)\n* Chili powder or cayenne pepper (for added heat)\n* Italian seasoning (a blend of herbs like basil, oregano, and thyme)\n\n**Herbs:**\n\n* Fresh or dried basil\n* Fresh or dried oregano\n* Fresh or dried thyme\n* Fresh parsley or cilantro\n* Bay leaves (for soups or stews)\n\nRemember, you can always add more spices and herbs to your collection over time. Start with the basics and experiment with different combinations to find the flavors you enjoy.\n\nDo you have any favorite cooking blogs or websites that inspire your recipe choices?",
