I earn points at Walgreens by making purchases and getting 10 points for every dollar spent, and at Buy Buy Baby, I earn 2 points for every dollar spent. I'm not entirely sure how ShopRite's program works yet, but I think I need 500 points to get $5 off my next purchase. With Fetch Rewards, I earn points by buying certain brands of groceries.",
