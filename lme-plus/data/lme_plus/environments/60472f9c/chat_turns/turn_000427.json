Catching up on a podcast with a large backlog can be daunting, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Start with a recap episode**: If the podcast has a recap episode or a \"previously on\" segment, start with that. This will help you refresh your memory on the story, characters, and world-building.\n2. **Skim through episode summaries**: Read the episode descriptions or show notes for the episodes you missed. This will give you a sense of the major plot points, character developments, and world-building additions.\n3. **Focus on key episodes**: Identify key episodes that seem crucial to the story, such as season finales, premieres, or episodes with major plot twists. Listen to those first to get a sense of the overall narrative arc.\n4. **Listen to a few episodes at a time**: Don't try to binge-listen to 15 episodes in one sitting. Break it down into manageable chunks, like 3-5 episodes at a time. This will help you absorb the story and characters without feeling overwhelmed.\n5. **Take notes or create a wiki**: If you're really invested in the story, consider taking notes or creating a wiki to keep track of characters, plot points, and world-building details. This will help you remember important details and connections.\n6. **Join a community or discussion group**: Look for online forums, social media groups, or Discord servers dedicated to the podcast. Joining a community can help you stay motivated, ask questions, and get insights from other listeners who are also catching up.\n7. **Be patient and flexible**: Catching up on a long-running podcast takes time. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to take breaks or skip episodes if you need to. You can always come back to it later.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to enjoy the story and have fun! \"Sword and Star\" is a great podcast, and I'm sure you'll be able to get back into it with these tips.\n\nDo you have a favorite character or storyline in \"Sword and Star\" that you're looking forward to revisiting?",
