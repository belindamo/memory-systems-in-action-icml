  "content": "Good luck with your Master's thesis! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here are some top academic databases, search engines, and resources that you can use to find research papers related to AI in medical diagnosis:\n\n**Databases:**\n\n1. **PubMed** (National Library of Medicine): A comprehensive database of biomedical literature, including articles, conference proceedings, and book chapters.\n2. **Scopus** (Elsevier): A large database of peer-reviewed journals, conference papers, and book chapters in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including medicine and AI.\n3. **IEEE Xplore** (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers): A digital library of technical literature in electrical engineering, computer science, and related disciplines, including AI and healthcare.\n4. **ScienceDirect** (Elsevier): A leading platform for scientific, technical, and medical journals and books, including those related to AI and medical diagnosis.\n5. **Web of Science** (Clarivate Analytics): A citation database that covers a wide range of scientific and medical journals, conference proceedings, and book chapters.\n\n**Search Engines:**\n\n1. **Google Scholar** (Google): A search engine specifically designed for scholarly literature, including articles, theses, books, and conference papers.\n2. **Microsoft Academic** (Microsoft): A search engine that indexes academic papers, authors, institutions, and publications in various fields, including AI and healthcare.\n3. ** Semantic Scholar** (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence): A free academic search engine that uses AI to identify relevant papers and provide summaries.\n\n**Other Resources:**\n\n1. **arXiv** (Cornell University Library): An open-access repository of electronic preprints in physics, mathematics, computer science, and related disciplines, including AI and medical imaging.\n2. **bioRxiv** (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory): A preprint server for biology and medical research, including papers on AI applications in healthcare.\n3. **MedRxiv** (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory): A preprint server for medical research, including papers on AI in medical diagnosis and healthcare.\n4. **ResearchGate**: A social networking platform for scientists and researchers, where you can find and follow researchers in your field and access their publications.\n5. **AI in Healthcare publications** ( Various institutions and organizations): Look for publications from institutions like MIT, Stanford, Harvard, and organizations like the American Medical Association (AMA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which often publish research papers and reports on AI in healthcare.\n\nTo get the most out of these resources, use specific keywords related to your research topic, such as:\n\n* \"AI in medical diagnosis\"\n* \"Machine learning in healthcare\"\n* \"Deep learning for disease detection\"\n* \"Natural language processing in medical imaging\"\n* \"Computer-aided diagnosis systems\"\n\nYou can also use Boolean operators, quotes, and parentheses to refine your search queries. Additionally, set up alerts or notifications on these platforms to stay updated on new publications in your area of research.\n\nGood luck with your thesis, and I hope these resources help you find the papers you need!",
