  "content": "Most of the culinary tours in Mexico City are available in both Spanish and English, and often other languages too. Tour operators usually list the languages available for their tours on their websites, so you can check before booking. In general, it shouldn't be a problem to find a tour that offers English-language guides, especially in popular tourist areas like Mexico City. You could also consider hiring a private guide who speaks your language if you prefer a more customized experience.",
