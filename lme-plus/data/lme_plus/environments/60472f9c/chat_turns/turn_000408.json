  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on pricing strategies for my homemade products. I recently participated in the Spring Fling Market and did pretty well, selling 25 jars of homemade jam and 12 handmade candles, making a total profit of $230. By the way, I spent the entire week prior to the event perfecting my jam recipe and making extra batches to ensure I had enough stock. Do you have any tips on how to determine the optimal price for my products?",
