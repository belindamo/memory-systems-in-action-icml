  "content": "Cockpit voice recorders (CVRs) provide crucial information in accident investigations by recording all communications and sounds within the cockpit, including conversations between crew members, radio communications, and other noises such as alarms or engine sounds. This information can be used to reconstruct the events leading up to an accident and determine contributing factors.\n\nModern regulations govern the use of CVRs in airplanes, including requirements for the type of recorder used, the duration of recording, and the data storage capacity. For example, in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that CVRs record at least two hours of audio and be capable of retaining data for a minimum of 30 days. Other countries may have different regulations.\n\nIn addition, regulations govern the access and use of CVR data. Typically, the data is only accessible to authorized investigators and is used solely for accident investigations. It is also protected by privacy and confidentiality laws, and any transcripts or recordings released to the public must be carefully redacted to ensure personal information is not disclosed.",
