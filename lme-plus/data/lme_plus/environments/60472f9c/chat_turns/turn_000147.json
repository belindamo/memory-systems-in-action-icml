  "content": "The control group of this study would be the \"wait and see\" group. This group would not receive ear tube surgery and would be followed for a period of time to assess the frequency of ear infections. This group would serve as a point of comparison for the other treatment groups (ear tube surgery, refusing antibiotics, and continuing antibiotics as ear infections come) to determine if ear tube surgery is more effective in reducing the frequency of ear infections. The control group allows researchers to compare the outcomes of the experimental group (ear tube surgery) to a group that did not receive the treatment and therefore it helps to isolate the effect of the ear tube surgery on reducing frequency of ear infections.",
