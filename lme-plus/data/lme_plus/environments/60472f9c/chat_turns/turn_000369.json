Don't worry, I'm here to help you with finding relevant research papers on AI in medical diagnosis, specifically on image classification.\n\nHere are some top databases and search engines you can use to find relevant research papers:\n\n1. **PubMed** (National Library of Medicine): A comprehensive database of biomedical literature, including papers on medical imaging and AI applications.\n2. **Google Scholar** (scholar.google.com): A search engine specifically designed for scholarly literature, including research papers, theses, and books.\n3. **arXiv** (arxiv.org): A repository of electronic preprints in physics, mathematics, computer science, and related disciplines, including AI and machine learning.\n4. **IEEE Xplore** (ieeexplore.ieee.org): A digital library of IEEE journals, transactions, and conference proceedings, covering AI, machine learning, and biomedical engineering.\n5. **ScienceDirect** (sciencedirect.com): An online platform providing access to scientific, technical, and medical journals and books published by Elsevier.\n6. **ResearchGate** (researchgate.net): A social networking platform for scientists and researchers to share research, collaborate, and find relevant papers.\n7. **Academia.edu** (academia.edu): A platform for academics to share research papers, articles, and other publications.\n8. **Microsoft Academic** (academic.microsoft.com): A search engine for academic publications, including papers on AI, machine learning, and medical imaging.\n9. ** Semantic Scholar** (semanticscholar.org): A free academic search engine that uses AI to identify influential papers and authors.\n10. **Web of Science** (wokinfo.com): A database of peer-reviewed literature, including papers on AI, machine learning, and biomedical research.\n\nTo refine your search, use specific keywords like:\n\n* \"AI in medical imaging\"\n* \"Image classification in medical diagnosis\"\n* \"Deep learning for medical image analysis\"\n* \"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image classification\"\n* \"Medical image segmentation using AI\"\n* \"AI-assisted diagnosis in [specific disease or condition]\"\n\nYou can also use advanced search features, such as filtering by date, author, or journal, to narrow down your search results.\n\nGood luck with your research paper search, and I hope your Database Systems project is going well!",
