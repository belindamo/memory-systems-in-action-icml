  "content": "The therapist takes a close look at the rod and examines it carefully. She tells you that she doesn't know anyone offhand who might be able to identify it, but she suggests taking it to a specialist or an expert in the field of alien artifacts. She advises caution and tells you to be careful about who you approach with the rod, as not everyone will have good intentions. She also suggests doing some research on your own to see if you can find any information about similar objects or encounters with aliens.",
