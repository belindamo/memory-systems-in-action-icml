This will help prevent the marinade from becoming too oily. For example, if you're using 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, use 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil.\n2. **Use a mixture of acids**: Combine lemon juice with other acids like vinegar (apple cider or balsamic work well) or yogurt to create a more complex flavor profile.\n3. **Don't overdo the oil**: Olive oil is great for flavor, but it can make the marinade too oily. Use a light hand when adding oil, and consider using a lighter oil like avocado oil or grapeseed oil.\n4. **Add aromatics**: Include aromatics like minced garlic, ginger, or onions to add depth to your marinade.\n5. **Herbs and spices**: Fresh or dried herbs like parsley, thyme, or rosemary can add a lot of flavor to your marinade. You can also use spices like paprika, cumin, or coriander to give it a unique twist.\n6. **Salt and pepper**: Don't forget to add salt and pepper to your marinade to enhance the flavors and help the seasonings penetrate the meat.\n\n**A simple marinade recipe for grilled chicken:**\n\nHere's a basic marinade recipe you can use as a starting point:\n\n* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1 clove garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley\n* 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\nCombine all the ingredients in a bowl, then whisk until smooth.
