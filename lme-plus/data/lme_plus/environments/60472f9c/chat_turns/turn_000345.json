  "content": "The banana-walnut combination is a classic for a reason.\n\nPortioning out walnuts can make a big difference in terms of flavor and texture. Here are some suggestions:\n\n**Chopped Walnuts:**\n\n* Chopping walnuts into smaller pieces (about 1/4 inch or 6-8 mm) can help distribute their flavor and texture more evenly throughout your Greek yogurt and banana. This is a great option if you want a more uniform bite.\n* Start with about 1-2 tablespoons of chopped walnuts per serving. You can always adjust to your liking.\n\n**Whole Walnuts:**\n\n* Leaving walnuts whole can provide a nice textural contrast to the creamy yogurt and soft banana. Plus, it's a great way to get a good crunch in each bite.\n* Use about 2-3 whole walnuts per serving. You can halve or quarter them if you prefer a slightly smaller bite.\n\n**Walnut Halves or Quarters:**\n\n* If you want a balance between chopped and whole walnuts, try halving or quartering them. This will give you a good chunk of walnut in each bite while still providing some texture variation.\n* Use about 2-3 walnut halves or quarters per serving.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a balance that you enjoy. You can always adjust the amount and size of your walnuts to suit your taste preferences.\n\nHere's a rough guide to get you started:\n\n* 1 tablespoon chopped walnuts \u2248 2-3 whole walnuts \u2248 4-6 walnut halves or quarters\n\nFeel free to experiment and find your perfect walnut-to-banana ratio!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, just let me know!",
