  "content": "The correct option is 1) made.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Made is the correct option as it is in the past tense and indicates the completion of the action of making kites. The sentence \"After we had eaten lunch, we flew our kites. That was fantastic because we made kites ourselves!\" implies that the speaker and the listener made the kites before flying them.\n2. Had made is in the past perfect tense which is not necessary in this sentence as there is no indication of an event that occurred prior to the making of the kites.\n3. Were made is in the passive voice, implying that someone or something else made the kites for the speaker and the listener. However, the sentence states that they made the kites themselves.\n4. Were making is in the progressive form and suggests that the action of making kites was ongoing during the flying of the kites. However, the sentence states that the making of the kites was completed before flying them.",
