Here are some key features and innovations that were common in cameras from the 1960s:\n\n**Rangefinder Design:**\n\n* In the 1960s, rangefinders were the norm for 35mm cameras. They used a separate viewfinder and rangefinder windows to help photographers compose and focus their shots.\n* The rangefinder mechanism was typically coupled to the lens, allowing for precise focusing and a more compact design.\n* Many rangefinders from this era featured a compact, rectangular body with a prominent lens mount and a smaller viewfinder/rangefinder window.\n\n**Lens Design:**\n\n* Lenses from the 1960s were often simpler in design, with fewer elements and groups compared to modern lenses.\n* Many lenses from this era featured a single coating or no coating at all, which can affect their performance in certain lighting conditions.\n* The 1960s saw the introduction of more versatile lenses, such as the 35mm f/2 and 50mm f/1.8, which became staples for many photographers.\n\n**Shutter and Aperture:**\n\n* Cameras from the 1960s often featured mechanical shutters with speeds ranging from 1/1000th of a second to 1 second, with a bulb mode for longer exposures.\n* Aperture control was typically manual, with a ring on the lens that allowed photographers to adjust the f-stop.\n* Some cameras from this era featured a \"match-needle\" system, which used a needle to indicate when the aperture and shutter speed were properly set for a given lighting condition.\n\n**Metering and Exposure:**\n\n* The 1960s saw the introduction of built-in light meters, which made it easier for photographers to determine the proper exposure.\n* Many cameras from this era featured a selenium or cadmium sulfide (CdS) meter, which were relatively simple and prone to errors.\n* Exposure compensation was often done using a dial or ring on the camera, allowing photographers to adjust the exposure based on the meter reading.\n\n**Other Features:**\n\n* Many cameras from the 1960s featured a flash sync socket, which allowed photographers to connect an external flash unit.\n* Some cameras had a self-timer, which allowed for delayed shutter releases.\n* Filters were often used to adjust the color and contrast of images, with popular filters including yellow, orange, and polarizing filters.\n\n**Innovations:**\n\n* The 1960s saw the introduction of more compact and lightweight cameras, making them easier to carry and use.\n* The development of more sensitive films and improved lens designs allowed for better low-light performance and shallower depth of field.\n* The introduction of more affordable cameras, like the Canon QL17, made photography more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nYour Canon rangefinder is a great example of a camera from this era, with its compact design, coupled rangefinder, and manual aperture and shutter control. With proper care and maintenance, it can still take amazing photos today!\n\nI hope this helps you appreciate your camera even more. Happy shooting!",
