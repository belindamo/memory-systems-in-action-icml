Here are some psychological thrillers similar to \"Inception\" that'll keep you on the edge of your seat:\n\n1. **Shutter Island (2010)**: Directed by Martin Scorsese, this movie follows a U.S. Marshal investigating a mental hospital on a remote island. It's a mind-bending, atmospheric thriller with a complex plot and stunning visuals.\n2. **Memento (2000)**: Christopher Nolan's critically acclaimed film tells the story of a man suffering from short-term memory loss who sets out to avenge his wife's murder. The non-linear narrative and clever plot twists make it a must-watch.\n3. **Primer (2004)**: This indie sci-fi thriller explores the consequences of time travel and the blurring of reality. It's a complex, thought-provoking film that requires close attention, but the payoff is worth it.\n4. **Black Swan (2010)**: Darren Aronofsky's psychological horror-thriller follows a ballerina's descent into madness as she prepares for a role in a production of Swan Lake. The film's atmosphere is tense and unsettling, with a standout performance from Natalie Portman.\n5. **Gone Girl (2014)**: David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's bestselling novel is a twisted, suspenseful thriller about a couple's seemingly perfect marriage that turns out to be a facade. The film's full of surprises and features a phenomenal cast, including Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike.\n6. **Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)**: Another mind-bending film from Michel Gondry, this one explores the concept of memory erasure and the consequences of playing with fire when it comes to love and relationships.\n7. **The Prestige (2006)**: Christopher Nolan's mystery drama follows the rivalry between two magicians who engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic consequences. The film's a complex, layered exploration of obsession and sacrifice.\n8. **Misery (1990)**: Rob Reiner's classic thriller stars Kathy Bates as a deranged fan who holds a writer (James Caan) captive and forces him to write a novel featuring her favorite character. The tension is palpable, and Bates' performance is iconic.\n9. **The Girl on the Train (2016)**: Based on Paula Hawkins' novel, this film follows a commuter who becomes obsessed with a perfect couple she watches on her daily train ride. The story takes a dark turn when the woman goes missing, and the commuter becomes entangled in the investigation.\n10. ** Searching (2018)**: This unique thriller takes place entirely on computer screens, as a father searches for his missing daughter by tracking her digital footprints. The film's a gripping, suspenseful ride with a surprising twist at the end.\n\nThese movies offer a mix of psychological tension, complex plots, and suspense that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.
