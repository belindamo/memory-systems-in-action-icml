  "content": "The Congregational Church acknowledges the challenges and controversies it has faced and continues to work towards addressing them.\n\nFor instance, the church has made efforts to address the rifts created when some churches and members left the denomination due to its progressive stance on LGBTQ+ issues. The United Church of Christ has established relationships with some of the churches that had left and has worked towards promoting unity and understanding among members with different views.\n\nRegarding racial justice, the Congregational Church has created programs and policies to promote diversity and inclusion within the denomination. In 2013, the United Church of Christ voted to become a \"multiracial, multicultural and open and affirming church,\" and has since implemented initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion within the church.\n\nFurthermore, the Congregational Church has made efforts to reach out to people outside the church who may have felt unwelcome or excluded in previous years. They have created resources and programs to support marginalized groups and to promote unity among people of different backgrounds.\n\nThe Congregational Church recognizes that these issues are complex and continuous work is required to address them. However, the church remains committed to promoting social justice, diversity, and inclusion in all its endeavors.",
