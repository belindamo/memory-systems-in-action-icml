Here are some tips to help you get the most out of Trello's labeling feature:\n\n**Labeling Strategy:**\n\n1. **Create labels for stages:** Create labels for each stage of your research, such as \"Literature Review,\" \"Methodology,\" \"Results,\" \"Discussion,\" and \"Conclusion.\" This will help you categorize your cards based on the stage of your research.\n2. **Use color-coded labels:** Assign a specific color to each label to create a visual distinction between stages. For example, you could use blue for \"Literature Review,\" green for \"Methodology,\" and red for \"Results.\"\n3. **Add sub-labels for tasks:** Create sub-labels for specific tasks within each stage. For example, under \"Literature Review,\" you could have sub-labels like \"Read and annotate papers,\" \"Summarize findings,\" and \"Identify gaps.\"\n4. **Prioritize with numbers:** Use numbers to prioritize your cards within each stage. For example, you could use \"1,\" \"2,\" and \"3\" to indicate the order in which you need to complete tasks.\n5. **Use keywords and tags:** Add relevant keywords and tags to your labels to make them more specific and searchable. For example, you could add \"Machine learning\" or \"Deep learning\" to a label related to methodology.\n\n**Labeling Examples:**\n\n* Literature Review:\n\t+ Read and annotate papers (1)\n\t+ Summarize findings (2)\n\t+ Identify gaps (3)\n* Methodology:\n\t+ Design experiment (1)\n\t+ Collect and preprocess data (2)\n\t+ Train and test models (3)\n* Results:\n\t+ Analyze results (1)\n\t+ Create visualizations (2)\n\t+ Interpret findings (3)\n\n**Benefits of Labeling:**\n\n1. **Easy categorization:** Labels help you categorize your cards based on the stage of your research, making it easy to find and prioritize tasks.\n2. **Visual distinction:** Color-coded labels create a visual distinction between stages, making it easy to identify which cards belong to which stage.\n3. **Prioritization:** Numbered labels help you prioritize tasks within each stage, ensuring that you complete the most important tasks first.\n4. **Searchability:** Keywords and tags make your labels searchable, allowing you to quickly find specific cards or tasks.\n\nBy using Trello's labeling system, you'll be able to categorize and prioritize your cards efficiently, making it easier to manage your thesis project and stay on track.",
