  "content": "You find that the resources and contacts your therapist gave you are a mix of government agencies, private organizations, and individuals who have either claimed to have had contact with aliens or are experts in the field of ufology.\n\nYou see that one of the contacts is a well-known ufologist who has been studying alien encounters for decades. Another contact is a former government official who claims to have worked on a top-secret project involving extraterrestrial life. You also see a phone number for a support group for people who have had similar experiences to yours.\n\nAs you sift through the resources, you feel a sense of relief knowing that you are not alone in this experience. You decide to reach out to the support group and the ufologist to see if they can provide any insight or guidance on how to move forward.",
