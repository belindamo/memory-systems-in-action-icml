  "content": "In general, the use of cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recordings is limited to accident investigations and safety improvements. However, in rare circumstances, sensitive and personal conversations that occur in the cockpit during an emergency may be subject to additional confidentiality protections. \n\nFor example, in the United States, the Allan H. Conney Safety Act allows for pilots to voluntarily disclose sensitive information without fear of being punished or penalized. This includes personal or sensitive information that may have been discussed during an emergency situation.\n\nAdditionally, aviation regulators understand that preserving confidentiality in such situations can be important in promoting the safety culture of the aviation industry. There are established procedures for protecting sensitive information that may have been discussed during emergency situations, and such procedures are typically followed when appropriate.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the overriding concern for the use of CVR recordings remains the promotion of aviation safety. If any information is discovered that could potentially impact aviation safety, it would be subject to the appropriate investigative process, regardless of the circumstances under which it was discovered.",
