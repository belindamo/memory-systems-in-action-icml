      "content": "Step 1: Prep the Hair\nStart by washing and conditioning the hair, then blow dry it using a round brush to create a smooth and sleek finish.\n\nStep 2: Section the Hair\nDivide the hair into three sections: top, middle, and bottom. Use clips to keep each section separate.\n\nStep 3: Cut the Top Section\nTake the top section of hair and cut it to the desired length for the pixie cut. Use scissors or clippers to create a choppy, layered look.\n\nStep 4: Cut the Middle Section\nTake the middle section of hair and cut it to a slightly shorter length than the top section. Again, use scissors or clippers to create a choppy, layered look.\n\nStep 5: Cut the Bottom Section\nTake the bottom section of hair and cut it to a shorter length than the middle section. Use scissors or clippers to create a choppy, layered look.\n\nStep 6: Cut the Bangs\nTake the front section of hair and cut it to the desired length for the bangs. Use scissors or clippers to create a choppy, layered look.\n\nStep 7: Blend the Layers\nUse scissors or clippers to blend the layers together, making sure to create a seamless transition from one layer to the next.\n\nStep 8: Style the Hair\nUse a texturizing spray or sea salt spray to add volume and texture to the hair. Use a round brush to style the bangs and a flat iron to smooth out any flyaways.\n\nStep 9: Finish the Look\nApply a light hold hair spray to keep the hair in place, and you're done! Your new pixie cut with bangs like Jenna Ortega is complete."
