The discontinuation of the Fusion was said to be a part of Ford\u2019s shifting strategic focus away from passenger cars toward crossovers and SUVs\u2014many with electrified powertrains.1 Observers wondered if Ford could essentially abandon the market for automobiles as car sales had been its lifeblood since 1908 when Henry Ford revolutionized passenger trans\ufffeportation with production of the Model T. Industry analysts also wondered if the American love affair with the SUV and trucks would continue if the price of gasoline began to escalate as the United States, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. engaged in tactics to alter energy prices around the world. Exhibit 1 below outlines key milestones in the history of the Ford Motor Company.\nFord\u2019s Strategic Situation in 2020\nBy 2020, Ford employed over 200,000 people world\ufffewide in 70 plants producing midsize cars, SUVs,and pickup trucks. Since the recession of 2008, the company\u2019s revenues had rebounded due to increased disposable income levels, falling unemployment, and arenewed demand for big-ticket purchases. However, thecompany reported falling sales in some of its establishedmarkets in 2019 and 2020\u2014partially due to the spreadof the COVID-19 virus in early 2020. Exhibit 2 pres\ufffeents Ford\u2019s stock performance between April 2015 andApril 2020. The company\u2019s consolidated income state\ufffements for 2017 through 2019 are presented in Exhibit 3.Ford Motor Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets for2018 and 2019 are presented in Exhibit 4\n\nFord\u2019s New Product Strategy \nWilliam Clay Ford, Jr., Executive Chairman of Ford, suggests that 115 years ago, when the company began, the company\u2019s mission was to make people\u2019s lives better by making mobility accessible and affordable. By 2020, the company was moving toward manufac- turing \u201csmart vehicles for a smart world.\u201d The world plan focused on four pillars: (1) A winning portfolio; (2) new propulsion options; (3) a high-level autono- mous business built on the most trusted self-driving systems; and (4) cloud-based mobility experiences that deliver recurring revenue. The winning portfolio in 2020 was envisioned to be the Escape, Expedition, Explorer, Ranger, F-150 Hybrid, Bronco, and the Mustang Shelby GT500. The Ford Bronco was produced between 1966 and 1996 and was discontinued when the smaller two- door Bronco II suffered from a tipping problem. The reintroduced Bronco will be modular with a remov- able top and doors. Two years before the Bronco was discontin- ued, the automobile gained a great deal of atten- tion when Al Cowlings drove O.J. Simpson down a Los Angeles freeway after Simpson was charged with the murders of his ex-wife and her friend. More than 95 million people across the United States watched the two-hour pursuit on television while crowds gathered on overpasses to cheer on the NFL football legend."
