Some sticks for the arms.\n5. A carrot or other material for the nose.\n6. Some coal or other material for the eyes, mouth, and buttons.\n7. A hat and scarf (optional).\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Find a good spot in your yard or park where the snow is packed well and there is enough space to build a snowman.\n2. Start by rolling the large snowball on the ground until it is big enough for the base of the body. You may need to add more snow to it as you go.\n3. Place the large snowball on the ground and roll the medium-sized snowball until it is big enough for the middle of the body. Place it on top of the large snowball.\n4. Roll the small snowball until it is the right size for the head. Place it on top of the medium-sized snowball.\n5. Use the sticks to create the arms. You can either stick them directly into the body of the snowman or attach them using a little bit of snow as \"glue.\"\n6. Use the carrot or other material to create the nose. You can either stick it directly into the head or attach it using a little bit of snow as \"glue.\"\n7. Use the coal or other material to create the eyes, mouth, and buttons. You can either stick them directly into the body or attach them using a little bit of snow as \"glue.\"\n8. If you have a hat and scarf, you can put them on your snowman to keep him warm.\n\nThat's it! With a little bit of effort and creativity, you can build a snowman that will bring joy to you and your family."
