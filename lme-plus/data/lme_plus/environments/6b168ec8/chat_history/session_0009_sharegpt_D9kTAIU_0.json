How my dad (1) had just died from a heart-attack, and I would have to attend his funeral tomorrow and deliver a eulogy. My father was a strict, abusive, and old-fashioned man. He would beat me and my brother as a form of punishment and discipline. From time to time, he would even beat my mom (2). He was not just physically abusive, but he was also verbally abusive, and he would call my brother a \u201cFatso\u201d even though he knew that my brother was insecure about his weight. But, at the end of the day he was still my father and he had provided for and protected me and my brother. And that my\u2026, My thoughts were interrupted by the sudden ring of my phone, -so I glanced at it while my eyes were starting to tear up. I could make out the faint outline of the word mom (3) and I rushed to pick it up. \u2018Hello\u2019 \\*I said in a shaky voice\\* and my mom (4) started asking me if I were okay and if I could deliver the eulogy. I said whilst trying to sound confident \u201cYeah mom I\u2019m fine, I\u2019ll deliver the eulogy\u201d so she asked me if I had finished writing it, I lied and said yes and then told her I would go to bed now and hung-up the phone. I got down from the roof into my apartment not knowing what I should do, so I sat down and started writing the eulogy \u201ceulogy text.\u201d When I finished, I decided that I should go to sleep as it took me 3 hours to write the eulogy and it was now 2:00 AM. I lay in bed restless thinking about my dad (5). It is not like this was even sudden news. His health was in terrible condition before he had gotten the heart-attack, but it still hurt. I finally started to sleep after an hour or so of mourning. The next day I woke up at 8:00 AM and got dressed to attend the funeral. I drove over to the cemetery. I arrived and got out of the car and started walking over to my father\u2019s grave where I found my family members, some of my father\u2019s friends and colleagues. I saw my mom in tears and felt sorry for her. We started praying over my father when we were done praying, I had to go up and deliver the -eulogy. I went up to the podium and started reading out the eulogy I could feel my voice getting weaker and weaker. My mother noticed and looked concerned, but I pushed through with a heavy heart. After I was done, I sat back down, and we prayed some more I looked at my mom and stared right into her eyes I saw how upset she was but remembered all that my dad had done to me and my brother and her and so I got angry because how could my mom mourn for him. I am so confused about my feelings I am angry; I am upset I do not know what is going on or what to do. Was I just doing this for my mom? I snapped back to reality and let my thoughts rest. after we were done with the funeral I started walking over to my car when my mom started calling out my name from behind. I looked back and went over to her and asked her what is up? She asked me if I could stay with her in her apartment while she copes and I started thinking about all the problems that would arise by me staying there like the long -drive to my job from her apartment would be a little over an hour compared to the 15 minutes from my house to work and how I would need to wake up way earlier but she needed me right now and I couldn't leave her all alone and it would be good for me to have some company at this time too. So, I told her sure mom. She said thank you dear, I said no worries want me to drive you to your apartment instead of taking the bus. She said that would be lovely thank you again. I said you're welcome and we walked over to my car and I opened the door for her and helped her in. she asked me if I could give her the auxiliary cord, so I said the card doesn't have one it uses Bluetooth so she asked me can you help me connect and I said sure give me the phone I typed in my car radio password then it connected and I gave it back to her, she asked do you want me to play anything specific, I told her no thank you play whatever you want. she said all right and started playing a song but this song I knew this song I used to listen to this everyday as a kid!!!! I felt nostalgia rushing through me my mom noticed and said I knew you would remember in a happy excited witty tone. We arrived at my mom\u2019s apartment, and I rushed to my childhood bedroom, which made me happy for a second, since I do not visit my mom often. My mom told me she would go take a nap; even though it was 4 pm. So, I went exploring around the apartment but did not find anything interesting, so I went back to my room and started reading some children\u2019s books that I found, which made me giggle. My mom came in soon after I put the books down and told me to come drink some afternoon tea with her, so I jumped out of bed and went to the kitchen table. My mom had already set the table with two cups of tea and a few pieces of cake. I started drinking my tea while my mom ate some cake when suddenly, my mom started slowly moving her head back and forward. I asked her what is wrong? She said I feel so dizzy and numb. I instantly panicked and called 911. 911 Operator/Dispatcher: \u201c911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201d Hello, my mom is currently suffering a stroke, she is experiencing dizziness and numbness. 911 Operator/Dispatcher: \u201cIs she currently conscious?\u201d Yes. 911 Operator/Dispatcher: \u201cWhat is your address sir?\u201d 0214 97 olive avenue Ave Lane house 198. 911 Operator/Dispatcher: \u201cHelp is on the way remain calm and make sure she doesn\u2019t slip into an unconscious state\u201d Ok, please hurry. Mom said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to do that, why would you call an ambulance?\u201d In a hushed drowsy voice. I replied, \u201cMum this is serious we need to be careful.\u201d Suddenly she passed out/fainted and I started panicking even more I was trying to wake her up with no luck, so I started frantically running around waiting for the ambulance until I heard the doorbell ringing and ran to open it/unlock it I let the paramedics to the kitchen, and they put her on a stretcher. at this point I was petrified/terrified. the paramedics rushed to the elevator, but it could only fit one out of the two paramedics and the stretcher with my mom on it, so the other paramedic tried to go down the other elevator, but it was in maintenance mode, so he rushed down the stairs and saw did I my mom lived on the 9th floor, so it was a bit tiring, but the adrenaline kept me going. we arrived at the ground floor where the paramedic was already waiting for us, and I leapt into the ambulance and so did the other paramedic. they could see that her blood was leaking in her brain and told me they think she has a stroke they were trying to give her blood and stop the leaking using some medication to clot the blood. We arrived at the hospital where she got sent to the ER immediately and the doctors said led me out of the room and they told me to wait outside while they operate on her I was so horrified and scared and worried for my mom I just wanted to see her I sat in the waiting room for over 3 hours when the doctor told me to come in my mum's room so I rushed beside him and while we were going over to the room he told me that he had some bad news he told me that my mom was in a coma and he didn't know how long it would take for her to get out of it my life shattered in that moment it's hasn't even been a month since my dad died now my other parent is in the hospital in a coma. I set by her hospital bed day and night, got fired from my job since I didn\u2019t notify the supervisor I would be on leave, and on top of all that I am now drowning in medical bills and debts."

      "content": "As we drove to my mom's apartment, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. I was still grieving over my dad's death, but I also felt a sense of relief. I was relieved that I wouldn't have to deal with his abuse anymore, but at the same time, I felt guilty for feeling that way. I knew that my dad was not a good person, but he was still my father. I decided to push those thoughts aside for now and focus on supporting my mom through this difficult time.\n\nWhen we arrived at my mom's apartment, she thanked me for driving her and asked if I wanted to come in for a cup of tea. I agreed, and we sat down in her living room. She started talking about my dad and how she wished things could have been different between them. She said that she loved him despite his flaws, and that she was grateful for the good times they had together. I listened to her and nodded, but I didn't know what to say. I felt like I couldn't relate to her feelings because my experiences with my dad were so different.\n\nAfter a while, my mom asked me if I wanted to stay with her for a few days until she was feeling better. I hesitated, but I ultimately agreed. I didn't want to leave her alone, and I knew that I needed to be there for her. So, I packed a small bag and moved into her apartment.\n\nThe next few days were difficult. I struggled to adjust to the long commute to work and the change of surroundings. I missed my own home and my own bed. But, at the same time, I was glad to be able to spend time with my mom and help her through her grief. I helped her with household chores, cooked meals for her, and listened to her talk about my dad. I also attended counseling sessions with her, which helped us both to process our emotions and come to terms with what had happened.\n\nOver time, things started to get better. My mom and I started to heal and move forward. We talked about our feelings and shared our memories of my dad. We also made plans for the future, like moving to a new apartment and starting fresh. I realized that even though my dad's death was a tragedy, it also gave us the opportunity to move on and rebuild our lives without his abuse and negativity.\n\nI am still grieving and I still have moments where I feel angry and confused. But, with the support of my mom and the help of counseling, I am slowly learning to let go of the past and focus on the future. I am grateful for the love and support of my mom, and I am determined to make the most out of the second chance that life has given me."
