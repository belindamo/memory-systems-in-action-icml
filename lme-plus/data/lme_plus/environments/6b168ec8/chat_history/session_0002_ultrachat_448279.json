Additionally, some people were critical of the song \"Formation,\" which contains references to police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as the imagery of Beyonc\u00e9 and her dancers wearing Black Panther-inspired outfits during the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nOn the other hand, many others saw \"Lemonade\" as a powerful and important work of art that represented a new level of creative ambition and social commentary for Beyonc\u00e9.
