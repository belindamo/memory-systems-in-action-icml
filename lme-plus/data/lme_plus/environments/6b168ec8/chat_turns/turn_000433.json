Here are some tips to help you achieve a sense of texture and dimensionality in your mixed media work:\n\n1. **Experiment with different adhesives**: Choose adhesives that suit the materials you're working with. For example, acrylic gel medium or decoupage medium work well with paper, while fabric adhesive or hot glue gun can be used for fabric.\n2. **Layering is key**: Build up layers of paper, fabric, or other materials to create depth and visual interest. You can also use layering to create subtle texture and dimensionality.\n3. **Emphasize texture with paint**: Use paint to enhance the texture of your materials. For example, you can use thick, impasto strokes to emphasize the ridges of paper or the weave of fabric.\n4. **Contrast textures**: Combine rough, tactile textures with smooth, flat areas to create visual interest. This contrast will draw the viewer's eye through the composition.\n5. **Play with scale**: Use large, sweeping gestures or small, intricate details to create a sense of scale and dimensionality.\n6. **Incorporate found objects**: Add found objects like burlap, lace, or natural fibers to introduce unexpected textures and add depth to your work.\n7. **Use fabric as a substrate**: Instead of painting on canvas or board, use fabric as your base. This can add a unique texture and flexibility to your work.\n8. **Add dimension with paper manipulation**: Crumple, fold, or tear paper to create three-dimensional forms that add depth to your composition.\n9. **Experiment with transfer techniques**: Transfer images or textures onto your surface using techniques like gel transfer, paper transfer, or photo transfer. This can add an extra layer of interest and dimensionality.\n10. **Balance texture with negative space**: Make sure to balance your textured elements with areas of negative space to create a sense of breathing room and visual calm.\n\nSome specific tips for working with paper and fabric:\n\n* When using paper, consider the weight and texture of the paper itself. Thicker, heavier papers can add more dimensionality than thinner ones.\n* When working with fabric, choose fabrics with interesting textures or patterns to add depth to your work. You can also dye or paint fabric to create unique colors and textures.\n* Experiment with different ways of attaching fabric and paper to your surface, such as stitching, gluing, or taping.\n\nRemember, the key to creating texture and dimensionality in mixed media is to experiment and play. Don't be afraid to try new techniques and materials \u2013 it's often the unexpected combinations that lead to the most interesting results!",
