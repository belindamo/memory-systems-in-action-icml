In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, orange juice, vinegar, Dijon mustard, and honey or maple syrup until well combined.\n2. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more citrus juice, vinegar, or honey to your liking.\n3. Stir in some chopped fresh herbs, if using, for added flavor and color.\n4. Store the vinaigrette in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.\n\nThis vinaigrette has a nice balance of tangy and sweet, with a refreshing citrus twist.
