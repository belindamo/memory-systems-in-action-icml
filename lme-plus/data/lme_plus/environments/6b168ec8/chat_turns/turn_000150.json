  "content": "The speaker and his wife have been in love for 70 years and he has had the same attitude towards her since they first met. They see themselves as two parts of one whole, and do not see themselves living without each other. The speaker was very involved in the formation of their four children Avner, Esther, Michal, and Tamar. He has written a book about the fundamental law of human dignity and freedom which reflects Israeli law.\nA conversation between two people discussed a book that reflected the history of Israeli law. The speaker mentioned that they used to be in charge of the night and their son Avner when he would cry. Allegations of nepotism have been heard against the speaker and they admitted that it was wrong for the children of judges to intern with their fathers. The speaker concluded that it is better for judges not to take care of their children, as it can lead to criticism.\nThis conversation discusses Yitzhak Rabin's resignation as Prime Minister of Israel in 1977. It references a Treasury committee that recommended a ransom for Rabin's wife, but the legal advisor did not accept this recommendation. Rabin accepted the criticism and resigned without hiding behind his Knesset immunity. The speaker expresses their sadness at Rabin's passing, noting his honesty.\nThe speaker is discussing the resignation of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a result of a mistake he made, and comparing it to the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's situation. He appreciates Netanyahu for his accomplishments as Prime Minister, but is critical of his current actions, which he believes are not in the best interest of Israel. He believes that Netanyahu should have resigned like Olmert did, and that Rabin's resignation was the right thing to do.\nThe speaker resigned after Yitzhak Rabin did not require a plea deal but with Netanyahu, who is accused of bribery, they agreed to a plea deal to prevent a rift in the nation. The speaker also said that if Netanyahu had agreed to the deal at the time, he would have had to confess and resign and leave political life. The speaker then discussed an old woman with whom they had difficulty.\nAlika is in old age and it is hard for the speaker to see her in this state. Despite the pain of old age, the speaker takes comfort in the fact that Alika had a wonderful life. They have four children and 11 grandchildren, which has brought them great wealth. The speaker believes changes should be made but they need to be done with agreement so that they can stand the test of time. They mention Judge Aharon Barak and thank him for having this conversation as well as Amir Ben David and Noa Myel who helped prepare this idea.\nThe speaker is thanking the other person for giving them the opportunity to participate in their programs, and expressing appreciation for the previous programs. They mention that a particular experience was particularly fascinating, and thank them again.",
