It can be tough to tear yourself away from a captivating show, but setting reminders on your phone can be a great way to help you stick to your wind-down routine. Here are a few ways to do it:\n\n1. **Set a specific reminder**: Set a reminder on your phone to go off at a specific time each day, say 30 minutes or 1 hour before your desired bedtime. This can be a gentle nudge to start winding down and disconnecting from screens.\n2. **Use a bedtime mode**: Many phones have a built-in \"Bedtime\" or \"Do Not Disturb\" mode that can be scheduled to turn on at a specific time. This can help silence notifications, dim your screen, and remind you to start winding down.\n3. **Apps to the rescue**: There are several apps available that can help you track and limit your screen time, as well as remind you to take breaks and wind down before bed. Some popular options include:\n\t* Freedom: Blocks distracting apps and websites across all your devices.\n\t* Moment: Tracks your screen time and provides insights to help you reduce it.\n\t* Calm: Offers guided meditation and relaxation exercises, as well as a \"Sleep Story\" feature to help you wind down.\n\t* Sleep Cycle: Tracks your sleep patterns and wakes you during your lightest sleep phase, helping you feel more rested.\n4. **Create a bedtime routine**: Set reminders to start your bedtime routine, which can include activities like reading, journaling, or practicing gentle stretches. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a reminder system that works for you and your unique schedule. Experiment with different methods until you find one that helps you stick to your wind-down routine and gets you ready for a restful night's sleep.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you willing to give one of these methods a try?",
