However, it's essential to consider your viewing habits and priorities.\n\n**Pros of binge-watching:**\n\n* You can immerse yourself in the series and enjoy the momentum.\n* You might retain more information and connect the dots between episodes better.\n* You'll finish the series quickly and can move on to other shows or activities.\n\n**Cons of binge-watching:**\n\n* You might burn out or feel overwhelmed by watching multiple episodes in a short span.\n* You might not give yourself time to process or reflect on the information presented.\n* You'll finish the series quickly, but then you'll be left with a void in your schedule.\n\n**Sticking to the one episode per week schedule:**\n\n* You'll pace yourself and have time to digest the information and reflect on each episode.\n* You'll maintain a consistent schedule and avoid binge-watching fatigue.\n* You'll have something to look forward to each week, and the series will last longer.\n\nConsidering your initial plan, I recommend sticking to the one episode per week schedule for \"When We Left Earth\". This will help you maintain a balanced schedule, avoid burnout, and enjoy the series at a leisurely pace. However, if you do decide to binge-watch, make sure you're not sacrificing your other shows or activities.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your viewing habits and make choices that work best for you. If you do decide to binge-watch, just be aware of your viewing habits and adjust your schedule accordingly.",
