It's a whole different ball game, isn't it?\n\nI'd be happy to help you with affordable accommodation options in Southeast Asia and South America. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n**Southeast Asia:**\n\n1. **Hostels:** Southeast Asia is famous for its affordable and social hostels. You can find dorms for as low as $5-10 per night, and private rooms for $15-30. Look for hostels with good reviews on websites like Hostelworld, Booking.com, or Hostelbookers.\n2. **Guesthouses:** Family-run guesthouses (or homestays) are a great option for solo travelers. They're usually cheaper than hostels and offer a more local experience. You can find them on Booking.com or by asking locals for recommendations.\n3. **Bungalows:** If you're heading to beach destinations like Thailand, Cambodia, or Indonesia, consider staying in bungalows. They're often simple, but affordable and close to the beach.\n4. **Apps:** Download apps like Hostelworld, Booking.com, or HotelsCombined to find and book affordable accommodations on the go.\n\n**South America:**\n\n1. **Hostels:** South America has a vibrant hostel scene, especially in popular destinations like Rio, Buenos Aires, and Cusco. Expect to pay $10-25 per night for a dorm and $20-40 for a private room.\n2. **Hostal:** In South America, a \"hostal\" is often a family-run guesthouse or B&B. They're a great option for solo travelers, offering a local experience at an affordable price (around $20-35 per night).\n3. **Airbnb:** Consider staying in an Airbnb apartment, especially if you're traveling for an extended period. You can find entire apartments for $20-30 per night in many South American cities.\n4. **Couchsurfing:** If you're feeling adventurous, try Couchsurfing, a platform that connects travelers with local hosts who offer free accommodation.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Book in advance:** Especially during peak travel seasons, booking accommodations in advance can save you money and ensure availability.\n2. **Negotiate:** In some cases, especially with guesthouses or hostels, you can negotiate the price, especially if you're staying for an extended period.\n3. **Research:** Read reviews, check the location, and research the area before booking your accommodation.\n4. **Be flexible:** Be prepared for differences in amenities, cleanliness, and service standards compared to what you're used to in Hawaii or other Western destinations.\n\nI hope these tips help you plan your solo adventure in Southeast Asia or South America!\n\nHow was your family vacation to Hawaii? What were some of the highlights and challenges of traveling with your family?",
