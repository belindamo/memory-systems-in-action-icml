Centrale Montemartini - This museum is housed in an old power station and features classical sculptures alongside engines and turbines.\n\n2. Villa Farnesina - A beautiful Renaissance villa that features frescoes and artwork by Raphael.\n\n3. Palazzo Massimo alle Terme - An underrated museum that houses a vast collection of ancient Roman art and artifacts.\n\n4. Crypta Balbi - This museum is located in the remains of an ancient Roman theater and showcases the layers of Rome's history.\n\n5. Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia - Located just outside the city center, this museum is devoted to the Etruscan civilization that predates ancient Rome.\n\n6. Chiostro del Bramante - A former monastery turned exhibition center, it showcases contemporary art and photography.\n\nI hope this helps! Enjoy exploring Rome's museums!",
