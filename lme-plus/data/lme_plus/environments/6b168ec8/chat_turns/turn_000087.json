  "content": "While it may seem counterproductive and short-sighted to resist progress, it is important to remember that change can be difficult for many people, particularly if it challenges their worldview or way of life. People may also be resistant to change if they don't fully understand its implications or feel that it threatens their personal or cultural identity.\n\nFear of the unknown, uncertainty and risk aversion can also play a role in people's resistance to change or new discoveries. Folks may be unsure about the potential outcomes or benefits of such changes and seek stability over possible progress.\n\nHowever, as you've said, it is essential to recognize that the world is constantly changing and evolving, and that progress is necessary for the survival and thriving of societies. For this reason, it's important to educate people on the benefits and potential of new ideas, technologies and advancements so that they can better understand their implications and make informed decisions. Ultimately, a balanced and measured approach towards progress, keeping important social and environmental issues in mind, is important for everyone.",
