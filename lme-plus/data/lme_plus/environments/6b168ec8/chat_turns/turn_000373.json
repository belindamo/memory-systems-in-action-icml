This means that your fitness tracker doesn't have built-in GPS, but instead, it connects to your phone's GPS via Bluetooth to access location data.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nHere's how connected GPS works:\n\n1. **Phone's GPS**: Your phone's GPS is used to determine your location, speed, and distance traveled.\n2. **Bluetooth connection**: Your fitness tracker connects to your phone via Bluetooth, allowing it to access the GPS data.\n3. **Data syncing**: The fitness tracker receives the GPS data from your phone and uses it to track your activity, including distance, pace, and route.\n4. **Syncing data**: The fitness tracker syncs the data with your phone, allowing you to view your activity details, including maps, on the fitness tracker's app.\n\n**Benefits of Connected GPS:**\n\n1. **Convenience**: You don't need to carry a separate GPS device or a phone with built-in GPS.\n2. **Accurate tracking**: Connected GPS provides accurate distance, pace, and route tracking, even in areas with weak GPS signals.\n3. **Extended battery life**: Since the fitness tracker isn't using its own GPS, it can conserve battery life.\n4. **Seamless integration**: Connected GPS allows for easy syncing of data between your fitness tracker and phone.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. **Phone dependency**: You need to have your phone with you during the activity, which can be a limitation for some users.\n2. **Bluetooth range**: The fitness tracker and phone need to be within Bluetooth range (typically around 30 feet) for connected GPS to work.\n\n**Fitness trackers with Connected GPS:**\n\nMany fitness trackers offer connected GPS, including some Fitbit models, Garmin devices, and Samsung wearables. If you're looking for a dedicated fitness tracker with connected GPS, you can consider models like the Fitbit Inspire HR, Garmin Vivosport, or Samsung Galaxy Fit.\n\n**Your Fossil smartwatch:**\n\nI'm glad to hear you're enjoying your Fossil smartwatch! Since you're looking for a dedicated fitness tracker, you might want to consider a device that complements your smartwatch. A fitness tracker with connected GPS can be a great addition to your wearable collection, offering more specific fitness tracking features and longer battery life.\n\nDo you have any other questions about connected GPS or fitness trackers in general?",
