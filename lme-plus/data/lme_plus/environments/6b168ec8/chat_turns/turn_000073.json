  "content": "Yes, here are some high-protein vegan snacks that you can take on-the-go:\n\n1. Roasted Chickpeas: Rinse and drain a can of chickpeas and toss them with a tablespoon of olive oil and your desired seasonings (such as garlic powder and smoked paprika). Roast in the oven at 400\u00b0F for 20-25 minutes until crispy. This snack contains around 6 grams of protein per 1/2 cup serving.\n\n2. Apple Slices with Almond Butter: Slice an apple and dip the slices into 1-2 tablespoons of almond butter. This snack contains around 5 grams of protein.\n\n3. Vegan Trail Mix: Mix together your favorite nuts (such as almonds, cashews, and peanuts) with seeds like pumpkin or sunflower seeds, and your favorite dried fruit like raisins or cranberries. This snack contains around 6 grams of protein per 1/4 cup serving.\n\n4. Vegan Protein Bars: Look for vegan protein bars that contain at least 10 grams of protein per bar. Some brands I recommend are Larabar, Kind Bar, and GoMacro.\n\nI hope these snack ideas help you stay fueled and satisfied on-the-go!",
