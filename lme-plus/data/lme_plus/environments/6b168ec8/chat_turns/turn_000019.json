It's calculated by dividing the total amount of credit used by the total credit limit, and then multiplying by 100.\n\n**How does credit utilization ratio affect my credit score?**\n\nCredit utilization ratio has a significant impact on your credit score, as it indicates your ability to manage credit responsibly. Here's how it affects your score:\n\n* **High credit utilization (above 30%):** A high utilization ratio can negatively affect your credit score, as it may indicate:\n\t+ Over-reliance on credit\n\t+ Potential financial difficulties\n\t+ Higher risk for lenders\n* **Low credit utilization (below 30%):** A low utilization ratio can positively impact your credit score, as it may indicate:\n\t+ Responsible credit management\n\t+ Ability to manage debt\n\t+ Lower risk for lenders\n\n**How to improve your credit utilization ratio:**\n\n1. **Reduce debt:** Pay down your outstanding balances to decrease your credit utilization ratio. Focus on high-interest debts first.\n2. **Increase credit limits:** Request a credit limit increase from your creditors, but avoid applying for new credit cards or loans, as this can temporarily lower your score.\n3. **Avoid new credit inquiries:** Limit new credit applications, as they can lead to temporary score drops and increase your credit utilization ratio.\n4. **Monitor credit reports:** Ensure your credit reports accurately reflect your credit limits and utilization. Dispute any errors or inaccuracies.\n5. **Consider a credit utilization ratio of 10% or less:** Aim to maintain a utilization ratio of 10% or less to demonstrate responsible credit management and improve your credit score.\n6. **Diversify your credit:** Having a mix of different credit types, such as credit cards, loans, and a mortgage, can help improve your credit utilization ratio and overall credit score.\n7. **Avoid closing old accounts:** Closing old accounts can negatively affect your credit utilization ratio, as it reduces your total available credit. Consider keeping old accounts open and using them sparingly to maintain a healthy utilization ratio.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you have two credit cards with the following details:\n\n* Card A: $1,000 credit limit, $300 balance (30% utilization)\n* Card B: $2,000 credit limit, $500 balance (25% utilization)\n\nYour total credit limit is $3,000, and your total balance is $800. Your credit utilization ratio would be:\n\n($800 \u00f7 $3,000) x 100 = 26.7%\n\nTo improve your credit utilization ratio, you could:\n\n* Pay down the balance on Card A to $200 (20% utilization)\n* Request a credit limit increase on Card B to $2,500 (20% utilization)\n\nBy doing so, your total credit utilization ratio would decrease to:\n\n($600 \u00f7 $3,500) x 100 = 17.1%\n\nRemember, maintaining a healthy credit utilization ratio is crucial for a good credit score. By following these tips, you can improve your credit utilization ratio and overall credit health.",
