All laptops require regular maintenance and updates to keep them running smoothly and securely. It's just the nature of technology.\n\nHowever, you could simplify the process by purchasing a laptop that is designed for ease of use and requires minimal maintenance. For example, a Chromebook is a popular choice for those who want a laptop that is easy to use and doesn't require much maintenance. Chromebooks operate on the Chrome OS, which is designed to be fast and user-friendly, and they come equipped with built-in antivirus software.\n\nAnother option is to purchase a laptop with good build quality and service support from a reputable manufacturer. This can reduce the likelihood of technical issues and provide you with the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have reliable technical support if something does go wrong.\n\nIn summary, while it would be nice to have a laptop that never has issues or requires maintenance, it's not a realistic expectation. However, you can simplify the process by choosing a laptop designed for ease of use, purchasing from a reputable manufacturer with good service support, and regularly maintaining your laptop.",
