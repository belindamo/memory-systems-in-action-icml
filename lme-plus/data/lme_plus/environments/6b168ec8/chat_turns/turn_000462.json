  "content": "I like the lentil or black bean chili idea. I've been trying to cook more at home, so this is a great opportunity to do that. By the way, speaking of cooking, I met a friend at a new sandwich shop downtown last week and we had lunch at 2 pm. Their veggie club was really good, and it's nice to have more healthy options in the area. Anyway, back to the chili - do you have any suggestions for spices or seasonings that I can add to give it an extra boost of flavor?",
