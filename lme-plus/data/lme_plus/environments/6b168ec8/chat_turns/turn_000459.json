However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or knowledge of specific locations, so I didn't know about your experience at the sandwich shop downtown.\n\nMoving on to the meal prep ideas, here are some healthy and delicious options that you can consider:\n\n1. Salad Jars: Prepare a week's worth of salad jars by layering mixed greens, vegetables, and proteins like chicken, tuna, or tofu in a jar. Add a simple vinaigrette dressing just before serving.\n2. Whole Grain Wraps: Fill whole grain tortillas with roasted vegetables, lean meats, and hummus or avocado spread. You can also add some mixed greens and nuts for crunch.\n3.
