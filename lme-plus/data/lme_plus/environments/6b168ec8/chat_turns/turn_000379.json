The Spring Festival: As I mentioned earlier, the traditional custom of offering sacrificial offerings during the Spring Festival has declined due to modernization. Additionally, traditional cultural activities, such as paper cutting and making dumplings, are no longer as common as they once were, as people have access to modern entertainment.\n\n2. The Lantern Festival: The traditional practice of releasing lanterns during the Lantern Festival has been impacted by modern influences. In some areas, the use of traditional paper lanterns has been replaced with plastic lanterns that are more durable and longer-lasting.\n\n3. The Dragon Boat Festival: As I mentioned earlier, the Dragon Boat Festival has been revitalized and transformed into an international event in Jilin province. While the traditional elements of the festival are still present, new and modern editions, such as dragon boat racing, food festivals, and performances, have been added to attract more participants.\n\n4. The Mid-Autumn Festival: The traditional practice of worshipping the moon during the Mid-Autumn Festival is still prevalent in Jilin province, but modern influences have led to different ways of celebrating the festival, such as hosting barbecues, going on trips, and shopping.\n\n5. The Sun Island Snow Sculpture Festival: This is a modern festival that has been introduced to Jilin province, but it incorporates traditional elements such as building snow sculptures that depict traditional Chinese myths and legends.",
