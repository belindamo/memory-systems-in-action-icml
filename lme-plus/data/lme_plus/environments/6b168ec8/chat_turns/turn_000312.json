  "content": "You are a senior in college, assigned to work with a certain client for the semester as a part of your final project. The client's company has a problem, or \"an opportunity for growth\" that they need to solve, but you don't have enough information to solve it.\n\nYou do know that the company is responsible for exclusive technical and managerial training within their field (meaning that only they can train others) by providing instructional classes. The current method of completing this plan has not been well structured because it is reliant on the knowledge of the section managers and course instructors and what they can provide in order to maintain the requirements given to them. As a result of this incomplete and non-structured plan, the company has been losing resources within its yearly budget and the non-allocation of employee hours to produce an efficient work environment. The company is seeking aid in determining a model to help equivalate the number of Instructors to the number of hours of instruction that can be provided. There are 8 Technical Training Sections in the organization based on particular disciplines of technical training. Each Section has independent variables that factor into determining the ratio of instructors to hours of instruction.\n\nDue to budget constraints and employee attrition, they are looking for a new model to distribute instructors. This new model would also convey to stakeholders and other agencies an accurate estimate of required resources, and allow those same stakeholders and agencies a better understanding of the effects of either increasing or decreasing this company's staffing levels or budget. The client wants us to :\n\n1.) Analyze each section to determine the variables they face in deciding their output. \n \n2.) Determine a relative quantitative measure of these variables.\n \n3.) Create a partial/complete automated tool and/or model using MS Excel that can consider the shifting variables and provide a relative number of hours.\n\nWhat information are you missing to satisfy all the requirements and construct such a model? What questions would you ask the client to get all the information you need?",
