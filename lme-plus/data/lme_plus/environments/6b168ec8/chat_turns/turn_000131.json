By mentioning the interest you generated in your new product line, you can create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) among the attendees you're reaching out to.\n\nThis strategy is often referred to as \"social proof,\" where you're using the success of your previous event to demonstrate the value and popularity of your product.
