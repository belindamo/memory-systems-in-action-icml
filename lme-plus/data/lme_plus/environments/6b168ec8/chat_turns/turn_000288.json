  "content": "Yeah, it was a great experience, but definitely very different from solo travel. One thing that stood out was how much more stressful it was to travel with family. My parents are pretty particular about their schedules and meal times, so we had to stick to a rigid itinerary, whereas I prefer to go with the flow. We spent 10 days exploring Oahu, Maui, and Kauai, and stayed in a beautiful resort in Waikiki. My brother, who's 12, had an amazing time trying new water activities like surfing and paddleboarding. What about transportation in Southeast Asia and South America? Are there any affordable options for solo travelers?",
