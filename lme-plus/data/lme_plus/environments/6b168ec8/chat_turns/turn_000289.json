It's great that you got to experience both styles, though.\n\n**Transportation in Southeast Asia:**\n\n1. **Local Transport:** Use local buses, trains, and songthaews (red trucks that operate as shared taxis) to get around. They're super affordable, with fares starting from $1-3.\n2. **Tuk-tuks:** These three-wheeled vehicles are a popular mode of transportation in Southeast Asia. Negotiate the fare before you start your journey, and be prepared for a bumpy ride!\n3. **Flights:** With the rise of budget airlines like AirAsia, Scoot, and Jetstar, flying between Southeast Asian cities is relatively affordable. Book in advance to score cheap deals.\n4. **Bus and Ferry Combos:** For longer distances, consider bus and ferry combinations. They're a cost-effective way to travel, especially in countries like Thailand and Cambodia.\n5. **Motorbike Rentals:** If you're comfortable with riding a motorbike, renting one can be a great way to explore rural areas and save money on transportation costs.\n\n**Transportation in South America:**\n\n1. **Bus Companies:** Companies like Orme\u00f1o, Cruz del Sur, and Expreso Brasileiro offer affordable bus services across South America. You can find routes and book tickets online.\n2. **Colectivos:** Minivans or shared taxis that operate on fixed routes, colectivos are a cheap way to travel short distances.\n3. **Taxis:** Taxis are widely available, but make sure to negotiate the fare or use a taxi app like EasyTaxi to avoid being ripped off.\n4. **Flights:** Similar to Southeast Asia, budget airlines like Avianca, LATAM, and Sky Airline offer affordable flights within South America.\n5. **Shuttles and Tours:** Consider booking shuttle services or guided tours to popular attractions, as they can be more cost-effective than renting a car or hiring a private driver.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Research:** Always research your transportation options in advance to find the best deals and most convenient routes.\n2. **Book Ahead:** Booking transportation in advance can help you save money and ensure availability, especially during peak travel seasons.\n3. **Be Prepared:** Be prepared for delays, cancellations, or changes in schedules, especially when using local transport.\n4. **Stay Safe:** Always prioritize your safety when using public transportation, especially at night or in unfamiliar areas.\n\nIt sounds like your brother had an amazing time trying new water activities in Hawaii! Did you try any new activities or experiences during your trip?\n\nWhich mode of transportation are you most concerned about or interested in using during your solo trip?",
