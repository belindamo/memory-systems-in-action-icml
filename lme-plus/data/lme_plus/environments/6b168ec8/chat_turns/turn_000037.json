However, I can provide you with evidence-based information regarding the impact of these interventions on smoking and alcohol consumption rates. \n\nThere is a substantial body of research that shows that these public health interventions have been successful in reducing smoking and alcohol consumption rates in various countries worldwide. \n\nFor example, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), higher taxes on tobacco products have been shown to reduce smoking rates by increasing the price of tobacco products, making them less accessible and affordable to the general public. Additionally, the WHO found that Quitline services have been effective in helping smokers quit, with evidence suggesting that the services increase the likelihood of quitting by 18% to 33%. \n\nFurthermore, research has found that restrictions on advertising and marketing of alcohol can decrease alcohol consumption. For example, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that a comprehensive ban on alcohol advertising in Sweden led to significant reductions in alcohol consumption, particularly among youth. \n\nSimilarly, research has shown that designated driver campaigns have changed social norms around drinking and driving, making it less acceptable to drive while under the influence of alcohol. A study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs found that designated driver campaigns were associated with a significant reduction in drinking and driving behaviors among young adults. \n\nIn conclusion, there is strong evidence to support the effectiveness of these public health interventions in reducing rates of smoking and alcohol consumption.",
