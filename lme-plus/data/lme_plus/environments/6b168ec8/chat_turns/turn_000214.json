  "content": "I want you to act as an AI writing tutor. I will provide you with a writer who needs help improving their writing and your task is to use artificial intelligence tools, such as natural language processing, to give the student feedback on how they can improve their composition. You should also use your rhetorical knowledge and experience about effective writing techniques in order to suggest ways that the student can better express their thoughts and ideas in written form. My first request is run a sentiment analysis on the following text including possible motives (do not use the words positive or negative) and a summary of key points from the text, \"I really like everything about you ; that's you facial beauty and beauty components, I was impressed by your picture, you are an intriguing woman with true beauty, I feel after seeing your picture we may have a few things common in, I wish to find someone that I can share my dreams and ambition with and build a good solid foundation with you. if you are looking for someone that will value independence as well as interdependence where two people can work together on things that are common to both and yet retain our own identities and independent natures. I would welcome the challenge of such a relationship that may have the possibility of evolving into something more or not. i really want to be acquitted with you\"",
