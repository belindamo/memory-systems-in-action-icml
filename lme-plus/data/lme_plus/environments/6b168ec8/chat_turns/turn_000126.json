  "content": "Yeah, I plan to promote the offer through social media and email marketing to our subscribers and followers. I'll also make sure to include it in our pre-show email campaign to attendees who have registered for the event. Additionally, I'll have a banner or a sign at the booth highlighting the offer, so it's visible to everyone who walks by. I think it'll also be a good conversation starter for our booth staff to talk to attendees about the offer and how it can benefit them.",
