Add cooked lentils, tomato paste, and vegetable broth. Cook until the liquid has reduced and the mixture has thickened. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish, top with mashed potatoes, and bake in the oven at 375\u00b0F for 30-40 minutes. This dish contains around 20 grams of protein per serving. 2. Vegan Chili: Saut\u00e9 onions and garlic in olive oil in a large pot. Add in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, canned beans (such as kidney beans or black beans), chili powder, cumin, and vegetable broth. Cook until the chili has thickened and the flavors have melded together. This dish contains around 15-20 grams of protein per serving. 3. Chickpea Curry: Saut\u00e9 onions, garlic, and ginger in olive oil in a large pot. Add to the pot a can of chickpeas, coconut milk, diced tomatoes, and your desired spices (such as curry powder, turmeric, and cumin). Simmer until the liquid has thickened and the flavors have melded together. This dish contains around 15 grams of protein per serving. 4. Vegan Spaghetti and Meatballs: In a food processor, blend together cooked lentils, breadcrumbs, and seasonings to form \"meatballs.\" Cook the meatballs in a skillet until browned. Serve over whole wheat spaghetti with marinara sauce. This dish contains around 15-20 grams of protein per serving. I hope these dinner ideas help you create delicious and satisfying vegan meals!",
