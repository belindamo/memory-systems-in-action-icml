You'll have a good block of time for your meeting, and you'll still have the rest of the afternoon for other tasks.\n\nNow, about those healthy lunch options... I've got some quick and delicious ideas for you:\n\n1. **Salad Jars**: Prep a week's worth of salad jars by layering mixed greens, veggies, and protein (like chicken, tuna, or tofu) in a jar. Add a simple vinaigrette, and you're good to go!\n2. **Whole Grain Wraps**: Fill whole grain tortillas with sliced veggies, lean meats (like turkey or chicken), and hummus or avocado spread.\n3. **Soup and Sandwich**: Whip up a big batch of lentil or vegetable soup on the weekend, and portion it out for quick reheats during the week. Pair with a side salad or whole grain bread for a satisfying meal.\n4. **Quinoa Bowls**: Cook quinoa and roast a variety of veggies (like broccoli, sweet potatoes, and Brussels sprouts) on the weekend. Then, assemble bowls with your favorite toppings, such as grilled chicken, avocado, and a fried egg.\n5. **Mason Jar Noodles**: Cook noodles, add your favorite sauce (like peanut sauce or salsa), and top with veggies and lean protein. This one's a great way to use up leftovers!\n6. **Omelette**: Whip up an omelette with eggs, veggies, and a sprinkle of cheese. Add a side of whole grain toast or a salad for a filling meal.\n7. **Chickpea or Black Bean Salad**: Mix canned beans with diced veggies, a vinaigrette, and a sprinkle of feta cheese (optional). Serve on top of a bed of greens or as a sandwich filling.\n8. **Grilled Chicken and Veggies**: Marinate chicken breast and grill with your favorite veggies (like bell peppers, zucchini, and onions). Serve with quinoa or brown rice and a side salad.\n\nThese ideas should give you a great starting point for quick and healthy lunches. You can always mix and match ingredients to keep things interesting and tailored to your taste preferences.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any dietary restrictions or preferences I can take into account for more tailored suggestions?",
