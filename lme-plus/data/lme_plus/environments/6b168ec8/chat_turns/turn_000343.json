  "content": "I'd be happy to help you categorize your gift expenses.\n\nTo get started, can you please provide some details about the gifts you've purchased? Here are some questions to consider:\n\n1. Who were the gifts for (e.g., family, friends, coworkers, charitable donations)?\n2. What type of gifts did you buy (e.g., birthday, holiday, wedding, anniversary)?\n3. What were the gifts (e.g., physical items, experiences, gift cards)?\n4. Approximately how much did you spend on each gift?\n\nWith this information, we can categorize your gift expenses into subcategories, such as:\n\n* Birthday gifts\n* Holiday gifts (e.g., Christmas, Hanukkah, etc.)\n* Wedding gifts\n* Anniversary gifts\n* Charitable donations\n* Other gifts (e.g., host/hostess gifts, sympathy gifts)\n\nOnce we have a better understanding of your gift expenses, we can also discuss how to categorize them within your overall budget (e.g., as a separate category or as part of a larger \"Entertainment\" or \"Miscellaneous\" category).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to help!",
