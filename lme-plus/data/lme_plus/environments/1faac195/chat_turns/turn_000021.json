  "content": "Yes, there are similar efforts being made to preserve the purity of other Indian languages. Every major Indian language, such as Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, Telugu, Marathi, and Gujarati, has its own language purist movement. These movements aim to promote the use of the purest form of the language, free from foreign influence, and encourage the use of native words instead of loanwords. \n\nFor example, in Hindi, the movement is called Hindi Rakshak Samiti, or Hindi Protection Committee, and in Bengali, it is called Bangla Bhasha Bachao Samiti or Save Bengali Language Committee. Similarly, various regional language purist movements have emerged in recent years and are working towards promoting the linguistic purity and cultural identity of their respective languages. \n\nAdditionally, the Indian government has launched various language preservation initiatives, such as the National Translation Mission and the Central Institute of Indian Languages, to promote the use of native and classical languages and to document and preserve regional and cultural diversity.",
