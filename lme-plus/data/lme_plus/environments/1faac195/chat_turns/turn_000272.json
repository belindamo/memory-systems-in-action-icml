Is it fiction, non-fiction, mystery, romance, or something else?\n2. What is the general theme or topic of your friend's book? This might help me suggest similar books by local authors.\n3. Are you interested in reading books by authors from your specific city or region, or are you open to exploring authors from other parts of the country or world?\n4. Do you have a preferred format for the books? Are you looking for novels, short stories, poetry, or something else?\n5. Is there a particular tone or style you're in the mood for?
