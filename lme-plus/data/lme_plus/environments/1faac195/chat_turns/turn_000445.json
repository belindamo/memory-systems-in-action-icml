  "content": "Drone photography can add a fantastic new perspective to your Hocking Hills portfolio.\n\nRegarding drone regulations, Hocking Hills State Park follows the guidelines set by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Here are some key restrictions and guidelines to be aware of:\n\n1. **Permits:** You don't need a permit to fly a drone for personal, recreational use in Hocking Hills State Park. However, if you plan to use your drone for commercial purposes (e.g., selling your photos or videos), you'll need to obtain a permit from the ODNR.\n2. **Altitude and Distance:** Drones are allowed to fly up to 400 feet above ground level, but you must maintain a safe distance from people, buildings, and wildlife. Avoid flying directly above or near campgrounds, picnic areas, or other high-traffic zones.\n3. **No-Fly Zones:** There are some no-fly zones within the park, including:\n\t* Within 100 feet of any park buildings, structures, or facilities.\n\t* Above or near areas with sensitive wildlife habitats or nesting sites.\n\t* Near emergency response situations, such as search and rescue operations.\n4. **Visual Line of Sight:** You must maintain a clear visual line of sight with your drone at all times. Avoid flying beyond visual range or behind obstacles.\n5. **Respect Wildlife:** Be mindful of wildlife, especially during breeding or nesting seasons. Avoid disturbing or harassing animals with your drone.\n6. **Follow FAA Guidelines:** Register your drone with the FAA if it weighs more than 0.55 pounds (most drones do). Follow all FAA guidelines and regulations for recreational drone use.\n\nRemember to always fly safely and responsibly, and be respectful of other park visitors and the environment.\n\nBefore you head out, I recommend checking the Hocking Hills State Park website or contacting the park's administration for any updates on drone regulations or restrictions.\n\nHave a great time capturing those aerial shots, and I hope you get some stunning views of Hocking Hills!",
