  "content": "For the flights, I think I'll go with the American Airlines non-stop from JFK to SFO on the earliest available date. Can you book that for me? Also, I'd like to book the Hotel Zeppelin for 3 nights, starting from the day I arrive. Can you make those arrangements as well? \n\nRegarding the books and podcasts, I think I'll download \"The Nightingale\" and \"A Man Called Ove\" on my e-reader, and check out \"How I Built This\" and \"Stuff You Should Know\" on my podcast app. Thanks for the recommendations!",
