Both sunflowers and daisies are great choices, but they have different personalities that might suit your jam display better or worse. Here's a brief rundown to help you decide:\n\n**Sunflowers:**\n\n* Sunflowers are often associated with warmth, happiness, and sunshine, which fits perfectly with the lively atmosphere you described.\n* Their tall, statuesque stems and large, bright yellow petals can create a striking visual impact, drawing customers' attention to your display.\n* Sunflowers can be a bit more dramatic and attention-grabbing, which might be perfect if you want to make a statement with your display.\n\n**Daisies:**\n\n* Daisies are often seen as friendly, approachable, and whimsical, which can create a charming and inviting atmosphere around your display.\n* Their smaller size and more delicate petals can add a touch of elegance and simplicity to your display, which might be fitting if you're going for a more rustic or homespun feel.\n* Daisies come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, which can complement your jam labels and packaging.\n\nConsider the following factors to make your decision:\n\n* **Color scheme:** If your jam labels and packaging feature bright, bold colors, sunflowers might be a better fit. If your branding is more subdued or pastel-colored, daisies might be a better choice.\n* **Display style:** If you're going for a more dramatic, eye-catching display, sunflowers might be the way to go. If you prefer a more understated, charming look, daisies could be the better option.\n* **Personal preference:** Ultimately, choose the flowers that make you happy and reflect your brand's personality!\n\nRemember to choose fresh flowers that are in season and not too overpowering, so they don't distract from your delicious homemade jams. A small bouquet or a few strategically placed stems can make a big impact without overwhelming your display.",
