Capitol Records' focus on the quality of the music and the artist's unique sound over the number of followers or views is a testament to their commitment to fostering long-term careers for emerging artists. By taking the time to listen to the music, they can evaluate the uniqueness and potential of an artist's sound and work with them to build a strong career. This approach benefits both the artist and the label in the long run, as it reduces the risk of signing an artist based solely on their popularity, without considering their potential for long-term success. Overall, Capitol Records' approach to discovering and supporting emerging artists is commendable and inspiring.",
