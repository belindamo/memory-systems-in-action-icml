However, I have to break it to you that cilantro (Coriandrum sativum) is an annual herb, which means it completes its life cycle within a year and typically doesn't produce \"babies\" or offspring like some other plants do.\n\nBut don't worry, I'm here to help you troubleshoot the issues with your current plant and offer some tips to keep it healthy and thriving!\n\n**Reviving a Wilting Cilantro Plant:**\n\n1. **Check the soil moisture**: Cilantro prefers well-draining soil and can be sensitive to overwatering. Stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle, and if it feels dry, it's time to water. If it's already moist, wait a day or two before watering again.\n2. **Adjust the watering schedule**: Cilantro needs consistent moisture, especially when it's hot or during periods of low humidity. Water your plant when the top inch of soil feels dry. Avoid getting water on the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.\n3. **Provide sufficient light**: Cilantro loves full sun to partial shade. If your plant is not getting enough light, it may become leggy or wilted. Move it to a brighter location or consider using grow lights.\n4. **Maintain a comfortable temperature**: Cilantro prefers temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). Avoid placing your plant near heating vents, radiators, or extreme temperature fluctuations.\n5. **Fertilize**: Feed your cilantro plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (5-5-5 NPK) once a month. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n6. **Prune and shape**: Pinch off any wilted or damaged leaves to prevent the spread of disease and encourage bushy growth. Trim back the plant to about 2-3 inches from the soil to promote new growth.\n7. **Watch for pests**: Check your plant for signs of pests like spider mites, aphids, or whiteflies. If you find any, treat the plant with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n\n**Growing New Cilantro Plants:**\n\nSince cilantro is an annual, you can start new plants from seeds every 1-2 weeks to ensure a continuous harvest. Sow the seeds about 1/8 inch deep and 1-2 inches apart in a well-draining potting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist and warm (around 70\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F or 21\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C) until germination (7-10 days).\n\nYou can also try direct sowing cilantro seeds in your garden or container when the weather warms up. Thin the seedlings to 6-8 inches apart as they grow.\n\nI hope these tips help you revive your cilantro plant and encourage new growth!",
