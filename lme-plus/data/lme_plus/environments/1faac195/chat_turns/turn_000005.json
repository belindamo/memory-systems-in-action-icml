  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have opinions or emotions, but I understand your concern. It is important to remember that cybercriminals and scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and can create very convincing phishing emails and websites. They use social engineering tactics to prey on human emotions such as fear, greed or urgency, which can make even the most tech-savvy people fall for their scams. Rather than calling people dumb, we should focus on raising awareness about the dangers of phishing scams, educating ourselves about how to detect and report them, and working together to stop scammers from stealing our sensitive information.",
