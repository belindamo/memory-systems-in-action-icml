  "content": "No, it is not recommended to use regular human shampoo on your rabbit. Human shampoos are not formulated for a rabbit's skin and can be too harsh, causing dryness, irritation or even skin inflammation. It's important to use a shampoo specifically designed for rabbits, as they have a different pH level and their skin is much more sensitive than human skin. If you run out of rabbit shampoo, it's better to wait until you can get more than to risk harming your rabbit's skin with a human shampoo.",
