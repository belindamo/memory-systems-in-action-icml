  "content": "Yes, it is certainly true that musicians can influence each other, and that influence can take many different forms. While Prokofiev may not have been directly influenced by Debussy, it is possible that some of Debussy's ideas or techniques were absorbed into the broader musical landscape of the time and influenced Prokofiev indirectly.\n\nRegarding your point about Debussy's engagement with musical exoticism, this is certainly true - Debussy was known for incorporating non-Western musical elements and scales into his compositions, creating a unique sound that was different from many other classical composers of his time. Dvorak was also interested in incorporating folk music elements into his work, which could be seen as a form of musical exoticism. However, it's worth noting that many composers throughout history have been interested in exploring music from other cultures and incorporating those elements into their own work. For example, composers such as Bartok and Kodaly were also known for their use of folk music elements in their compositions.",
