That's a good sign that your seeds are germinating well.\n\n**Seed Starting Tips:**\n\n1. **Temperature**: Most seeds germinate best in a warm environment, typically between 70\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F (21\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C). Your heating mat should be providing a consistent temperature, which is perfect for seed germination.\n2. **Lighting**: Once your seedlings have 2-3 sets of leaves, they'll need more light. Consider moving them to a spot with direct sunlight or using grow lights to supplement the natural light in your sunroom.\n3. **Watering**: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Check the soil daily, and water when the top 1-2 inches feel dry to the touch.\n4. **Humidity**: Maintain high humidity around your seedlings by covering the seed tray with a clear plastic bag or a cloche. This will help retain moisture and promote healthy growth.\n5. **Air circulation**: Ensure good air circulation around your seedlings to prevent fungal diseases. You can achieve this by providing space between the seedlings and using a fan on a low setting.\n\n**Transplanting:**\n\nOnce your seedlings have 2-3 sets of leaves, it's time to transplant them into individual pots or into a larger container. This will give their roots more room to grow.\n\n1. **Hardening off**: Before transplanting, acclimate your seedlings to outdoor conditions by gradually exposing them to direct sunlight, wind, and cooler temperatures over the course of 7-10 days.\n2. **Soil preparation**: Use a well-draining potting mix and a container with good drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.\n3. **Handle with care**: Be gentle when transplanting your seedlings, as their roots are still delicate.\n\n**Common Issues:**\n\n1. **Damping off**: Fungal diseases can cause seedlings to rot at the soil line. Improve air circulation, reduce watering, and ensure good drainage to prevent this.\n2. **Leggy seedlings**: If your seedlings are stretching towards the light, it may be a sign that they need more light or are too close together. Prune them back to encourage bushy growth.\n\nKeep up the good work, and you'll be enjoying your homegrown tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers in no time!",
