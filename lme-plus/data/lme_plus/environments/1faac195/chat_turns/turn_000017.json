  "content": "Yes, there have been efforts to preserve pure Tamil language usage despite the influences of other languages. One of the most notable efforts is the Tamil Purists Movement, which advocates for the use of pure Tamil words and discourages the use of foreign loanwords. There are also initiatives to promote the use of classical Tamil, which is considered to be the purest form of Tamil. The Tamil Nadu government has established a Tamil Virtual University that offers courses on classical Tamil literature and language. Additionally, there are organizations that promote the use of Tamil in various domains, such as education, media, and literature. The Tamil Nadu government has also mandated the use of Tamil in official communication and encourages the use of Tamil in public spaces. Despite these efforts, the influence of other languages on Tamil usage continues to be strong, particularly in contemporary contexts.",
