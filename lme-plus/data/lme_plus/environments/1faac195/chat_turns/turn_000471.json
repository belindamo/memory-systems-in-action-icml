It can be really tough to navigate a new city, especially when you're still getting used to a new language.\n\nI'd be happy to help you with directions to the nearest grocery store from your apartment. Can you please tell me the address of your apartment or the nearest landmark? That way, I can give you the most accurate directions possible.\n\nAlso, I'm here to listen if you want to talk more about your experience getting to language class today. Sometimes sharing what's on your mind can help you feel better. What was the most challenging part of your journey today? Was it the language barrier, getting lost, or something else entirely?",
