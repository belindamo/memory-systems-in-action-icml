  "content": "Some people believe that the prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 is about King Hezekiah, but the context of the verse and the overall message of the book of Isaiah indicate that it is a messianic prophecy. The Hebrew word used for \"child\" in this verse can also be translated as \"descendant\" or \"offspring\", and the names given to the child in this verse are not typical royal titles. The book of Isaiah also contains many other messianic prophecies, such as the suffering servant passages in Isaiah 52-53 and the promise of a new king in Isaiah 11:1-10. These prophecies point to a future savior who will bring peace and redemption to the world, and I believe that this savior is Yeshua.",
