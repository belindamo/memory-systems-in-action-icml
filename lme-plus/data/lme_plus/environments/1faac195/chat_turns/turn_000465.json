  "content": "Yes, there are several countries that have less robust social welfare systems than Sweden. Some of these countries include:\n\n1. United States: Unlike Sweden, the US does not have universal healthcare or parental leave policies. The US social welfare system provides limited support to low-income families, mostly in the form of food stamps and rental assistance.\n\n2. United Kingdom: While the UK has a strong healthcare system, its social welfare system has been subject to significant cuts in recent years. The country has also been criticized for its limited support for low-income families and the disabled.\n\n3. Japan: The Japanese social welfare system is considered to be less comprehensive than those of many other developed countries. There is no universal healthcare system, and parents receive very little support in terms of parental leave or affordable childcare.\n\n4. India: India has a very limited social welfare system, and poverty remains widespread. Access to healthcare, education, and housing is often inadequate or non-existent for many of its citizens.\n\nOverall, the level of social welfare provision varies widely across different countries, depending on their political, economic, and social contexts.",
