  "content": "I completely concur. capitol records' approach to discovering and supporting emerging artists has opened up opportunities for musicians who may have otherwise gone unnoticed. by prioritizing diverse and unique sounds, they demonstrate that not all music has to fit into traditional molds to be successful, and this creates room for talented artists who might otherwise struggle. it's heartening to see labels recognize the value of these kinds of artists, and work to help them excel in the industry.",
