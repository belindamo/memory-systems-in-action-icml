  "content": "It is not recommended to shave off your long haired rabbit's fur, even in hot weather. The fur helps to regulate your rabbit's body temperature and protects them from harmful UV radiation. If your rabbit gets too hot in the summer, there are other ways to help them cool down, such as keeping them in a cool, shaded area, providing them with cool water to drink, and freezing water bottles or ceramic tiles for them to lay on. \n\nIf your long haired rabbit requires regular grooming, you can adjust the frequency to suit weather conditions, but it's not advisable to shave off their long fur. Grooming helps remove dead skin cells, distribute oils through the coat, and prevent mats and tangles. It also helps to prevent hairballs, which can be dangerous for rabbits. If you're uncertain about how to groom your rabbit properly, consult with a professional pet groomer or a veterinarian who can provide guidance or refer you to a rabbit-savvy groomer.",
