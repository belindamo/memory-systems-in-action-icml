By focusing on how exercise makes you feel and celebrating small wins, you'll be more likely to develop a positive and sustainable relationship with physical activity.\n\nSetting reminders or cues can be a great way to stay on track and reinforce your new mindset. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Set a daily reminder**: Set a reminder on your phone to take a few minutes each day to reflect on how you're feeling and what you're grateful for. This can help you stay focused on the positive aspects of exercise and cultivate a more mindful approach.\n2. **Create a motivational board**: Create a board or vision board with inspiring quotes, images, or reminders that motivate you to exercise and focus on how it makes you feel. Place it in a spot where you'll see it often, like on your fridge or near your workout space.\n3. **Use affirmations**: Write down affirmations that resonate with your new mindset, such as \"I exercise because it makes me feel strong and confident\" or \"I am capable of achieving my fitness goals.\" Repeat them to yourself before or during your workouts to stay focused and motivated.\n4. **Schedule self-care**: Treat yourself to a post-workout self-care routine, like a relaxing bath, a healthy smoothie, or a good book. This can help you associate exercise with positive feelings and reinforce your new mindset.\n\nRemember, the key is to find what works for you and make it a consistent part of your routine. By setting reminders and cues, you'll be more likely to stay on track and maintain your motivation.\n\nHow do you plan to incorporate reminders or cues into your routine?",
