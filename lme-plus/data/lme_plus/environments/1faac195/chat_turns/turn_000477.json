Finding specialty ingredients can be a challenge, but New York City is a melting pot of cultures, and you can often find what you're looking for with a little digging.\n\nBerbere spice and injera bread are common ingredients in Ethiopian cuisine, and you can find them in various African or Middle Eastern markets in the city. Here are a few options to get you started:\n\n**For berbere spice:**\n\n1. **African Market** (Multiple locations): This market has several locations in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, and they usually carry a variety of African spices, including berbere.\n2. **Momo's African Market** (Harlem): This market in Harlem has a wide selection of African ingredients, including berbere spice.\n3. **Kalustyan's** (East Village): This Indian and Middle Eastern market might not be the first place you'd think to look, but they often carry berbere spice and other African ingredients.\n\n**For injera bread:**\n\n1. **Ethiopian markets**: There are several Ethiopian markets in the city, particularly in the Bronx and Brooklyn. You can try **Tana Ethiopian Market** (Bronx) or **Addis Ethiopian Market** (Brooklyn). They usually carry fresh injera bread or can order it for you.\n2. **African Market** (Multiple locations): Again, African Market might carry injera bread or be able to order it for you.\n3. **Online options**: If you can't find injera bread in stores, you can try ordering it online from retailers like **Amazon** or **Ethiopian Grocery**. Keep in mind that freshness might be an issue with online purchases.\n\nBefore visiting any of these markets, I recommend calling ahead to confirm they have the ingredients you need in stock. You can also try searching online for other Ethiopian or African markets in the city that might carry what you're looking for.\n\nRemember to also explore online communities, forums, or social media groups dedicated to Ethiopian cuisine or expats from your home country. They might have helpful tips or recommendations for finding specific ingredients in the city.\n\nGood luck with your cooking, and I hope you're able to find the ingredients you need to make your traditional dish!",
