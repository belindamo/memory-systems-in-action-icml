  "content": "Yeshua did not break the Sabbath, but rather he fulfilled its purpose and showed its true intention. In John 5:16-17, Yeshua healed a man who had been an invalid for 38 years on the Sabbath, and the religious leaders accused him of breaking the Sabbath. In response, Yeshua said, \"My Father is working until now, and I am working.\" This statement showed that the Sabbath is a day of rest and worship, not a day of legalistic rules and regulations. Yeshua also showed that the Sabbath is a day to do good and help others, as he demonstrated by healing the man on the Sabbath. By fulfilling the true purpose of the Sabbath, Yeshua showed that he was a Torah-observant Jewish teacher.",
