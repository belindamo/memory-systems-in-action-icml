Researching and comparing features is essential to finding the perfect device for your needs.\n\nBased on your requirements, I'd say a mid-range option like the Garmin Vivosport or Fitbit Inspire HR could be sufficient for your needs. Here's why:\n\n1. **GPS accuracy**: Both the Garmin Vivosport and Fitbit Inspire HR have reliable GPS tracking, which should be sufficient for running and outdoor activities.\n2. **Heart rate monitoring**: Both devices offer continuous heart rate monitoring, which is perfect for tracking your heart rate during exercise and at rest.\n3. **Battery life**: The Garmin Vivosport typically lasts up to 7 days, while the Fitbit Inspire HR can last up to 5 days. Both should be sufficient for most users, but if you're a frequent exerciser, you might need to charge the Fitbit Inspire HR more often.\n\nThe Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a more advanced device, and its additional features might not be essential for your needs. Here are a few reasons why you might not need to splurge:\n\n1. **Music storage**: If you don't plan to store music on your device or use it for music playback, the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music's music storage feature might not be a necessity.\n2. **Advanced running features**: While the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music offers advanced running features like cadence, stride length, and lactate threshold tracking, these might not be essential for casual runners or those who focus on weightlifting.\n3. **Price**: The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is significantly more expensive than the mid-range options, so if budget is a concern, the Vivosport or Inspire HR might be a more affordable choice.\n\nThat being said, if you're a serious athlete or plan to use the device for more advanced features like triathlon tracking, the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music might be worth considering.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n1. Research and compare the features of the Garmin Vivosport, Fitbit Inspire HR, and Garmin Forerunner 245 Music.\n2. Read reviews and watch videos to get a better understanding of each device's performance in real-world scenarios.\n3. Consider your budget and prioritize your needs. If you're willing to spend more for advanced features, the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music might be the better choice. If you're on a tighter budget, the Garmin Vivosport or Fitbit Inspire HR could be the way to go.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to find a device that meets your needs, is comfortable to wear, and provides the data you need to track your progress.",
