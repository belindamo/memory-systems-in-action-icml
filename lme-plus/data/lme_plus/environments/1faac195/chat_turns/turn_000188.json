In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.\" This verse indicates that the Sabbath is a day of rest, even during times of plowing and harvesting. In addition, the Talmud discusses the prohibition against harvesting on the Sabbath in several passages, such as Shabbat 73a and Yoma 84b. These teachings show that harvesting is not permitted on the Sabbath.",
