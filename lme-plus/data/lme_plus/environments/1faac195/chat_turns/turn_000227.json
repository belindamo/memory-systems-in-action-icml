  "content": "I'm looking to visit my mom's best friend in San Francisco, and I'm pretty flexible with dates, but I'd like to go as soon as possible. I live in New York, so I'd prefer to fly out of JFK or LaGuardia. Budget-wise, I'm looking to spend around $500 for flights and $100-200 per night for accommodations. I'd prefer to stay in a hotel, something near her place would be great. Also, do you think I could get some recommendations for some comforting books or podcasts to listen to during the trip? It's been a tough few months, and I could use some distractions.",
