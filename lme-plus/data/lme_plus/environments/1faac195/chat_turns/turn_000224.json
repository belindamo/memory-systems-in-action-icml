No sale or promotion is listed.\n* **Other brands:** Target also carries other brands like Barilla, Prego, and Rag\u00fa. Prices vary depending on the brand and size, but they're generally around $3-$5 per jar.\n\nAs for sales or discounts, I didn't find any current promotions or sales on marinara sauce in the weekly ad. However, it's always a good idea to check the store's sales section or endcaps for any unadvertised deals or clearance items.\n\nNow, about that Ibotta offer: if you have an offer on marinara sauce, it's definitely worth checking the prices at Target to see if you can combine the offer with a sale or discount. Ibotta offers can be a great way to earn cash back on your grocery purchases, and stacking them with sales or discounts can increase your savings even more.\n\nRemember to check the Ibotta app for any specific requirements or limitations on the offer, such as which brands or sizes are eligible, and make sure to upload your receipt to Ibotta after your purchase to earn your cash back.\n\nHappy shopping, and I hope you score a great deal on your marinara sauce!",
