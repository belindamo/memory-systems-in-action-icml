You can find the weekly ad on Target's website or through their app.\n2. **Look for Cartwheel offers**: Target's Cartwheel app often has percentage-off offers on various items, including laundry detergent. You can check the app to see if there are any current offers on Tide or other laundry detergent brands.\n3. **Browse the sales section**: When you're at the store, take a look at the sales section or the endcaps for discounted or clearance items. You might find a previous version of Tide or another brand at a lower price.\n4. **Consider store-brand alternatives**: Target's Up & Up brand often offers comparable products at a lower price point than name-brand options like Tide.
