  "content": "Yeshua did not teach against keeping the Torah, but rather he taught about the proper application and fulfillment of the Torah. Yeshua said in Matthew 5:17-19, \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" This shows that Yeshua upheld the authority and relevance of the Torah, and he taught his followers to do the same.",
