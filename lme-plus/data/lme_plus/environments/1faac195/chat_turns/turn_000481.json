  "content": "While Ethiopian restaurants might not typically sell berbere spice or other ingredients for cooking, they might be able to provide some guidance or point you in the right direction.\n\n**Berbere spice**: Some restaurants might have berbere spice in their pantry, but it's unlikely they would sell it to customers. However, they might be willing to share their supplier information or recommend a local market where you can find it.\n\n**Other ingredients**: Restaurants might not typically sell individual ingredients, but they might have some pantry staples like onions, garlic, ginger, or other spices that they use in their kitchen. They might be willing to sell you a small quantity or provide guidance on where to find them.\n\nWhen you contact the restaurants, you can ask:\n\n* \"Do you sell injera bread for takeout or purchase?\"\n* \"Do you have berbere spice or know where I can find it?\"\n* \"Do you have any other ingredients for traditional Ethiopian cooking, like niter kibbeh or mitmita?\"\n\nKeep in mind that restaurants are busy, and they might not have the time or resources to provide extensive guidance. However, they might be willing to help or point you in the right direction.\n\nIf the restaurants don't have the ingredients you need, you can still try the African or Middle Eastern markets I mentioned earlier. They might carry a variety of spices and ingredients for Ethiopian cooking.\n\nRemember to also ask about the quality and authenticity of the ingredients, especially when it comes to berbere spice. You want to ensure you're getting a high-quality, authentic spice blend that will give your dish the right flavor.\n\nGood luck with your ingredient hunt, and I hope you're able to find everything you need for your traditional recipe!",
