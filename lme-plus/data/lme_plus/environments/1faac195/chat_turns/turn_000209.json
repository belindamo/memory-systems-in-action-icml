  "content": "I've been experimenting with spicy flavors in my cocktails, and I recently made a Spicy Mango Mule that was a huge hit at my last BBQ. I added a splash of smoky mezcal to give it a unique twist. By the way, have you heard of the Paper Plane cocktail? I had it at a cocktail bar downtown, and I've been trying to recreate it at home. It's made with bourbon, Aperol, and Amaro Nonino.",
