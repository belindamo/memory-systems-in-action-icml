  "content": "I'm so sorry to hear about your ex-boyfriend's loss, and I can only imagine how difficult it must be to process that news while also trying to plan a trip to visit your mom's best friend who is going through a tough time as well.\n\nOf course, I'd be happy to help you find flights and accommodations for your trip. Before we get started, I just want to acknowledge that this is a lot to handle emotionally, and it's okay to take a moment to breathe and prioritize your own well-being, too.\n\nTo help me assist you better, could you please provide me with some more details about your trip? Here are some questions to get started:\n\n1. Where is your mom's best friend located?\n2. What are your flexible travel dates for the next few weeks? Are there any specific dates you're aiming for or avoiding?\n3. What is your preferred airport or city to fly out of?\n4. What is your budget for flights and accommodations?\n5. Are you open to staying with your mom's best friend or would you prefer to book a hotel or alternative accommodation?\n6. Are there any specific amenities or services you're looking for in a hotel or accommodation?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can start searching for flights and accommodations that fit your needs.\n\nRemember, take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any emotional support or a listening ear.",
