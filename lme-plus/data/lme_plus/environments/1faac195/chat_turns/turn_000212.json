I'm a big fan of experimenting with unusual bitters to add depth and complexity to cocktails.\n\nI've worked with a variety of bitters, including chocolate mole, and I think they can be a great way to add an extra layer of flavor to a cocktail. Here are some tips and recommendations for experimenting with bitters:\n\n**Unusual Bitters to Try:**\n\n* **Chocolate Mole Bitters:** As you mentioned, these bitters add a rich, chocolatey flavor with notes of spice and nuts. They pair well with spirits like bourbon, rum, and mezcal.\n* **Smoked Bitters:** These bitters have a smoky, savory flavor that's perfect for cocktails with a BBQ or grilled flavor profile. Try them with bourbon, whiskey, or tequila.\n* **Cardamom Bitters:** These bitters have a sweet, spicy flavor that pairs well with gin, vodka, and rum.\n* **Grapefruit Bitters:** These bitters have a bright, citrusy flavor that's perfect for cocktails with a citrus twist. Try them with gin, vodka, or tequila.\n\n**Tips for Experimenting with Bitters:**\n\n* **Start with a small amount:** Bitters can be potent, so start with a small amount (2-3 dashes) and adjust to taste.\n* **Experiment with different spirits:** Bitters can change the flavor profile of a cocktail dramatically, so try pairing them with different spirits to find the perfect match.\n* **Pair bitters with complementary flavors:** If you're using a bitter with a strong flavor profile, try pairing it with ingredients that complement its flavors. For example, pair chocolate mole bitters with cocoa nibs or chocolate syrup.\n* **Make your own bitters:** If you're feeling adventurous, try making your own bitters at home. This can be a fun and rewarding process, and you can customize the flavors to your liking.\n\n**Cocktail Recipes with Unusual Bitters:**\n\n* **Smoked Pineapple Collins:** Mix 2 oz gin, 1 oz smoked pineapple juice, 1 oz lemon juice, 1/2 oz simple syrup, and 2 dashes smoked bitters in a shaker. Strain into a Collins glass filled with ice and top with soda water.\n* **Cardamom Gimlet:** Mix 2 oz gin, 1 oz lime juice, 1/2 oz simple syrup, and 2 dashes cardamom bitters in a shaker. Strain into a coupe glass and garnish with a lime wheel.\n* **Grapefruit Basil Martini:** Mix 2 oz vodka, 1 oz grapefruit juice, 1/2 oz simple syrup, and 2 dashes grapefruit bitters in a shaker. Strain into a martini glass and garnish with a basil leaf.\n\nI hope these tips and recipes inspire you to experiment with unusual bitters in your cocktails!",
