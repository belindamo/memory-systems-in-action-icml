  "content": "What a fantastic idea! Adding fake cigarette smoke to your costume can really enhance the bumbling detective persona and create a memorable impression. Using a vape pen or a fog machine can be a great way to achieve this effect, but please make sure to consider the following:\n\n**Vape pen:**\n\n* Check with the party organizers or venue management to ensure that vaping is allowed indoors.\n* Choose a vape pen with a flavorless or odorless liquid to avoid distracting from your costume or causing any discomfort to others.\n* Be mindful of the amount of vapor you produce, as excessive vapor can be overwhelming or annoying to others.\n\n**Fog machine:**\n\n* Check with the party organizers or venue management to ensure that fog machines are allowed and won't trigger any fire alarms.\n* Use a fog machine with a low-lying fog output to create a subtle, atmospheric effect. You don't want to create a thick fog that obscures your costume or makes it difficult for others to see.\n* Consider using a fog machine with a remote control or timer to ensure you can control the amount of fog released.\n\n**Safety first:**\n\n* Make sure you're not allergic to any materials used in the vape pen or fog machine.\n* Avoid using any devices that could be a fire hazard or cause damage to the venue or other partygoers.\n* Be mindful of any asthma or respiratory issues that may be triggered by excessive fog or vapor.\n\n**Tips for using fake smoke:**\n\n* Use the fake smoke sparingly to create a subtle, atmospheric effect. You want to enhance your costume, not overwhelm the senses.\n* Practice using the vape pen or fog machine before the party to get a feel for how much smoke or vapor you want to produce.\n* Consider adding a few fake cigarette props to your costume to complement the fake smoke effect.\n\nBy using a vape pen or fog machine responsibly and thoughtfully, you can create a fantastic, bumbling detective costume that's sure to impress. Just remember to prioritize safety and consider the comfort of others around you.",
