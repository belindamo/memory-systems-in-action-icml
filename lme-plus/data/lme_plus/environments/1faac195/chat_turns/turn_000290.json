The culinary traditions of Vietnam are influenced by multiple regions and cultures including China, France, and Thailand, resulting in a diverse and delicious culinary experience.\n\nSome of the most popular dishes in Vietnamese cuisine include pho (a noodle soup with beef or chicken), banh mi (a sandwich made with French baguette, meat, vegetables, and herbs), spring rolls (fresh vegetables and herbs, meat or shrimp wrapped in rice paper), and bun cha (grilled pork served over rice noodles with herbs and a dipping sauce).\n\nVietnamese cuisine also has cultural significance as it reflects the country's history and traditions. It is often characterized by the use of fresh herbs, spices, and vegetables, which are reflective of Vietnam's abundant and diverse agriculture. The use of communal eating with dishes being shared amongst the table represents the traditional values of family and community in Vietnamese culture.\n\nAdditionally, many dishes such as pho and banh mi have become internationally recognized, and have contributed to the rise of Vietnam's tourism industry, bringing attention to Vietnamese culture and cuisine.
