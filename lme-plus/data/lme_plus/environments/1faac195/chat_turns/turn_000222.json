  "content": "Black beans are a great addition to any pantry.\n\nYes, Target does carry black beans in their grocery section. They typically offer both dry and canned black beans from various brands, including their own Market Pantry brand.\n\nAs for sales, I've checked the current Target weekly ad and online prices, and here's what I found:\n\n* **Dry black beans:** Market Pantry Dry Black Beans, 1 lb, are currently priced at $1.99 online and in-store. No sale or promotion is listed.\n* **Canned black beans:** Market Pantry Canned Black Beans, 15 oz, are currently priced at $1.49 online and in-store. No sale or promotion is listed.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to check the store's sales section or endcaps for any unadvertised deals or clearance items. You might find a different brand or size on sale.\n\nIf you're looking for a better deal, you could consider buying in bulk or purchasing a larger size. Target often offers discounts on bulk purchases or larger sizes of canned goods.\n\nRemember to check the prices and calculate the cost per unit (e.g., price per pound or ounce) to ensure you're getting the best deal.\n\nHappy shopping, and I hope you find a great deal on your black beans!",
