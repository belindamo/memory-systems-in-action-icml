  "content": "One example of a prophecy that convinced me is from Isaiah 9:6, which says \"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\" This prophecy was fulfilled in Yeshua, who was born as a child, given to us as a son, and is called by the names described in this verse. There are many other prophecies that have been fulfilled in Yeshua, and I believe that these fulfillments demonstrate that he is the Messiah.",
