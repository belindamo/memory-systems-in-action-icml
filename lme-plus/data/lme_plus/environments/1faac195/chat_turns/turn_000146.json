In this recipe, we will explore how to make a tantalizing bowl of culinary bliss that combines fragrant spices, succulent seafood, and creamy coconut milk. In less than 30 minutes, you'll have a spicy soup that's bursting with flavor and is perfect for satisfying your cravings.\n\nLaksa Paste and Garnish\n\nTo start with, we will prepare the laksa paste, which is the foundation of this dish. Begin by heating three tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Then add a peeled and chopped onion and cook for five to six minutes until it softens. Add four medium red chilies, two teaspoons of Ginger paste, two minced cloves of garlic, a teaspoon of lemongrass paste, tablespoon of fresh coriander stalks, a teaspoon and a half of turmeric, half a teaspoon each of cumin and paprika, and a teaspoon of Tamarind paste. Mix all the ingredients together and fry them for another five minutes until they release a lovely fragrance. Once cooked, transfer the mixture to a mini chopper and blend it to form a paste.\n\nWhile the laksa paste is cooking, prepare a quick and simple garnish for the soup. In a small bowl, mix a teaspoon of rice vinegar, a teaspoon of caster sugar, finely chopped red chili, a finger-sized piece of cucumber that's been finely chopped, a quarter of a small red onion that's been finely diced, and a small handful of chopped coriander leaf. Combine the ingredients until they are well-mixed, and the flavors melt together while you work on the laksa paste.\n\nSeafood Laksa\n\nNow that you have the laksa paste ready, add it back into the frying pan, along with 200 mL of full-fat coconut milk, a teaspoon of fish sauce, and 300 mL of chicken or seafood stock. Stir all the ingredients together and bring them to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce is heated through, add in two cod or haddock fillets weighing about 140 grams or five ounces each. Allow the fish to cook in the broth for about four minutes, stirring occasionally until the fish starts to flake apart.\n\nAs the fish cooks, soak 200 grams or about seven ounces of dried rice or vermicelli noodles in boiling water for about three minutes. Once the fish is almost cooked through, add in 16 King prawns to serve four people, and cook them for another minute until they turn pink. Next, add 200 grams or about seven ounces of fresh bean sprouts and cook them for another minute or two until they are heated through. Then turn off the heat.\n\nTo serve, drain the rice noodles and divide them between four bowls. Top the noodles with the delicious seafood laksa, and finish each bowl with a tablespoon of the fresh and vibrant garnish made earlier. Your spicy Thai-inspired soup is now ready to be enjoyed.\n\nRequired Kitchen Tools and Equipment\n\n* Large frying pan\n* Mini chopper\n* Small bowl\n* Wooden spoon\n* Sharp knife\n\nTips and Variations\n\n* Use your preferred seafood combination, such as shrimp, squid, scallops, or fish.\n* Add vegetables like baby corn, sliced peppers, or bok choy to add more color and nutrition to the dish.\n* Substitute chicken or vegetable stock for seafood stock if you prefer.\n* Adjust the heat level by adding more or fewer chilies or using different types of chili peppers.\n* Use fresh or dried noodles according to your preference.\n* Add a squeeze of lime juice and a sprinkle of chopped peanuts for extra flavor.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)",
