Summer BBQ menus often feature grilled meats, fresh veggies, and sweet treats, so I've come up with some refreshing flavor combinations that would pair perfectly:\n\n1. **Summer Sunset**:\n\t* 2 oz Gin\n\t* 1 oz Fresh Grapefruit Juice\n\t* 1 oz Honey Syrup (1:1 honey and water, dissolved)\n\t* Splash of Grenadine\n\t* Garnish: Slice of grapefruit, sprig of rosemary\n\nThe bitter sweetness of grapefruit and honey will complement the smokiness of grilled meats, while the grenadine adds a fruity and refreshing touch.\n\n2. **Cucumber Lime Refresher**:\n\t* 2 oz Vodka\n\t* 1 oz Fresh Lime Juice\n\t* 1 oz Cucumber Syrup (cucumber infused in water and sugar, then strained)\n\t* Splash of Sparkling Water\n\t* Garnish: Slice of cucumber, lime wheel\n\nThis light and crisp cocktail will cut through the richness of BBQ favorites like ribs and burgers.
