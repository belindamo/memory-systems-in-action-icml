  "content": "When you reach out to Maria, you can ask her about her general availability on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and then narrow down the time slot based on her response.\n\nHere's a suggested message:\n\n\"Hi Maria, I'm interested in scheduling a private lesson with you to work on my salsa moves. I was wondering if you're available on Tuesdays or Thursdays? If so, what times work best for you? Let me know and we can schedule a time that suits us both. Thanks!\"\n\nBy asking about her general availability, you'll get a sense of her schedule and can then discuss specific time slots that work for both of you. This will ensure you find a time that fits your schedule and Maria's.\n\nRemember to be flexible and open to different time slots. You can always adjust your schedule to accommodate the private lesson, and it'll be worth it to get personalized feedback and guidance from Maria!",
