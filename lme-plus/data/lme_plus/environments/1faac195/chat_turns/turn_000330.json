I'd be delighted to help you with some detective-inspired costume ideas.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on the hilarious improv session with Rachel! That sounds like an absolute blast. I'm sure it's great to have a creative outlet like improv to express yourself and have fun with friends.\n\nNow, let's get to the detective costumes! Here are some iconic and inspiring ideas:\n\n1. **Sherlock Holmes**: Go for a classic deerstalker hat, a long coat, and a magnifying glass. You can add a fake pipe and a \" Elementary, my dear fellow\" attitude to complete the look.\n2. **Film Noir Detective**: Channel the likes of Humphrey Bogart or Philip Marlowe with a fedora, a trench coat, and a crumpled suit. Add a fake cigarette and a world-weary expression.\n3. **Columbo**: Embody the lovable, rumpled detective from the classic TV series with a raincoat, a suit that's seen better days, and a signature cigar.\n4. **Nancy Drew**: If you want to go for a more feminine take, dress up as the iconic teen detective with a bright, colorful outfit, a magnifying glass, and a curious expression.\n5. **Modern Detective**: Opt for a more contemporary look with a sleek suit, a crisp white shirt, and a tie. Add a badge and a gun holster to complete the modern detective attire.\n6. **Clue-inspired Detective**: Pay homage to the classic board game with a brightly colored suit, a matching hat, and a magnifying glass. You can even carry a fake Clue game piece as a prop.\n\nAccessories can make or break the costume, so don't forget to add:\n\n* A detective's notebook and pen\n* A fake mustache or a fedora to add a touch of sophistication\n* A prop gun or a toy magnifying glass\n* A \"Detective [Your Name]\" badge or a fake ID card\n\nFeel free to mix and match elements to create your unique detective character. Have fun and get creative!\n\nDo you have any specific detective character in mind, or would you like more ideas?",
