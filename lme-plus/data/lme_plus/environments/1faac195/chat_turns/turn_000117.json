  "content": "It's not recommended to give your long haired rabbit a buzz cut. Not only does it harm their natural insulation and protection, but it impacts their coat\u2019s natural colour and health. A buzz cut could cause your rabbit to become too cold if the temperature drops, and their skin could become irritated and sunburned with prolonged exposure to sunlight. All rabbits should have some covering over their back and sides to protect their skin, and this is particularly important in long haired rabbits. Regular grooming is the best way to maintain a healthy and comfortable coat for your rabbit.",
