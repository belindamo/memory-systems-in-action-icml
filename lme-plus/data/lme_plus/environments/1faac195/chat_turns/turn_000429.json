Here's why:\n\n1. **Nutrient uptake**: Fiddle leaf figs, like most plants, require essential nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) to grow and thrive. Fertilizers provide these nutrients, which are absorbed through the roots.\n2. **Soil depletion**: Potting soil can become depleted of nutrients over time, especially if you're using a well-draining mix. Fertilizing helps replenish these nutrients, ensuring Felix gets what he needs.\n3. **Growth and development**: Fertilizers promote healthy growth, encourage new leaves, and support the development of a strong root system.\n4. **Pest and disease resistance**: A well-fertilized fiddle leaf fig tree is better equipped to resist pests and diseases, as it's more vigorous and resilient.\n\n**Fertilizing Schedule for Felix:**\n\nFor a fiddle leaf fig tree like Felix, a balanced fertilizer (20-20-20 or 10-10-10 NPK) is a good starting point. You can fertilize:\n\n* **During the growing season (spring-fall)**: Fertilize Felix every 1-2 weeks during the growing season, when he's actively producing new leaves and growing.\n* **During the dormant season (winter)**: Reduce fertilization to once a month, as Felix's growth slows down during this period.\n\n**Additional Tips for Fertilizing Felix:**\n\n* **Dilute the fertilizer**: To avoid burning Felix's roots, dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength.\n* **Water thoroughly**: Water Felix thoroughly after fertilizing to help the nutrients reach the roots.\n* **Monitor Felix's response**: Keep an eye on Felix's response to fertilization. If you notice any adverse reactions, adjust the frequency or type of fertilizer accordingly.\n* **Consider a fertilizer with micronutrients**: Fiddle leaf figs benefit from micronutrients like magnesium, calcium, and iron. Look for a fertilizer that includes these essential micronutrients.\n\n**Other Care Tips for Felix:**\n\n* **Humidity**: Fiddle leaf figs prefer a humid environment, typically above 50%. You can increase humidity around Felix by placing him on a tray with pebbles and water or using a humidifier.\n* **Lighting**: Felix prefers bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can cause leaf scorch, so ensure he's placed in a spot with filtered or dappled light.\n* **Watering**: Water Felix when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.\n\nBy following these fertilization and care tips, you'll be helping Felix thrive and become a stunning addition to your home!",
