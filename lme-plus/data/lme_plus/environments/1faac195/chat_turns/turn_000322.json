It allows for image recognition, object recognition, and markerless tracking, making it a versatile option for creating AR experiences.\n3. Unity: Unity is a game engine that supports AR development through the Unity AR Foundation package. It provides a platform for developing AR experiences that can be deployed to multiple devices and platforms, including iOS and Android.\n4. Unreal Engine: Unreal Engine is a game engine that also supports AR development. It provides a robust set of tools for creating high-quality, interactive AR experiences.\n\nAll of the above options can be used to create the AR experience for your app. The choice will depend on the specific requirements of your project and the skills of your development team.\n\nPlease note that all the above methods need to be tested and optimized in order to achieve the best results and compatibility with your target devices.",
