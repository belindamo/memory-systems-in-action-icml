There are many other prophecies that have been fulfilled in Yeshua, and I believe that these fulfillments demonstrate that he is the Messiah."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Some people believe that the prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 is about King Hezekiah, but the context of the verse and the overall message of the book of Isaiah indicate that it is a messianic prophecy. The Hebrew word used for \"child\" in this verse can also be translated as \"descendant\" or \"offspring\", and the names given to the child in this verse are not typical royal titles. The book of Isaiah also contains many other messianic prophecies, such as the suffering servant passages in Isaiah 52-53 and the promise of a new king in Isaiah 11:1-10. These prophecies point to a future savior who will bring peace and redemption to the world, and I believe that this savior is Yeshua."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yeshua did not teach against keeping the Torah, but rather he taught about the proper application and fulfillment of the Torah. Yeshua said in Matthew 5:17-19, \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" This shows that Yeshua upheld the authority and relevance of the Torah, and he taught his followers to do the same."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yeshua did not break the Sabbath, but rather he fulfilled its purpose and showed its true intention. In John 5:16-17, Yeshua healed a man who had been an invalid for 38 years on the Sabbath, and the religious leaders accused him of breaking the Sabbath. In response, Yeshua said, \"My Father is working until now, and I am working.\" This statement showed that the Sabbath is a day of rest and worship, not a day of legalistic rules and regulations. Yeshua also showed that the Sabbath is a day to do good and help others, as he demonstrated by healing the man on the Sabbath. By fulfilling the true purpose of the Sabbath, Yeshua showed that he was a Torah-observant Jewish teacher."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "According to the Jewish tradition, harvesting is not permitted on the Sabbath. The Torah states in Exodus 34:21, \"Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest. In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.\" This verse indicates that the Sabbath is a day of rest, even during times of plowing and harvesting. In addition, the Talmud discusses the prohibition against harvesting on the Sabbath in several passages, such as Shabbat 73a and Yoma 84b. These teachings show that harvesting is not permitted on the Sabbath."
