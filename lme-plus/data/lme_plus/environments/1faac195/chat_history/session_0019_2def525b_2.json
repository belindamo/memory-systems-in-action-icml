I live in New York, so I'd prefer to fly out of JFK or LaGuardia. Budget-wise, I'm looking to spend around $500 for flights and $100-200 per night for accommodations. I'd prefer to stay in a hotel, something near her place would be great. Also, do you think I could get some recommendations for some comforting books or podcasts to listen to during the trip? It's been a tough few months, and I could use some distractions."

      "content": "I'm so glad you found some comforting gift ideas!\n\nRegarding your ex-boyfriend's mom, I think it's a beautiful gesture to consider sending a condolence gift or card. Losing a loved one is never easy, and it's clear that you still care about your ex-boyfriend and his family.\n\nSending a condolence gift or card can be a thoughtful way to express your sympathy and show that you're thinking of them during this difficult time. It's not about rekindling a romantic relationship or reconnecting; it's about showing empathy and compassion for someone who's grieving.\n\nIf you're worried about it being awkward or inappropriate, you could consider the following:\n\n1. Keep the message simple and sincere. Express your condolences and let him know you're thinking of him and his family.\n2. Avoid any romantic or overly personal language. Keep the tone respectful and platonic.\n3. Consider sending a card or gift that's not too personal or extravagant. A simple bouquet of flowers, a sympathy card, or a donation to a charity in his mom's name could be a thoughtful gesture.\n\nRemember, the goal is to show your condolences and support, not to reinitiate contact or reopen old wounds. If you're still unsure, you could reach out to a mutual friend or acquaintance to get a sense of how your ex-boyfriend might receive your gesture.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what feels right. If you do decide to send a condolence gift or card, I hope it brings some comfort to your ex-boyfriend and his family during this difficult time."
