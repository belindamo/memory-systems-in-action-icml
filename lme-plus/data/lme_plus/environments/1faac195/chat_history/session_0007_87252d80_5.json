What time period do you want to focus on? (e.g. last year, last 5 years, lifetime)\n2. Do you want to include only international trips or domestic trips as well?\n3. Would you like to organize your list by country, city, or specific locations (e.g. landmarks, national parks)?\n4. Are there any specific details you'd like to include about each trip, such as dates, modes of transportation, or notable experiences?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of what you're looking for, I can help you create a list that fits your needs."
