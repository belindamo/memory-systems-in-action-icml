      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "My apologies. The most common hickory species found in the eastern United States is the Shagbark Hickory (Carya ovata). Its range extends from Maine to Florida and as far west as Minnesota and Texas."

      "content": "I never knew hickory trees had so many different species. What's the difference between them all?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, there are several different species of hickory trees found in the U.S. In terms of differences, each species has its own unique characteristics such as bark texture, leaf shape, and nut size and flavor. For example, the bark of a Shagbark hickory is known for its shaggy appearance, while the bark of a Pignut hickory is much smoother. The leaves of a Mockernut hickory are larger than the leaves of a Shagbark hickory, while the nuts of a Shellbark hickory are more difficult to crack than other hickory nuts. Additionally, different species of hickory may have slightly different growth requirements and tolerances to different environmental conditions."

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Wow, I never realized there was so much diversity among hickory trees. Do all of the species produce edible nuts, or are some of them just ornamental?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Most species of hickory trees produce edible nuts that are used for food and other applications. However, some species are grown primarily for ornamental purposes and their nuts are not typically consumed. For example, the Red Hickory (Carya ovalis) produces small, bitter nuts that are not commonly harvested for consumption. Similarly, the Southern Shagbark Hickory (Carya carolinae-septentrionalis) produces small nuts with thick shells that are not considered edible. In general, the nuts produced by hickory trees that are native to the eastern United States are considered food sources, and have been used by Native Americans and settlers for centuries."
