  "content": "A 5-star system is a great way to start, and adding notes about what you liked or didn't like about the book will help you reflect on your reading experiences.\n\nIncluding a section for DNFs (did not finish) or abandoned books is an excellent idea! Tracking DNFs can be helpful for several reasons:\n\n1. **Identifying patterns**: You might notice that you tend to DNF books with certain themes, genres, or writing styles, which can help you make more informed reading choices in the future.\n2. **Reflecting on why you DNF'd**: Writing down why you didn't finish a book can help you understand your reading preferences and what didn't work for you. This can also help you articulate your thoughts and opinions about the book.\n3. **Honesty and accountability**: Acknowledging DNFs can help you be more honest with yourself about your reading habits and avoid feeling guilty about not finishing a book.\n4. **Space for growth**: By tracking DNFs, you might identify areas where you want to challenge yourself as a reader, such as trying new genres or authors.\n\nWhen creating a section for DNFs, you might consider including the following information:\n\n* Book title and author\n* Reason for DNFing (e.g., lack of interest, slow pace, unengaging characters, etc.)\n* Page number or percentage of the book you reached before stopping\n* Any notable thoughts or opinions about the book\n\nRemember, your reading journal is a personal space for reflection and growth. Feel free to experiment and adapt your system as needed.\n\nHow do you plan to organize your journal? Will you have separate sections for finished books, DNFs, and maybe even a to-be-read (TBR) list?",
