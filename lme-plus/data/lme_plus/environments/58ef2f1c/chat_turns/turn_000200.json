  "content": "I'd be happy to help you organize your shopping expenses and calculate the total amount you spent.\n\nTo get started, can you please provide me with the list of purchases you've made this month? You can share the items, quantities, and prices (if you have them) in a format that's comfortable for you, such as:\n\n* A list with columns for item, quantity, price, and total\n* A series of sentences or bullet points with the item names and prices\n* A scanned or photographed receipt\n\nRegarding your concern about multiple items of the same product, don't worry! We can work around that. If you don't have the individual prices listed, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the quantity by the price per unit.\n\nFor example, if you bought 2 pairs of jeans for $X total, we can divide the total cost by 2 to get the price per pair. Then, we can categorize the expense accordingly.\n\nLet's get started!",
