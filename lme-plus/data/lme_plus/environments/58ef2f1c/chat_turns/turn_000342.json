  "content": "Yes, there are other major trade agreements in the works right now. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP): This is a proposed trade agreement between 16 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, Japan, and India. Negotiations have been ongoing since 2012, and the agreement would create a free trade area in the region, covering about a third of global GDP.\n\n2. Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP): This is a trade agreement that was signed in 2018 by 11 countries, including Canada, Japan, and Australia. The agreement was originally called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and included the United States, but the US withdrew from the agreement in 2017.\n\n3. African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA): This is an agreement between 54 African countries that was signed in March 2018. The agreement aims to create a single market for goods and services in Africa, and could potentially transform the continent's economy.\n\nThese are just a few examples of major trade agreements that are currently being negotiated or implemented. The global economy is becoming increasingly interconnected, and trade agreements are an important tool for facilitating that integration.",
