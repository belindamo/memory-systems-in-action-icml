  "content": "One popular song from the 13th century that might be heard in taverns and gatherings is \"Sumer is icumen in\" (also known as the \"Summer Canon\" or the \"Cuckoo Song\"). This Middle English round or rota is one of the oldest known musical compositions featuring six-part polyphony. The lyrics celebrate the arrival of summer and the joys of nature.\n\nHere is the original Middle English text of \"Sumer is icumen in\":\n\nSumer is icumen in,\nLhude sing cuccu!\nGrowe\u00fe sed and blowe\u00fe med\nAnd spring\u00fe \u00fee wde nu,\nSing cuccu!\n\nAwe blete\u00fe after lomb,\nLhouth after calue cu.\nBulluc sterte\u00fe, bucke uerte\u00fe,\nMurie sing cuccu!\nCuccu, cuccu, wel singes \u00feu cuccu;\nNe swik \u00feu nauer nu.\n\nAnd here is a modern English translation:\n\nSummer has come in,\nLoudly sing, cuckoo!\nThe seed grows and the meadow blooms,\nAnd the wood springs anew,\nSing, cuckoo!\n\nThe ewe bleats after the lamb,\nThe cow lows after the calf.\nThe bullock stirs, the stag farts,\nMerrily sing, cuckoo!\nCuckoo, cuckoo, well you sing, cuckoo;\nDon't ever you stop now.\n\nKeep in mind that the language used in this song might be challenging for modern English speakers to understand and sing. If you wish to join in singing, you may want to practice the Middle English pronunciation and become familiar with the melody. Alternatively, you can enjoy listening to the locals sing and appreciate the cultural experience.",
