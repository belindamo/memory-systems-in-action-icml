  "content": "A comedy writing workshop can be a fantastic way to improve your skills, get feedback, and connect with other comedians. When looking for a workshop or instructor, here are some things to consider:\n\n**Workshop Structure:**\n\n1. **Format**: Look for a workshop that offers a mix of lectures, writing exercises, and feedback sessions. This will help you learn new skills, practice writing, and get feedback on your work.\n2. **Duration**: Consider the length of the workshop. Is it a one-day intensive, a multi-week course, or an ongoing program? Choose a format that fits your schedule and learning style.\n3. **Class size**: A smaller class size can provide more personalized attention and feedback. However, a larger class can offer more diverse perspectives and ideas.\n\n**Instructor Credentials:**\n\n1. **Industry experience**: Look for an instructor with a strong background in comedy writing, either as a performer, writer, or both.\n2. **Teaching experience**: Ensure the instructor has experience teaching comedy writing workshops or classes.\n3. **Success stories**: Research the instructor's previous students and their success stories. Have they gone on to perform at festivals, secure writing gigs, or develop their own shows?\n\n**Instructor's Teaching Style:**\n\n1. **Approach**: Do they focus on specific comedy styles (e.g., stand-up, sketch, improv)? Do they emphasize structure, creativity, or both?\n2. **Feedback style**: How do they provide feedback? Is it constructive, supportive, and actionable?\n3. **Encouragement**: Do they foster a positive, encouraging environment that helps you feel comfortable taking risks and trying new things?\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n1. **Cost**: Compare prices among different workshops and consider the value you'll receive for your investment.\n2. **Location**: If you prefer in-person workshops, look for one in your area. If you prefer online, ensure the platform and technology are user-friendly.\n3. **Community**: Does the workshop offer a community or network of fellow comedians and writers? This can be valuable for support, feedback, and potential collaborations.\n4. **Guest speakers or industry connections**: Does the workshop offer opportunities to learn from industry professionals, agents, or bookers?\n5. **Alumni success**: Research the workshop's alumni and their success stories. Have they gone on to achieve their comedy goals?\n\n**Red Flags:**\n\n1. **Lack of transparency**: Be wary if the workshop or instructor is unclear about their approach, structure, or credentials.\n2. **Overemphasis on gimmicks**: If the workshop focuses too much on quick fixes or gimmicks rather than fundamental skills, it might not provide the best value.\n3. **Unrealistic promises**: Be cautious of workshops that promise overnight success or guaranteed results. Comedy writing takes time, effort, and dedication.\n\nBy considering these factors, you'll be well on your way to finding a comedy writing workshop that suits your needs and helps you improve your skills. Good luck!",
