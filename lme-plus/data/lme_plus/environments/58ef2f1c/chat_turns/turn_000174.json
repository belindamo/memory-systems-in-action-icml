Here are some tips to help you stay on track:\n\n**1.

Write it down in your calendar and commit to it.\n\n**2. Start small:**\n Begin with a manageable goal, like 5-10 minutes of loving-kindness meditation per day. As you establish the habit, you can gradually increase the duration.\n\n**3. Make it a ritual:**\n Develop a pre-meditation routine to signal to your mind that it's time to practice loving-kindness.

Reflecting on your experiences and progress can help you stay motivated and inspired.\n\n**6. Be gentle with yourself:**\n Remember that it's okay if you miss a day or two.

Remind yourself of the benefits:**\n Reflect on how loving-kindness meditation has positively impacted your life, such as increased feelings of compassion, patience, or calmness. This can help motivate you to continue the practice.\n\n**9. Make it a habit loop:**\n Attach loving-kindness meditation to an existing daily habit, like right after waking up or before bed. This can help make it a consistent part of your routine.\n\n**10. Seek inspiration:**\n Listen to talks, podcasts, or guided meditations from inspiring teachers or practitioners.
