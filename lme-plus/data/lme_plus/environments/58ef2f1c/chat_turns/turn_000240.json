  "content": "That's fascinating! I can see how Pollock and Rothko's personal experiences and emotions influenced their art, and how they used their art as a way to express and process their emotions. It's interesting to see how their different experiences and emotions shaped their unique styles and techniques.\n\nI'm curious to know more about the role of the viewer in Abstract Expressionism. You mentioned that Rothko's paintings were designed to evoke a sense of intimacy and connection with the viewer. Can you tell me more about how Abstract Expressionist artists like Pollock and Rothko thought about the viewer's experience, and how they sought to engage with their audience?",
