  "content": "What a great experience! Hearing an author's insights about their own work can add a whole new layer of depth to the reading experience.\n\nI'd be happy to help you find your next thriller fix! Can you tell me a bit more about the book you just finished? What did you enjoy about it? Was it:\n\n1. A fast-paced, action-packed plot?\n2. A psychological thriller with a complex, twisty mystery?\n3. A darker, more atmospheric tale with a sense of foreboding?\n4. A character-driven story with a strong, relatable protagonist?\n\nAlso, are you open to trying out a new author or would you prefer recommendations from authors you've already read and enjoyed?\n\nLastly, are there any specific themes, settings, or elements you'd like to see in your next thriller? (e.g. police procedural, amateur detective, supernatural, etc.)\n\nThe more information you can provide, the better I'll be able to tailor my recommendations to your tastes!",
