Since you don't have the prices for each item, we'll make some assumptions and notes to help us organize the expenses.\n\nHere's a categorized list of your purchases:\n\n**Clothing:**\n\n* Camisoles (multiple) from H&M - unknown price\n* Ankle boots from Zara - unknown price\n* Jeans (2 pairs) from Levi's at Macy's - unknown price per pair, but 2 pairs were purchased\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* Notecards from The Paperie - unknown price\n\n**Beauty:**\n\n* Eyeshadow palette from Sephora - unknown price\n* Travel-sized skincare products (multiple) from Drunk Elephant - unknown price\n\n**Home/Office:**\n\n* Custom planner from Etsy - unknown price\n\nTo better organize your expenses, it would be helpful to know the total amount you spent in each category or the total amount for each purchase. If you have the receipts or can recall the prices, please share them with me. If not, we can make an estimate or leave the prices blank for now.\n\nDo you remember the total amount you spent in each category or for each purchase? Or would you like to estimate the prices based on your typical spending habits?",
