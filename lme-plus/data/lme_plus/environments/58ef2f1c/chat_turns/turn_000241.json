Let's dive into how they thought about the viewer's role and how they sought to engage with their audience.\n\n**Pollock's View of the Viewer**\n\nPollock's approach to the viewer was complex and multifaceted. On one hand, he believed that the viewer should bring their own experiences and emotions to the artwork, allowing them to interpret the painting in a personal and subjective way. He wanted his paintings to be a kind of \"mirror\" that reflected the viewer's own emotions and thoughts.\n\nOn the other hand, Pollock was also interested in creating a sense of immediacy and directness with the viewer. He believed that the viewer should be able to experience the painting in a visceral, intuitive way, without needing to intellectualize or analyze it. He wanted his paintings to be a kind of \"event\" that happened between the viewer and the artwork.\n\nPollock's drip paintings, with their complex web of lines and colors, were designed to create a sense of dynamic movement and energy. He wanted the viewer to feel like they were part of the creative process, as if they were witnessing the painting unfold before their eyes.\n\n**Rothko's View of the Viewer**\n\nRothko's approach to the viewer was more introspective and contemplative. He believed that the viewer should approach his paintings with a sense of reverence and quiet contemplation. He wanted his paintings to create a sense of intimacy and connection with the viewer, as if they were sharing a secret or a private moment.\n\nRothko's paintings, with their large, rectangular forms and subtle color gradations, were designed to create a sense of enclosure and containment. He wanted the viewer to feel like they were stepping into a private space, where they could confront their own emotions and thoughts.\n\nRothko was also interested in creating a sense of timelessness and universality with his paintings. He believed that his artworks should transcend the specificities of time and place, speaking to something deeper and more fundamental in the human experience.\n\n**Engaging with the Audience**\n\nBoth Pollock and Rothko were concerned with engaging with their audience in a more direct and intimate way. They wanted to break down the barriers between the artist and the viewer, creating a sense of immediacy and connection.\n\nPollock's approach was more extroverted and performative. He would often invite friends and colleagues to his studio, where he would create paintings in front of them. This performative aspect of his work was meant to create a sense of drama and excitement, drawing the viewer into the creative process.\n\nRothko's approach was more introverted and contemplative. He would often create paintings in private, working alone in his studio. However, he would also engage with his audience through his writings and lectures, sharing his thoughts and ideas about art and the human experience.\n\nIn both cases, Pollock and Rothko sought to create a sense of connection and intimacy with their audience. They wanted their artworks to be a kind of catalyst, sparking a deeper level of emotional and intellectual engagement with the viewer.\n\nI hope this helps!
