Here are some tips to help you cook shrimp perfectly:\n\n1. **Freshness matters**: Fresh shrimp will always taste better and have a better texture than frozen or older shrimp. If you can, try to buy shrimp from a reputable fish market or store that has a high turnover rate.\n2. **Thawing**: If you're using frozen shrimp, thaw them according to the package instructions. Pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture before cooking.\n3. **Size matters**: Shrimp cook quickly, so it's essential to cook them in batches if you're using different sizes. This ensures that the smaller shrimp don't overcook while the larger ones are still cooking.\n4. **Don't overcook**: Shrimp are done when they turn pink and opaque. Overcooking will make them tough, rubbery, and dry. Cook them until they're just set, then remove them from the heat.\n5. **Cooking methods**: You can cook shrimp using various methods, such as saut\u00e9ing, grilling, baking, or poaching. For the Spicy Shrimp and Vegetable Stir-Fry, saut\u00e9ing is a great option.\n6. **Temperature control**: Heat your pan or skillet over medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C). Add a small amount of oil, then add the shrimp. Cook for 1-2 minutes per side, depending on the size.\n7. **Don't overcrowd**: Cook shrimp in batches if necessary, to ensure they have enough room to cook evenly. Overcrowding can lead to uneven cooking and a higher risk of overcooking.\n8. **Use a timer**: Set a timer to ensure you don't overcook the shrimp. A general guideline is to cook shrimp for 2-3 minutes per side, but this may vary depending on their size and your desired level of doneness.\n9. **Check for doneness**: Remove a shrimp from the pan and check its internal temperature. It should be at least 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C). If it's not quite there, return it to the pan for another 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n10. **Drain excess moisture**: After cooking, remove the shrimp from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess moisture. This helps prevent the shrimp from becoming soggy or watery.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to cook shrimp that are tender, juicy, and full of flavor. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your Spicy Shrimp and Vegetable Stir-Fry and Chicken Feta Phyllo Triangles!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
