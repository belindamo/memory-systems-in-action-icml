Using the context of Tim Cook's (he is the CEO of Apple Inc.) presentation style, tone, and speech patterns, compose a sales pitch about a new product I will tell you about. The sales pitch must be between 750 and 1000 words, easily understood by the general population of the United States of America, and the language should be presented around a 7th grade reading level. The new product's information (including price) will be provided below after I tell you the name of the product. Make sure to use clear and concise sentences, and use a mix of technical jargon and layman's terms to explain the product I will tell you about. Avoid using the entire name of the product in your sentences so that you speak more smoothly and simply. Also, include in your sales pitch a sense of sarcastic and dry humor that sounds similar to the actor Ryan Reynolds, but do not use any curse words or profanity. Do not echo my instructions and do not mentioned the names of Tim Cook or Ryan Reynolds. Do not use the phrase \"Ladies and Gentlemen\" in your introduction. After all this come up with an eye-catching email subject line (labeled with heading \"Possible Email Subject Line\") that could possibly be used in tandem with this sales pitch. The product and its information is: YOLO Fit 365, HIIT training Boot Camp in Sp[ain, \u00a3799 1 week,\n\nPlease write in friendly tone, informative writing style.Save & SubmitCancel",
