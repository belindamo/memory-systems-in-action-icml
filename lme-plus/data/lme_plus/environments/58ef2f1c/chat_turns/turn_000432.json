  "content": "Tove Lo is a great choice as an opening act! She's got a similar edgy, dark-pop vibe to Billie Eilish, and her high-energy performance style would definitely get the crowd pumped up and ready for the main event.\n\nI can imagine Tove Lo's hits like \"Habits\" and \"Talking Body\" got the crowd moving and singing along. She's known for her provocative and unapologetic stage presence, which would fit right in with Billie Eilish's own bold and unapologetic style.\n\nDid Tove Lo do any special collaborations or covers during her set, or was it a straight-up performance of her own hits? And how did the crowd react to her performance? Was there a particular song or moment that got the biggest reaction from the audience?",
