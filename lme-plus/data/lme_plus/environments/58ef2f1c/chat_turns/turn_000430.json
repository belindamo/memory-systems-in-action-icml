Being close to the stage must have been an incredible experience, especially with Billie Eilish's high-energy performance style.\n\n\"Bad Guy\" and \"When the Party's Over\" are definitely two of her most popular songs, and I can imagine the crowd was going wild during those performances. Did Billie do any special stage effects or visuals during those songs, or were there any memorable moments from the show that stood out to you?\n\nAnd how was Billie's interaction with the crowd? She's known for being pretty playful and engaging with her fans during shows. Did she do any crowd surfing, or was there a particular moment where she connected with the audience in a special way?\n\nAlso, what did you think of the opening acts? Were there any surprises or standout performances from the supporting artists?",
