  "content": "I think I spent around $700-800 on gifts in the past few weeks. I remember buying a birthday gift for my sister last weekend, and some other gifts for my brother's graduation, a friend's baby shower, and my colleagues for our office's secret Santa. For household essentials, I think I spent around $250 last month when I went shopping with my mom for some things for my grandma. As for groceries, I picked up some essentials for my neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, last week and spent around $50.",
