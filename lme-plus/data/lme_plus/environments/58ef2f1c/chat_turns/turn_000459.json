  "content": "I think those recipe ideas sound great! I'm open to trying out different cuisines, so no specific preferences there. I'd say we have about an hour to an hour and a half to cook and eat on those days, so nothing too elaborate. There are four of us in my family, and we don't have a specific budget in mind. I'd like to feature some seasonal ingredients if possible. And one more thing, I've been trying to have dinner with my family at least three times a week, which is why I'm looking for new ideas.",
