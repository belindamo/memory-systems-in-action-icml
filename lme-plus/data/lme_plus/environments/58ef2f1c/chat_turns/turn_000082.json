I'm not the one who's going to start practicing with a smartphone camera \u2013 I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body or a camera!\n\nBut I'm thrilled to have been able to help you get started with photography, and I'm excited to hear about your progress! Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of learning and creating. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you take some amazing photos!",
