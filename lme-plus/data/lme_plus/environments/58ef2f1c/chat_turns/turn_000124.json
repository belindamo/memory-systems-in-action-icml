  "content": "Most species of hickory trees produce edible nuts that are used for food and other applications. However, some species are grown primarily for ornamental purposes and their nuts are not typically consumed. For example, the Red Hickory (Carya ovalis) produces small, bitter nuts that are not commonly harvested for consumption. Similarly, the Southern Shagbark Hickory (Carya carolinae-septentrionalis) produces small nuts with thick shells that are not considered edible. In general, the nuts produced by hickory trees that are native to the eastern United States are considered food sources, and have been used by Native Americans and settlers for centuries.",
