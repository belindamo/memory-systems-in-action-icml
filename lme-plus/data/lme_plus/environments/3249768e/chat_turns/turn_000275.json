  "content": "A balanced product mix with a slight emphasis on candles sounds like a great strategy.\n\nTo determine how many of each product to bring, let's use some simple calculations based on your past sales data and the expected demand at the Harvest Market.\n\n**Calculating Inventory**\n\n1. **Soaps**: You sold 20 soaps at the Weekly Farmers' Market and 15 soaps at SummerFest Market. Let's average these numbers to get a rough estimate of soap sales per event: (20 + 15) / 2 = 17.5 soaps per event. For the Harvest Market, you might want to increase this number slightly to account for the seasonal demand. Let's round up to 20 soaps.\n2. **Candles**: You sold 15 candles at the Weekly Farmers' Market and 30 candles at SummerFest Market. Again, let's average these numbers: (15 + 30) / 2 = 22.5 candles per event. Since you want to emphasize candles, let's increase this number to 25-30 candles for the Harvest Market.\n\n**Inventory Recommendations**\n\nBased on these calculations, consider bringing:\n\n* 20-25 soaps\n* 25-30 candles (with a focus on your popular pumpkin spice candle)\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* **Packaging and Display**: Make sure you have attractive and sturdy packaging for both products. Consider creating a visually appealing display that showcases your products in an inviting way.\n* **Pricing**: Review your pricing strategy to ensure it's competitive and aligned with your target audience's expectations.\n* **Inventory Management**: Keep a close eye on your inventory levels during the market and be prepared to restock or adjust your sales strategy if needed.\n\nBy bringing a balanced product mix with a focus on candles, you'll be well-prepared to cater to the Harvest Market crowd and increase your chances of success. Good luck, and I hope you have a fantastic time at the market!",
