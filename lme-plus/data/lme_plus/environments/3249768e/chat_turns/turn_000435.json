With the diced ham or Canadian bacon, your breakfast quesadilla is going to be even more satisfying.\n\nBy the way, speaking of breakfast, I'm loving my new breakfast bowl that I got from a garage sale last weekend. It's really cute and adds a nice touch to my morning routine.\n\nAnyway, back to your quesadilla! Are you planning on adding any other fillings or toppings, like salsa, sour cream, or avocado?",
