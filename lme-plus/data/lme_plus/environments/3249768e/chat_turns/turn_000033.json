We opened the Dale shopping mall in August 2021.Kim Soo-hyun and Yang Ae-rip, co-CEOs, both majored in design and visual designers. Yes, so now we are working on design together, but yes, CEO Kim Soo-hyun usually does all the production work, and CEO Yang Yi-rip does the sns content. I wanted to learn, so I worked at a promotion company (a clothing production agency) in the middle. I think that's why it helps a lot.Most of the high school classmates and sales who studied visual design that we produce ourselves are all production. More than 90% of the products we sell are self-made, and that's the only thing that goes out.I'm sure there are some popular products or Dale's signature products here.Spadio lines made of span fabric, such as spaoni dress and spanio pants, tend to be popular.Also, there's a nylon top and bottom set called \"Montaway,\" which is also very popular.The popularity factor may be fabric, but I think it's probably because of the design.There are so few everyday designs. Looking at it... Yes, the functionality of the fabric is the basic in the market. If it doesn't support it, we won't forget it at all, but now our design is a bit of a daily blessing.That's the biggest difference. Customers usually wear clothes for professionals, hairdressers, dog hairdressers, hairdressers, and men and women.",
