  "content": "Flavored salts are an excellent way to add depth and complexity to your cocktails! They can elevate the flavor profile of your drinks and provide a unique textural element. Here are some recommendations for making and using flavored salts in Campari-based cocktails:\n\n**Making flavored salts:**\n\n1. **Infusion method**: Mix kosher salt with your desired flavor ingredients (e.g., citrus zest, herbs, spices, or botanicals) in a bowl. Let it sit for a few hours or overnight, then sift the mixture to remove the solids.\n2. **Dehydration method**: Mix kosher salt with your flavor ingredients and spread the mixture on a baking sheet. Dehydrate in a low-temperature oven (150\u00b0F - 200\u00b0F) for 1-2 hours, then blend the mixture into a fine powder.\n\n**Flavored salt ideas for Campari-based cocktails:**\n\n1. **Citrus-herb salt**: Infuse salt with lemon or orange zest, thyme, or rosemary for a bright, herbaceous flavor.\n2. **Spicy salt**: Mix salt with chili flakes, cayenne pepper, or smoked paprika for a spicy kick.\n3. **Botanical salt**: Infuse salt with dried flowers like lavender, hibiscus, or rose petals for a floral, fragrant flavor.\n4. **Smokey salt**: Mix salt with smoked salt, Lapsang souchong tea, or chipotle powder for a smoky, savory flavor.\n\n**Using flavored salts in Campari-based cocktails:**\n\n1. **Rim the glass**: Rub a lime wedge around the rim of the glass, then dip the rim into a shallow dish of flavored salt to coat.\n2. **Garnish**: Sprinkle a pinch of flavored salt on top of the cocktail as a garnish, or use it to rim a slice of citrus.\n3. **Mix into the drink**: Add a small amount of flavored salt to the cocktail itself, especially if you're using a sweet or fruity ingredient.\n\n**Campari-based cocktail ideas using flavored salts:**\n\n1. **Smoky Jungle Bird**: Rim a glass with smoky salt and serve a Jungle Bird with a smoky twist.\n2. **Citrus-Herb Campari Spritz**: Rim a glass with citrus-herb salt and serve a Campari Spritz with a splash of citrus-flavored soda water.\n3. **Spicy Negroni**: Mix spicy salt into a Negroni for a bold, spicy flavor.\n\nRemember to use flavored salts sparingly, as they can quickly overpower the other flavors in your cocktail. Start with a small amount and adjust to taste. Experiment with different flavor combinations to find the perfect pairing for your Campari-based creations!",
