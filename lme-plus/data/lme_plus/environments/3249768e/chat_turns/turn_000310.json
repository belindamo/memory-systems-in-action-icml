  "content": "I've been taking dance classes on Saturday mornings at a dance studio near my house, and I've been practicing my jazz technique to prepare for the \"Nowadays\" number in \"Chicago\". I was also a stagehand for \"The Glass Menagerie\" for three weeks in February, and I had to attend rehearsals every Tuesday and Thursday from 7 pm to 10 pm at the local community theater. I'm excited to apply the skills I learned from that experience to my role as Mary Sunshine in \"Chicago\".",
