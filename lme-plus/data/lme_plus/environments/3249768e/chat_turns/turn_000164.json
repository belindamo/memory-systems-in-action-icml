I'd be happy to help you find a purr-fect toy for Whiskers!\n\nHere are some popular and highly-recommended interactive toy options:\n\n1. **Laser Pointer**: A classic favorite among cats, laser pointers provide endless entertainment as Whiskers chases the red dot around the room. Just be careful not to shine it directly into her eyes.\n2. **Feather Teasers**: Feather toys with long handles allow you to engage Whiskers in a natural hunting behavior, encouraging her to pounce and chase.\n3. **Interactive Treat Dispensers**: Toys that dispense treats as the cat plays with them are great for mental stimulation and slowing down eating.

They're also great for encouraging exercise and agility.\n5. **Catnip Toys**: If Whiskers is sensitive to catnip, consider toys filled with high-quality catnip or coated with catnip oil.
