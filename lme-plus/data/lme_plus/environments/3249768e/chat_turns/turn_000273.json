However, soaps still contribute a significant portion of the revenue.\n\n**Product Mix Strategy**\n\nConsidering the data, here are a few options for the Harvest Market:\n\n1. **Focus on Candles**: Since candles are the more profitable product, you could focus on bringing a larger quantity of candles to the Harvest Market. This might help you capitalize on their popularity and increase overall revenue.\n2. **Balanced Product Mix**: Bring a mix of both soaps and candles, but with a slight emphasis on candles. This approach would allow you to cater to customers who prefer soaps while still maximizing the potential revenue from candles.\n3. **Soap-Candle Bundles**: Consider offering bundles or sets that include both soaps and candles. This could help increase the average sale per item and encourage customers to purchase more products.\n\n**Additional Factors to Consider**\n\n* **Seasonal Demand**: Harvest Market is a seasonal event, and customers might be looking for products that fit the autumn theme. You could consider creating seasonal scents or packaging for your soaps and candles to appeal to this demand.\n* **Competition**: Take a look at the other vendors participating in the Harvest Market. If there are already several soap or candle vendors, you might want to focus on the product that has less competition.\n* **Inventory Management**: Make sure you have enough stock of both products to meet demand. You don't want to run out of your best-selling items too quickly.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on your business goals, target audience, and market conditions. By analyzing your sales data and considering these factors, you can make an informed decision about the best product mix to bring to the Harvest Market.",
