  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. The `--m<parent-number>` option is not supported by `git format-patch`, it is only supported by `git diff-tree`. Instead, you can use the `-p` or `--stdout` option with `git log` to generate a patch that includes the changes from a merge commit.\n\nHere's an example command that will generate a patch file that includes the changes from a merge commit, and includes the merge commit message:\n```sql\ngit log -p -m -1 <merge-commit> > merge-commit.patch\n```\nIn this command, `-p` tells `git log` to output the patch for each commit, `-m` tells it to treat the merge commit as a set of changes rather than a single diff, and `-1` tells it to output only the most recent commit (the merge commit). The output is redirected to a file called `merge-commit.patch`.\n\nYou can adjust the command as needed to generate the patch output in the format and style that you prefer.",
