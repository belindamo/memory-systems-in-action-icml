Here are some popular areas to consider:\n\n1. **Shibuya**: Known for its famous scramble crossing, Shibuya is a vibrant area with plenty of shopping, dining, and entertainment options. It's a great spot for first-time visitors, with many restaurants, cafes, and bars within walking distance.\n2. **Shinjuku**: A major business hub with a lively nightlife, Shinjuku offers a mix of skyscrapers, department stores, and small alleys filled with tiny bars and restaurants. It's also close to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building for a free observation deck with great city views.\n3. **Asakusa**: This historic area is famous for Senso-ji Temple and offers a more traditional Japanese atmosphere. It's a bit farther from the city center, but still has plenty of restaurants and shops to explore.\n4. **Roppongi**: An upscale area with a more international feel, Roppongi is known for its luxury hotels, shopping centers, and restaurants. It's a bit pricier than other areas, but offers easy access to Tokyo Tower and Roppongi Hills.\n5. **Ikebukuro**: A bustling commercial district with a more local feel, Ikebukuro has plenty of shopping and dining options, as well as easy access to other parts of the city via its major train station.\n6. **Ueno**: A cultural hub with many museums and parks, Ueno is a great area for those interested in history and nature. It's also close to the famous Tsukiji Fish Market (outer market, not the inner market which has moved to a new location).\n\nNow, about your Airbnb quote:\n\n$64 per night is a relatively good price for a 7-night stay in Tokyo, especially considering the average daily rate for a hotel room in Tokyo is around \u00a515,000-20,000 (approximately $140-180 USD).\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to research the location and amenities of the Airbnb to ensure it fits your needs. Here are some questions to consider:\n\n* Is the location convenient for your planned activities and travel style?\n* What are the amenities included (e.g., Wi-Fi, kitchen, laundry facilities)?\n* Are there any additional fees or charges (e.g., cleaning fee, service fee)?\n* What's the cancellation policy in case your plans change?\n\nRemember to read reviews from previous guests and check the host's response rate and ratings before making a decision.\n\nHope this helps you find the perfect accommodation for your Tokyo adventure!",
