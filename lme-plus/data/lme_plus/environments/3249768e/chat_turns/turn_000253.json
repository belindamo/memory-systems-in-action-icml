However, I can say that seeking support and working towards recovery following a traumatic experience can provide valuable benefits and help individuals to develop a more positive outlook on life.\n\nWhile progress may be slow, and there is no guarantee of success, many individuals have found that seeking support and making a commitment to recovery can lead to improved mental health, more satisfying relationships, and a greater sense of overall well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the longer someone goes without addressing the effects of trauma, the more difficult it can become to recover. It's important to surround yourself with supportive people, seek the advice of qualified mental health professionals who specialize in trauma, and remain patient and persistent in the process of healing.\n\nUltimately, whether or not recovery is pursued after experiencing trauma is a personal decision. However, it can be important to acknowledge that seeking help and support is brave, and can lead to growth and healing.",
