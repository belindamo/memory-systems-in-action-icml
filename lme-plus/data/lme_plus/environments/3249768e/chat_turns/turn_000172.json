Placing it in a corner of the living room will allow you to monitor Whiskers' activity without making her feel like she's being watched too closely.\n\nRegarding Whiskers' sleep patterns, it's not uncommon for cats to sleep more as they age. On average, cats spend around 16-18 hours per day sleeping, and this can increase with age.\n\nAt 5 years old, Whiskers is still considered a young adult cat. However, as cats enter their senior years (around 7-10 years old), they may start to sleep more due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. **Natural aging process**: As cats age, their physical abilities and energy levels may decline, leading to increased sleepiness.\n2. **Health issues**: Underlying health problems, like arthritis, dental issues, or chronic pain, can cause cats to sleep more to conserve energy and cope with discomfort.\n3. **Changes in lifestyle**: If Whiskers' routine has changed, such as a move to a new home, changes in your work schedule, or the introduction of new pets or people, she may be sleeping more due to stress or anxiety.\n\nIt's essential to monitor Whiskers' overall health and behavior to determine if her increased sleepiness is a normal part of aging or a sign of an underlying issue. Keep an eye out for other changes, such as:\n\n* Changes in appetite or water intake\n* Weight gain or loss\n* Changes in grooming habits\n* Increased vocalization or whining\n* Decreased playfulness or activity level\n\nIf you're concerned about Whiskers' sleep patterns or overall health, it's always best to consult with your veterinarian. They can perform a physical examination, review her medical history, and provide guidance on any potential underlying issues.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure Whiskers is getting enough mental and physical stimulation through playtime, social interaction, and a balanced diet. Providing a comfortable and stress-free environment can also help promote healthy sleep patterns.",
