Delicate fabrics and accessories require special care to ensure they look their best throughout the run of the show. Here are some tips to help you care for your Mary Sunshine costume:\n\n1. **Handle with care**: Be gentle when putting on and taking off your costume to avoid scratching, pulling, or tearing the fabric. If you need to adjust the fit, ask Emily or a dresser for assistance.\n2. **Store your costume properly**: When not in use, store your costume in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Hang your costume on a padded hanger or lay it flat on a soft surface to prevent wrinkles and creases.\n3. **Avoid food and drinks near your costume**: Food and drink spills can be disastrous for delicate fabrics. Keep your costume away from snacks and drinks in the dressing room or backstage.\n4. **Clean your costume carefully**: Check with Emily or the costume department to see if your costume can be machine washed or dry cleaned. If hand washing is required, use cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid using harsh chemicals or hot water, which can damage fabrics.\n5. **Be gentle with beads and sequins**: Avoid touching or handling beads and sequins excessively, as the oils from your skin can cause them to tarnish or fall off. If a bead or sequin does come loose, report it to the costume department for repair.\n6. **Protect your costume from makeup and hair products**: Makeup, hairspray, and styling products can stain or damage fabrics. Use a makeup cape or bib to protect your costume when applying makeup, and avoid using hairspray or styling products near your costume.\n7. **Use a steamer or low-heat iron**: If your costume requires ironing, use a low-heat setting or a steamer to avoid damaging fabrics. Always check the care label or consult with the costume department before using heat on your costume.\n8. **Check your costume regularly**: Inspect your costume regularly for any signs of damage, such as tears, loose threads, or broken zippers. Report any issues to the costume department promptly to ensure they can be repaired before the show.\n9. **Use a costume bag or cover**: When transporting your costume, use a protective bag or cover to prevent dirt, dust, and damage. This will also help keep your costume clean and prevent wrinkles.\n10. **Communicate with the costume department**: If you have any concerns or questions about caring for your costume, don't hesitate to reach out to Emily or the costume department.
