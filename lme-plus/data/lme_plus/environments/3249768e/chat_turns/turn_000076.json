  "content": "That's a great idea! Maria's high-energy vibe and playlist would definitely translate well to a weightlifting class. Since Alex is out sick, it's awesome that you're thinking of asking Maria to sub in. Just make sure to check with her availability and make sure she's comfortable teaching a weightlifting class.\n\nIt's also a good idea to give her a heads up on the class format, the type of exercises you typically do, and any specific cues or modifications you like to provide to your students. That way, she can prepare and make sure to give your students a great workout.\n\nMaria's enthusiasm and energy are infectious, and I'm sure she'll bring a fun and motivating vibe to your weightlifting class. Your students will likely appreciate the change of pace and the opportunity to experience a different teaching style. Good call!",
