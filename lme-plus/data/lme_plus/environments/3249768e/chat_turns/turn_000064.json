  "content": "In MySQL, there is no direct support for materialized views. However, you can simulate materialized views using tables and triggers.\n\nTo refresh the materialized view every 5 minutes, you can create a MySQL event that runs the `REFRESH` statement on the materialized view every 5 minutes.\n\nHere's an example code to create an event that refreshes the materialized view `sales_summary` every 5 minutes:\n```sql\nCREATE EVENT refresh_sales_summary\nON SCHEDULE\n    EVERY 5 MINUTE\nDO\nBEGIN\n    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;\nEND;\n```\nThis code creates an event named `refresh_sales_summary` that runs every 5 minutes and refreshes the `sales_summary` materialized view.\n\nNote that in order to use events, you must have the `EVENT` privilege, and the MySQL event scheduler must be enabled. You can enable the event scheduler by running the following command:\n```sql\nSET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;\n```\nThis command enables the event scheduler for the current session. To enable it permanently, you can add the following line to your MySQL configuration file:\n```ini\nevent_scheduler=ON\n```\nMake sure to test the event thoroughly before deploying it to production.",
