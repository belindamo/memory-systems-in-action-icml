  "content": "Yes, sustainable and eco-friendly textiles can often be more expensive than traditional textiles. This is because the production of sustainable textiles often involves more labor-intensive and environmentally friendly processes. However, it's important to keep in mind that the cost may be higher because you are paying for ethical and sustainable practices. Investing in sustainable textiles can be seen as a long-term investment as they often last longer than non-sustainable alternatives. Additionally, shopping second-hand or vintage can also be a budget-friendly way to incorporate sustainable textiles into your wardrobe.",
