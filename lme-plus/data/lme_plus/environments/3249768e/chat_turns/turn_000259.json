  "content": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and frustrated when it feels like nothing is working, and recovery feels out of reach. However, it's important to remember that healing is a process, and setbacks are a natural part of any process.\n\nIt can be challenging to motivate oneself to keep trying, but it's important to remember that recovery takes time and requires patience and commitment. Developing a routine and setting small, achievable goals can help to build momentum and increase motivation.\n\nAdditionally, seeking support from loved ones, a mental health professional, or support groups can provide accountability, encouragement, and validation - all of which can help to boost motivation.\n\nIt's also important to remember that recovery is not a linear process, and progress may not always be readily visible. Recognizing even the smallest successes, such as attending a therapy session or practicing self-care, can help to build motivation and provide a sense of accomplishment.\n\nRemember that recovery is possible, and while it may be challenging at times, it's important to keep going and not give up. Seeking support and taking small, consistent steps towards recovery can lead to significant progress over time.",
