  "content": "Since you're familiar with the neighborhood theater, I'd recommend checking their website or social media pages to see if they have any upcoming productions of \"Avenue Q\" or \"Hadestown\". They might have announced their season lineup or upcoming shows.\n\nYou can also try contacting the theater directly via phone or email to ask about their upcoming productions. They might be able to give you more information about their schedule and whether either of these shows are planned for their season.\n\nIf they don't have either of these shows coming up, you could also ask them for recommendations based on your interest in musical comedies like \"Avenue Q\" or grand, sweeping scores like \"Hadestown\". They might have some other suggestions that would be a good fit for you!\n\nAdditionally, you could also explore other local theaters in your city to see if they have any upcoming productions of \"Avenue Q\" or \"Hadestown\". You might find that another theater in your area is producing one of these shows soon.\n\nRemember to keep an eye on the theater's website and social media pages for updates on their season lineup, as it's always subject to change. Good luck, and I hope you find a show that you'll enjoy!",
