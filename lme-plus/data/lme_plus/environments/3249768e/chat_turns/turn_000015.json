They're there to support you and help you have a great experience.\n\nRemember to stay relaxed, enjoy the ride, and take in the scenery. Cycling is a great way to explore new areas and get some exercise, and riding with a group can be a fantastic way to meet new people who share your interests.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you a fantastic first group ride and many enjoyable miles on the road!",
