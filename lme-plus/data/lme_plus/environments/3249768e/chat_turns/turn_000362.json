  "content": "Yes, there are many programming languages that support immutable data structures. Some examples include:\n\n1. Haskell: Haskell is a purely functional programming language that requires all data structures to be immutable.\n\n2. Scala: Scala is a hybrid functional and object-oriented programming language that supports both mutable and immutable data structures.\n\n3. Clojure: Clojure is a dialect of LISP that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and supports immutable data structures.\n\n4. Rust: Rust is a modern systems programming language that supports safe parallelism through immutable data structures.\n\n5. Elixir: Elixir is a functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine and supports immutable data structures.\n\n6. Kotlin: Kotlin is a modern programming language that supports both mutable and immutable data structures.\n\nThese are just a few examples - many other programming languages support immutable data structures as well.",
