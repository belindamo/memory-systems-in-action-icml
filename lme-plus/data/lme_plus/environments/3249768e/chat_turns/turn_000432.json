Here are some tortilla options:\n\n1. **Flour Tortillas**: These are a popular choice for breakfast quesadillas. Look for a medium-thick, soft flour tortilla (around 8-10 inches in diameter). You can use either white or whole wheat flour tortillas.\n2. **Corn Tortillas**: If you prefer a more traditional Mexican flavor, use corn tortillas. They'll add a slightly sweet and crunchy texture to your quesadilla. Look for yellow or white corn tortillas, and make sure they're not too thin or brittle.\n3. **Tortilla Size**: For a breakfast quesadilla, you can use either an 8-inch or 10-inch tortilla. The larger tortilla will give you more room for fillings, but the smaller one will be easier to fold and cook.\n\n**Tortilla Tips:**\n\n* Use fresh tortillas for the best results. Stale tortillas can become brittle and crack when folded.\n* If using flour tortillas, you can warm them up by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20-30 seconds. This will make them more pliable and easier to fold.\n* If using corn tortillas, you can grill or cook them on a dry skillet for a few seconds on each side to make them more pliable.\n\nNow that you have your tortilla, it's time to assemble your breakfast quesadilla! Place your scrambled eggs, cheese, and chosen fillings on half of the tortilla, and fold the other half to enclose. Cook it in your cast iron skillet using the stovetop method, and enjoy your delicious breakfast quesadilla!",
