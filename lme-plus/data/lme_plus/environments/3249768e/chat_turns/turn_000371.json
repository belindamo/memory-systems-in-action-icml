Speaking of finding what I need, I've been trying to get into a better habit of flossing every day, so I've been keeping my floss picks in a little container on the bathroom counter. It's been helping me remember to do it every morning and night. Do you have any advice on how to keep the bathroom countertops clean and clutter-free?",
