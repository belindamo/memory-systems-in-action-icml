Provide clues that lead teams to find and take a photo with the product, or complete a task related to the product (e.g., \"Take a selfie with our new product and show us your best sales pitch\").\n2. **Ad Hunt**: Create a list of ads or billboards in the city that feature your company's products or campaigns. Challenge teams to find and take a photo in front of each ad, or complete a task related to the ad (e.g., \"Find the billboard with our latest campaign and recreate the pose\").\n3. **Social Media Challenge**: Create a series of social media-related challenges, such as:\n\t* Take a team photo in front of a popular Instagram-worthy spot in the city and post it on your company's social media account using a specific hashtag.\n\t* Find a street artist or performer and have them create a piece related to your company's brand or product, then share it on social media.\n\t* Record a short video showcasing your team's creative skills, such as a lip sync or dance performance, and share it on social media.\n4. **Marketing Trivia**: Create a series of trivia questions related to marketing, advertising, or your company's products. Challenge teams to find the answers in the city, such as:\n\t* Find a street sign or advertisement that uses a specific marketing principle (e.g., scarcity, social proof).\n\t* Take a photo of a business that uses a unique marketing strategy (e.g., a pop-up shop, a guerrilla marketing stunt).\n5. **Creative Expression**: Encourage teams to express their creativity by completing challenges such as:\n\t* Create a short poem or song lyrics about your company's product or brand.\n\t* Design a temporary logo or branding element using materials found in the city (e.g., sidewalk chalk, stickers).\n\t* Take a team photo that showcases a specific brand value or personality trait (e.g., innovation, teamwork).\n6. **Influencer Challenge**: Partner with local influencers or content creators in the city to create challenges that require teams to interact with them. For example:\n\t* Find a popular influencer in the city and take a selfie with them while showcasing your company's product.\n\t* Complete a task or challenge designed by the influencer, such as a dance routine or a photo shoot.\n7. **Storytelling**: Create a narrative that unfolds throughout the scavenger hunt, with each challenge or clue building on the previous one. This can be a fun way to engage teams and encourage creative storytelling.\n\nRemember to keep the challenges engaging, yet not too difficult or time-consuming. You want to ensure that teams have fun and stay motivated throughout the event. Good luck, and I hope these ideas help!",
