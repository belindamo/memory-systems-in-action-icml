I was thinking about my bathroom scale, and I just realized I've been weighing myself every morning since I replaced the old one with a new digital scale from Target about 3 weeks ago. I've lost about 2 pounds, which is great motivation to keep going. Do you have any advice on how to keep the bathroom scale clean and accurate?",
