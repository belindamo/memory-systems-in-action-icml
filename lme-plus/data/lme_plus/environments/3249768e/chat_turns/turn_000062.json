  "content": "The interval for refreshing a materialized view depends on various factors such as the size of the underlying tables, the frequency of updates, the available system resources, and the desired query performance.\n\nIf the underlying dataset is in millions, refreshing the materialized view every 2 minutes may not be feasible or efficient, as it could put a significant load on the system and affect the query performance. In such cases, you may want to consider refreshing the materialized view less frequently, such as once per hour, or even less frequently depending on the specific use case.\n\nIt is recommended to perform some testing and analysis to determine the optimal refresh interval for the materialized view based on the specific requirements and constraints of the system.",
