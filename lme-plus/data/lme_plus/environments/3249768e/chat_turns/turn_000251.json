While some individuals may experience full recovery and be able to form healthy relationships and trust others, for others recovery may be more of an ongoing process. \n\nFor some individuals, trauma can leave a lasting impact on their sense of self, relationships with others, and their overall well-being. However, with the proper support and tools, individuals can find ways to cope with and manage the symptoms of trauma, and work towards healing and growth.\n\nHealing from trauma is not a linear process, and setbacks or regression may occur. However, with time, patience, and a commitment to self-care, individuals can make progress towards recovery and develop meaningful relationships. \n\nIt is important to remember that recovery is a highly individualized process, and there is no \"right way\" or timeline for it. Support from qualified mental health professionals and supportive loved ones can provide a positive impact on the journey towards healing.",
