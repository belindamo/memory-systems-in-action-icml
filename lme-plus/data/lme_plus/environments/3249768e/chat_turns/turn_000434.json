Both options will complement the scrambled eggs and cheese nicely. Here's how you can incorporate them:\n\n* **Diced Ham**: Add 1-2 tablespoons of diced ham to the scrambled eggs before cooking them. This will distribute the ham flavor throughout the eggs.\n* **Canadian Bacon**: Dice 1-2 slices of Canadian bacon and add them to the quesadilla filling along with the scrambled eggs and cheese. You can also cook the Canadian bacon separately before adding it to the quesadilla.\n\n**Other Protein Options:**\n\nIf you want to explore other protein sources, consider these options:\n\n* **Cooked Sausage**: Use cooked sausage (like chorizo or breakfast sausage) in place of ham or Canadian bacon.\n* **Bacon Bits**: Add some crispy bacon bits to the quesadilla filling for a smoky flavor.\n* **Black Beans**: If you want to keep the quesadilla vegetarian, you can add cooked black beans to the filling for a plant-based protein source.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to cook the protein of your choice before adding it to the quesadilla filling.\n* Don't overdo it with the protein; you want to maintain a balance with the other fillings.\n* Experiment with different protein combinations to find your favorite!\n\nNow that you have your protein added, you're ready to assemble and cook your breakfast quesadilla! Remember to cook it in your cast iron skillet using the stovetop method, and enjoy the crispy, cheesy, protein-packed goodness!",
