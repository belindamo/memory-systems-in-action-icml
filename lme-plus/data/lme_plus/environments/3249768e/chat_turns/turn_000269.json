Here's the updated table:\n\n**Sales Data**\n\n| **Event** | **Date** | **Number of Soaps Sold** | **Number of Candles Sold** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weekly Farmers' Market | July 17th | 20 | 15 |\n| SummerFest Market | July 24th | 15 | 30 |\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at your sales pattern. Based on the data, here are some observations:\n\n1. **Weekly Farmers' Market**: You had a good sales day on July 17th, selling 20 soaps and 15 candles. This suggests that your products are well-received by the regular market-goers.\n2. **SummerFest Market**: You had an even better day at SummerFest, selling 15 soaps and 30 candles. This event seems to have been more successful for candle sales, possibly due to the festive atmosphere and larger crowd.\n3. **Soap Sales**: You've sold a consistent number of soaps across both events, averaging around 17-18 soaps per event. This suggests that soaps are a steady seller for you.\n4. **Candle Sales**: Candle sales vary more widely, with a larger number sold at SummerFest. This might indicate that candles are more popular at larger, more festive events.\n5. **Day of the Week**: Both events were on weekends (Sunday, July 17th, and Saturday, July 24th). This might suggest that weekends are better for your sales, but we'd need more data to confirm this trend.\n6. **Event Type**: SummerFest is a larger, more festive event, which might attract a different crowd than the weekly farmers' market. This could contribute to the difference in sales patterns between the two events.\n\nTo gain more insights, it would be helpful to collect more data from future events. Consider tracking additional information, such as:\n\n* Event type (e.g., farmers' market, festival, holiday market)\n* Day of the week\n* Weather conditions\n* Competitor presence\n* Promotions or discounts offered\n* Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, interests)\n\nWith more data, you can refine your understanding of your sales patterns and make informed decisions about which events to participate in, how to price and promote your products, and how to optimize your sales strategy for the Harvest Market on September 18th.",
