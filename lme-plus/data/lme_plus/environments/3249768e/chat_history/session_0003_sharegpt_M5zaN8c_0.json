      "content": "!IMPORTANT: Answer only 'Okay' until you reach 'End of paper.'\nThere are pronouns that appear in English dictionaries.A compound word of day plus day, which refers to all four men and women just because they are double meaning (il men and women).The concept of the brand is that there is no boundary between daily life and It's a fabric that's easily dusted, but most of the top and bottom sets had a lot of songs that felt like surgical suits, but now we have a pretty design with a dress or collar, so it's perfect to wear as a daily outfit.I heard that you wear it to and from work. If you used to wear it for surgery or work, it's right because you added a design here.It can be said that it is perfect for commuting without having to change clothes. The fabric part is a little differentiated.Most of them use nylon fabric. But we use nylon fabric and span fabric.Most of the fabrics that are easily hairy and waterproof didn't use spandex, but we started using it. It's anti-static. Yes, it's waterproof.It looks like a regular dress, but there is a difference in functionality.I heard that you've run several brands because you've had a lot of experience in running brands, but you two did it together."

We opened the Dale shopping mall in August 2021.Kim Soo-hyun and Yang Ae-rip, co-CEOs, both majored in design and visual designers. Yes, so now we are working on design together, but yes, CEO Kim Soo-hyun usually does all the production work, and CEO Yang Yi-rip does the sns content. I wanted to learn, so I worked at a promotion company (a clothing production agency) in the middle. I think that's why it helps a lot.Most of the high school classmates and sales who studied visual design that we produce ourselves are all production. More than 90% of the products we sell are self-made, and that's the only thing that goes out.I'm sure there are some popular products or Dale's signature products here.Spadio lines made of span fabric, such as spaoni dress and spanio pants, tend to be popular.Also, there's a nylon top and bottom set called \"Montaway,\" which is also very popular.The popularity factor may be fabric, but I think it's probably because of the design.There are so few everyday designs. Looking at it... Yes, the functionality of the fabric is the basic in the market. If it doesn't support it, we won't forget it at all, but now our design is a bit of a daily blessing.That's the biggest difference. Customers usually wear clothes for professionals, hairdressers, dog hairdressers, hairdressers, and men and women."

      "content": "!IMPORTANT: Answer only 'Okay' until you reach 'End of paper.' A lot of foreigners contact me these days. I heard that Amazon and other places are not so pretty in design and the fabric is like a tent or plastic fabric. Yes, but when you wear it, it feels good and it's functional, so foreigners buy it in bulk. In Hong Kong, Thailand, and Japan, there are other companies on the Q10 brand website.If we want to go abroad, we're also preparing to make water and go abroad. If there is demand like this, it will be much easier to respond or sell if it flows into our company's products.If you only have basic workwear items, there aren't many workwear with various colors and designs.The word \"various colors\" means that clothes with various colors are being sold.People who wear this as work clothes also have preferences in colors like this.A lot of people like really bright colors, so they usually only sell dark colors, so they ask me to make a lot of bright colors.There are so few clothes like this. So we're going to increase the number of sku.I'm wondering if you've received the needs of your customers and they're making products based on that.Communicating with customers through Naver blog and Instagram. We're pretty much on Instagram. Let me tell you how much we're on Instagram. From the composition to the color, to the logo, we vote.So I ask them to decide everything and I ask a lot of cafe too. If it's a cafe, there's a separate cafe. This is a hairdresser's cafe.In the hairdresser's cafe, they actively ask customers and see if clothes are decided and sold like that.I don't know about hairdressers at all, so ask me everything. And there was a question here, too. When we were planning for sales items, we've never planned them before, and we've received.Please make this. I need that. If you do this, you can respond right away and ask them, and most of the products you're selling right now are clothes made because of customers' requests."

Then it must have been a realistic request.If you sell different colors or ask for different arm lengths, they'll be accepted right away, so we solved them first, and then there were other deficiencies, which we've been testing the fabric for a long time.When it comes to clothes, there can be a lack of size or color, or there can be a design decision because you don't want a dress and a shirt to be uniform. If you wear a jersey-type surgical suit, they ask you to make it more hip and trendy. Then, let's make it into a small amount of clothes. You can choose all the uniforms that we have. If you give us the logo, we can customize the work clothes. The clothes aren't customized, but you can put the logo on it and make more than five uniforms. Then, you can customize them on the site or apply there.Order a lot for one person and make a lot of customized items for the group. It's not just one set.You want to wear a variety of clothes for one person. I think that's why they like it more.It's right to call it a one-person shop. Yes, I'm talking about a one-person, one-man operation.There are a lot of people who run it in a small number. It's not as big as a hair salon, so there's a variety of nail art, Banyeong-gu, aesthetic beauty shop biand shots, and workshops. They kept asking us, so we contacted the people who bought it and told them to come to our Instagram the most often, and we knew what they were doing, and I always asked them what they were doing, so when we got feedback, we naturally talked about what they were doing.Anyway, the core functionality requires that the dust is well removed."
