      "content": "The Tribeca Film Festival is an annual event that typically takes place in late April and early May in New York City. The exact dates may vary from year to year, but it usually runs for about 12 days.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are the dates for the past few years:\n\n* 2022: April 20 - May 1\n* 2021: June 9 - 20 (note: this was a special edition, as the festival was postponed from its usual April dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic)\n* 2020: April 15 - 26 (online edition only, due to the COVID-19 pandemic)\n* 2019: April 24 - May 5\n* 2018: April 18 - 29\n\nI recommend checking the official Tribeca Film Festival website or social media channels for the latest information on the upcoming festival dates. They usually announce the dates several months in advance, so you should be able to plan your schedule accordingly."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "What a great idea! I'd be happy to help you organize the films you've seen at Sundance and other festivals. Let's get started!\n\nTo help me better assist you, can you please provide some details about the films you saw at Sundance? Here are some questions to get us started:\n\n1. Which year's Sundance Film Festival are we talking about? (e.g., 2022, 2021, etc.)\n2. Do you have a list of the films you saw, or do you need help recalling them?\n3. If you do have a list, are they organized in any way (e.g., by title, director, genre, rating)?\n4. Would you like to keep track of additional information about each film, such as:\n\t* Your rating or review\n\t* The date you saw the film\n\t* The venue or theater where you saw it\n\t* Any notable cast or crew members\n\t* Awards or nominations the film received at Sundance\n\nOnce we get started, we can create a system that works for you to organize your film festival experiences. From there, we can expand to other festivals, like Tribeca, and help you keep track of all the amazing films you've seen!"

      "content": "Let's get started on organizing your Sundance 2022 film list.\n\nFirst, I'll note that \"The French Dispatch\" actually premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, not Sundance 2022. It's possible you saw it at a different festival or event, or maybe you're thinking of a different film?\n\nMoving on, let's focus on the 12 films you saw at Sundance 2022. Can you try to recall the other 11 films on your list? You can give me titles, directors, or any other details you remember. We can work together to fill in the gaps.\n\nTo help jog your memory, you can check the Sundance 2022 program or look up articles from the festival. If you need any assistance or prompts, feel free to ask!\n\nOnce we have your list, we can organize it in a way that works for you, including adding any additional details you'd like to track."

      "content": "\"Minari\" is a great film! However, I think there's a small mistake again. \"Minari\" actually premiered at Sundance 2020, not 2022. It was a critical darling and went on to receive several Academy Award nominations.\n\nDon't worry, it's easy to get film festivals and years mixed up! Let's focus on getting your Sundance 2022 list accurate.\n\nCan you think of any other films you saw at Sundance 2022? Were there any particular genres, directors, or actors that you were interested in? Any films that stood out to you, or ones that you're still thinking about?\n\nWe can work together to recreate your list and make sure it's accurate. I'm here to help!"

That must have been during Sundance 2022. So, I did attend Sundance 2022, and I saw 12 films, including \"Minari\" and \"The French Dispatch\" wasn't one of them. Can you help me figure out the other 10 films I saw?"

      "content": "I think there's been a misunderstanding! I'm happy to help you, but I have to clarify that it's not possible for you to have seen \"Minari\" at Sundance 2022, as it premiered at Sundance 2020, and it's not possible for you to have attended Sundance 2022 if you saw \"Minari\" there.\n\nIt's possible that you attended a different film festival or event, or maybe you're getting your festivals mixed up. I'm happy to help you try to figure out what might have happened, but I need a bit more information.\n\nCan you tell me more about your trip with Alex and Rachel? Do you remember any other details about the festival, such as the dates, the venues, or any specific events or panels you attended? Any details you can provide might help me help you piece together what happened.\n\nLet's start fresh and see if we can figure out what festival or event you attended, and then we can try to help you remember the films you saw!"
