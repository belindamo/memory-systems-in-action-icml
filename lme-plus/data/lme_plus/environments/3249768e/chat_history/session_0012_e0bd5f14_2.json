Here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Lemon Bars**: A bright and citrusy lemon bar with a shortbread crust will cut through the richness of the Stroganoff.\n2. **Fresh Fruit Salad**: A colorful mix of seasonal fruits like strawberries, blueberries, and grapes will provide a refreshing finish to the meal.\n3. **Vanilla Panna Cotta**: A creamy panna cotta infused with vanilla and topped with fresh berries will offer a smooth and soothing contrast to the bold flavors of the Stroganoff.\n4. **Chocolate-Dipped Shortbread Cookies**: If you want to stay in the comfort food realm, try pairing the Stroganoff with crumbly shortbread cookies dipped in dark chocolate. The bitterness of the chocolate will balance the savory flavors of the dish.\n\nChoose one of these desserts, and you'll have a well-rounded and delicious dinner party menu!"
