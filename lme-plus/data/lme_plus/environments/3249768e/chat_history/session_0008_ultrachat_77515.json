      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, sustainable and eco-friendly textiles can often be more expensive than traditional textiles. This is because the production of sustainable textiles often involves more labor-intensive and environmentally friendly processes. However, it's important to keep in mind that the cost may be higher because you are paying for ethical and sustainable practices. Investing in sustainable textiles can be seen as a long-term investment as they often last longer than non-sustainable alternatives. Additionally, shopping second-hand or vintage can also be a budget-friendly way to incorporate sustainable textiles into your wardrobe."

    {

      "content": "It's difficult to predict if or when traditional fashion brands will start prioritizing sustainability over profits. However, there is growing pressure from consumers, investors, and governments for businesses to become more sustainable and socially responsible. In addition, consumers are becoming more aware of the impact of their purchases, and many are demanding more transparency and sustainability from the brands they support.\n\nAs a result, many traditional fashion brands are starting to incorporate more sustainable practices into their operations, such as using more sustainable materials, reducing waste, and improving working conditions. However, there is still a long way to go before the fashion industry as a whole can be considered sustainable.\n\nUltimately, it will be up to both consumers and businesses to prioritize sustainability in the fashion industry. Consumers can make a difference by choosing to support sustainable fashion brands, buying second-hand clothing, and demanding transparency from traditional fashion brands. And businesses can make a difference by adopting more sustainable practices, and by being transparent about their sustainability efforts."
