The move is valid and seems optimal.\n* Short Horizon Reward: 1. The state is the goal state, as all the disks are in the correct position on rod C.\n* Long Horizon Reward: N/A. There is no need to consider the long horizon reward since the goal state has been reached.\n* Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nBased on the revised value, I think the previous plan is an optimal one. I have made the move and reached the goal state. Please provide any feedback or confirm the solution."
