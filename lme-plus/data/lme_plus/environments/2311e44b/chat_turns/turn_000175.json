  "content": "**More Game Ideas for a Jungle Adventure Theme:**\n\n1. **Jungle Scavenger Hunt**: Hide jungle-themed items (e.g., plastic monkeys, stuffed animals, pictures of jungle leaves) around the party area. Give each guest a list of clues to find these items.\n2. **Monkey See, Monkey Do**: Divide the guests into two teams. One team performs a series of jungle-themed actions (e.g., crawling like a monkey, making a bird sound), and the other team has to mimic them.\n3. **Jungle Animal Match**: Prepare a set of cards with pictures of jungle animals. Shuffle the cards and lay them out face down. Each guest takes a turn flipping over two cards to see if they match.\n4. **Tropical Trivia**: Create a short quiz with questions related to babies, parenting, or the jungle (e.g., \"What is the average weight of a newborn baby?\" or \"What is the largest mammal in the jungle?\").\n5. **Jungle-themed Word Scramble**: Create a list of jungle-themed words (e.g., \"monkey,\" \"parrot,\" \"banana\") and scramble the letters. Give each guest a copy of the scrambled words and see who can unscramble them all first.\n\n**When to Host a Baby Shower:**\n\nThe ideal time to host a baby shower varies, but generally, it's recommended to hold it 1-2 months before the baby's due date. This allows the expecting mother to:\n\n1. Enjoy the celebration without feeling too close to her due date.\n2. Receive gifts and prepare the nursery before the baby arrives.\n3. Avoid any potential discomfort or health issues that may arise closer to the due date.\n\nHowever, the most important thing is to consider Sarah's preferences and schedule. If she's having a busy summer, you might want to plan the shower for earlier in the summer. If she's having a relaxed summer, you could plan it closer to her due date.\n\n**Other Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to send out invitations 4-6 weeks before the shower to give guests ample time to RSVP.\n* Consider hosting the shower on a weekend, when most guests are more likely to be available.\n* Keep the games and activities simple and short, so guests can socialize and enjoy each other's company.\n\nI hope this helps!
