  "content": "What a wonderful idea! A \"Wishing Tree\" or \"Words of Wisdom\" card is a beautiful way to collect heartfelt notes and advice from guests for Sarah and her baby. This is a thoughtful and personalized way to celebrate the upcoming arrival of the baby and provide Sarah with a treasured keepsake.\n\nHere's how you can set it up:\n\n**Wishing Tree:**\n\n* Create a beautiful, rustic-themed tree or branch (you can use a real branch or a decorative one) and place it in a prominent spot at the shower.\n* Provide small cards or tags with a ribbon or string attached to each one.\n* Guests can write their wishes, advice, or words of encouragement on the cards and tie them to the tree.\n* This creates a stunning visual display of love and support for Sarah and her baby.\n\n**Words of Wisdom Card:**\n\n* Prepare a beautiful card or a journal with a heartfelt message or a prompt, such as \"Words of Wisdom for Sarah and Baby [Name]\" or \"Advice for New Parents.\"\n* Place the cards or journal at a designated station with a pen or pencil.\n* Guests can write their thoughts, advice, or words of encouragement on the cards or in the journal.\n* Collect the cards or journal and present them to Sarah as a keepsake after the shower.\n\nBoth ideas are wonderful ways to collect heartfelt notes and create a special memento for Sarah and her baby. It's a thoughtful way to involve guests in the celebration and provide Sarah with a treasured keepsake.\n\nRemember to encourage guests to be creative and sincere in their notes, and let them know that their words will be cherished by Sarah and her baby.",
