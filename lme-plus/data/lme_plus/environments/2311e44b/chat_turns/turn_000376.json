Graphic novels and manga can be a great way to:\n\n1. **Take breaks from dense non-fiction**: Graphic novels and manga can be a nice change of pace, allowing your brain to relax and recharge before diving back into denser material.\n2. **Boost your page count**: As you mentioned, graphic novels and manga tend to be quicker to get through, which can help you make progress toward your page count goal.\n3. **Explore different formats and genres**: Mixing up the formats and genres can keep your reading fresh and exciting, which can help you stay motivated.\n\nBy alternating between these formats, you can create a balanced reading routine that keeps you engaged and moving forward. For example, you could try:\n\n* Reading a denser non-fiction book for 2-3 days, and then switching to a graphic novel or manga for 1-2 days.\n* Setting aside dedicated days for graphic novels/manga, and using those days to catch up on your page count.\n* Creating a \"reading sandwich\" where you start with a graphic novel/manga, followed by a denser non-fiction book, and then finishing with another graphic novel/manga.\n\nRemember to be flexible and adjust this approach as needed. If you find that you're struggling to keep up with your denser non-fiction books, you can always adjust the ratio of graphic novels/manga to non-fiction.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you excited to give this approach a try?",
