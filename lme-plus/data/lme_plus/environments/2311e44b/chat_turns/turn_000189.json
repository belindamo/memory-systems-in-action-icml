That's a great accomplishment!\n\nNow, let's dive into the world of digital pianos and explore the differences between weighted hammer action and graded hammer action.\n\n**Weighted Hammer Action:**\n\nWeighted hammer action is a type of key mechanism found in digital pianos that attempts to replicate the feel of an acoustic piano. The keys are weighted to provide resistance, which helps develop finger strength and technique. The weight is usually distributed evenly across all keys, which can make it feel a bit uniform and less nuanced compared to a graded hammer action.\n\nWeighted hammer action is often found in more affordable digital pianos and is suitable for beginners or those who want a more straightforward playing experience. It's still a significant improvement over non-weighted or spring-loaded keys, but it might not provide the same level of expression and control as a graded hammer action.\n\n**Graded Hammer Action:**\n\nGraded hammer action is a more advanced key mechanism that takes the weighted action to the next level. In addition to providing resistance, the weight of the keys is graded, meaning it varies from key to key, just like an acoustic piano. The lower notes have a heavier touch, while the higher notes are lighter. This gradation of weight allows for a more expressive and nuanced playing experience.\n\nGraded hammer action is typically found in higher-end digital pianos and is preferred by more advanced players or those who want a more authentic piano experience. It requires more skill and technique to play, but it rewards the player with a greater range of tonal colors and dynamics.\n\n**Key differences:**\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* Weighted hammer action: Evenly weighted keys, suitable for beginners or those who want a more straightforward playing experience.\n* Graded hammer action: Weighted keys with a graded response, suitable for more advanced players or those who want a more authentic piano experience.\n\nWhen trying out digital pianos, pay attention to the feel of the keys. If you're used to playing acoustic pianos or want a more expressive experience, look for a digital piano with graded hammer action. If you're a beginner or prefer a more straightforward playing experience, weighted hammer action might be sufficient.\n\nI hope this helps you in your search for the perfect digital piano!",
