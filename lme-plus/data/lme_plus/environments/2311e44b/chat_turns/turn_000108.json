Here are a few layout suggestions to consider:\n\n**Option 1: Floating Sectional**\n\n* Place the sectional sofa away from the walls, creating a floating arrangement that defines the seating area. This will help create a sense of flow and make the room feel more spacious.\n* Position the coffee table in front of the sofa, leaving about 12-18 inches of space between the two. This will create a comfortable conversational area.\n* Place the floor lamp in the corner, behind the sofa, to create a cozy reading nook or ambient lighting.\n* Consider placing the new lamp on a side table or console table behind the sofa, to create a sense of balance and symmetry.\n\n**Option 2: Window-Focused**\n\n* Place the sectional sofa along the wall adjacent to the window, taking advantage of the natural light. This will also create a beautiful view from the seating area.\n* Position the coffee table perpendicular to the sofa, creating an L-shape configuration. This will define the seating area and provide a convenient surface for placing drinks or snacks.\n* Place the floor lamp in the corner, near the window, to create a warm and inviting ambiance.\n* Consider placing the new lamp on the coffee table or a side table near the window, to take advantage of the natural light and create a sense of harmony.\n\n**Option 3: Symmetrical Balance**\n\n* Place the sectional sofa against a wall, with the TV mounted above it. This will create a focal point in the room and provide a sense of balance.\n* Position the coffee table in front of the sofa, centered and symmetrical.\n* Place the floor lamp in the opposite corner, creating a sense of balance and harmony.\n* Consider placing the new lamp on a side table or console table near the sofa, to create a sense of symmetry and visual interest.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started. Feel free to experiment and adjust the layout to suit your personal preferences and needs. Remember to consider the flow of traffic, conversation areas, and the overall aesthetic you want to achieve.\n\nWhich of these options resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas in mind?",
