Here are some tips to help you prepare a delicious and moist turkey:\n\n**Turkey Prep 101**\n\n1. **Thawing:** Allow plenty of time to thaw your turkey in the fridge. It's essential to thaw it slowly and safely to prevent bacterial growth. Plan ahead and thaw your turkey in the fridge for about 24 hours for every 4-5 pounds.\n2. **Brining:** Brining is a game-changer for turkey. It helps to keep the meat moist and adds flavor. You can use a store-bought brine or make your own by mixing salt, sugar, and spices with water. Submerge the turkey in the brine for 24 hours before roasting.\n3. **Stuffing:** If you're using a stuffing, make sure it's loosely filled and not packed too tightly. You can also cook the stuffing outside the turkey in a separate dish to ensure food safety.\n4. **Temperature:** Use a meat thermometer to ensure the turkey reaches a safe internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Check the temperature in the thickest part of the breast and the innermost part of the thigh.\n5. **Roasting:** Roast the turkey in a preheated oven at 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C). Baste the turkey with melted butter or olive oil every 30 minutes to keep it moist and promote browning.\n\n**Herb-Roasted Turkey Recipe**\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 (12-14 pound) whole turkey\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 2 tablespoons butter, softened\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C).\n2. Rinse the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels.\n3. In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, butter, garlic, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper.\n4. Rub the mixture all over the turkey, making sure to get some under the skin as well.\n5. Place the turkey in a roasting pan and put it in the oven.\n6. Roast for about 4-4 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n7. Let the turkey rest for 30 minutes before carving and serving.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Use a roasting pan with a rack to allow air to circulate under the turkey.\n* Tent the turkey with foil if it starts to brown too quickly.\n* Don't overcrowd the roasting pan, as this can cause the turkey to steam instead of roast.\n* Let the turkey rest before carving to allow the juices to redistribute.\n\nI hope these tips and the recipe help you feel more confident about cooking your first turkey!
