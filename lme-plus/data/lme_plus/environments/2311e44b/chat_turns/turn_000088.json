  "content": "Dense retrieval models and sparse retrieval models differ in the way they represent documents and queries for information retrieval tasks.\n\nSparse retrieval models typically represent documents and queries as a bag-of-words, which is a sparse vector that encodes the presence or absence of each word in a document or query. For example, if we have two documents \"the quick brown fox\" and \"the lazy dog\", we could represent them using the following sparse vectors:\n\n* Document 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n* Document 2: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nHere, each number represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word in the document, and the order of the words is ignored.\n\nIn contrast, dense retrieval models represent documents and queries as dense vectors that capture the semantic meaning of the text. For example, if we represent the same two documents as dense vectors using a pre-trained language model like BERT, we might get:\n\n* Document 1: [0.28, 0.62, -0.43, 1.05, ...]\n* Document 2: [0.83, -0.51, 0.17, 0.25, ...]\n\nHere, each number represents a continuous value in a high-dimensional vector space, where the distances between vectors capture the semantic relationships between words and phrases.\n\nThe main advantage of dense retrieval models is that they can capture more nuanced semantic relationships between words and phrases, and they can better handle out-of-vocabulary words. However, sparse retrieval models are often faster and more scalable, as they can be represented using sparse matrices that require less memory and computation.\n\nIn practice, a common approach is to use a hybrid model that combines both sparse and dense representations, where the sparse representation is used for initial filtering, and the dense representation is used for ranking the top candidates. This approach can balance the advantages of both models and achieve high retrieval performance.",
