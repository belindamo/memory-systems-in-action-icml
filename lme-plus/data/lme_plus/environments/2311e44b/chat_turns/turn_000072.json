You're the one who's been asking questions and seeking guidance.\n\nLet's start fresh! Please provide me with the information I requested earlier, and I'll help you create a personalized crop rotation plan for your garden.\n\nTo recap, I need to know:\n\n1. **Garden size and layout**: How many beds or sections do you have in your garden, and what's the approximate size of each bed?\n2. **Current plantings**: You've mentioned tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers. Are they planted in separate beds or together in the same bed? Are there any other vegetables or plants currently in your garden?\n3. **Future plantings**: What other vegetables do you want to plant in the future? Are there any specific crops you're interested in growing, or do you have a rough idea of the types of vegetables you want to include in your rotation?\n4. **Soil type and sun exposure**: What's the soil type in your garden (clay, sand, loam, etc.)? How much sunlight does each bed receive per day?\n5. **Climate and region**: What's your region's climate like? Do you have a short growing season, or is it warm year-round?\n\nOnce I have this information, I'll help you create a personalized crop rotation plan that suits your garden's specific needs.",
