  "content": "Yeah, I can see how the Gucci handbag would be a want. It's funny, I was thinking about that purchase and how I justified it at the time, but looking back, it was definitely an impulse buy. I mean, I didn't need a new handbag, and I could've gotten a similar one for way cheaper. I think I just got caught up in the excitement of the promotion and the idea of treating myself. Do you have any tips on how to avoid impulse buys like that in the future?",
