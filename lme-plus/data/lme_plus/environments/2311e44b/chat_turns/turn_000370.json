That means you still need to read:\n\n50 - 12 = 38 books\n\nSince you didn't specify the average page count of the books you read, we'll use the page count of \"The Nightingale\" as a rough estimate. Let's assume an average page count of 400 pages per book (which is a reasonable estimate, given the length of \"The Nightingale\").\n\nTo calculate the total number of pages you need to read:\n\n38 books \u00d7 400 pages/book \u2248 15,200 pages\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of days you have left in the year:\n\nAssuming today is [current date], there are approximately 154 days left in the year (until December 31st).\n\nTo find out how many pages you need to read per day:\n\n15,200 pages \u00f7 154 days \u2248 99 pages per day\n\nSo, you would need to read approximately 99 pages per day to reach your goal of 50 books by the end of the year.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate, and you can adjust it based on your actual reading speed and the page counts of your future reads. Good luck with your reading challenge, and I hope you enjoy finishing \"The Nightingale\"!",
