Here are some theme and game ideas to get you started:\n\n**Theme Ideas:**\n\n1. **Summer Lovin'**: Celebrate the warmth of summer and the upcoming arrival of baby with a bright and cheerful theme. Decorate with sunflowers, balloons, and pastel colors.\n2. ** Jungle Adventure**: Welcome baby to the wild world with a fun jungle-themed shower. Think greenery, animal prints, and a \"roaring\" good time!\n3. **Enchanted Garden**: Create a whimsical atmosphere with a garden-inspired theme. Use florals, soft colors, and delicate decorations to create a sweet and serene setting.\n4. **Woodland Wonders**: Bring the outdoors in with a woodland-themed shower. Incorporate elements like pinecones, owls, and forest-inspired colors.\n5. **Little Peanut**: A sweet and playful theme featuring peanuts and elephants in a soft, neutral color palette.\n\n**Game Ideas:**\n\n1. **Baby Bingo**: Create bingo cards with words related to babies or baby showers. As the host opens gifts, players mark off the words they see. The first to get five in a row wins!\n2. **Guess the Baby Food**: Prepare several different baby foods, and have guests guess the flavors. The person who correctly identifies the most flavors wins.\n3. **Pin the Pacifier on the Baby**: A baby shower twist on the classic game. Blindfold each player and have them take turns trying to pin the pacifier on a picture of a baby.\n4. **Baby Shower Charades**: Write down baby-related words or phrases (e.g., \"changing a diaper\") on slips of paper, and have guests act them out for the others to guess.\n5. **The Price is Right**: Gather several baby items, and have guests guess the price of each item. The person who comes closest to the actual price without going over wins.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider Sarah's personal preferences and interests when choosing a theme and games.\n* Plan some fun activities for the guests, like a \"Guess the Baby Photo\" game or a \"Words of Wisdom\" card for guests to offer advice to Sarah.\n* Don't forget to have plenty of refreshments and snacks available for your guests.\n* Make sure to send out invitations well in advance to give guests ample time to RSVP.\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan a wonderful baby shower for Sarah!",
