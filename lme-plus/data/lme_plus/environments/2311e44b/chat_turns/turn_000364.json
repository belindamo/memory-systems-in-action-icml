I am contesting the ticket for the following reasons:\n\n1. I was not speeding at the time of the citation. I maintain that I was driving at a safe and legal speed.\n2. The officer who issued the citation did not accurately measure my speed. The speed-measuring device used by the officer may have been faulty or improperly calibrated.\n3. I was not given the opportunity to challenge the citation at the time it was issued. I was not provided with a notice to appear in court or a written notice of the citation.\n\nI request that the court dismiss the citation and find me not guilty. I am enclosing copies of any relevant evidence, including the citation and any documents or photographs that support my case.\n\nThank you for considering my trial by written declaration.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
