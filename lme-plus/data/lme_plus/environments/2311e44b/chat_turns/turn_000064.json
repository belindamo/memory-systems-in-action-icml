  "content": "Late spring is a great time to plant a variety of vegetables that will thrive in the warmer weather. Since you've already got tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers started, here are some other vegetables that do well in late spring:\n\n1. **Squash**: Zucchini, yellow crookneck, and acorn squash love the warmer weather and can be direct-sown in late spring. They're quick to mature and can be harvested in as little as 35-40 days.\n2. **Carrots**: Little Finger and Danver's Half-Long are two popular varieties of carrots that do well in late spring. Make sure the soil is loose and well-draining, and sow seeds about \u00bc inch deep.\n3. **Radishes**: Radishes are another fast-growing crop that can be direct-sown in late spring. They're ready to harvest in as little as 20-25 days and add a spicy kick to salads and sandwiches.\n4. **Green beans**: Bush beans like Blue Lake and Kentucky Wonder are excellent choices for late spring planting. They're easy to grow, mature quickly (around 50-60 days), and can be trained to climb up trellises or fences.\n5. **Herbs**: Many herbs thrive in late spring, including basil, cilantro, dill, and parsley. They add fresh flavor to a variety of dishes and can be direct-sown or started indoors and transplanted.\n6. **Eggplant**: While they take a bit longer to mature (around 70-80 days), eggplants love the warmth of late spring and can be direct-sown or started indoors and transplanted.\n7. **Okra**: Okra is another warm-season crop that does well in late spring. It's relatively easy to grow and can be direct-sown or started indoors and transplanted.\n8. **Summer lettuce and other leafy greens**: Lettuce, spinach, and arugula can be direct-sown in late spring for a continuous harvest. They prefer cooler weather, so make sure to provide some shade and keep the soil consistently moist.\n9. **Corn**: If you have the space, late spring is a great time to plant corn. Make sure to choose a variety that matures quickly (around 60-70 days) and plant in blocks to ensure good pollination.\n10. **Beans (bush and pole)**: In addition to green beans, you can also plant bush and pole beans like Romano, Kentucky Wonder, and Blue Lake in late spring. They're easy to grow and provide a bountiful harvest.\n\nRemember to check the specific growing conditions and days to maturity for each variety to ensure you're planting at the right time for your region. Happy gardening!",
