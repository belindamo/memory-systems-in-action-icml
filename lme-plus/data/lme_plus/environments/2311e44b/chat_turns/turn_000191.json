  "content": "While the terms \"digital piano\" and \"keyboard\" are often used interchangeably, there are distinct differences between the two.\n\n**Digital Piano:**\n\nA digital piano is a type of electronic musical instrument that is designed to mimic the sound and feel of an acoustic piano. It typically has a more realistic piano-like action, with weighted or graded hammer-action keys, and is often built into a cabinet or console that resembles an acoustic piano. Digital pianos usually have a more authentic piano sound and a wider range of tonal colors, making them suitable for serious piano practice, performance, and music education.\n\nCharacteristics of digital pianos:\n\n* Weighted or graded hammer-action keys\n* Realistic piano sound and tone\n* Often built into a cabinet or console\n* Typically more expensive than keyboards\n* Suitable for serious piano practice, performance, and music education\n\n**Keyboard:**\n\nA keyboard, on the other hand, is a more general term that refers to any electronic musical instrument with a keyboard layout. Keyboards can range from simple, portable instruments to more advanced, workstation-style keyboards. They often have non-weighted or spring-loaded keys, and their sound quality can vary greatly. Keyboards are often used for a wide range of music genres, from casual playing to professional music production.\n\nCharacteristics of keyboards:\n\n* Non-weighted or spring-loaded keys\n* Sound quality can vary greatly\n* Often more portable and affordable than digital pianos\n* Suitable for casual playing, music production, and various music genres\n\n**Key differences:**\n\nThe main differences between digital pianos and keyboards are:\n\n* Key action: Digital pianos have weighted or graded hammer-action keys, while keyboards have non-weighted or spring-loaded keys.\n* Sound quality: Digital pianos tend to have more realistic and authentic piano sounds, while keyboards can have a wide range of sounds and quality.\n* Purpose: Digital pianos are designed for serious piano practice and performance, while keyboards are often used for more casual playing and music production.\n\nIn summary, while both digital pianos and keyboards are electronic musical instruments with a keyboard layout, digital pianos are designed to mimic the sound and feel of an acoustic piano, making them suitable for serious piano practice and performance. Keyboards, on the other hand, are more general-purpose instruments that can be used for a wide range of music genres and applications.",
