  "content": "As I'm a large language model, I don't have specific information about the music store's inventory or products. However, it's likely that a music store that carries guitar amps like the Fender Mustang II would also carry drum accessories, including drumheads.\n\nI would recommend calling the store and asking about their drum accessory selection, specifically about the type of drumheads you're looking for. They might carry a variety of brands and sizes, or they might be able to special order something for you.\n\nAdditionally, you can also ask about any deals or discounts they might have on drumheads or other drum accessories. It's always a good idea to check with multiple stores or online retailers to compare prices and find the best deal.\n\nRemember to also ask about their return and exchange policies, in case you need to swap out the drumheads for a different size or type.\n\nGood luck with your drumhead shopping, and I hope you find the perfect fit for your set!",
