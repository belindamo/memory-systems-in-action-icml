Focusing on exercises that target your legs, glutes, and core will help you build the strength and endurance you need to power through your 10K training. Here are some exercises that I highly recommend:\n\n**Squats**: Squats are a must-do for runners. They work multiple muscle groups, including your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend your knees and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Aim for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n\n**Lunges**: Lunges target your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, and help improve your running stride and balance. Stand with your feet together, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower your body until your back knee almost touches the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Alternate legs with each rep. Aim for 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg.\n\n**Deadlifts**: Deadlifts work multiple muscle groups, including your glutes, hamstrings, and lower back. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend down and grab a weight or barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart, and lift the weight up to hip level. Lower the weight back down to the starting position. Aim for 3 sets of 8-10 reps.\n\n**Calf Raises**: Strong calf muscles are essential for runners, as they help you push off the ground with each stride. Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto your tiptoes, and then lower back down. Aim for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Step-Ups**: Step-ups target your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, and help improve your running stride and agility. Stand in front of a step or bench, raise one foot up onto the step, and then bring the other foot up to meet it. Step back down to the starting position. Alternate legs with each rep. Aim for 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg.\n\n**Leg Press**: The leg press is a great exercise for targeting your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Sit in a leg press machine, push the platform away from you with your feet, and then lower it back down to the starting position. Aim for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n\n**Glute Bridges**: Glute bridges target your gluteus maximus, which is essential for hip stability and power when running. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, lift your hips up towards the ceiling, and then lower back down. Aim for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Core Exercises**: A strong core is essential for runners, as it helps with stability, balance, and posture. Incorporate exercises like planks, Russian twists, and leg raises into your strength training routine.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Start with lower weights and gradually increase the weight as you build strength.\n* Focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury.\n* Incorporate strength training 2-3 times a week, allowing for at least one rest day in between.\n* Warm up before each strength training session with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching.\n\nBy incorporating these exercises into your strength training routine, you'll be building the leg strength and endurance you need to power through your 10K training and crush your goal!",
