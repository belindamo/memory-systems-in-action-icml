  "content": "Yes, there are many features and considerations that people can look for when buying a house to ensure it's structurally sound during extreme weather events. Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Foundation: Look for a home with a strong, stable foundation, such as a concrete slab or reinforced foundation walls. The foundation should also be properly anchored to the ground to resist high winds and prevent uplift.\n\n2. Roof and walls: The roof and walls should be constructed of sturdy materials, such as metal or concrete, that can withstand high winds, heavy rain, and hail. The windows and doors should also be impact-resistant or protected by storm shutters.\n\n3. Drainage: The home's drainage system should be designed to move water away from the foundation and prevent flooding. This may include a sloped grade around the property, gutters and downspouts, and a French drain or sump pump.\n\n4. Location: The home's location can also impact its resilience to extreme weather events. Look for a home that is not located in a flood zone or on a hillside prone to landslides or mudslides.\n\n5. Building codes: Finally, it's important to check that the home was built to code, which includes regulations for structural integrity and resilience to extreme weather conditions. You can obtain the building codes from the local authority having jurisdiction, which can indicate structural requirements for buildings in extreme weather conditions.\n\nBy paying attention to these factors, buyers can make more informed decisions when purchasing a home, ensure they invest in structurally sound properties, and achieve greater peace of mind knowing their homes are ready for unexpected weather events.",
