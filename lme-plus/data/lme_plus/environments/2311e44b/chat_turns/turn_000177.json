  "content": "**Guess the Baby Photo Game:**\n\nWhat a great idea! The \"Guess the Baby Photo\" game is a classic and always a hit at baby showers. It's a wonderful way to get everyone involved and laughing together. Since Sarah is a coworker, you might not have access to her baby photos, but you could ask her to provide some pictures of herself as a baby or a young child. Alternatively, you could ask guests to bring their own baby photos and have a fun guessing game to see who can identify the most baby pictures correctly.\n\n**Number of Games:**\n\nFor a typical baby shower, 2-3 games are a good number. This allows guests to participate, have fun, and socialize without feeling overwhelmed or bored. You can choose games that complement each other in terms of pace and style. For example, you could have a more energetic game like \"Jungle Scavenger Hunt\" followed by a quieter, more introspective game like \"Words of Wisdom\" (where guests write advice for Sarah).\n\nHere's a possible game plan:\n\n1. **Jungle Scavenger Hunt**: A fun, energetic game to get everyone moving and laughing together.\n2. **Guess the Baby Photo**: A classic game that's easy to understand and always generates a lot of laughter and excitement.\n3. **Tropical Trivia**: A shorter, more low-key game that's a great way to wrap up the activities before cake and gift-giving.\n\nRemember to keep the games short and sweet, around 10-15 minutes each. This will give guests a chance to participate, have fun, and still have time to socialize and enjoy the celebration.\n\nI hope this helps, and congratulations to your cousin Emma on the arrival of baby Lucas!",
