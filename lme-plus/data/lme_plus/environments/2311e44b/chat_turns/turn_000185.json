  "content": "**Scene:** A home furnishings store. Two men, JIM and MIKE, are standing in front of a wall of curtains. Both men are visibly ill and are acting erratically.\n\n**Jim:** These curtains are terrible! They're not even the right color!\n\n**Mike:** You're just saying that because you're a moron! These curtains are perfect!\n\n**Jim:** Perfect? Are you kidding me? These curtains are the worst I've ever seen!\n\n**Mike:** That's because you have no taste! These curtains are the best in the store!\n\n**Jim:** The best? They're the worst!\n\n**Mike:** Fine, if you don't like these curtains, then what do you like?\n\n**Jim:** I like these ones! (points to a different set of curtains)\n\n**Mike:** Those curtains are even worse than the ones we're looking at!\n\n**Jim:** How can you say that? They're beautiful!\n\n**Mike:** You're not even making sense anymore! You have rabies!\n\n**Jim:** So do you!\n\n**Mike:** That may be true, but at least I can still appreciate good curtains!\n\n**Jim:** I can too! These are the best curtains in the store!\n\n**Mike:** No, they're not! These are the best! (points to a different set of curtains)\n\n**Jim:** This is ridiculous! We're never going to agree on the best curtains!\n\n**Mike:** You're right. We're both insane with rabies. Let's just leave and forget about the curtains.\n\n**Jim:** Good idea. I don't even care about curtains anymore.\n\n**Mike:** Me neither. Let's just go. (both men exit the store)\n\n**End scene.**",
