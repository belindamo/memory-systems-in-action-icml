  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on planning a road trip to the Pacific Coast Highway. I recently took my new Subaru Outback on a solo trip to Big Sur and loved the scenic drive. Now I'm thinking of exploring more of the coast with my friends. Can you recommend some must-see stops and scenic overlooks? By the way, I just got back from an amazing 4-day camping trip to Yosemite National Park with my friends, and I'm still buzzing from the breathtaking views at Vernal Falls.",
