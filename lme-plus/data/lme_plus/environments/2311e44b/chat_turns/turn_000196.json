  "content": "I've been thinking about getting a digital piano, and I've also been getting back into playing guitar after a 5-year break. I started taking lessons again on February 10th and it's been going great, I even played my first full song without mistakes on February 20th! Anyway, back to digital pianos, can you recommend some good online resources for learning music theory, especially chord progressions and scales?",
