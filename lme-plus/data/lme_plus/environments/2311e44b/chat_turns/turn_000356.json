  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have human emotions, but you're right. It can be difficult for host birds to raise cuckoo chicks. Cuckoo chicks are often larger and more demanding than host bird chicks, which can result in a lot of work and energy expenditure for the host birds. This can be particularly challenging when the host birds are already raising their own chicks alongside the cuckoo chicks in the same nest.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that brood parasitism has been going on for a long time, and many host bird species have evolved strategies to cope with cuckoo chicks. Some host birds have learned to recognize and reject cuckoo eggs or chicks, which reduces the negative impact on their own chick's survival and growth. As a result, many host bird populations are still able to thrive despite the presence of cuckoo chicks in their nests.",
