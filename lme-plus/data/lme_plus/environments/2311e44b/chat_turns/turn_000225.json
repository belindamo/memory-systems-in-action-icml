  "content": "Architects ensure that buildings are structurally sound during extreme weather events by designing buildings that meet building codes and standards for wind and earthquake loads. They use advanced computer software that allows them to simulate and model weather events to determine potential structural weaknesses in the building's design. \n\nArchitects also use materials and construction techniques that are resistant to high winds, heavy rains, and flooding. They may use reinforced concrete or steel to ensure greater strength and stability, and design the building to have a low profile or flat roof to minimize the wind\u2019s impact. \n\nIn addition, they consider the effects of storm surge, wave action, and soil conditions on the building's foundation. They may opt to elevate the building's elevation to avoid flooding or use waterproof coatings and sealed openings to prevent water intrusion. \n\nFinally, architects work with structural engineers to ensure that their designs are feasible and that building materials and construction techniques can withstand extreme weather conditions. They also work with local authorities and emergency management agencies to ensure that the building's design meets local or regional codes and requirements, and the building occupants have safe access to shelters or evacuation routes.",
