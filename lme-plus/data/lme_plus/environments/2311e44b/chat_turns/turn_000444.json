  "content": "With 12 books already under your belt, you've got a good head start.\n\nLet's recalculate your target:\n\n* You want to read 50 books by the end of the year, and you've already read 12, so you need to read: 50 - 12 = 38 books\n* You have [insert number of months left in the year] months remaining in the year. Let's assume it's September, so you have 4 months left.\n* Divide the remaining books you need to read (38) by the number of months you have left: 38 books / 4 months = 9.5 books per month\n\nSo, you'll need to read around 9-10 books per month for the remaining 4 months to reach your goal.\n\nNow, about those non-fiction book recommendations!\n\nSince you're enjoying \"Sapiens\" but finding it slow going, I'll suggest some engaging and accessible non-fiction books that might be up your alley:\n\n1. **\"The Devil in the White City\" by Erik Larson**: A historical true crime book that reads like a thriller. It's about the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago and the serial killer H.H. Holmes.\n2. **\"Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\" by John Carreyrou**: A fascinating and well-researched book about the rise and fall of Theranos, a biotech startup that claimed to revolutionize healthcare.\n3. **\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\" by Rebecca Skloot**: A compelling story about the intersection of medicine, ethics, and humanity, centered around the life of Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells.\n4. **\"Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption\" by Bryan Stevenson**: A powerful and thought-provoking book about the US justice system, racial inequality, and the author's work as a lawyer advocating for death row inmates.\n5. **\"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\" by Charles Duhigg**: A fascinating exploration of habits, how they're formed, and how we can change them. It's a great mix of science, psychology, and real-life examples.\n\nThese books are all well-researched, engaging, and relatively easy to read. They're not too dense or academic, making them perfect for someone who wants to enjoy non-fiction without feeling overwhelmed.",
