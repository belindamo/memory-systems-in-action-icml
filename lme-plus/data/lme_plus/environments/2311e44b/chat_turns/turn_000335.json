And thanks for the restaurant recommendations! I'm definitely going to check out The Wharf Restaurant and The Crab Shack. Fresh seafood is always a must when you're at the beach. By the way, speaking of family, I recently attended my cousin's wedding, and it was great to catch up with my relatives.
