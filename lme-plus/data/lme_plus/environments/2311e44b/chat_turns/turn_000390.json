I'm happy to help you with that!\n\nFirstly, congratulations on realizing the importance of good lighting after the power outage! It's amazing how we often take it for granted until we're plunged into darkness.\n\nNow, let's tackle the issue at hand. Adding a floor lamp can be a great solution to supplement the table lamp. To determine the best placement for the floor lamp, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Traffic path**: Avoid placing the lamp in a high-traffic area where it might be a tripping hazard or get in the way.\n2. **Seating areas**: Position the lamp near a seating area, such as a reading nook or a conversation circle, to provide task lighting and create a cozy atmosphere.\n3. **Room layout**: Take note of the room's layout and the direction of the furniture. If you have a large sectional sofa, for example, you might want to place the lamp behind it to create a sense of balance.\n4. **Dark corners**: Identify the darkest areas of the room and place the lamp accordingly. This will help illuminate the space and create a more even distribution of light.\n5. **Power outlet**: Ensure there's a nearby power outlet to plug in the lamp, or consider a lamp with a long cord or a wireless option.\n\nHere are some popular placement options for a floor lamp:\n\n* Corner placement: Tuck the lamp into a corner to create a cozy reading nook or to illuminate a dark area.\n* Behind a sofa or armchair: Place the lamp behind a piece of furniture to create a sense of depth and provide lighting for the seating area.\n* Near a window: Position the lamp near a window to supplement natural light and create a sense of brightness.\n\nBefore making a final decision, you might want to experiment with different lamp placements using a temporary solution, like a table lamp or a flashlight, to see how the light falls in the room.\n\nI hope these tips help you find the perfect spot for your new floor lamp!",
