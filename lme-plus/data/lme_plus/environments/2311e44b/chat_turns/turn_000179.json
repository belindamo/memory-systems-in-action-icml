Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Monkey Mango Punch**: Mix together mango juice, pineapple juice, and a splash of lemon-lime soda for a sweet and tangy drink. Add some ice and garnish with fresh mango slices and a sprinkle of mint leaves.\n2. **Jungle Juice**: Combine pineapple juice, orange juice, and a splash of grenadine syrup for a fruity and refreshing drink. Serve over ice with a jungle-themed straw and a pineapple wedge.\n3. **Tropical Tonic**: Mix together ginger ale, pineapple juice, and a squeeze of lime juice for a light and refreshing drink. Add a few slices of lime and a sprig of fresh mint for garnish.\n4. **Rainforest Refresher**: Blend together frozen pineapple, mango, and coconut milk for a creamy and dreamy drink. Pour into glasses and garnish with a sprinkle of shaved coconut and a pineapple wedge.\n\nYou could also consider serving flavored water or infused water with fruits and herbs like strawberries, lemons, and mint. This is a great option for a lighter, non-sugary drink.\n\nRemember to have fun with the names and presentation to fit the Jungle Adventure theme! You could serve the drinks in jungle-themed cups or garnish with edible flowers or leaves.\n\nI'm glad you had a great time visiting your cousin Emma and meeting baby Lucas!",
