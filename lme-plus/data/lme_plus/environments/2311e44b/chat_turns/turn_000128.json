Here are some tips to help you balance your running and strength training:\n\n**Periodization**: Divide your training into periods or blocks, with specific goals and focuses for each period. For example, you might focus on building your endurance and mileage during one period, and then switch to a strength-focused period to build power and speed.\n\n**Microcycles**: Break down your training into smaller, weekly microcycles. For example, you might have a \"hard\" week with high-intensity running and strength training, followed by an \"easy\" week with lower-intensity workouts and active recovery.\n\n**Running and Strength Training Ratio**: Aim for a balance between running and strength training. A common ratio is 2-3 running days per week, with 1-2 strength training days per week. In your case, you're already committed to Saturday morning runs, so you can fit in strength training on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\n**Prioritize Your Running**: As you're training for a 10K, prioritize your running workouts. Make sure you're getting in your quality running sessions, and then fit in strength training around those runs.\n\n**Don't Overdo It**: Be careful not to overdo it with strength training, especially if you're new to it. Start with lower weights and higher reps, and gradually increase the intensity as your body adapts. Remember, the goal is to complement your running, not replace it.\n\n**Active Recovery**: Incorporate active recovery days, where you do light, low-intensity activities like yoga, cycling, or swimming. This will help your body recover from the demands of running and strength training.\n\n**Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to your body and take rest days as needed. If you're feeling fatigued or experiencing muscle soreness, it's okay to take an extra day off or modify your workouts.\n\nHere's an example of what your weekly workout routine might look like:\n\n* Saturday: 5-7 km run\n* Tuesday: Strength training (legs and glutes focus)\n* Wednesday: Active recovery (e.g., yoga or cycling)\n* Thursday: Strength training (core and upper body focus)\n* Friday: Rest day or easy run (e.g., 3-4 km)\n* Sunday: Rest day or active recovery\n\nRemember to stay flexible and adjust your routine as needed. With consistent training and careful planning, you'll be well on your way to crushing your 10K goal!",
