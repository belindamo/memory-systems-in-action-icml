  "content": "I understand your concern about trunk space, and a roof-mounted rack is a great option for smaller cars. However, it's essential to ensure the rack can handle the combined weight of both your road bike and mountain bike.\n\n**Weight Capacity Considerations:**\n\n1. **Road Bike (Trek Emonda):** The Trek Emonda is a high-end road bike, and its weight can vary depending on the model and components. On average, a Trek Emonda can weigh between 17-20 pounds (7.7-9 kg).\n2. **Mountain Bike (Specialized Rockhopper):** The Specialized Rockhopper is a popular hardtail mountain bike, and its weight can also vary depending on the model and components. On average, a Specialized Rockhopper can weigh between 25-30 pounds (11.3-13.6 kg).\n\n**Combined Weight:** Assuming an average weight for both bikes, the combined weight would be around 42-50 pounds (19-22.7 kg).\n\n**Roof-Mounted Rack Weight Capacity:**\n\n1. **Typical Roof-Mounted Rack Weight Capacity:** Most roof-mounted bike racks have a weight capacity ranging from 30-50 pounds (13.6-22.7 kg) per bike. Some high-end racks may have a higher capacity, but it's essential to check the manufacturer's specifications.\n2. **Check the Rack's Weight Capacity:** Before selecting a roof-mounted rack, ensure it can handle the combined weight of both your road bike and mountain bike. Look for racks with a higher weight capacity, such as 60-70 pounds (27.2-31.8 kg) or more.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n1. **Bike Size and Shape:** The size and shape of your bikes can also affect the rack's ability to handle the weight. Larger or heavier bikes may require a more substantial rack or additional support.\n2. **Roof Type and Strength:** The type and strength of your vehicle's roof can also impact the rack's weight capacity. Some roofs may have weight restrictions or require additional reinforcement.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on your bike weights, I recommend looking for a high-end roof-mounted rack with a weight capacity of at least 60-70 pounds (27.2-31.8 kg) to ensure safe and secure transportation of both your road bike and mountain bike. Additionally, consider the following:\n\n1. **Check the manufacturer's specifications:** Verify the rack's weight capacity and compatibility with your vehicle's roof type.\n2. **Consult with a professional:** If you're unsure about the rack's weight capacity or installation, consult with a professional bike shop or rack installer.\n3. **Choose a rack with adjustable arms:** An adjustable arm design can help accommodate different bike sizes and shapes, ensuring a secure fit.\n\nBy selecting a suitable roof-mounted rack, you can enjoy your road trip with both your road bike and mountain bike safely and securely in tow.",
