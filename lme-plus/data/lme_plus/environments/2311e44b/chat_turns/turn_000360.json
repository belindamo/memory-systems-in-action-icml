  "content": "Yes, some host birds have developed strategies to detect and remove cuckoo eggs from their nests before they hatch into chicks. One way they do this is through visual inspection. Host birds may notice that the size, shape, or color of the egg differs from their own eggs and then remove the cuckoo egg from the nest. Some host bird species can also recognize and remember the appearance of cuckoo eggs from previous experiences, which helps them to detect and remove cuckoo eggs more efficiently.\n\nAnother way that host birds can detect cuckoo eggs is through vocal recognition. Some cuckoo species produce distinctive calls that are recognized by their host birds. Host birds can use these calls to identify and reject cuckoo eggs from their nests.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all host bird species are able to detect and reject cuckoo eggs, and some are better at it than others. This can vary depending on factors such as the size and coloration of the cuckoo egg, and the relative size and similarity of the host and cuckoo species.",
