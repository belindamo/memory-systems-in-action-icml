The officer who issued the citation did not accurately measure my speed. The speed-measuring device used by the officer may have been faulty or improperly calibrated.\n3. I was not given the opportunity to challenge the citation at the time it was issued. I was not provided with a notice to appear in court or a written notice of the citation.\n\nI request that the court dismiss the citation and find me not guilty.
