Here, we show how the ELI5 dataset allows us to train a dense retrieval system without access to either, making dense retrieval models more accessible."

      "content": "The passage discusses recent advances in the field of training embedding-based retrieval models for open-domain questions. Such models aim to retrieve relevant information to support answers to open-ended questions. The author notes that progress has been made in this area when direct supervision is available or when models are pre-trained on task-specific data.\n\nHowever, the author argues that their work demonstrates a way to train dense retrieval models without the need for direct supervision or extensive pretraining. This is made possible by using the ELI5 dataset, which provides a diverse set of questions and answers. By using this dataset, the author claims that they can make dense retrieval models more accessible. In other words, they can make it easier for researchers to develop and use these models without requiring specialized expertise or resources."

      "content": "\"Embedding-based retrieval\" models refer to a type of machine learning model used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval tasks. These models are trained to convert words, phrases, or documents into numerical vectors (i.e., embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning in a high-dimensional space.\n\nThe goal of embedding-based retrieval models is to enable efficient and effective matching of queries with relevant documents or passages in a large corpus of text. By representing text as vectors, the model can compare the similarity between query and document vectors to determine the relevance of a given document to a particular query.\n\nThese models have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to capture the semantic relationships between words and phrases, as well as their efficiency in handling large datasets. Examples of embedding-based retrieval models include BERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec."

      "content": "Dense retrieval models are a type of information retrieval model that use dense vector representations (i.e., embeddings) to compare the similarity between a query and a set of candidate documents. These models are often used for open-domain question answering tasks and can be contrasted with sparse retrieval models, which rely on traditional bag-of-words representations of documents.\n\nIn dense retrieval models, the query and document are represented as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, where the similarity between the vectors is computed using methods such as cosine similarity or dot product. The documents are ranked based on their similarity to the query, and the top-ranked documents are returned as the answer.\n\nDense retrieval models have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to capture the semantic relationships between words and phrases, as well as their efficiency in handling large datasets. Examples of dense retrieval models include DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) and SOTA (State-of-the-Art) models such as T5, BART, and ELECTRA."

      "content": "Dense retrieval models and sparse retrieval models differ in the way they represent documents and queries for information retrieval tasks.\n\nSparse retrieval models typically represent documents and queries as a bag-of-words, which is a sparse vector that encodes the presence or absence of each word in a document or query. For example, if we have two documents \"the quick brown fox\" and \"the lazy dog\", we could represent them using the following sparse vectors:\n\n* Document 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n* Document 2: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nHere, each number represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of a word in the document, and the order of the words is ignored.\n\nIn contrast, dense retrieval models represent documents and queries as dense vectors that capture the semantic meaning of the text. For example, if we represent the same two documents as dense vectors using a pre-trained language model like BERT, we might get:\n\n* Document 1: [0.28, 0.62, -0.43, 1.05, ...]\n* Document 2: [0.83, -0.51, 0.17, 0.25, ...]\n\nHere, each number represents a continuous value in a high-dimensional vector space, where the distances between vectors capture the semantic relationships between words and phrases.\n\nThe main advantage of dense retrieval models is that they can capture more nuanced semantic relationships between words and phrases, and they can better handle out-of-vocabulary words. However, sparse retrieval models are often faster and more scalable, as they can be represented using sparse matrices that require less memory and computation.\n\nIn practice, a common approach is to use a hybrid model that combines both sparse and dense representations, where the sparse representation is used for initial filtering, and the dense representation is used for ranking the top candidates. This approach can balance the advantages of both models and achieve high retrieval performance."

      "content": "Sure, let me provide a more detailed example of a sparse retrieval model.\n\nSuppose we have a collection of three documents:\n\n* Document 1: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n* Document 2: \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\"\n* Document 3: \"Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.\"\n\nWe can represent each document as a bag-of-words vector, where each element in the vector corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary. For simplicity, let's assume our vocabulary only includes the following words:\n\n[\"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"jumps\", \"over\", \"lazy\", \"dog\", \"A\", \"bird\", \"in\", \"the\", \"hand\", \"is\", \"worth\", \"two\", \"bush\", \"Time\", \"flies\", \"like\", \"an\", \"arrow\", \"fruit\", \"a\", \"banana\"]\n\nUsing this vocabulary, we can represent each document as a binary vector indicating the presence or absence of each word. For example, the bag-of-words representation of Document 1 would be:\n\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the first eight elements are set to 1 because they correspond to the words that appear in Document 1, and the remaining elements are set to 0 because they do not appear in the document.\n\nSuppose we want to retrieve documents that are relevant to the query \"brown fox\". We can represent the query as a bag-of-words vector using the same vocabulary:\n\n[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the third and fourth elements are set to 1 because they correspond to the words \"brown\" and \"fox\", and the remaining elements are set to 0.\n\nTo retrieve relevant documents, we can compute the cosine similarity between the query vector and each document vector, and rank the documents based on their similarity score. The documents with the highest similarity scores are returned as the top results.\n\nSparse retrieval models are simple and easy to implement, but they have limitations in capturing semantic relationships between words and phrases, and they may not perform well in handling out-of-vocabulary words."

      "content": "Dense retrieval models typically handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words by leveraging subword embeddings, which represent words as a combination of their constituent subwords.\n\nSubword embeddings are typically learned by pre-training language models on large amounts of text data. During training, the language model learns to predict the next word in a sequence of text, given the previous words as input. To handle OOV words, the language model learns to represent each word as a combination of its constituent subwords, which are typically character n-grams.\n\nFor example, suppose we have an OOV word \"fudgel\" that is not present in the vocabulary of our pre-trained language model. We can still represent the word as a combination of its constituent subwords, such as \"fud\" and \"gel\". The language model can then use the embeddings of these subwords to represent the OOV word.\n\nDuring retrieval, the dense retrieval model can use the pre-trained language model to compute dense embeddings for both the query and the documents in the collection. The embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, including the meaning of OOV words that are represented as combinations of subword embeddings.\n\nBy using subword embeddings, dense retrieval models can handle OOV words more effectively than sparse retrieval models, which may not be able to represent OOV words at all. However, subword embeddings increase the dimensionality of the dense vector representations, which can make computation and storage more challenging. To mitigate this, some dense retrieval models may use dimensionality reduction techniques or other compression strategies to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings without losing too much information."
