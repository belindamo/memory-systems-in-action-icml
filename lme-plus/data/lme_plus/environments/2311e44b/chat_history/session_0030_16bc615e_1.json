I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations on photo management software and apps.\n\n**Computer-based options:**\n\n1. **Adobe Lightroom**: A popular choice among photographers, Lightroom is a powerful photo management tool that allows you to import, organize, edit, and export your photos.

It's free, easy to use, and integrates well with other Apple devices.\n3. **Google Photos** (web-based): While not a traditional desktop app, Google Photos is a great option if you're comfortable with cloud-based storage. It offers unlimited storage for high-quality photos and has robust search and organization features.\n\n**Mobile apps:**\n\n1. **Google Photos** (iOS and Android): The mobile app is just as powerful as the web version, allowing you to organize, search, and edit your photos on-the-go.\n2. **VSCO** (iOS and Android): A popular app for editing and organizing photos, VSCO also offers a journal feature to help you tell the story of your trip.\n3. **PicsArt** (iOS and Android): A feature-rich photo editing app that also offers organization and sharing features.\n\n**Tips for organizing your travel photos:**\n\n1. **Create folders and subfolders**: Organize your photos by location (e.g., Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka), date, or activity (e.g., temples, food, landscapes).\n2. **Use keywords and tags**: Assign relevant keywords and tags to your photos to make them easily searchable.\n3. **Add captions and descriptions**: Write a brief description of each photo, including the location, date, and any interesting stories or facts.\n4. **Star or favorite your best shots**: Mark your favorite photos to easily find them later.\n5. **Backup your photos**: Make sure to backup your photos to an external hard drive, cloud storage, or both, to ensure they're safe and accessible.\n\n**Additional tips for Japan-specific photos:**\n\n1. **Use location-based folders**: Create folders for specific locations, such as Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing or Kyoto's Fushimi Inari Shrine.\n2. **Organize by day or activity**: Create folders for each day of your trip or by activity, such as \"Tokyo Day 1\" or \"Osaka Food Tour\".\n3. **Capture context**: Take photos of signs, maps, and other contextual information to help you remember the details of your trip.\n\nI hope these recommendations and tips help you organize your travel photos from Japan!"
