      "content": "Shoegaze music is characterized by:\n\n1. Ethereal vocals: Vocals are often breathy, whispered or dreamy.\n\n2. Walls of guitar noise: High levels of guitar feedback, distortion and reverb.\n\n3. Use of pedals: Shoegaze guitarists often use a variety of effects pedals to create unique sounds.\n\n4. Slow tempo: Shoegaze songs tend to be mid-tempo or slow.\n\n5. Layered soundscapes: The music often features layers of noise, delay, and echo.\n\n6. Limited dynamic range: Songs are often performed at a consistent volume level without many changes in dynamics.\n\n7. Influenced by psychedelic, dream pop and alternative rock: Shoegaze was influenced by other styles of music, including late-1980s alternative rock, dream pop, and psychedelia.\n\n8. Emphasis on atmosphere: The music is often more about creating a mood than conveying a specific lyrical message.\n\n9. Obscured vocals: Shoegaze can be difficult to understand at times as vocals are often intentionally obscured by the music.\n\n10. Use of alternate tunings: Many songs employ alternate guitar tunings to achieve a distinct sound."
