      "content": "While it's understandable that some people may not be interested in politics and social issues, it's important to recognize that these issues can have a significant impact on our daily lives. Political decisions can affect everything from our access to healthcare and education to our ability to travel internationally.\n\nAdditionally, social issues are often matters of basic human rights and can impact the well-being of individuals and communities. Ignoring these issues can perpetuate inequities and injustices that affect us all, whether we realize it or not.\n\nThat being said, it's also important to find a balance and take care of our own individual needs and wellbeing. Staying informed and engaged with political and social issues doesn't mean sacrificing one's own mental and emotional health. It's important to find a healthy balance and prioritize self-care."
