The \"list up\" should include at least 10 key contents and key sentences\n6.When you \"list up\" the previously output list number again, the previously output list number is printed at the front and the new list number is printed.\nFor example\n3. Necessity of Python: You can automate repetitive tasks using Python.If you \"list up\" about something,\n3.1. Web Crawling: You can automatically collect web content using Python.\n3.2. Excel Automation: You can automatically enter information that needs to be entered repeatedly in Excel using Python.\nThere are a total of six rules for the \"list up\" stage.\n\n\"Print\" stage :\nwrite a detailed description of the contents listed in the \"list up\" step. The rules for this step are:\n1. Use short sentences\n2. Include examples\n3. Write sentences that progress in a more concrete manner as the paragraph continues\n4. The overall length should be more than 200 words.\n5.

      "content": "Regular exercise is important for maintaining a healthy heart. Physical activity can help strengthen the heart and improve cardiovascular function. This is achieved by increasing blood flow and strengthening the heart muscle. When the heart works more efficiently, it pumps blood more effectively, which can lead to lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of heart disease. Regular exercise also improves the overall health of the cardiovascular system, which includes the heart and blood vessels. This is because physical activity helps to reduce the buildup of plaque in the arteries, a major risk factor for heart disease. Exercise can also increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the \"good\" cholesterol, which helps remove the \"bad\" cholesterol from the bloodstream and reduce the risk of heart disease (Source: American Heart Association)."
