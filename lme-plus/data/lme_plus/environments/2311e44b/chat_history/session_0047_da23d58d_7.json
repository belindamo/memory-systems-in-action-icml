I want to go with a board game theme, so I was thinking of setting up different stations with popular games like Scattergories and Codenames. This month, I chose Clue for my sister and me to play and learn together, and I think it would be cool to have a Clue-themed area as well. Do you have any suggestions on how to decorate the place?"
