I can provide you with some general tips on how to find out about exhibitions and events at art museums, though!\n\n1. Check the museum's website: Most museums have a website that lists their current and upcoming exhibitions, as well as events and programs. You can usually find this information under sections like \"Exhibitions,\" \"Events,\" or \"Calendar.\"\n2. Sign up for newsletters: Many museums offer newsletters that provide updates on new exhibitions, events, and programs. You can usually find a sign-up form on their website.\n3. Follow museums on social media: Museums often post about their exhibitions and events on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n4. Use online event calendars: Websites like Eventbrite, Meetup, or local arts and culture websites often list exhibitions and events happening in your area.\n5. Ask locals or museum staff: If you know someone who lives in the area or works at the museum, ask them for recommendations! They might have insider knowledge on what's not to be missed.\n\nAs for your visit to the \"Street Photography\" exhibition, I'm glad you enjoyed it! Since I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't know about your visit. But I'm happy to chat with you about it if you'd like to share more about your experience!\n\nI hope these tips help you plan your upcoming museum visits!"
