Be consistent: Consistency is key when it comes to building an online presence. Try to post regularly and maintain a consistent style to build a strong brand. 2. Use high-quality visuals: When posting your artwork online, make sure you use high-quality visuals that do justice to your work. This includes high-resolution images and videos, and attention-grabbing thumbnails that encourage people to click through to your content. 3. Showcase your personality: People are more likely to follow and engage with artists who have a strong personality and are true to themselves. Don't be afraid to showcase your personality, share your interests, and give your followers a glimpse into your life beyond your artwork. 4. Engage with your audience: Engaging with your audience is essential for building a strong online presence. Ask for feedback, respond to comments and messages, and make an effort to show interest in your followers' own work. 5. Network with other artists: Networking with other artists can help you build valuable relationships and reach a wider audience. Collaborate on projects, attend events and exhibitions, and participate in online groups and communities. 6. Use diverse platforms : Consider using different social media platforms - not every platform works for an artist. Experiment and choose which platform is best to showcase your art and gain a following. Remember, building a strong online presence as an artist takes time and persistence. Keep promoting your artwork, try new things and stay true to yourself.",
