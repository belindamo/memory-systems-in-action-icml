Instead, there are several street photography festivals and events that take place around the world, each with its own unique focus and schedule.\n\nHere are a few examples of street photography festivals and events that might interest you:\n\n* **London Street Photography Festival** (London, UK): A annual festival that celebrates street photography with exhibitions, talks, and workshops.\n* **Miami Street Photography Festival** (Miami, USA): A annual festival featuring exhibitions, workshops, and lectures on street photography.\n* **StreetFoto San Francisco** (San Francisco, USA): A annual festival that showcases street photography with exhibitions, talks, and workshops.\n* **Paris Street Photography Festival** (Paris, France): A biennial festival that celebrates street photography with exhibitions, talks, and workshops.\n\nThese festivals typically feature exhibitions, workshops, lectures, and photowalks, and they often attract renowned street photographers as speakers and judges. They're a great way to connect with other street photographers, learn from the experts, and get inspired by the latest work in the genre.\n\nTo find out about upcoming street photography festivals and events, I recommend following street photography institutions, organizations, and communities on social media, as well as searching online for \"street photography festival\" or \"street photography event\" along with your location or a specific city.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
