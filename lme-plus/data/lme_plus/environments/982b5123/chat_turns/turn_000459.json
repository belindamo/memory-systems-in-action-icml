  "content": "I'm planning a family trip to Hawaii in June and I'm trying to finalize our accommodation options. I've been looking at hotels in Waikiki, but I was wondering if you could recommend any good travel websites or resources to help me find the best deals? By the way, I recently got back from a solo trip to New York City in early March, and I had a great experience booking a hotel in Midtown, so I'm hoping to find something similar in Waikiki.",
