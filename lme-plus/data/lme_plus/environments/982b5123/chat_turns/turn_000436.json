  "content": "Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disorder that cannot be cured. However, it can be managed effectively with a strict gluten-free diet. If a person with celiac disease can maintain a gluten-free diet, the intestinal lining will heal, and they will experience significant improvement in symptoms. In some cases, the need for medications and supplements can be eliminated over time, as the intestinal lining heals and the body begins to absorb nutrients more effectively. However, it is important to note that even small amounts of gluten can cause significant damage to the intestines and trigger symptoms in individuals with celiac disease, so maintaining a gluten-free diet is essential for long-term health and well-being.",
