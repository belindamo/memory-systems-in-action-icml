  "content": "The Grilled Portobello Mushroom and Oaxaca Cheese filling is a match made in heaven. Here are some tips to help you prepare the mushrooms and cheese for this delicious filling:\n\n**Grilled Portobello Mushrooms:**\n\n1. **Choose the right mushrooms**: Look for large, fresh Portobello mushrooms with a firm texture and no signs of bruising or soft spots.\n2. **Clean and prep the mushrooms**: Gently wipe the mushrooms with a damp cloth to remove any dirt or debris. Remove the stems and gills, and slice the caps into 1/4-inch thick pieces.\n3. **Marinate the mushrooms**: In a bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1 minced garlic clove, and 1 teaspoon dried oregano. Add the mushroom slices and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.\n4. **Grill the mushrooms**: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the mushrooms from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Grill the mushrooms for 3-4 minutes per side, or until they're tender and slightly charred.\n5. **Season with salt and pepper**: Once grilled, season the mushrooms with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n**Oaxaca Cheese:**\n\n1. **Choose the right cheese**: Oaxaca cheese is a type of Mexican string cheese made from cow's milk. You can find it at most Latin American markets or some well-stocked supermarkets.\n2. **Slice the cheese**: Slice the Oaxaca cheese into thin strips or crumble it into small pieces.\n3. **Melt the cheese**: You can melt the cheese by placing it in a dry skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until it's smooth and creamy. Alternatively, you can microwave it for 10-15 seconds at a time, stirring between each interval, until melted and smooth.\n\n**Assembling the filling:**\n\n1. **Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms**: In a skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the grilled mushrooms and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes, until they're heated through.\n2. **Add the cheese**: Add the melted Oaxaca cheese to the skillet with the mushrooms. Stir until the cheese is well combined with the mushrooms.\n3. **Add some freshness**: Stir in some chopped cilantro, onion, or epazote to add a burst of freshness to the filling.\n4. **Season to taste**: Season the filling with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lime juice to taste.\n\nNow you're ready to fill your homemade tortillas with this delicious Grilled Portobello Mushroom and Oaxaca Cheese filling!\n\nDo you have any questions about the recipe or would you like some suggestions for other toppings or sides to pair with this filling?",
