Here are some suggestions to help you maintain your space:\n\n1. **Create a \"home\" for each item**: Assign a designated spot for each decorative object, book, or remote control. This will help keep clutter at bay and make it easier to find things when you need them.\n2. **Group similar items together**: Grouping similar items, like decorative objects or books, can create a sense of cohesion and make it easier to maintain. For example, you could group all your decorative vases together on one shelf or all your coffee table books in a neat stack.\n3. **Use a \"one in, one out\" policy**: To prevent clutter from building up, adopt a policy where you get rid of an old item every time you bring a new one into your living room. This will help maintain a balanced amount of possessions and prevent clutter from accumulating.\n4. **Schedule regular tidying sessions**: Set aside time each week (e.g., 10-15 minutes) to tidy up your living room. This can be as simple as straightening up the couch cushions, wiping down surfaces, or rearranging decorative objects.\n5. **Use storage containers**: Use decorative storage containers or baskets to corral small items like coasters, remotes, or magazines. This will keep them organized and out of sight.\n6. **Keep surfaces clear**: Try to keep surfaces like your coffee table, side tables, and shelves clear of clutter. This will create a sense of openness and make it easier to clean.\n7. **Consider a \"launching pad\"**: Designate a specific spot, like a tray or dish, as a \"launching pad\" for items that need to be dealt with, such as mail, keys, or remotes. This can help keep clutter at bay and make it easier to find what you need.\n8. **Make it a habit**: Tidying and organizing becomes a habit with practice. Try to make it a part of your daily or weekly routine, so it becomes second nature.\n\nFor your coffee table, consider these additional tips:\n\n1. **Use a coffee table with storage**: If possible, consider using a coffee table with built-in storage, like a storage ottoman or a table with a shelf underneath. This can help keep items like magazines, books, or games organized and out of sight.\n2. **Choose decorative objects wisely**: Select decorative objects that are easy to clean and maintain. Avoid fragile or delicate items that might be prone to breakage or dust accumulation.\n3. **Group decorative objects by theme**: Grouping decorative objects by theme, like vases, candles, or sculptures, can create a visually appealing display and make it easier to maintain.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you'll be able to maintain your living room's tidiness and organization, even with all the decorative objects on your coffee table.",
