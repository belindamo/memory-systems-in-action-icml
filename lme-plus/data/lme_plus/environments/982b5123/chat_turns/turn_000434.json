  "content": "Doctors diagnose celiac disease through a combination of medical history, physical examination, blood tests, and intestinal biopsy. \n\nMedical history: A doctor will ask about any symptoms that the patient is experiencing, as well as any family history of celiac disease or other autoimmune disorders.\n\nPhysical examination: The doctor may perform a physical exam to look for signs of malnutrition, such as thinning hair, bloated abdomen, and muscle wasting.\n\nBlood tests: Blood tests can help detect certain antibodies that are present in people with celiac disease. These tests include a specific test for antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA) and total serum IgA levels.\n\nIntestinal biopsy: A small sample of tissue is taken from the small intestine in a procedure called an endoscopy. The sample is then analyzed by a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease.\n\nThe primary treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet. This means avoiding foods that contain wheat, barley, and rye. It is important for individuals with celiac disease to read food labels carefully, as gluten can be hidden in many processed and packaged foods. Patients may also need to take vitamin and mineral supplements, as malabsorption caused by celiac disease can lead to deficiencies.\n\nComplications of untreated celiac disease can include malnutrition, iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, miscarriage, and certain cancers, such as lymphoma. It is important for individuals with celiac disease to follow a strict gluten-free diet in order to avoid these potential complications.",
