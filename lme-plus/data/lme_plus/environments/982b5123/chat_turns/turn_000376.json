It's easy to get caught up in the \"just in case\" mentality, but it's great that you're reflecting on your packing habits and identifying areas for improvement.\n\nLeaving the tablet behind might have been a good call, especially if you had your laptop and phone with you. Tablets are great for relaxation and reading, but they can be bulky and add weight to your luggage.\n\nFor your Seattle trip, consider this: if you don't need your laptop for work or other essential tasks, you might be able to get by with just your phone and a portable charger. This will not only lighten your load but also encourage you to be more present and enjoy the city without the distraction of multiple devices.\n\nRemember, it's all about striking a balance between staying connected and being mindful of your packing list. By prioritizing your must-haves and being intentional about what you bring, you'll be able to travel more efficiently and focus on enjoying your trip.\n\nNow, tell me more about your trip to Chicago last month! What were some of your favorite experiences or sights?",
