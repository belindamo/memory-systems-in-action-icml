But I can suggest a few options to help you find what you're looking for:\n\n1. **Walmart's Website:** You can check Walmart's website (walmart.com) for their current sales and promotions. They usually have a \"Weekly Ad\" or \"Rolling Back\" section that highlights their latest deals. You can also search for \"household essentials bundle\" or \"toilet paper and paper towels bundle\" to see if they have any relevant offers.\n2. **Walmart's App:** If you have the Walmart app, you can check their weekly ad, browse sales, and even build a shopping list. You can also use the app to find items in-store and check prices.\n3. **In-Store:** When you visit Walmart this weekend, you can check the household essentials aisle for any bundled deals or promotions. You can also ask a store associate if they have any sales or discounts on toilet paper and paper towels.\n\nRegarding the 20% off coupon, that's great that you were able to save on your entire purchase! However, as a digital AI assistant, I don't have access to your personal shopping history or coupon usage. But I'm always here to help you with any questions or shopping-related queries you may have!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
