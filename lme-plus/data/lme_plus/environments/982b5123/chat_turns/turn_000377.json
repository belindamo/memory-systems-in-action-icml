  "content": "I loved exploring Millennium Park and taking in the city's vibrant atmosphere. The architecture was amazing, and I enjoyed trying some of the local food, like deep-dish pizza. But, I have to say, lugging all those electronics around was a real hassle. I'm definitely going to be more mindful of what I pack for Seattle. Speaking of which, I was thinking of packing some snacks for the trip. Do you have any recommendations for non-perishable snacks that are easy to pack and won't make a mess?",
