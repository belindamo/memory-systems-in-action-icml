  "content": "Yes, there are a few more things you should be aware of if you have celiac disease. Here they are:\n\n1. Cross-contamination: Even small amounts of gluten can cause significant damage and trigger symptoms in individuals with celiac disease. Therefore, it is important to take precautions to avoid cross-contamination in the kitchen and when dining out. This includes using separate utensils, cookware, and cutting boards for gluten-free foods and avoiding shared kitchen surfaces.\n\n2. Osteoporosis and bone health: Celiac disease can lead to osteoporosis and other bone disorders, especially in those who have been undiagnosed for a long time. Following a gluten-free diet and taking supplements as needed can help to prevent bone loss and maintain bone health.\n\n3. Routine testing and follow-up: Regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider are essential to monitor for any potential complications of celiac disease. These may include repeat biopsy, blood tests, and monitoring of any additional health conditions that may develop over time.\n\n4. Gluten-free diet and nutritional needs: A gluten-free diet can be restrictive and limit the variety of foods available, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies if not properly managed. It is important to consult a registered dietitian to ensure that you are meeting your nutritional needs, especially for vitamins and minerals like iron, calcium, and vitamin D.\n\n5. Collaborating with healthcare professionals: Managing celiac disease can require the collaboration of multiple healthcare professionals, including primary care providers, gastroenterologists, dietitians, and mental health providers. Be sure to work with a team of healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about celiac disease and can provide comprehensive care.",
