Packing your own snacks is a great idea, especially when you're unsure about the availability of your favorite foods or have specific dietary needs. Here are some non-perishable, mess-free snack recommendations that are easy to pack:\n\n1. **Nuts and seeds**: Almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, or trail mix are all nutritious and filling.\n2. **Dried fruits**: Dried apricots, cranberries, or raisins are sweet and chewy.\n3. **Energy bars**: Look for compact, low-mess options like Clif Bars, granola bars, or protein bars.\n4. **Jerky**: Beef, turkey, or chicken jerky is a protein-packed snack that's easy to pack.\n5. **Crackers and peanut butter**: Individual packets of crackers and peanut butter are a satisfying snack.\n6. **Instant oatmeal**: Single-serve packets of oatmeal are a great breakfast or snack option.\n7. **Dark chocolate**: A few squares of dark chocolate can be a nice pick-me-up.\n8. **Tea or instant coffee**: If you're a coffee or tea lover, consider packing individual packets or a travel-sized coffee maker.\n\nRemember to pack your snacks in airtight containers or ziplock bags to keep them fresh and mess-free.\n\nFor Seattle, you might also consider packing some snacks that are specific to the Pacific Northwest, like dried cranberries or smoked salmon jerky.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any specific snack preferences or dietary restrictions I can help with?",
