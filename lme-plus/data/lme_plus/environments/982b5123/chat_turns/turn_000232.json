You can usually find this option in the subscription settings or preferences.\n2. **Look for \"Update Email\" or \"Change Email\" options**: In each subscription, search for an option to update your email address. This might be a button, link, or field where you can enter your new email address.\n3. **Enter your new email address and confirm**: Enter your new email address and confirm the change. You might receive a verification email to your new address to confirm the update.\n4. **Update your email address in your browser or email client**: If you use a browser extension or email client to manage your subscriptions, update your email address there as well.\n\n**Transferring Contacts:**\n\n1. **Export your contacts from your old email**: Log in to your old email account and export your contacts to a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file. The export option is usually found in the contacts or address book section.\n2. **Import contacts to your new email**: Log in to your new email account and import the CSV file you exported earlier. The import option is usually found in the contacts or address book section.\n3. **Update your contacts' email addresses**: Go through your contacts and update their email addresses to your new email address. You can do this manually or use a bulk update feature if available.\n\nSome additional tips:\n\n* Take your time and work through your subscriptions and contacts gradually to avoid missing any important updates.\n* Keep a record of the services and subscriptions you've updated, so you can refer back to it later.\n* If you're using a password manager, update your email address there as well to ensure you receive password reset emails and other important notifications.\n\nRemember, it's a process, and it might take some time to update everything. But with a clear plan, you'll get there!\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any other questions about transferring your email subscriptions and contacts?",
