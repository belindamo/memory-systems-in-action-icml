It's a great way to give them something tangible to open and enjoy, while still focusing on the experience as the main gift.\n\nHere are some ideas for small gifts that can complement the experience:\n\n1. **Theme-related item**: Get a small item that relates to the experience, such as a toy animal if you're gifting a zoo visit, or a mini art supply kit if you're gifting an art class.\n2. **Personalized item**: A personalized item, like a customized keychain, sticker, or magnet, with their name or initials can be a thoughtful addition to the experience.\n3. **Fun and games**: A small puzzle, a deck of cards, or a fun game can be a great way to keep them entertained before or after the experience.\n4. **Treats**: A bag of their favorite snack or a small treat, like a gift card to their favorite ice cream shop, can be a sweet addition to the experience.\n5. **Memory keeper**: A small journal or a scrapbook where they can record their memories of the experience can be a lovely way to encourage them to reflect on the fun they had.\n\nRemember to keep the small gift simple and inexpensive, as the focus should still be on the experience. You can also consider setting a budget for the small gift, like $5-10, to ensure it doesn't break the bank.\n\nHere are some examples of small gifts that might work well with different experiences:\n\n* For an amusement park visit: a small stuffed animal, a bag of candy, or a fun keychain\n* For an art class: a set of washable markers, a small art supply kit, or a fun sketchbook\n* For a sporting event: a team-themed sticker or magnet, a small foam finger, or a bag of popcorn\n\nI think it's a great idea to get a small gift to go along with the experience. It's a thoughtful touch that can add to the excitement and make the day even more special for your nieces and nephews!",
