  "content": "Shampoo and conditioner are essentials, indeed!\n\nAs for deals on shampoo and conditioner, Walmart often has sales and promotions on personal care items. However, I don't have real-time access to their current sales and promotions. But I can suggest a few options to help you find deals:\n\n1. **Walmart's Website:** Check Walmart's website for sales and promotions on shampoo and conditioner. You can filter by brand, price, and customer reviews.\n2. **Walmart App:** Use the Walmart app to browse sales and promotions on shampoo and conditioner. You can also use the app to check prices and find items in-store.\n3. **In-Store:** When you visit Walmart, check the personal care aisle for sales and promotions on shampoo and conditioner. You can also ask a store associate if they have any deals or discounts available.\n\nRegarding the 20% off coupon, that's great that you were able to use it on your entire purchase, including the household essentials! However, as a digital AI assistant, I don't have access to your personal shopping history or coupon usage. I'm here to provide general information and guidance, but I don't retain information about individual shoppers or their purchases.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
