Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros of a room with a separate living area:**\n\n1. **Extra space**: A separate living area provides more space for the kids to spread out, play, or relax, which can be a blessing when you need some downtime or want to enjoy a quiet moment.\n2. **Comfort**: A living area often comes with a sofa bed, which can be a comfortable spot for kids to lounge around or take a nap.\n3. **Privacy**: If you have older kids or need some alone time, a separate living area can provide a sense of privacy and separation from the bedroom.\n4. **Flexibility**: A living area can be used for multiple purposes, such as a play area, a reading nook, or even a makeshift office if you need to get some work done.\n\n**Cons of a room with a separate living area:**\n\n1. **Cost**: Rooms with separate living areas are often more expensive than standard rooms, which might stretch your budget.\n2. **Space constraints**: While a separate living area provides extra space, it might mean the bedroom area is smaller, which could be a trade-off to consider.\n\n**When to splurge on a room with a separate living area:**\n\n1. **Young children**: If you have very young children (under 5), a separate living area can be a lifesaver, as it provides a safe and comfortable space for them to play and relax.\n2. **Long stays**: If you're planning an extended stay in Waikiki (more than 5-7 days), a room with a separate living area can be a good investment, as it provides more space and comfort for the entire family.\n3. **Special needs**: If you have children with special needs or require extra space for equipment or therapy, a room with a separate living area can be essential.\n\n**When a standard room with two queen beds might be sufficient:**\n\n1. **Older kids**: If your kids are older (8-12+), they might not need as much space or attention, and a standard room with two queen beds could be sufficient.\n2. **Short stays**: If you're only staying in Waikiki for a few days, a standard room might be enough, as you'll likely be spending most of your time exploring the island rather than hanging out in the room.\n3. **Budget-friendly**: If budget is a significant concern, a standard room with two queen beds can be a more affordable option.\n\nIn Waikiki, some hotels offer rooms with separate living areas, such as:\n\n* **Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa**: Offers suites with separate living areas, including a sofa bed and a private balcony.\n* **Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort & Spa**: Features rooms with separate living areas, including a sofa bed and a private balcony with ocean views.\n* **The Modern Honolulu**: Offers suites with separate living areas, including a sofa bed and a private balcony with city or ocean views.\n\nUltimately, the decision to splurge on a room with a separate living area depends on your family's specific needs, budget, and preferences. If you can afford it and think the extra space will make a significant difference to your family's comfort and enjoyment, it might be worth the investment.",
