  "content": "I appreciate the detailed information on Elfa's weight capacity and heavy-duty options. I do have a lot of long, heavy items like winter coats and luggage, so I think I'll need to explore other shelving systems that can accommodate those items. But I'm still interested in customizable shelving, so I'll look into other brands that offer similar features. Thanks for the input! By the way, I also ended up buying a set of storage bins for my closet, which have been super helpful in keeping my clothes organized. Do you think I could use those bins in conjunction with a shelving system, or would that be overkill?",
