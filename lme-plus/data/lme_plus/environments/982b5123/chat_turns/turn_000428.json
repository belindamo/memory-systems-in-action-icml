In fact, caramelized onions and garlic are a classic combination in many Mexican dishes, including tacos and quesadillas.\n\nTo incorporate saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic into your filling, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic separately**: Before adding the mushrooms, saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic in a little oil until they're softened and fragrant. This will help bring out their natural sweetness and depth of flavor.\n2. **Use a mix of yellow and white onions**: Yellow onions will add a sweet, caramelized flavor, while white onions will provide a punch of freshness.\n3. **Don't overdo the garlic**: While garlic is a fundamental flavor component in many Mexican dishes, it's easy to overpower the other flavors. Start with 1-2 cloves and adjust to taste.\n4. **Add the mushrooms and cook until they're tender**: Once the onions and garlic are softened, add the marinated mushroom slices and cook until they're tender and lightly browned.\n5. **Integrate the Oaxaca cheese**: After the mushrooms are cooked, stir in the melted Oaxaca cheese, making sure it's well combined with the mushroom mixture.\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic will add a rich, savory flavor to your Grilled Portobello Mushroom and Oaxaca Cheese filling. The sweetness of the onions will balance out the earthiness of the mushrooms, while the garlic will tie everything together.\n\nSome other options to consider adding to your filling include:\n\n* A sprinkle of dried oregano or thyme for an herby flavor\n* A squeeze of fresh lime juice for brightness and acidity\n* A dash of smoked paprika for a smoky depth\n* Chopped fresh cilantro or scallions for a fresh, oniony flavor\n\nRemember, the key is to taste as you go and adjust the seasoning to your liking. Your filling should be a harmonious balance of flavors, with each component complementing the others.\n\nHow do you think you'll adjust the recipe to incorporate the saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic?",
