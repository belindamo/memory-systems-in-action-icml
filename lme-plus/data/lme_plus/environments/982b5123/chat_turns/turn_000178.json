It should have a tight-fitting lid and be able to withstand minor jolts and movements.\n2. **Cool the lasagna completely**: Before transporting, make sure the lasagna has cooled down completely to room temperature. This will help prevent it from sliding around in the container and reduce the risk of spills.\n3. **Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil**: Wrap the lasagna tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out and to keep it clean. You can also wrap it in a clean towel or cloth for extra protection.\n4. **Use a lasagna carrier or cake carrier**: If you have a lasagna carrier or cake carrier, use it! These carriers have a sturdy base and a removable top, making it easy to transport and serve your lasagna.\n5. **Keep it level and secure**: Place the lasagna container in a secure spot in your vehicle, such as the trunk or back seat, and make sure it's not at an angle. You can also place a non-slip mat or a towel under the container to prevent it from sliding around.\n6. **Drive carefully**: Drive carefully and avoid sudden stops or sharp turns to prevent the lasagna from shifting around in the container.\n7. **Serve from the container**: Consider serving the lasagna directly from the container to minimize handling and reduce the risk of mess.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to transport your vegan lasagna safely and without making a mess. \n\nRemember to also pack serving utensils, such as a serving spoon and spatula, and a cutting board if needed. You might also want to bring some extra napkins and paper towels, just in case.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your friends will love your delicious vegan lasagna!",
