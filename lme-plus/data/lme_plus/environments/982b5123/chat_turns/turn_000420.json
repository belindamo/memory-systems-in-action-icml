I was simply trying to provide a relatable scenario to help facilitate our conversation.\n\nHowever, I understand that many people do struggle with staying within their budget, especially during the holiday season. If you're looking to cut back or make adjustments to stay within your budget, here are some general tips that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Set a budget**: Determine how much you can afford to spend on gifts and stick to it.\n2. **Make a list**: Plan out your gifts in advance and prioritize your spending.\n3. **Consider DIY gifts**: Think about making your own gifts, like baked goods, photo albums, or handmade crafts.\n4. **Shop smart**: Look for discounts, sales, and promotions to get the most value for your money.\n5. **Gift experiences**: As we discussed earlier, gifting experiences can be a great way to create memories without breaking the bank.\n6. **Scale back**: If you need to cut back, consider scaling back on the number of gifts you give or the price point of each gift.\n7. **Get creative**: Think outside the box and come up with unique, thoughtful gifts that don't have to break the bank.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show your loved ones that you care, not how much money you spend.",
