You can find plenty of options on services like Audible, Scribd, or your local library's digital collection.\n2. **Music and sing-alongs**: Create a fun playlist with her favorite songs or introduce her to your own childhood favorites. Singing along can be a great way to bond and create memories.\n3. **Car games**: Play classic games like \"I Spy,\" \"20 Questions,\" or \"Would You Rather.\" You can also create a scavenger hunt list of items to spot on the road, like different types of cars or roadside attractions.\n4. **Travel-sized toys and puzzles**: Pack travel-friendly toys, like coloring books, sticker sheets, or small puzzles, to keep her hands busy and engaged.\n5. **Road trip bingo**: Create bingo cards with items she might see on the road, like cows, rest stops, or billboards. The first one to get five in a row wins!\n6. **Snack and drink challenges**: Prepare a special road trip snack box with surprise treats and have her guess the flavors or textures. You can also play \"Would You Rather\" with snacks, like \"Would you rather have a goldfish cracker or a pretzel?\"\n7. **Car-friendly movies**: Bring along a tablet or portable DVD player with her favorite movies or TV shows. Just be sure to bring headphones to keep the noise level down.\n8. **Pit stops**: Plan regular breaks at rest stops or parks to stretch her legs, get some fresh air, and run around. This can help break up the drive and make the trip feel less long.\n9. **Storytelling**: Encourage her to tell you stories or make up her own tales. You can take turns adding to the story, creating a fun and interactive experience.\n10. **Surprises**: Pack a few surprise gifts or activities, like a new toy or a special game, to keep things exciting and unpredictable.\n\nRemember to take breaks, stay patient, and enjoy the quality time with your niece.
