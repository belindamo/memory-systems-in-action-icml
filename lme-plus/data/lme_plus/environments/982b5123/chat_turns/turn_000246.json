The trip takes around 30-40 minutes, and the fare is approximately $9.65.\n2. **SuperShuttle**: This is a shared-ride van service that can take you from the airport to your Airbnb. You can book online in advance, and the fare is around $17-20 per person, depending on the location. The trip takes around 30-40 minutes, depending on traffic.\n3. **Taxis**: You can find taxi stands at the airport, and the fare to the city is around $40-50, depending on traffic.

The fare will depend on the time of day, traffic, and the type of vehicle you choose.
