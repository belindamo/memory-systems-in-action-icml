When it comes to cuisine options, you can't go wrong with the classics, but you may also want to consider including some other popular options to cater to diverse tastes. Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Classic options:**\n\n* Italian\n* Mexican\n* Indian\n* Chinese\n\n**Additional options:**\n\n* Vegan comfort food (e.g., vegan mac and cheese, vegan burgers)\n* Middle Eastern (e.g., falafel, shawarma, hummus)\n* Southeast Asian (e.g., Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian)\n* Mediterranean (e.g., Greek, Turkish, Lebanese)\n* Global bowls (e.g., Korean bibimbap, Japanese donburi, Ethiopian injera)\n\n**Other ideas:**\n\n* You could also include a \"Surprise me!\" or \"Other ( specify in comments)\" option to encourage members to share their unique preferences.\n* Consider adding a \"Seasonal/holiday-themed\" option, as people might be interested in recipes related to specific times of the year (e.g., Halloween, Christmas, Thanksgiving).\n\nRemember to keep your poll concise and easy to understand. You can always create a follow-up poll or ask for more specific feedback in the comments section.\n\nBy including a mix of classic and diverse options, you'll likely get a good sense of what your group is interested in, and you can use that feedback to share relevant recipes and content in the future. Good luck with your poll! \ud83d\udcca",
