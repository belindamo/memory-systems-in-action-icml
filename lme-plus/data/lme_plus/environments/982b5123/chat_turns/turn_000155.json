Each guided tour is unique and may focus on a different section of the collection or a specific theme.\n\nIf you could provide me with more details about the tour you attended, such as:\n\n* The title of the tour or the theme of the tour\n* The approximate date of the tour\n* Any specific artists or works that you remember seeing during the tour\n* Any distinctive features or characteristics of the artworks that stuck with you\n\nI can try to help you identify the artists and works that were featured in that specific section of the collection. Alternatively, you can also contact the Modern Art Museum directly and ask about the tour you attended. They may be able to provide you with more information about the artworks and artists that were featured.",
