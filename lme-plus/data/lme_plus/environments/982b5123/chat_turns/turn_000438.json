  "content": "Yes, celiac disease can cause neurological symptoms in some people. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, and the nervous system is not an exception. The antibodies produced by the immune system can sometimes attack the brain and the nervous system, leading to neurological symptoms. The most common neurological symptoms associated with celiac disease include:\n\n1. Migraines and headaches\n2. Peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in the hands and feet)\n3. Ataxia (loss of balance and coordination)\n4. Seizures\n5. Depression and anxiety\n\nThese symptoms can occur even if the individual with celiac disease is following a strict gluten-free diet. However, it is important to note that neurological symptoms are relatively rare in celiac disease, and most people with the condition do not experience them. In some cases, neurological symptoms may be the only presenting symptom of celiac disease, making proper diagnosis and treatment critical.",
