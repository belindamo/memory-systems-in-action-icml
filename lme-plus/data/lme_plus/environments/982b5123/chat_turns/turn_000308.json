Here's my recitation of the famous Langston Hughes poem, \"Dreams\":\n\nHold fast to dreams\nFor if dreams die\nLife is a broken-winged bird\nThat cannot fly.\n\nHold fast to dreams\nFor when dreams go\nLife is a barren field\nFrozen with snow.\n\nI hope you enjoyed that recitation of \"Dreams\" by Langston Hughes!",
