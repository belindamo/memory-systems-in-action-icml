It is designed to handle specific types of workloads such as dev/test environments, high-performance computing scenarios, batch processing jobs, big data, analytics, container-based and large-scale stateless applications [[1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines/spot/)].\n\nNote that the use of a Spot VM is subject to capacity availability and can be evicted at any time by the cloud provider with a 30-second notice when more capacity is needed [[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/spot-vms)]. Despite this limitation, using a Spot VM can provide significant discounts compared to other virtual machine instances [[3](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/spot)]."
