      "content": "Thank you for providing the necessary information! Based on your data, here's an analysis of your recent performance on each platform:\n\n**Instagram:**\n\n* **Engagement rate:** Your average engagement rate is around 2.5% (calculated by adding up all likes and comments and dividing by the total number of followers). This is a relatively good engagement rate, indicating that your content is resonating with your audience.\n* **Content performance:** Photos seem to perform better than stories, with an average of 35 likes per photo post compared to 20-40 views per story. This might be because photos are more discoverable and stay on your profile longer, whereas stories disappear after 24 hours.\n* **Hashtag usage:** You mentioned using hashtags occasionally, but it's not clear how effective they are. Consider using a consistent set of relevant hashtags to increase discoverability and reach a broader audience.\n* **Posting frequency:** Your posting frequency of 3-4 times a week is good, but you might consider experimenting with different frequencies to see what works best for your audience.\n* **Recommendations:**\n\t+ Experiment with Instagram's features like IGTV, Reels, or Instagram Live to diversify your content and increase engagement.\n\t+ Use Instagram Insights to track your account's performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\t+ Consider collaborating with friends or like-minded individuals to reach a broader audience.\n\n**Facebook:**\n\n* **Engagement rate:** Your average engagement rate is around 1.5% (calculated by adding up all likes and comments and dividing by the total number of followers). This is a relatively low engagement rate, indicating that your content might not be resonating as well with your audience.\n* **Content performance:** Links seem to perform better than photos, with an average of 25 likes and 5 comments compared to 15 likes and 2 shares. This might be because links are more attention-grabbing and encourage discussion.\n* **Posting frequency:** Your posting frequency of 1-2 times a week is relatively low, which might contribute to the lower engagement rate. Consider increasing your posting frequency to keep your audience engaged.\n* **Recommendations:**\n\t+ Experiment with different content types, such as videos or Facebook Live, to increase engagement.\n\t+ Use Facebook Groups to engage with your audience and encourage discussion.\n\t+ Consider running a Facebook Ad campaign to increase your reach and engagement.\n\n**Twitter:**\n\n* **Engagement rate:** Unfortunately, you didn't provide enough data for me to calculate your engagement rate. However, I can offer some general insights.\n* **Content performance:** Links seem to be your primary content type, which is suitable for Twitter's fast-paced and news-oriented platform.\n* **Posting frequency:** You didn't provide a posting frequency, but it's generally recommended to tweet at least 5-10 times a week to keep your audience engaged.\n* **Recommendations:**\n\t+ Use Twitter Chats and hashtags to participate in relevant conversations and increase your reach.\n\t+ Experiment with Twitter Polls, GIFs, or videos to diversify your content and increase engagement.\n\t+ Consider using Twitter Analytics to track your account's performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\nOverall, it seems like you're doing a good job on Instagram, but there's room for improvement on Facebook and Twitter. Focus on experimenting with different content types, increasing your posting frequency, and engaging with your audience to boost your performance on all three platforms."
