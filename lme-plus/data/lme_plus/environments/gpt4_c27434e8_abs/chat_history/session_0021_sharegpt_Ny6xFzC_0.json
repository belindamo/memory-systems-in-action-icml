      "content": "Ok, now combine the two. We are launching a similar meal kit service for the Hong Kong market. Hong Kongers are primarily used to Cantonese style home cooked meals, but can also be adventurous eaters due to the international influences. Some of the most iconic dishes in Hong Kong are actually \"fusion\" \u8336\u9910\u5ef3 dishes before fusion was cool.\n\nLike the western counterparts, we want this service to focus on quick and easy meals, with (sometimes simplified versions) of the everyday staples, but also encourages the customers to explore new and interesting techniques, flavors, ingredients and twists. \n\nThe dishes should be quick and easy to prepare, with few enough steps that can fit on a recipe card that can be followed even by relatively inexperienced home cooks. It should also work with ingredients that can be shipped in an ice box. With that in mind, create 15 dishes that fits everything we talked about. Use Chinese names for the dishes.3 / 3"
