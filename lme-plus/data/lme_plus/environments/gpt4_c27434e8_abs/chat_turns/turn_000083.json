  "content": "The sovereignty of Western Sahara is disputed between Morocco and the Polisario Front, a national liberation movement that seeks self-determination for the Sahrawi people. Morocco administers much of Western Sahara as its southern provinces, while the Polisario Front maintains control over a portion of the territory east of the Moroccan wall, which is a military fortification that separates the two sides. The United Nations continues to seek a peaceful resolution to the dispute and supports a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara.",
