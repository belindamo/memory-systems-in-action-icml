These oils help freshen breath, reduce plaque, and soothe gums.\n2. **Herbal Extracts:** Herbs like sage, chamomile, and calendula are used for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, helping to reduce gum inflammation and combat bad breath.\n3. **Aloe Vera:** Aloe vera is a natural soothing agent that helps reduce inflammation, heal mouth sores, and moisturize the mouth.\n4. **Vitamin C:** Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy gum tissue.\n5. **Xylitol:** Xylitol is a natural sweetener that prevents the growth of bacteria and helps reduce plaque.\n6. **Potassium Sorbate:** A natural preservative that helps extend the shelf life of the product while being gentle on the mouth.\n7. **Sea Salt:** Some mouthwashes use sea salt to help reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and promote healthy gum tissue.\n\n**Comparison to Traditional Mouthwashes:**\n\nTraditional mouthwashes often contain harsh chemicals like:\n\n1. **Alcohol:** Can dry out the mouth, reduce saliva production, and irritate the mouth and throat.\n2. **Chlorhexidine:** An antibacterial agent that can stain teeth, alter taste, and affect the oral microbiome.\n3. **Artificial Sweeteners:** Like aspartame and sucralose, which can be harmful to overall health and contribute to an imbalance of gut bacteria.\n4. **Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS):** A foaming agent that can irritate the mouth, skin, and eyes.\n5. **Triclosan:** An antibacterial agent that's been linked to hormone disruption and antibiotic resistance.\n\nIn contrast, eco-friendly mouthwashes use natural ingredients that are gentle on the mouth and environment. These ingredients work together to:\n\n* Reduce plaque and gingivitis\n* Freshen breath\n* Soothe and calm the mouth\n* Promote healthy gum tissue\n* Support the oral microbiome\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\n1. **Gentle on the mouth:** Natural ingredients are less likely to irritate the mouth, making them suitable for sensitive teeth and gums.\n2. **Environmentally friendly:** Eco-friendly mouthwashes reduce the amount of harsh chemicals entering waterways and soil.\n3. **Promotes oral health:** Natural ingredients work together to support the oral microbiome and promote healthy gum tissue.\n4. **Fewer artificial additives:** Eco-friendly mouthwashes often have fewer artificial sweeteners, flavors, and dyes, making them a better option for those with sensitivities.\n\nWhen choosing a mouthwash, consider your personal needs and preferences. If you're looking for a more natural, gentle, and environmentally friendly option, eco-friendly mouthwashes are a great choice. Always read labels and consult with your dentist or healthcare provider if you have specific concerns.",
