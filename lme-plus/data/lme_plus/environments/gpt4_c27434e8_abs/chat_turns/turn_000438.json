Here are some tips:\n\n1. **Airtight Containers**: Store sumac and paprika in airtight containers, such as glass jars or spice bottles with tight-fitting lids. This will prevent air, light, and moisture from affecting the spices.\n2. **Cool, Dark Place**: Keep the containers in a cool, dark place, like a pantry or cupboard away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Sumac and paprika can lose their flavor and aroma when exposed to heat, light, or moisture.\n3. **Room Temperature**: Store the spices at room temperature (around 68\u00b0F to 72\u00b0F or 20\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C). Avoid storing them near ovens, stoves, or refrigerators, which can generate heat and moisture.\n4. **Keep Them Dry**: Make sure the containers are completely dry before adding the spices. Any moisture can cause the spices to clump or lose their flavor.\n5. **Use Within a Reasonable Timeframe**: Sumac and paprika can retain their flavor and aroma for about 6 months to 1 year when stored properly. Try to use them within this timeframe for optimal flavor.\n6. **Freezing**: If you won't be using the spices within the recommended timeframe, consider freezing them. Simply transfer the spices to an airtight container or freezer bag, press out as much air as possible, and store them in the freezer. Frozen spices can last for up to 2 years.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* When handling sumac, be gentle to avoid crushing the berries, which can cause them to lose their flavor and aroma.\n* If you notice any changes in the color, aroma, or flavor of the spices, it's best to replace them.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you'll be able to enjoy the vibrant flavor and aroma of sumac and paprika in your cooking for a longer period.\n\nEnjoy your roasted vegetables with sumac, one-pot pasta, and salad tonight!",
