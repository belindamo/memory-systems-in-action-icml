  "content": "Although consuming rotting flesh may contain bacteria and toxins that would be harmful to other animals, vultures have an extremely acidic stomach that kills most of the bacteria and neutralizes harmful toxins. In addition, their immune systems have also evolved to tolerate pathogens that would cause illness or death in other animals. Furthermore, vultures are highly resistant to diseases and infections that are associated with consuming rotting flesh. Therefore, the risk of harm to their health from consuming rotting flesh is relatively low compared to other animals that are not adapted to this type of diet.",
