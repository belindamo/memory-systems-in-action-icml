I think you'll find that the artists I mentioned share a similar vibe with Billie Eilish's darker, edgier sound.\n\nAnd yes, I'm familiar with the music video for \"Bad Guy\"! It's indeed a stunning visual feast, and Billie Eilish's creativity and boundary-pushing approach to her art are truly inspiring. The video's blend of dark humor, striking visuals, and mind-bending choreography is a perfect reflection of her music's edgy, avant-garde spirit.\n\nBillie Eilish is definitely one of the most exciting and innovative young artists out there, and it's great to see her pushing the boundaries of what's possible in music and music videos. Her willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas is a big part of her appeal, and I think she's inspiring a whole new generation of artists and fans to think outside the box and challenge the status quo.\n\nWhat do you think it is about Billie Eilish's music and aesthetic that resonates with you? Is there something specific that draws you to her sound and style?",
