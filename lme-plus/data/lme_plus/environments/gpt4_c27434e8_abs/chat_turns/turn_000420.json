You're taking the right steps by setting up a separate breeding tank and researching the best techniques and tank conditions.\n\n**Breeding platies: A great learning experience**\n\nBreeding platies can help you gain valuable knowledge about the reproductive cycle of fish, and it's an excellent way to develop your skills in aquarium keeping. Platies are one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, and they're relatively easy to breed, making them a great choice for beginners.\n\n**Tips for successful platy breeding:**\n\n1. **Choose healthy stock:** Select healthy, disease-free platies with desirable traits, such as vibrant colors, finnage, and body shape.\n2. **Provide optimal tank conditions:** Maintain a separate breeding tank with stable water parameters, plenty of hiding places, and a temperature range of 72\u00b0F to 82\u00b0F (22\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C).\n3. **Sexing platies:** Learn to sex your platies accurately, as males have a modified anal fin called a gonopodium, which is used for fertilization.\n4. **Conditioning:** Feed your platies a varied, nutrient-rich diet to promote good health and fertility.\n5. **Spawning:** Introduce a ratio of 1 male to 2-3 females to the breeding tank. Monitor the tank for spawning, which usually occurs in the morning.\n6. **Egg collection:** Use a spawning grate or a separate container to collect the eggs, which will help prevent the parents from eating them.\n7. **Incubation:** Incubate the eggs in a separate container with water from the breeding tank, maintaining a temperature of around 78\u00b0F (25\u00b0C).\n8. **Rearing the fry:** After hatching, feed the fry infusoria or a commercial fry food, and provide plenty of hiding places and water changes.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Breeding platies can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process.\n* Be prepared to deal with unexpected challenges, such as disease outbreaks or poor water quality.\n* Research local laws and regulations regarding the breeding and sale of aquarium fish.\n\nBy following these tips and guidelines, you'll be well on your way to successfully breeding platies. Good luck, and I hope you'll share your experiences and progress with me!\n\nDo you have any specific questions about platy breeding or the breeding process?",
