While the format shouldn't affect the story itself, it can influence the reading experience. Here are some possible ways:\n\n1. **Immediacy:** E-books can make it easier to devour a book quickly, as you did with \"The Silent Patient\". You can carry your book with you everywhere, and it's easy to sneak in a few pages whenever you have a spare moment.\n2. **Distractions:** On the other hand, e-books can be distracting, especially if you're reading on a device with notifications, social media, or email alerts. This might break your focus and make it harder to fully immerse yourself in the story.\n3. **Atmosphere and immersion:** Physical books can create a more immersive experience, especially for psychological thrillers. The tactile feel of the paper, the sound of turning pages, and the visual cues of the book's design can all contribute to a more intense, atmospheric reading experience. E-books might make it harder to fully absorb the atmosphere and tension.\n4. **Note-taking and referencing:** If you're someone who likes to take notes, highlight passages, or flip back to previous sections, e-books can make it easier to do so. However, some readers might find it more difficult to navigate and reference specific parts of the book in an e-book format.\n5. **Discussion and sharing:** As you mentioned, your book club read \"The Silent Patient\" as an e-book. This can make it easier to share notes, quotes, and discussions within the group, especially if you're all reading digitally. However, you might miss out on the tactile experience of passing physical copies around and discussing the book's design, cover art, or other physical aspects.\n\nUltimately, the format of the book shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the story itself. But it's interesting to consider how the medium might influence your reading experience. Did you find that reading \"The Silent Patient\" as an e-book affected your experience in any way?",
