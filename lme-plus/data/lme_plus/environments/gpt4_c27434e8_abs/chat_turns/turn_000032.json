We ask for your forgiveness and understanding, and seek to restore the balance and harmony that once existed between our tribe and your powerful spirit.\n\nWe offer these gifts of food and drink to honor and appease you, and ask that you look favorably upon our tribe once again. We recognize the power and wisdom that you bring to our lives, and we pledge to honor your spirit in all that we do.\n\nMay our spirits be aligned with yours, and may our tribe be protected and guided by your powerful presence. We ask for your continued blessings and protection, and we thank you for your wisdom and guidance.\n\nO great Mammoth spirit, we offer these gifts and prayers to you with utmost reverence and respect. May our spirits be at peace, and may the bond between our tribe and your powerful spirit be forever strong. Amen.",
