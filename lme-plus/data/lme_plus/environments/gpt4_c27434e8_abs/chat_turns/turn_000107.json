  "content": "Here are some examples and code snippets for the statistical techniques commonly used in acquisition/risk management, customer retention, and customer segmentation initiatives:\n\nAcquisition/Risk Management:\n\n1. Logistic Regression\n\nLogistic regression is a statistical technique used to model the probability of a binary outcome, such as whether a customer will default on a loan or not. In Python, you can use scikit-learn to build a logistic regression model. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load data\ndata = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')\n\n# Create X and y arrays\nX = data[['credit_score', 'debt_to_income_ratio', 'income']]\ny = data['default']\n\n# Split data into training and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n\n# Create logistic regression model\nmodel = LogisticRegression()\n\n# Train model on training set\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict on test set\npredictions = model.predict(X_test)\n```\n1. Decision Trees\n\nDecision trees are a statistical technique used to model decisions and outcomes. In acquisition/risk management, decision trees can be used to identify patterns and relationships between customer characteristics and the likelihood of default. Here's an example code in Python using scikit-learn:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load data\ndata = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')\n\n# Create X and y arrays\nX = data[['credit_score', 'debt_to_income_ratio', 'income']]\ny = data['default']\n\n# Split data into training and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n\n# Create decision tree model\nmodel = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n\n# Train model on training set\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict on test set\npredictions = model.predict(X_test)\n```\n1. Random Forest\n\nRandom forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of predictions. Here's an example code in Python using scikit-learn:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load data\ndata = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')\n\n# Create X and y arrays\nX = data[['credit_score', 'debt_to_income_ratio', 'income']]\ny = data['default']\n\n# Split data into training and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n\n# Create random forest model with 100 trees\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\n\n# Train model on training set\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict on test set\npredictions = model.predict(X_test)\n```\nCustomer Retention:\n\n1. Survival Analysis\n\nSurvival analysis is a statistical technique used to model the probability of customer churn over time. In Python, you can use the lifelines library to perform survival analysis. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load data\ndata = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')\n\n# Create Kaplan-Meier estimator\nkmf = KaplanMeierFitter()\n\n# Fit model\nkmf.fit(data['tenure'], event_observed=data['churn'])\n\n# Plot survival curve\nkmf.plot()\n```",
