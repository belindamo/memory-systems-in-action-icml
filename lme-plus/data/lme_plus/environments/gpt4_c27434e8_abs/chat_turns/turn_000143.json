Did you wear the necklace with any other jewelry, like earrings or a watch?\n5. Was the silver necklace a new addition to your collection, or is it a piece you've worn frequently before?\n\nThink back to that day and see if any other details come to mind. Sometimes, recalling small details can help trigger your memory and help you remember the exact day you wore the necklace.\n\nAlso, since you got a lot of compliments on the necklace, you might want to consider making it a regular part of your workday rotation.
