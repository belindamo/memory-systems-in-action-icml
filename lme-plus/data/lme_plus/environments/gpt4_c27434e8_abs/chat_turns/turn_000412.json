Algae growth is a common issue in aquariums, but with a few adjustments, you can get it under control. Here are some tips to help you tackle the algae in your 20-gallon freshwater community tank:\n\n1. **Monitor and adjust your lighting**: Algae growth is often triggered by excessive lighting. Consider reducing the duration or intensity of your lighting. If you're using a timer, try reducing the lighting period by 30 minutes to an hour. You can also switch to lower-wattage bulbs or LED lights, which produce less heat and are less conducive to algae growth.\n2. **Check your water parameters**: While you've done a recent water change, it's essential to ensure your water parameters are in balance. Test your water for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels. High levels of these substances can contribute to algae growth. You can use a water test kit to monitor these parameters.\n3. **Increase water circulation**: Poor water circulation can lead to stagnant areas where algae can thrive. Make sure your powerheads or filters are creating sufficient water movement. You can also add a powerhead or adjust the direction of your filter outlets to improve circulation.\n4. **Maintain good water flow around plants**: If you have live plants, ensure they're not overcrowded or obstructing water flow. Prune or thin out plants to promote healthy growth and prevent algae from forming on their leaves.\n5. **Reduce nutrient availability**: Algae feed on excess nutrients in the water, such as phosphates, nitrates, and carbon dioxide. Consider using a phosphate remover or a product that helps control algae growth by reducing these nutrients.\n6. **Introduce algae-controlling organisms**: Some species, like Amano shrimp, Nerite snails, or Otocinclus catfish, are known to feed on algae. Adding these to your tank can help control algae growth.\n7. **Avoid overfeeding**: Excess food can contribute to algae growth. Monitor your fish's food intake and adjust your feeding schedule accordingly. Consider using a high-quality flake or pellet food that's designed to reduce waste.\n8. **Clean your filter media**: Regularly clean your filter media to prevent the buildup of debris and excess nutrients, which can contribute to algae growth.\n9. **Consider a UV sterilizer**: UV sterilizers can help control algae growth by killing algae cells and preventing them from reproducing.\n10. **Be patient**: It may take some time to get your algae under control. Be consistent with your water changes, cleaning, and monitoring, and you should start to see improvements over time.\n\nRemember, prevention is key. By maintaining good tank hygiene, monitoring your water parameters, and making adjustments as needed, you can reduce the likelihood of algae growth in the future.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns about your tank or the algae issue, feel free to ask!",
