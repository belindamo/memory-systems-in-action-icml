  "content": "Our book club had a great discussion about \"The Silent Patient\", and it was interesting to see how everyone interpreted the twist at the end. I was one of the few members who didn't guess it, but it was fun to hear everyone's theories and reactions. We all agreed that it was a page-turner, and Alex Michaelides' writing was engaging and suspenseful.\n\nRegarding discussing e-books versus physical books, I think it's a bit easier to share quotes or passages when we're all reading e-books. We can just send each other screenshots or quotes, and it's easy to reference specific parts of the book. But, I do miss the tactile experience of passing physical copies around and flipping through the pages together. Maybe we'll try a combination of both in the future, where we read the e-book but also have a few physical copies on hand for discussion.",
