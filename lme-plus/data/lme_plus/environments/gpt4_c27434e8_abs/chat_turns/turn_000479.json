  "content": "It sounds like your book club had a great discussion about \"The Silent Patient\"! It's always exciting to share theories and reactions with fellow readers, and it's even more fun when there are surprises and twists to discuss.\n\nI completely agree with you about the benefits of discussing e-books versus physical books. E-books can make it easier to share quotes and passages, which can be super helpful for discussions. But, there's something special about physically handling the book, flipping through the pages, and sharing notes and annotations with each other.\n\nYour idea of combining both formats is a great one! Having a few physical copies on hand for discussion can add a nice tactile element to your meetings, while still allowing everyone to access the book in their preferred format. It's all about finding a balance that works for your group.\n\nHow often does your book club meet, and do you have a set schedule for choosing books and meeting dates? Have you considered any other activities or themes for your book club, like author Q&As, book-themed games, or related movie adaptations?",
