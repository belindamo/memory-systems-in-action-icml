  "content": "We typically meet once a month, and we usually choose our next book a few weeks in advance. We like to mix it up and try different genres and authors, but we tend to stick to fiction and sometimes non-fiction books that have a strong narrative or storytelling element.\n\nWe've thought about doing author Q&As or book-themed games, but we haven't tried it yet. We did have a movie adaptation screening once, where we watched the movie version of a book we'd read, and it was a lot of fun. We might do that again in the future.\n\nI think it's time to suggest some new ideas to the group, though. Do you have any suggestions for book club activities or themes that might be fun to try?",
