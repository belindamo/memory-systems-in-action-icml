However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't provide specific recommendations for local framing services.\n\nInstead, I can offer some suggestions on how to find a good framer in your area:\n\n1. **Online Review Sites**: Check review websites like Yelp, Google Reviews, or Angie's List to find highly-rated framing services in your area. Filter the results by rating, distance, and services offered.\n2. **Ask for Referrals**: Reach out to friends, family, or coworkers who have recently had a piece framed and ask for their recommendations.\n3. **Professional Associations**: Look for framers who are members of professional organizations like the Professional Picture Framers Association (PPFA) or the National Framers Association (NFA). These organizations have a directory of certified framers in your area.\n4. **Check Social Media**: Look up local framing businesses on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram to see their work, read reviews, and get a sense of their style and expertise.\n5. **Visit Local Art Supply Stores**: Art supply stores often have relationships with local framers and can provide recommendations.\n\nWhen selecting a framer, make sure to:\n\n* Check their experience with framing similar pieces (e.g., oil paintings, watercolors, etc.)\n* Ask about their materials and techniques used\n* Get quotes from multiple framers to compare prices and services\n* Inspect their workshop or storefront to ensure they have a clean and organized workspace\n\nRemember to provide the framer with information about the painting's value and any special requirements, such as conservation-grade materials or UV-filtering glass.\n\nGood luck finding the perfect framer for your new piece!",
