  "content": "Vultures have a keen sense of smell and are able to detect chemicals produced during the decomposition of organic matter. They are able to identify the odor of a fresh carcass from a distance up to a mile away. They are also able to detect the presence of bacteria and other microorganisms that are associated with rotting flesh. Additionally, vultures can visually determine the freshness of a carcass by looking for the signs of decay such as discoloration, bloating, and the presence of maggots. Overall, vultures use a combination of their sense of smell and vision to distinguish between fresh and rotting carcasses.",
