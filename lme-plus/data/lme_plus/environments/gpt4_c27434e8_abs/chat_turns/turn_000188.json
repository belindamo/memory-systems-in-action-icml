  "content": "Introduction:\nDigitalization refers to the use of digital technologies and platforms to enhance, simplify and automate processes, activities and services in various fields, including taxation. The provision of technologies for digitalization of tax administration in Sub-Saharan Africa has been a topic of interest in recent years. This review seeks to explore the impacts, benefits, challenges, and promises of digital technologies in enhancing tax collection and administration in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nImpacts of Digitalization on Tax Administration in Sub-Saharan Africa:\nSeveral studies have shown that digital technologies have had a positive impact on tax administration in Sub-Saharan Africa. Okunogbe and Santoro (2023) suggested that the use of information technology (IT) has the potential to increase tax collection and improve revenue mobilization in African countries. They argued that the adoption of digital platforms and technologies could enhance tax compliance, simplify tax procedures, and reduce the cost of tax administration. In a similar vein, Bernad et al. (2023) highlighted the potential of digital merchant payments as a medium of tax compliance, which could reduce the incidence of tax evasion and boost tax collection.\n\nChallenges and Limitations of Digitalization:\nWhile digitalization presents numerous benefits for tax administration, there are also challenges and limitations that must be addressed. Bakibinga-Gaswaga et al. (2020) identified policy gaps, inadequate infrastructure, limited access to digital technologies, and lack of digital literacy as major challenges facing the adoption of digital technologies in Africa. Similarly, Iddrisu (2023) noted that digitalization could exacerbate inequality and exclusion if not well-implemented. In the same vein, Nguimkeu and Okou (2021) highlighted the challenges of integrating informal sector players into digital platforms, as they lack formal identification and access to digital platforms.\n\nPromises and Opportunities of Digitalization:\nDigitalization presents numerous promises and opportunities for tax administration in Sub-Saharan Africa. It offers the potential to enhance tax compliance, reduce tax evasion, simplify tax procedures, and improve revenue mobilization. Nguimkeu and Okou (2021) suggested that digital technologies could help formalize the informal sector, boost productivity, and increase tax revenue in Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, Arthur et al. (2021) noted that the adoption of digital platforms could enhance revenue mobilization from the digital economy in post-COVID-19 Africa.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the provision of technologies for digitalization of tax administration in Sub-Saharan Africa presents numerous opportunities, challenges, and promises. The adoption of digital platforms and technologies could enhance tax compliance, reduce tax evasion, simplify tax procedures, and improve revenue mobilization. However, there are also challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, policy gaps, limited access to digital technologies, and lack of digital literacy that must be addressed. Policymakers should prioritize the provision of digital technologies, while also ensuring equitable access and addressing the challenges and limitations of digitalization.\n\nReferences:\nArthur, P., Hanson, K.
