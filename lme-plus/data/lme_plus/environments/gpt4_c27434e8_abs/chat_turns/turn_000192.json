  "content": "Certainly. One example of how member states worked together to resolve a crisis in the past is the case of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014.\n\nDuring the outbreak, the UN coordinated a response involving a number of member states, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and China, among others. These member states provided various resources, including financial aid, medical supplies, and personnel, to help avert a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nThe UN also facilitated communication between affected countries to coordinate efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. Member states played a key role in this communication and provided expertise in areas such as disaster response, epidemiology, and public health.\n\nThrough a coordinated effort, the outbreak was eventually brought under control, and the UN and its member states were credited with playing a key role in preventing a much larger crisis.\n\nThis is just one example of how the involvement of various member states within the UN can contribute to the resolution or ongoing management of a crisis.",
