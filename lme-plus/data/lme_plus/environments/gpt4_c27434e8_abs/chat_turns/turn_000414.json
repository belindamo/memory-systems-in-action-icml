Nitrates are a primary nutrient source for algae, and even small increases can fuel their growth. While nitrate levels within safe ranges are generally considered acceptable, excessive levels can still promote algae growth.\n\nIn a well-established tank like yours, it's not uncommon to see a slight increase in nitrate levels over time. This can be due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. **Biological processes**: Nitrifying bacteria convert ammonia and nitrite into nitrate, which can accumulate in the tank water.\n2. **Decaying organic matter**: Food waste, fish waste, and plant decay can release nitrogen compounds, which are then converted into nitrates.\n3. **Overfeeding**: Excess food can lead to increased ammonia production, which is then converted into nitrate.\n\nTo address the nitrate issue and combat algae growth, consider the following adjustments:\n\n1. **Increase water change frequency or volume**: Since you're already doing bi-weekly water changes, you could try increasing the frequency to weekly or alternating between 25% and 50% water changes every other week.\n2. **Optimize your filter media**: Make sure your filter media is properly maintained and replaced as needed. Some filter media, like activated carbon, can help reduce nitrate levels.\n3. **Reduce feeding**: Review your feeding schedule and adjust as necessary to prevent overfeeding. Consider using a high-quality food that's designed to reduce waste and minimize nutrient release.\n4. **Add nitrate-absorbing media**: You can add media specifically designed to absorb nitrates, such as nitrate-absorbing resins or live rock. These can help reduce nitrate levels and mitigate algae growth.\n5. **Monitor your tank's biological load**: Ensure your tank is not overcrowded, as this can lead to increased waste production and nitrate accumulation.\n\nBy addressing the nitrate issue, you should see an improvement in algae growth. Remember to continue monitoring your water parameters and making adjustments as needed to maintain a balanced and healthy environment for your fish.\n\nHow do you think you'll approach addressing the nitrate issue? Do you have any questions about the suggestions I provided?",
