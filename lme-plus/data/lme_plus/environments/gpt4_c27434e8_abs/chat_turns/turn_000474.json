  "content": "I think I preferred reading \"The Silent Patient\" as an e-book because I could easily adjust the font size and brightness, which made it more comfortable to read during my daily commute. But I do agree that physical books can create a more immersive experience, and I'm trying to make more time for e-book reading. By the way, have you got any recommendations for romance novels with great narrators? I've recently discovered Julia Whelan, and I love her voice.",
