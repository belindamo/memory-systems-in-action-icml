You can sign up for their newsletters or follow their social media accounts to stay informed.\n2. **Outdoor gear retailers:** Visit online retailers like REI, Moosejaw, Backcountry, or CampSaver, which often offer discounts, sales, or price matching. These retailers may also have loyalty programs or rewards that can help you save.\n3. **Deal websites and forums:** Keep an eye on deal websites like Steep and Cheap, GearTrade, or Slickdeals, which aggregate discounts and sales on outdoor gear. You can also check outdoor enthusiast forums, like Reddit's r/hiking or r/outdoorgear, where users often share deals and discounts.\n4. **Discount codes and coupons:** Look for discount codes or coupons on websites like RetailMeNot or Coupons.com. You can also use browser extensions like Honey or CamelCamelCamel to find and apply discounts at checkout.\n5. **Clearance sections:** Check the clearance sections of outdoor gear retailers or manufacturers' websites for discounted prices on last season's models or discontinued products.\n6. **Price comparison:** Use price comparison tools like Google Shopping, PriceGrabber, or Nextag to find the best prices across different retailers.\n\nAs of now, I couldn't find any specific deals or discounts on the exact models you're interested in. However, I recommend checking the retailers' websites or signing up for their newsletters to stay informed about any upcoming sales or promotions.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to try on boots before buying, even if you find a great deal online. A comfortable fit is essential for a enjoyable hiking experience!",
