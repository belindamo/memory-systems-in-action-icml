  "content": "Roasted sweet potatoes with sumac and paprika sound delicious! Choosing the right sweet potatoes can make a big difference in the final result. Here are some tips to help you select the perfect sweet potatoes for roasting:\n\n1. **Look for firm, smooth skin**: Avoid sweet potatoes with soft spots, wrinkles, or cracks, as they may be old or damaged. Opt for ones with firm, smooth skin that's free of blemishes.\n2. **Choose the right variety**: For roasting, you want sweet potatoes that are high in starch, like Russet or Idaho potatoes. These will yield a crispy outside and a fluffy inside. Avoid sweet potatoes like Yukon Gold or red potatoes, which are better suited for boiling or mashing.\n3. **Select sweet potatoes of similar size**: To ensure even roasting, choose sweet potatoes that are similar in size. This way, they'll cook at a similar rate and be done at the same time.\n4. **Avoid sweet potatoes that are too large**: While it might be tempting to choose large sweet potatoes, they can be difficult to roast evenly. Opt for smaller to medium-sized sweet potatoes, about 1-2 pounds each.\n5. **Check the color**: Sweet potatoes can range in color from white to yellow to purple. For roasting, look for sweet potatoes with a deep yellow or orange color, as they'll have a sweeter, nuttier flavor.\n6. **Store them properly**: Once you've chosen your sweet potatoes, store them in a cool, dark place with good ventilation. Don't wash them before storing, as excess moisture can cause them to rot.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to select sweet potatoes that are perfect for roasting. Remember to cut them into wedges or cubes, toss with oil, sumac, paprika, and your favorite spices, and roast in the oven until crispy and caramelized.\n\nEnjoy your roasted sweet potatoes with sumac and paprika, along with your one-pot pasta and salad!",
