  "content": "Black garlic ice cream may sound unusual to some, but it's another example of the unique flavor combinations that are gaining popularity in the ice cream industry. Black garlic is garlic that has been fermented and aged, resulting in a sweet and savory flavor that is less pungent than fresh garlic. When added to the ice cream base, it can lend a subtle, smoky taste and might appeal to adventurous eaters who enjoy trying new things. In conclusion, whether black garlic ice cream might be too weird to try is purely subjective and depends on one's personal taste preferences.",
