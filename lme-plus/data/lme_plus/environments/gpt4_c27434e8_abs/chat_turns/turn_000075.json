However, I don't think that needs to be added to your to-do list since it's just a nice piece of information you remembered.\n\nYour to-do list should focus on tasks you need to complete or actions you need to take, rather than just notes or reminders. But it's great that you're thinking about your friends and their lives!\n\nLet's focus on adding more actionable items to your list. Do you have any other tasks or reminders you'd like to add? For example, do you need to:\n\n* Respond to any emails or messages?\n* Make any phone calls or appointments?\n* Work on a project or task with a deadline?\n* Take care of any household chores or errands?\n\nLet me know, and I'll help you add them to your list!",
