  "content": "I do not have access to the specific details of all the acts of sabotage committed by Nelson Mandela or the African National Congress (ANC) during the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. However, I can provide some general information.\n\nThe sabotage carried out by the ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, targeted government buildings, power plants, transportation infrastructure, and other symbols of the apartheid regime. Some of the acts of sabotage included bombings, arson, and acts of vandalism.\n\nOne of the most well-known acts of sabotage was the bombing of the Sasol oil refinery in Secunda, South Africa, on June 16, 1980. The bombing was carried out by Umkhonto we Sizwe, and caused significant damage to the facility. Other acts of sabotage carried out by the ANC included attacks on police stations, government buildings, and transportation infrastructure.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the ANC and Umkhonto we Sizwe did engage in acts of sabotage, they claimed to have done so only after peaceful protests and other forms of resistance had failed to bring about change. The South African government, on the other hand, considered these acts to be acts of terrorism.",
