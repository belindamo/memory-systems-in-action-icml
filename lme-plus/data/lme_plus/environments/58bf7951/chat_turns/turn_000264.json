Here's a suggested next step:\n\n**Organize Your Music Library**\n\nTake some time to:\n\n* Review your music library's folder structure and make sure it's organized in a way that makes sense to you\n* Edit tags and metadata to ensure accuracy and consistency\n* Create playlists to categorize your music by genre, mood, or activity\n* Use MediaMonkey's auto-tagging feature to automatically fill in missing tags and metadata\n\nThis will help you get a better understanding of your music library and make it easier to find specific songs or artists.\n\nOnce you've organized your library, you can start exploring MediaMonkey's features for discovering new music, such as:\n\n* **Auto-DJ**: Creates a playlist of similar music based on your listening habits\n* **Music Maps**: Visualizes your music library as a map, allowing you to explore and discover new music\n* **Recommendations**: Provides personalized music recommendations based on your listening habits\n\nThese features can help you discover new music, artists, and genres that you might not have found otherwise.\n\nWhat do you think?
