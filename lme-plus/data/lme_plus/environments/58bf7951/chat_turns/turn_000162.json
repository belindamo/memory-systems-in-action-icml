  "content": "That sounds like an amazing itinerary! I'm really excited about the mix of national parks, beaches, and cities. I'm also glad you included some bike-friendly routes and stops. I was thinking of bringing my road bike, since I've been getting more into cycling lately, especially after the charity bike ride I did on June 3rd. Do you think the roads and bike trails on this itinerary would be suitable for a road bike, or would I need to bring a hybrid or mountain bike instead?",
