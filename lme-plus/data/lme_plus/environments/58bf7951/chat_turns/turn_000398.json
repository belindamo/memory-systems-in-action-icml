  "content": "Absolutely! While individual actions are important, systemic change is necessary to address the root causes of plastic pollution. Governments play a critical role in shaping policies and regulations that can help reduce plastic waste, and it's important for citizens to hold them accountable and demand action. By collaborating with businesses, NGOs, and citizens, governments can develop effective strategies to reduce plastic waste and protect our environment.
