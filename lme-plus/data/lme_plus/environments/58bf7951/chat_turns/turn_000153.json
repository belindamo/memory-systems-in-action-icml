Some measures that airlines can take to become more sustainable include:\n\n1. Developing new, more fuel-efficient aircraft: Airlines can invest in research and development for new aircraft models that are even more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly.\n\n2. Adopting innovative propulsion technologies: Airlines can explore innovative propulsion technologies such as electric, hybrid-electric, and hydrogen fuel-cell-powered aircraft.\n\n3. Reducing reliance on single-use plastics: Airlines can minimize waste by reducing the reliance on disposable food containers, plastic bags, and other single-use items.\n\n4. Improving operational efficiency: Airlines can work to minimize the fuel consumption and carbon emissions associated with taxiing, idling, or other operational practices.\n\n5. Collaborating with other stakeholders: Airlines can collaborate with airports, manufacturers, and governments to develop a comprehensive, coordinated approach to reducing the aviation industry's environmental impact.\n\nIn conclusion, sustainability is an ongoing process, and airlines need to continue to explore new and innovative ways to become more sustainable. With a shift in priorities and continued investment in sustainable practices, the aviation industry can reduce its environmental impact in the years to come.",
