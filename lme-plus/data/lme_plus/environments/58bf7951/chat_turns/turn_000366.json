This will create a visually appealing display and make it easy for guests to see what games are available.\n3. **Organize the components**: Keep the game components, such as cards, tokens, or trains, organized and tidy. You can use small bowls, trays, or containers to store them, keeping the coffee table surface clear.\n\n**Snack and Drink Display:**\n\n1. **Use a snack tray or board**: Place a decorative snack tray or board in the center of the coffee table to corral snacks and drinks. This will create a focal point and make it easy for guests to grab a snack or drink.\n2. **Group similar items together**: Organize snacks and drinks into categories, such as sweet treats, savory snacks, and beverages. This will make it easy for guests to find what they're looking for.\n3. **Add some garnishes**: Add some garnishes, like fresh fruit, nuts, or chocolate chips, to the snack display to add visual interest and make it more appealing.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Leave some negative space**: Don't overcrowd the coffee table. Leave some space between the games, snacks, and drinks to create a clean and uncluttered look.\n2. **Add some ambiance**: Consider adding some candles, fairy lights, or a small vase with fresh flowers to create a cozy atmosphere.\n3. **Make it easy to reach**: Place the most frequently used snacks and drinks within easy reach of the gamers, so they don't need to get up and down too much.\n\nHere's an example of what your coffee table setup could look like:\n\n* Ticket to Ride game board and components on one side\n* Codenames game box and components on the other side\n* Snack tray or board in the center with snacks and drinks organized by category\n* A small vase with fresh flowers or a candle adding ambiance\n* A few decorative items, like a small decorative box or a book, to add visual interest\n\nRemember to have fun and be flexible!
