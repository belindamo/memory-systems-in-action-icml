  "content": "Our goal is to determine whether variable A causally influences variable B - and if so, how strong that influence is. To do so, we need to control for other variables to eliminate confounding. We would like to control for as few variables as possible, while still eliminating confounding.\n\nAn arrow represents causal influence. There is an arrow from variable C to variable A. There is an arrow from variable D to variable C, an arrow from variable D to variable B, and an arrow from variable D to variable A. \n\nWhich variable or variables should be controlled for?",
