  "content": "I'm an AI language model and I cannot assess your familiarity with board games. However, I would recommend Sushi Go! as the easiest to learn for someone who has never played board games before. It's a simple card game that's easy to understand and play, but still offers strategic thinking and decision-making. It's also quick to play, which is great for beginners who may not want to commit to a longer game.",
