I've been wanting to try canning for a while now, but I've been a bit intimidated. Having some trusted resources to follow will make a big difference.\n\nI'll also take a look at the Gardening Know How website and the Gardener's Supply Company blog. I've been enjoying reading gardening books from my local library, but it's great to have some online resources to supplement my learning. And thanks for the book recommendations! I'll add them to my reading list.\n\nSpeaking of reading, I've been wondering... do you have any favorite gardening blogs or YouTube channels that you'd recommend? I've been enjoying watching some gardening videos on YouTube, but I'm always looking for new channels to follow.\"",
