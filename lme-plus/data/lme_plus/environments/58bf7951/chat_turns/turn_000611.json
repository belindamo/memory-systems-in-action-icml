Here are some techniques and tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Hand-building or throwing**: Raku clay can be hand-built or thrown on the wheel. However, due to its high grog content, it may be more challenging to throw thin walls or delicate forms.\n2. **Drying slowly**: Raku clay needs to dry slowly to prevent cracking. Cover your piece with plastic or a damp cloth to slow down the drying process.\n3. **Bisque firing**: Raku clay typically requires a bisque firing at a relatively low temperature (around 1800\u00b0F/980\u00b0C) to burn out the organic materials and prepare the piece for glazing.\n4. **Glazing**: Raku glazes are typically applied in a specific order, with a clear glaze over a white or colored glaze. This creates the characteristic crackle pattern.\n5. **Firing**: Raku firing involves a rapid heating process (around 1800\u00b0F/980\u00b0C) followed by a rapid cooling process, which causes the glaze to crackle and the clay to become brittle.\n6. **Post-firing reduction**: After firing, raku pieces are often placed in a reduction bin (e.g., a metal can with newspaper and sawdust) to cool slowly. This process enhances the crackle pattern and creates a more subtle color palette.\n7. **Sealing**: Due to the porous nature of raku clay, it's essential to seal your piece with a waterproof sealant to prevent moisture from entering the clay body.\n\n**Pottery Wheel Investment:**\n\nWhether or not to invest in a pottery wheel depends on your personal goals, space, and budget. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Cost**: Pottery wheels can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the quality and features.\n2. **Space**: You'll need a dedicated area for the wheel, as well as storage for clay, tools, and other supplies.\n3. **Time commitment**: Mastering the pottery wheel requires practice and patience. Be prepared to dedicate time to learning and improving your skills.\n4. **Creativity**: A pottery wheel can open up new creative possibilities, allowing you to create symmetrical, uniform pieces with ease.\n5. **Therapeutic benefits**: Many potters find the process of throwing on the wheel to be meditative and relaxing.\n\nIf you're new to pottery, you might consider:\n\n1. **Taking classes**: Enroll in pottery classes to gain experience and learn the basics before investing in a wheel.\n2. **Renting or sharing**: Many studios offer wheel rentals or shared studio spaces, allowing you to try out wheel-throwing without a large upfront investment.\n3. **Starting with a beginner's wheel**: Consider starting with a more affordable, beginner-friendly wheel to test the waters before investing in a higher-end model.\n\nUltimately, the decision to invest in a pottery wheel depends on your personal goals, budget, and priorities. If you're passionate about pottery and willing to put in the time and effort, a wheel can be a valuable investment in your creative journey.",
