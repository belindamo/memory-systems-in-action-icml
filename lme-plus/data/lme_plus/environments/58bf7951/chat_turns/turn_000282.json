  "content": "Roasted Asparagus is a fantastic side dish that pairs perfectly with the Cauliflower Rice and Grilled Chicken Salad. It's a light, healthy, and flavorful option that will complement the dish nicely.\n\nTo make it even easier, you can prep the asparagus ahead of time by trimming the ends and tossing it with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Then, simply spread it out on a baking sheet and roast in the oven when you're ready.\n\nHere's a quick tip: If you want to add some extra flavor to your asparagus, try tossing it with some grated Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, or chopped fresh herbs like parsley or thyme before roasting. It'll give it an extra boost of flavor and aroma!\n\nNow that you have your meal prep plan in place, I hope you enjoy your Cauliflower Rice and Grilled Chicken Salad with Roasted Asparagus!
