  "content": "National Guard members have both regular duties and can be called upon during emergencies or contingencies. National Guard members are required to train one weekend a month and two weeks a year, hence the term \"one weekend a month, two weeks a year.\" During this training, they maintain their military skills and receive new training to ensure they are prepared to respond in case of an emergency. National Guard members also have deployments or mobilizations that can range from a few days to several months, depending on the mission. In times of war or national emergency, National Guard members can be deployed for long periods to support combat operations. So, National Guard members, in addition to their civilian careers, have regular military duties and can be called upon to serve in emergencies, contingencies, or combat operations.",
