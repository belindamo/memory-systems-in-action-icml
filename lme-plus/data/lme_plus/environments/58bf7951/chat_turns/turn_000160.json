  "content": "I'm thinking of taking around 7-10 days for the road trip. I'm open to exploring multiple states along the West Coast, and I'd love to see a mix of national parks, beaches, and cities. I'm not really interested in surfing or whale watching, but I do enjoy hiking and trying out local food and drinks. As for the pace, I'd prefer to drive for a few hours each day and spend 2-3 days in each location. Also, I was thinking of bringing my bike along, since I had such a great time on the charity bike ride last weekend - any suggestions on bike-friendly routes or stops?",
