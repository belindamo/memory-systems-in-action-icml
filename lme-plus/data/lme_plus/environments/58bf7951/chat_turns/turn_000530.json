  "content": "In general, the performances of athletes at the 2014 Commonwealth Games were not on the same level as those at the Olympics. While both events attract elite athletes from around the world, the competition at the Olympics is typically more intense due to a larger number of countries (over 200 in the Summer Olympics) and a wider range of events, leading to greater depth of competition.\n\nHowever, there were still some outstanding individual performances at the 2014 Commonwealth Games that were comparable to those at the Olympics. For example, Usain Bolt won gold in both the 100m and 200m sprints, beating rival Justin Gatlin in the 100m. In swimming, Chad le Clos of South Africa won six gold medals, including a thrilling victory in the 200m butterfly over Michael Phelps at the 2012 Olympics.\n\nOverall, while the Commonwealth Games cannot match the size or intensity of the Olympics, it remains an important international competition that showcases some of the best athletes in the world.",
