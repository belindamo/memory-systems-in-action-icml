  "content": "Let the length of the slower train be L.\nThe relative speed of the faster train w.r.t. the slower train = (50 - 32) km/hr = 18 km/hr = (18/36) km/sec = 0.5 m/sec.\nSince the faster train crosses the last bogie of the slower train (which is at the end of the train), it has to travel the length of the slower train after crossing this bogie to completely pass the slower train. Therefore, the time taken by the faster train to completely pass the slower train is the same as the time taken by it to travel a distance equal to the length of the slower train relative to the slower train itself.\nTherefore, we have:\n\nL = speed x time\nL = 0.5 x 18\nL = 9 meters\nTherefore, the length of the slower train is 9 meters or 0.009 km.",
