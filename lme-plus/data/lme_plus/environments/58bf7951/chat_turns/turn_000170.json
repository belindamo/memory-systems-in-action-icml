  "content": "From statement 5, we know that Hulk is on the left of Thor. From statement 1, we know that the seven people are sitting in a circle. Therefore, we can place Hulk to the left of Thor in the circle.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the remaining four people (Pepper Potts, Ironman, Hawkeye, and Loki) are sitting at equal distances from each other. Therefore, they must be seated at the remaining positions on the circle.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that Ironman is two places right of Loki, who is one place right of Hawkeye. Therefore, the order of the four people is: Hawkeye, Loki, Ironman, Pepper Potts.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that Pepper Potts forms an angle of 90\u00b0 from Thor and an angle of 120\u00b0 from Hulk. Therefore, Pepper Potts must be sitting at the position opposite to the midpoint of the arc between Thor and Hulk. This means that Thor and Hulk are seated at adjacent positions in the circle, and Pepper Potts is sitting opposite to the midpoint of the arc between these two positions.\n\nTherefore, Thor is sitting between the pair of Hulk and Ironman.",
