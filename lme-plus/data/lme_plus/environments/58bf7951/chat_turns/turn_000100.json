I was a bit worried about the soil quality in my backyard, but I added some compost and it made all the difference. I've already harvested a few batches of cherry tomatoes and they're so sweet and delicious. I've also had some unexpected success with my herbs - my basil and cilantro are thriving and I've been using them to make all sorts of tasty dishes.\n\nAs for sharing my harvest, I've been giving some of my extra produce to my neighbors and friends. It's been great to share the bounty and get to know them better. I've also been thinking about trying my hand at canning or freezing some of my veggies for later. Do you have any tips or resources for a beginner like me?\n\nAnd speaking of resources, I've been using some online forums and YouTube channels to learn more about gardening. Do you have any favorite gardening resources or books that you'd recommend?\"",
