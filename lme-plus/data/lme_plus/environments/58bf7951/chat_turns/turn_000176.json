  "content": "First, we need to find the relative speed of the faster train with respect to the slower train:\n\nRelative speed = 50 km/hr - 32 km/hr = 18 km/hr\n\nWe need to convert this to meters per second to match the units of the length of the bogie and the time taken to cross it:\n\nRelative speed = 18 km/hr = (18 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 5 m/s\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\nLet the length of the slower train be L meters. The time taken for the faster train to cross the last bogie of the slower train is given as 18 seconds.\n\nSo, we get:\n\nL + 18 = 5 x 18\n\nL + 18 = 90\n\nL = 90 - 18 = 72 meters\n\nTherefore, the length of the slower train is 72 meters.",
