Here's why:\n\n* While there are some scenic roads with bike lanes, many of the routes on this itinerary involve sharing roads with cars, and some sections may have rough pavement or gravel shoulders.\n* The bike trails and paths mentioned are generally paved and smooth, but some may have rougher surfaces or obstacles like roots, potholes, or sand.\n* You'll encounter varying terrain, including hills, coastal winds, and possible rain showers, which can make a road bike less comfortable.\n\nA hybrid or touring bike would be a great choice for this trip because they:\n\n* Offer a more upright riding position, providing better visibility and comfort on varied terrain\n* Have slightly wider tires with more tread, which can handle rougher surfaces and provide better traction in wet conditions\n* Typically have more mounting points for accessories like fenders, racks, and water bottle cages, making them well-suited for touring and carrying gear\n\nThat being said, if you're comfortable with the potential challenges and have a road bike with:\n\n* Wider tires (28mm or larger) and a comfortable riding position\n* A bike with disk brakes, which can provide better stopping power in wet conditions\n* You're willing to take your time and be cautious on rough sections\n\nThen, you can still bring your road bike. Just be prepared for some potential discomfort and adjust your route or bike handling accordingly.\n\nRemember to also pack:\n\n* A basic tool kit and spare tubes\n* A waterproof jacket and pants for rainy days\n* Comfortable cycling clothing and shoes\n* A bike lock and any necessary accessories (e.g., lights, reflectors)\n\nEnjoy your trip, and happy cycling!",
