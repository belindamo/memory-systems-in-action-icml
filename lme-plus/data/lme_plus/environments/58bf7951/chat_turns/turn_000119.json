  "content": "To fill a half-full tank in 10 minutes while also draining it at a constant rate, the rate at which water is pumped in must be twice the rate at which it is drained. Since it takes 30 minutes to empty the tank by draining it at a constant rate, the rate at which it is drained is 1/30 of the tank's capacity per minute. Therefore, the rate at which water must be pumped in is 2 \\* (1/30) of the tank's capacity per minute, or 2/30 of the tank's capacity per minute.",
