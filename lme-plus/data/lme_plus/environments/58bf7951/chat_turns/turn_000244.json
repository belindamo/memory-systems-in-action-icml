  "content": "Quick bite before the ceremony, got it!\n\nYes, some of the restaurants I mentioned are open for lunch, but I'll highlight a few more options that are convenient and close to the Ritz-Carlton:\n\n**Open for lunch near the Ritz-Carlton:**\n\n1. **The Conservatory & Lounge** (inside the Ritz-Carlton): They serve light bites and sandwiches during the day, and it's a great spot to grab a quick bite before the ceremony.\n2. **Navio** (inside the Ritz-Carlton): They offer a lunch menu, but it might be a bit more upscale and time-consuming. If you're short on time, you might want to opt for a quicker option.\n\n**Other convenient options near the hotel:**\n\n1. **The Coffee Bar** (inside the Ritz-Carlton): If you just need a quick coffee and pastry, this is a great spot. They also offer light bites like sandwiches and salads.\n2. **Room service**: If you're really short on time, you can always order room service and enjoy a quick bite in the comfort of your own room.\n\n**Within a 5-10 minute drive from the Ritz-Carlton:**\n\n1. **Half Moon Bay Coffee Company**: A local coffee shop with a cozy atmosphere, serving coffee, pastries, and light bites like sandwiches and salads.\n2. **New Leaf Community Markets**: A natural food market with a deli counter, offering sandwiches, salads, and soups. You can grab something quick and easy to go.\n\nThese options should give you some flexibility to grab a quick bite before the ceremony. If you have a bit more time, you could always take a short drive to downtown Half Moon Bay and explore the charming shops and eateries there.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time at the wedding!",
