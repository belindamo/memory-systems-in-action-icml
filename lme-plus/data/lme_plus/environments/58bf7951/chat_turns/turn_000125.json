  "content": "The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +1 of a rotation matrix is a non-zero vector that remains unchanged (up to a scale factor) when the matrix is multiplied by it. In other words, if v is an eigenvector of a rotation matrix A with eigenvalue \u03bb, then Av = \u03bbv.\n\nFor a rotation matrix, the eigenvalue +1 corresponds to a rotation about an axis, and the eigenvector associated with this eigenvalue is a unit vector along that axis.\n\nWithout the explicit matrix \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35[\ud835\udc45], it's not possible to determine its eigenvectors.",
