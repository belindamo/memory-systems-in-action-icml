  "content": "Half Moon Bay Coffee Company is a local favorite, and I'm sure you'll enjoy their coffee.\n\nYes, Half Moon Bay Coffee Company has outdoor seating where you can enjoy your coffee before the ceremony. They have a cozy patio area with tables and chairs, surrounded by plants and a pleasant atmosphere. It's a great spot to relax and take in the morning sunshine while you sip on your coffee.\n\nPlease note that the outdoor seating area is relatively small, so it's possible that it might be busy during peak hours. However, it's worth a try, and you can always grab a coffee to-go if the patio is full.\n\nAdditionally, keep in mind that the patio area is dog-friendly, so you might see some furry friends accompanying their owners.\n\nI'm glad I could help, and I hope you enjoy your coffee and the beautiful views at Half Moon Bay Coffee Company!",
