  "content": "The primary objectives of the National Guard of the United States are:\n\n1. To provide support and assistance during natural disasters, civil disturbances, or other emergencies within the United States.\n\n2. To provide trained and equipped military personnel to support overseas combat operations.\n\n3. To support state and federal missions such as border security, counter-drug operations, and other law enforcement activities.\n\n4. To train and prepare its members to be ready to respond to any emergency or contingency.\n\nThe National Guard differs from other branches of the military in that it is a unique dual-status force. It is both a state and federal force, meaning that its members can be called upon to serve at the state or federal level. Additionally, National Guard units are often composed of citizen-soldiers who serve part-time and have civilian careers or studies, whereas active-duty military personnel serve full-time.",
