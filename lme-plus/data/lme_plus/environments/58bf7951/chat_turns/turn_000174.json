  "content": "Let the distance between Tarun's house and school be \"d\" km.\n\nWe know that time = distance / speed.\n\nOn the first day, Tarun walks at 4 km/hr and reaches 5 minutes late, which means he took (t + 5/60) hours to reach the school, where t is the actual time he should have taken to reach the school.\n\nOn the second day, Tarun walks at 5 km/hr and reaches 15 minutes early, which means he took (t - 15/60) hours to reach the school.\n\nWe can write two equations based on the above information:\n\nd/4 = t + 5/60 ...(1)\n\nd/5 = t - 15/60 ...(2)\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express t in terms of d as:\n\nt = (d/4) - (5/60)\n\nSubstituting this value of t in equation (2), we get:\n\nd/5 = (d/4) - (5/60) - (15/60)\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\nd/20 = 1/12\n\nd = 20/12 = 5/3 km\n\nTherefore, the distance between Tarun's house and school is 5/3 km.",
