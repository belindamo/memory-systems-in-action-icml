Increase public awareness and education: Increase public awareness and education on the impacts of plastic pollution on marine ecosystems through media campaigns and school programs aimed at educating children about the importance of reducing plastic waste.\n\n3. Increase recycling rates: Increase recycling rates by providing more recycling facilities in public areas and by implementing programs that encourage people to recycle more.\n\n4. Work with manufacturers to reduce plastic use: Encourage manufacturers to reduce plastic use by looking for sustainable alternatives or making changes to the design of their products to make them more eco-friendly.\n\n5.
