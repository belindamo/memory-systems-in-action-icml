  "content": "The Church Street bombing, which occurred on May 20, 1983, in Pretoria, South Africa, was an attack on a civilian target by the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe. The car bomb exploded near a military headquarters building, but it was located in a civilian area, and the majority of the victims were civilians. The attack killed 19 people and injured more than 200 others. So, to answer your question, the Church Street bombing was not a military target.",
