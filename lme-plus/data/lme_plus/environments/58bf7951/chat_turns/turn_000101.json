Compost can work wonders for soil quality.\n\nSharing your harvest with neighbors and friends is a great way to build community and spread the love. As for canning and freezing, I've got some resources for you! There are many beginner-friendly guides online, but I recommend checking out the USDA's Complete Guide to Home Canning and the National Center for Home Food Preservation website. They're both trustworthy sources with tons of info and recipes to get you started.\n\nAs for gardening resources, I'm a big fan of the Gardening Know How website and the Gardener's Supply Company blog. They've got a wealth of information on various gardening topics, from beginner tutorials to advanced techniques. If you're looking for books, I recommend 'The New Seed Starter's Handbook' by Nancy Bubel and 'The Vegetable Gardener's Bible' by Edward C. Smith. Both are super",
