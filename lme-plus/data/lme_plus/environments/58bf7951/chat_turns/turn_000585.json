  "content": "Nelson Mandela was involved in several acts of sabotage as part of his anti-apartheid activism. One of the most famous acts was the sabotage campaign carried out by the Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC), which Mandela helped to establish in 1961. The campaign involved bombings of government buildings, power plants, and other infrastructure seen as supporting the apartheid regime. The goal of the campaign was to disrupt the functioning of the government and draw international attention to the struggle against apartheid.",
