  "content": "Half Moon Bay Coffee Company has outlets available for customers to charge their devices.\n\nThey have a decent number of outlets scattered throughout the cafe, including some at the tables and along the walls. You should be able to find a spot with an available outlet to plug in your laptop and keep it charged.\n\nThat being said, it's always a good idea to be mindful of other customers and make sure you're not hogging an outlet that someone else might need. If you're planning to camp out for a while, you might consider bringing a portable power bank as a backup, just in case.\n\nBut in general, Half Moon Bay Coffee Company is a great spot to get some work done while keeping your devices charged. Enjoy your coffee and productivity session!",
