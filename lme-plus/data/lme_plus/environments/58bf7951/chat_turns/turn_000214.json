  "content": "Yes, leather and suede can be used for high-end tailored dresses as well. They can give a dress a luxurious and edgy feel or a soft and sophisticated appeal. \n\nLeather is a durable and versatile fabric that comes with different textures and finishes, such as smooth, pebbled, or patent. It can be used for a variety of dress styles, including fitted sheath dresses, flared skirts, or wrap dresses. However, leather can be pricey, particularly if it is of high quality or from exotic animals, such as crocodile or ostrich.\n\nSuede, on the other hand, is a softer and more supple fabric than leather. It is made by sanding the underside of leather, which gives it a fuzzy texture. Suede is often used in more casual or bohemian style dresses, but it can also be used to create elegant and chic designs. Similarly to leather, the cost of suede can vary depending on the quality and origin of the fabric.\n\nOverall, the choice of leather or suede for a tailored dress will depend on the style, occasion, and personal preference of the wearer, as well as the craftsmanship and expertise of the tailor.",
