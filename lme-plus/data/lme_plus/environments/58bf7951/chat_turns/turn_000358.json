Read Over the Menu: Before playing, take some time to read over the menu so you get familiar with the different types of sushi and their point values.\n\n2. Look for Synergy: Try to select sushi that work well together, such as Tempura and Sashimi that can earn you bonus points.\n\n3. Pay Attention to Your Opponents: Keep track of what your opponents are selecting, as you can use their choices to inform your own strategy.\n\n4. Anticipate Dessert: Keep dessert in mind as you play because it can greatly affect the final scoring.\n\n5. Be Strategic with Chopsticks: Chopsticks allow you to select two cards from your hand and then pass them to the next player. Use them wisely to try to get the cards you need or to prevent your opponents from getting cards that they want.\n\n6. Don't Be Greedy: Remember that you can only keep the sushi that you select for one round before you need to pass your remaining cards. Don't be greedy or you may end up losing out on points.\n\n7. Keep Track of Scores: Keep track of the scores as you go along so that you can make informed decisions in future rounds.\n\nI hope these tips help you, and that you have a great time playing Sushi Go! with your family!",
