Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n**Step 1: Download and Install MediaMonkey**\n\nIf you haven't already, download and install MediaMonkey from the official website. Make sure to download the correct version for your operating system (Windows or macOS).\n\n**Step 2: Launch MediaMonkey and Set Up the Library**\n\nLaunch MediaMonkey and follow the initial setup wizard to configure the software. You'll be asked to:\n\n* Choose the language and interface theme\n* Set up the music library location (select a folder where you want to store your music files)\n* Choose the default music file format (e.g., MP3, FLAC, etc.)\n\n**Step 3: Add Music Folders to MediaMonkey**\n\nClick on \"File\" > \"Add/Rescan Files\" and select the folders that contain your music files. You can add multiple folders at once. MediaMonkey will then scan the folders and import the music files into its database.\n\n**Step 4: Choose the Import Method**\n\nYou'll be prompted to choose the import method:\n\n* \"Add files to the library\" will import the files into MediaMonkey's database, but the files will remain in their original location.\n* \"Copy files to the library\" will copy the files to the MediaMonkey library folder you specified earlier.\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs.\n\n**Step 5: Configure Import Options (Optional)**\n\nIf you want to customize the import process, click on \"Options\" and select the \"Import\" tab. Here, you can configure settings like:\n\n* File naming conventions\n* Tagging options (e.g., artist, album, genre)\n* Folder structure\n\n**Step 6: Start the Import Process**\n\nClick \"OK\" to start the import process. MediaMonkey will scan the selected folders and import the music files into its database. Depending on the number of files and their size, this process may take some time.\n\n**Step 7: Organize and Enjoy Your Music Library**\n\nOnce the import process is complete, you can start organizing your music library using MediaMonkey's various features, such as:\n\n* Creating playlists\n* Editing tags and metadata\n* Syncing with mobile devices or other media players\n* Browsing your library by artist, album, genre, or playlist\n\nThat's it!
