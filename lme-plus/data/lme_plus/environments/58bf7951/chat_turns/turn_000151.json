  "content": "Yes, some airlines are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a biofuel made from sustainable feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and algae. SAF is blended with traditional jet fuel to reduce emissions and minimize the carbon footprint of air travel. SAF is still a liquid fuel, which means it can be used in existing aircraft without requiring significant modifications.\n\nSAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, and it is considered a safe and low-cost way for airlines to reduce their environmental impact. The use of SAF is expected to increase in the coming years as more feedstocks become available, and more airlines opt to use biofuels to power their aircraft.\n\nHowever, SAF is not yet widely available, and its production is currently limited, which means that it is more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Scaling up production to meet demand will be a challenge, as there is a limited supply of sustainable feedstocks, and production facilities are still relatively small. Nonetheless, SAF represents an exciting development in the ongoing efforts to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.",
