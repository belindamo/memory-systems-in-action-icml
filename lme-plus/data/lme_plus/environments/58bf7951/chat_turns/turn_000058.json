  "content": "Yes, it would make sense to statistically control for high test scores when examining the possible causal relationship between admission to a selective university and great athletic prowess if high test scores raise one's chances of both being admitted to a selective university and having great athletic prowess.\n\nIn this case, high test scores would be a confounding variable because they can affect both the exposure (admission to a selective university) and the outcome (great athletic prowess). By controlling for high test scores, we would be removing their effect on the relationship between admission to a selective university and great athletic prowess and obtaining an unbiased estimate of their relationship.\n\nConfounding variables can produce an apparent association between an exposure and an outcome when there is actually no causal relationship. By controlling for confounding variables, we can account for their effects and obtain a more accurate estimate of the relationship between the exposure and the outcome.\n\nIn addition to controlling for high test scores, it would also be important to control for other potential confounding variables that may affect both admission to a selective university and great athletic prowess, such as parental education, family income, and access to resources.",
