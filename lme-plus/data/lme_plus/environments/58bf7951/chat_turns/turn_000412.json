The Queen Mother's Legacy Fund supports a wide range of projects across the United Kingdom that benefit young people, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups in society. Some examples of the types of projects it has supported in the past include:\n\n1. Youth projects: The fund has supported projects that provide skills training, mentoring, or sports coaching for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. For example, it has funded a program that teaches young people how to build and maintain bicycles, and another that provides dance classes for teenagers.\n\n2. Elderly care: The fund has supported projects that improve the quality of life for elderly people, particularly those living in care homes or who are isolated. For example, it has funded initiatives that provide dementia-friendly activities, such as art classes or gardening, and others that offer social events, such as tea parties or day trips.\n\n3. Community support: The fund has also supported projects that address wider social issues in local communities, such as homelessness, poverty or mental health. For example, it has funded a project that provides support for homeless people, including food and clothing donations, and another that offers counseling and therapy services for people experiencing mental health problems.\n\nThe Queen Mother's Legacy Fund is managed by The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, in partnership with a number of other organizations.
