      "content": "From statement 5, we know that Hulk is on the left of Thor. From statement 1, we know that the seven people are sitting in a circle. Therefore, we can place Hulk to the left of Thor in the circle.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the remaining four people (Pepper Potts, Ironman, Hawkeye, and Loki) are sitting at equal distances from each other. Therefore, they must be seated at the remaining positions on the circle.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that Ironman is two places right of Loki, who is one place right of Hawkeye. Therefore, the order of the four people is: Hawkeye, Loki, Ironman, Pepper Potts.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that Pepper Potts forms an angle of 90\u00b0 from Thor and an angle of 120\u00b0 from Hulk. Therefore, Pepper Potts must be sitting at the position opposite to the midpoint of the arc between Thor and Hulk. This means that Thor and Hulk are seated at adjacent positions in the circle, and Pepper Potts is sitting opposite to the midpoint of the arc between these two positions.\n\nTherefore, Thor is sitting between the pair of Hulk and Ironman."

      "content": "First, we need to find the relative speed of the faster train with respect to the slower train:\n\nRelative speed = 50 km/hr - 32 km/hr = 18 km/hr\n\nWe need to convert this to meters per second to match the units of the length of the bogie and the time taken to cross it:\n\nRelative speed = 18 km/hr = (18 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 5 m/s\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\nLet the length of the slower train be L meters. The time taken for the faster train to cross the last bogie of the slower train is given as 18 seconds.\n\nSo, we get:\n\nL + 18 = 5 x 18\n\nL + 18 = 90\n\nL = 90 - 18 = 72 meters\n\nTherefore, the length of the slower train is 72 meters."

Therefore, the time taken by the faster train to completely pass the slower train is the same as the time taken by it to travel a distance equal to the length of the slower train relative to the slower train itself.\nTherefore, we have:\n\nL = speed x time\nL = 0.5 x 18\nL = 9 meters\nTherefore, the length of the slower train is 9 meters or 0.009 km."
