The use of multimedia platforms, such as social media and live streaming, has also added new dimensions to the way announcers deliver announcements, allowing them to connect with their audiences in real-time and adapt their delivery styles to suit the platform and audience preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the globalization of media has had a significant impact on announcers and the way they deliver announcements, requiring them to have a global perspective, adapt their delivery styles to new multimedia platforms, and present information in a more dynamic and engaging manner to attract and retain viewers."

Announcers are now using language that is more simplified and clear to accommodate non-native speakers. With the rise in digital technology and social media, information is spreading fast, and it is now possible to communicate messages to a global audience. To ensure that their message is understood by a diverse audience, announcers are now simplifying their language by limiting the use of technical terms and industry jargon.\n\nMoreover, announcers are also making an effort to use plain language and avoid colloquialisms or regional accents that may be difficult for non-native speakers to understand. Additionally, some announcers may provide translations or subtitles to help non-native speakers better understand the content.\n\nIn conclusion, the globalization of media has influenced the language used by announcers, with simpler language being used to accommodate non-native speakers.
