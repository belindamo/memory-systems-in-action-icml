      "content": "In the 1980s, the African National Congress (ANC) was labeled a terrorist organization by the United States government, along with several other Western countries, due to its use of violent tactics in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. The US government's decision to label the ANC as a terrorist organization was controversial and sparked protests from anti-apartheid activists, who argued that the ANC was a legitimate liberation movement fighting against a repressive regime.\n\nHowever, in 2008, the US government officially removed the ANC from its list of designated terrorist organizations, recognizing the role the organization had played in"

The car bomb exploded near a military headquarters building, but it was located in a civilian area, and the majority of the victims were civilians. The attack killed 19 people and injured more than 200 others. So, to answer your question, the Church Street bombing was not a military target."

The United States, for example, classified the ANC as a terrorist organization during the apartheid era, while other countries and organizations, such as the United Nations, did not.\n\nThe ANC was involved in armed struggle against the apartheid government and military targets, which resulted in civilian casualties in some instances. However, the ANC also engaged in negotiations and peaceful resistance, such as boycotts and strikes, to achieve their goals of ending apartheid and achieving equal rights for all South Africans.\n\nIt's worth noting that the ANC's actions and classification as a terrorist organization occurred in a specific historical context, and that the apartheid government also committed numerous human rights"

However, I can provide some general information.\n\nThe sabotage carried out by the ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, targeted government buildings, power plants, transportation infrastructure, and other symbols of the apartheid regime. Some of the acts of sabotage included bombings, arson, and acts of vandalism.\n\nOne of the most well-known acts of sabotage was the bombing of the Sasol oil refinery in Secunda, South Africa, on June 16, 1980. The bombing was carried out by Umkhonto we Sizwe, and caused significant damage to the facility. Other acts of sabotage carried out by the ANC included attacks on police stations, government buildings, and transportation infrastructure.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the ANC and Umkhonto we Sizwe did engage in acts of sabotage, they claimed to have done so only after peaceful protests and other forms of resistance had failed to bring about change. The South African government, on the other hand, considered these acts to be acts of terrorism."
