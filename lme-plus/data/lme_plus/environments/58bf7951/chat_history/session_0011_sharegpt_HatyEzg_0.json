      "content": "To fill a half-full tank in 10 minutes while also draining it at a constant rate, the rate at which water is pumped in must be twice the rate at which it is drained. Since it takes 30 minutes to empty the tank by draining it at a constant rate, the rate at which it is drained is 1/30 of the tank's capacity per minute. Therefore, the rate at which water must be pumped in is 2 \\* (1/30) of the tank's capacity per minute, or 2/30 of the tank's capacity per minute."

      "content": "Gimbal lock is a phenomenon that occurs in certain representations of orientation, such as Euler angles, when two or more rotational degrees of freedom become aligned and effectively \"lock\" the orientation representation into a singularity.\n\nEuler angle representation is prone to gimbal lock, meaning that two or more rotational axes become aligned and the orientation becomes ambiguous. This can occur when one of the Euler angles approaches 90 degrees, causing the rotational axes to become aligned.\n\nTherefore, Euler angle representation of orientation is susceptible to gimbal lock. Other representations, such as quaternions, Rodrigues' rotation formula, or rotation matrices, are not prone to gimbal lock."

A rotation about the vector [1,1,1]\ud835\udc47 by an angle of \u03c0/3 can be represented using the Rodriguez' formula as:\n\nR = I + sin(\u03c0/3)S + (1-cos(\u03c0/3))S^2\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix, S is the skew-symmetric matrix corresponding to the vector [1,1,1]\ud835\udc47 and S^2 is the matrix product of S with itself.
