      "content": "We had a call with our client. Our client, Hopper, has an issue creating ads on a global level. In the meeting, we have three user acquisition managers, which all independently manage their region (APAC, LatAM + Canada and Europe). We talk with them to go through their content needs. The challenges for us are: casting creators on a global level and creating the operational process around that. I'm meeting with our ops team tomorrow to discuss how we can structure this project. Could you give me an agenda for this call? The GOAL of the call is to identify a process through which we can create high quality content for all regions. I've got the following stakeholders on the call: Jes | Head of ops\nOwns the process + the ClickUp instance and ensures that things are getting delivered on time with the right quality standard.\n\nEtienne | Creative strategist\nResearches and scopes different ad concepts, creates briefs, and defines discovery criteria\n\nAli | Paid Media Director. Responsible for account growth"
