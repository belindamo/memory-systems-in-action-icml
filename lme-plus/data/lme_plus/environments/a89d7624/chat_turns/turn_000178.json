  "content": "Thanks for the tips on film photography. I've been trying to learn more about it since I got my vintage camera. Speaking of which, I've also been enjoying my vinyl collection lately - I invested in a new record player to ensure that I can enjoy my collection to the fullest today. Anyway, back to film photography, I was thinking of trying out black and white film. Do you have any recommendations for black and white film stocks that are good for beginners?",
