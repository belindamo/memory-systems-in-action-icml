However, I can suggest a few ways to find a gym or studio that suits your needs:\n\n1. Online search: Use search engines like Google to look for gyms or fitness studios in the downtown area. You can filter your search by location, hours of operation, and services offered.\n2. Social media: Check social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram to see if local gyms or fitness studios have pages or accounts. You can read reviews, look at their schedules, and get a sense of their community.\n3. Ask around: Ask your friends, colleagues, or fellow triathletes for recommendations. They might have experience with local gyms or studios that offer strength training classes or personal training sessions.\n4. Check with your insurance: If you have health insurance, check if they have partnerships with local gyms or fitness studios that offer discounts or promotions.\n\nRemember to always consult with a healthcare professional or certified personal trainer before starting any new exercise routine. They can help you create a personalized plan that suits your fitness level and goals.",
