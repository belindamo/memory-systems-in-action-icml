  "content": "Adding 2-3 core exercises to your weightlifting sessions will help you build a stronger, more stable core.\n\nPlanks are an excellent exercise for building overall core strength, stability, and endurance. When performed correctly, planks engage your entire core, including your abs, obliques, and lower back muscles. Here are some tips to help you properly engage your core during planks:\n\n1. **Start with proper form**: Begin in a push-up position with your hands shoulder-width apart, arms straight, and hands directly under your shoulders. Your feet should be hip-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed between your hands and feet.\n2. **Engage your core**: Draw your belly button towards your spine, and imagine pulling your navel towards the floor. This will help activate your transverse abdominis muscle, which is the deepest abdominal muscle that wraps around your spine and pelvis.\n3. **Squeeze your glutes**: Engage your glutes to help stabilize your pelvis and lower back. This will also help you maintain a straight line from head to heels.\n4. **Maintain a straight line**: Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, with no sagging or arching in your back. This will help you maintain proper form and engage your core muscles effectively.\n5. **Breathe naturally**: Breathe naturally, avoiding holding your breath. Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.\n\nAs for the duration, it's generally recommended to hold a plank for 30-60 seconds. However, if you're just starting out, you can start with shorter holds (20-30 seconds) and gradually increase the duration as you build endurance.\n\nHere's a progression you can follow:\n\n* Week 1-2: Hold for 20-30 seconds, rest for 30-60 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets.\n* Week 3-4: Hold for 30-45 seconds, rest for 30-60 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets.\n* Week 5 and beyond: Hold for 45-60 seconds, rest for 30-60 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets.\n\nRemember to focus on proper form and engagement throughout the exercise. If you feel your form starting to break or you experience discomfort, stop the exercise and rest.\n\nBy following these tips and progressing gradually, you'll be able to build a stronger, more stable core that will benefit your overall fitness and athletic performance.",
