  "content": "You're right, my mistake. In Flang, the phrase \"The dog's house\" would be translated as \"Flomi fash\".\n\nTo break it down:\n- \"flomi\" is the inflected form of the word \"flom\" (dog) in the genitive case\n- \"fash\" is the word for \"house\" in Flang\n- When a noun is used in the genitive case, it doesn't change its form in Flang.\n\nSo, when we put it all together, we get \"Flomi fash\" which means \"The dog's house\" in Flang. I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Let me know if you have any other questions or requests.",
