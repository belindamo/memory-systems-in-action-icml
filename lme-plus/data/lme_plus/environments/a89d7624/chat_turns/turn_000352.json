  "content": "You're thinking of asking The Ship Rock Grille if they have any tables available with a view of the stage? That's a great idea!\n\nWhile The Ship Rock Grille's patio does offer stunning views of the surrounding red rock formations, it's not directly adjacent to the Red Rocks Amphitheater's stage. However, it's still worth asking if they have any tables with a view of the stage or if they can accommodate your request.\n\nWhen you ask, you might want to phrase it like this: \"Do you have any tables available with a view of the Red Rocks Amphitheater's stage? We're attending a concert tonight and would love to get a sneak peek of the stage before the show.\"\n\nThe Ship Rock Grille's staff might be able to offer you a table with a partial view of the stage or provide you with information on the best spot to catch a glimpse of the stage before the concert. Even if they can't accommodate your request, it's still a great spot to grab dinner and get excited for the show!\n\nGood luck, and I hope you score a table with a view!",
