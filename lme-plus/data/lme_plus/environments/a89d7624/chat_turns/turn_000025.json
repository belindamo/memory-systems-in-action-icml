Rachel, your yoga instructor, might have some valuable insights and recommendations for strength training classes or personal training sessions in the downtown area. As a fitness professional, she likely has a network of colleagues and contacts in the industry who can provide guidance and support.\n\nDon't hesitate to ask Rachel about her recommendations, and be specific about your goals and needs as a triathlete. She may be able to suggest classes or trainers that focus on functional strength, endurance, and flexibility, which can be beneficial for your triathlon training.\n\nAdditionally, since you've already established a relationship with Rachel through your yoga classes, she may be able to provide personalized advice or even offer to create a customized strength training plan for you.\n\nRemember to also ask about any discounts or promotions that might be available for triathletes or individuals with similar fitness goals. Many gyms and studios offer special packages or rates for athletes in training, so it's always worth inquiring about.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a strength training program that complements your triathlon training and helps you reach your goals!",
