  "content": "The Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling in 1954 was a landmark decision that declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional. This decision overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established by the Plessy v. Ferguson ruling in 1896, which legalized racial segregation. The Brown v. Board of Education decision was significant in the Civil Rights Movement because it challenged the legal basis of segregation and provided a legal precedent to challenge segregation in other aspects of American life. The ruling ultimately led to a series of legal battles and helped to spark the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, which sought to end racial discrimination and promote equal rights for all Americans.",
