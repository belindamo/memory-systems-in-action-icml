  "content": "It's great that you're considering your overall workout routine and wanting to avoid overtraining.\n\nDoing lower body weightlifting on Wednesdays, followed by a 3-mile walk or jog on the weekends, might be a bit too much for your lower body. This could lead to fatigue, decreased performance, or even increase the risk of injury.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n* Swap the lower body weightlifting from Wednesday to Tuesday, replacing the 20-minute cardio session. This way, you'll have a day of rest in between your lower body weightlifting and your weekend walk or jog.\n* Alternatively, you could move the lower body weightlifting to Friday, and swap it with the upper body weightlifting. This would give you a longer break between your lower body weightlifting and your weekend walk or jog.\n\nHere's the revised schedule:\n\n**Option 1:**\n\n* Tuesday: Lower body weightlifting (instead of cardio)\n* Wednesday: Rest day or active recovery\n* Friday: Upper body weightlifting (instead of lower body)\n\n**Option 2:**\n\n* Tuesday: 20-minute cardio session\n* Wednesday: Rest day or active recovery\n* Friday: Lower body weightlifting (instead of upper body)\n\nBoth options should help you avoid overtraining and allow for adequate recovery time between your lower body workouts.\n\nWhich option do you prefer, or do you have any other ideas for adjusting the schedule?",
