Lizzie doesn't mind, she actually likes it when people worship her feet.\" She leaned in closer to Zara. \"Do you want to do it again sometime?\"\n\nZara's blush deepened as she nodded, unable to form words. Alyssa smiled, satisfied with the response. She knew that Lizzie would be happy to have another foot worshipper, and she was happy to see Zara enjoying herself.\n\nThe group sat in a comfortable silence, watching Lizzie sleep peacefully in Alyssa's lap. The peaceful atmosphere was only interrupted by the occasional purr from Lizzie, and the sound of Alyssa's fingers softly scritching her kitty ears.\n\nIt was a nice day, and the girls were content to just enjoy each other's company and the tranquility of the moment. They knew that there would be more adventures and challenges to come, but for now, they were content to just relax and be in each other's presence.",
