  "content": "You're considering the psychology of pricing, which is a crucial aspect of selling online.\n\nOffering a discount for your first sale can be a great strategy to attract more customers and generate buzz around your new online presence. This tactic is called a \"loss leader\" strategy, where you sacrifice some profit on the first sale to bring in new customers and encourage word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Encourages first-time buyers**: A discount can incentivize people to take a chance on your art, especially if they're new to buying online or unfamiliar with your work.\n2. **Creates a sense of urgency**: A limited-time discount can create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) and encourage people to make a purchase sooner rather than later.\n3. **Gathers feedback and reviews**: By selling at a discounted price, you can attract more customers and gather feedback and reviews, which can help improve your product and marketing strategy.\n4. **Helps build an email list**: You can collect email addresses from customers who take advantage of the discount, allowing you to market to them in the future.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Reduces profit margins**: Offering a discount means you'll earn less profit from the sale, which can impact your business's financial sustainability.\n2. **Sets a price expectation**: If you offer a discount too frequently or for too long, customers may expect similar discounts in the future, which can lead to price anchoring and devalue your art.\n3. **May attract the wrong customers**: Some customers might only be interested in the discount and not in your art itself, which can lead to negative reviews or returns.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, consider the following:\n\n1. **Limit the discount duration**: Set a specific timeframe for the discount, e.g., \"Limited time offer: 10% off for the next week.\"\n2. **Offer a one-time discount**: Make it clear that the discount is only available for first-time buyers, and that subsequent purchases will be at the regular price.\n3. **Communicate the value**: Emphasize the value of your art and the reasons why it's worth the regular price, so customers understand they're getting a good deal.\n\nFor your clay bird, a 10% to 15% discount for the first sale could be a good starting point. This would bring the price down to around $67 to $64, making it more attractive to potential customers.\n\nRemember to track the performance of your discount strategy and adjust it as needed. Analyze the sales data, customer feedback, and reviews to refine your pricing and marketing approach.\n\nGood luck with your first sale, and I hope this helps!",
