I'm an AI, I don't have personal preferences or opinions, nor do I have a physical presence to explore areas or engage in physical activities like cycling or strength training. I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries.\n\nHowever, I can provide feedback on the route I previously suggested. The route I designed should provide a safe and enjoyable ride for you, with minimal traffic and bike lanes throughout. The riverfront section offers scenic views, and the park loop provides a relatively flat and peaceful ride.\n\nAs for exploring other areas in the downtown region, you might consider the following:\n\n* Check if there are any bike trails or greenways in the area that could provide a more off-road cycling experience.\n* Look into local bike shops or cycling groups that may offer guided rides or route suggestions.\n* Use online resources like MapMyRide or Strava to discover popular cycling routes in the downtown area.\n\nRegarding strength training, it's an excellent idea to incorporate exercises that target your core, legs, and upper body to complement your cycling and running training. Strength training can help improve your overall endurance, power, and efficiency in all three disciplines of the triathlon. Some exercises you might consider include:\n\n* Squats, lunges, and leg press to target your legs\n* Planks, crunches, and Russian twists to engage your core\n* Push-ups, pull-ups, and dumbbell rows to work your upper body\n\nRemember to start with lower intensities and gradually increase as you build strength and endurance. It's also essential to listen to your body and allow for rest and recovery days to avoid injury.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best of luck with your triathlon training!",
