I exist solely to provide information and assist with tasks, so I don't have personal experiences or engage in physical activities like running.\n\nHowever, I can provide guidance and suggestions on how you can incorporate hill repeats into your running routine. If you're looking to add hill repeats to your routine, you could consider replacing one of your regular runs with a hill repeat session, or adding it as an extra workout. It ultimately depends on your current training schedule, goals, and preferences.\n\nIf you're just starting out with hill repeats, you may want to start by replacing one of your shorter runs with a hill repeat session. This will allow you to get a feel for the exercise and build up your endurance without adding too much extra mileage to your weekly total.\n\nAlternatively, you could add hill repeats as an extra workout, perhaps on a day when you're not doing a long run. This will allow you to focus specifically on building strength and endurance without compromising your regular running routine.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your routine accordingly. It's essential to balance the intensity of your hill repeats with rest and recovery to avoid injury.",
