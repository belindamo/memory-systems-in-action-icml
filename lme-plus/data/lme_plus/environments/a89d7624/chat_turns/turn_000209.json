  "content": "Yes, that's correct! In 1893, New Zealand became the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote in parliamentary elections. This was a major milestone in the history of women's suffrage and marked an important step towards greater equality between men and women. The right to vote was granted to women through the Electoral Act of 1893, which was passed by the New Zealand Parliament on September 19 of that year. The act granted all women over the age of 21 the right to vote and stand for office, regardless of their race or property ownership. The adoption of this act was largely the result of the tireless efforts of women's rights activists, who had been campaigning for women's suffrage for many years.",
