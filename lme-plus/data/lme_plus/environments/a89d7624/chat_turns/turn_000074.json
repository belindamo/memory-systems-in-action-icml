  "content": "I've been really inspired by Sarah's videos on layering glazes and creating textures, and I've been experimenting with those techniques on my new vase. I think it's going to have a really unique, one-of-a-kind look that will set it apart from my other pieces.\n\nYeah, I'm planning on sharing it on social media and at the art fair. I'm actually thinking of doing a Instagram story or Facebook live video to show off the vase and give people a sneak peek before the fair.\n\nAnd that's a great idea about custom commissions! I've had a few people ask me about doing custom pieces in the past, and I think with my new skills, I'd be able to take on more complex and unique projects. Do you think I should create a separate page on my website or social media profiles for custom commissions, or just advertise it through my regular channels?",
