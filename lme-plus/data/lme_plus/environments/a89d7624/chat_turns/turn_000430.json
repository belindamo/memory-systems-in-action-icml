  "content": "Option 1 should help you balance your lower body workouts and allow for proper recovery time.\n\nRegarding core exercises, it's great that you're thinking about incorporating them into your routine. While yoga does engage your core muscles to some extent, it's not always enough to provide a comprehensive core workout.\n\nAdding dedicated core exercises can help improve your overall core strength, stability, and overall athletic performance. Since you already have a solid foundation with yoga, you can focus on supplementing with exercises that target specific core muscle groups.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to get you started:\n\n1. Add 2-3 core exercises to your weightlifting sessions (e.g., planks, Russian twists, or leg raises).\n2. Incorporate core-focused exercises on your rest days or active recovery days (e.g., bodyweight exercises like bicycle crunches, flutter kicks, or bird dogs).\n3. Consider adding a dedicated core workout session (20-30 minutes) once a week, focusing on exercises like planks, side planks, woodchoppers, or Pallof press.\n\nRemember to start slow and gradually increase the intensity and difficulty as you build strength and endurance. It's also essential to focus on proper form and engagement to avoid injury.\n\nHere's an updated schedule incorporating core exercises:\n\n**Monday**\n\n* Morning: 30-minute yoga session (focus on gentle flows and flexibility)\n* Evening: Upper body weightlifting (focus on shoulders, biceps, and triceps) + 2-3 core exercises\n\n**Tuesday**\n\n* Morning: Lower body weightlifting (focus on legs and glutes) + 2-3 core exercises\n* Evening: Rest day or active recovery\n\n**Wednesday**\n\n* Morning: Rest day or active recovery\n* Evening: 30-minute yoga session (focus on balance and core strength)\n\n**Thursday**\n\n* Morning: 20-minute cardio session (high-intensity interval training or HIIT)\n* Evening: Rest day or active recovery\n\n**Friday**\n\n* Morning: Rest day or active recovery\n* Evening: Upper body weightlifting (focus on chest, back, and shoulders) + 2-3 core exercises\n\n**Saturday**\n\n* Morning: 30-minute outdoor activity (e.g., hiking, jogging, or cycling)\n* Evening: Rest day or active recovery\n\n**Sunday**\n\n* Morning: 60-minute yoga session (focus on restorative yoga or yin yoga for deep relaxation)\n* Evening: Rest day or active recovery\n\nFeel free to adjust the schedule as needed, and remember to prioritize proper form, technique, and recovery.",
