  "content": "When using a slower rise, you'll want to adjust the yeast amount and possibly the salt content to ensure the best results.\n\n**Yeast amount:**\n\n1. **Reduce yeast amount**: With a slower rise, you'll want to reduce the yeast amount to prevent over-fermentation. A good rule of thumb is to reduce the yeast by 25-50% compared to a standard recipe.\n2. **Consider the yeast type**: If you're using a sourdough starter, you may not need to add commercial yeast at all. However, if you're using a combination of sourdough starter and commercial yeast, reduce the commercial yeast amount accordingly.\n\n**Salt content:**\n\n1. **Keep salt content moderate**: Salt helps control yeast growth and can affect the fermentation process. With a slower rise, you may want to keep the salt content moderate (around 1-2% of the total flour weight) to prevent over-inhibition of yeast growth.\n2. **Consider the type of salt**: If you're using a slower rise, you may want to use a coarser, flakier salt (like Maldon or kosher salt) to help control yeast growth.\n\n**Other adjustments:**\n\n1. **Flour strength**: With a slower rise, you may want to use a stronger flour (higher protein content) to help develop the gluten structure and support the longer fermentation time.\n2. **Water temperature**: Keep the water temperature cooler (around 75\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F or 24\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) to slow down the fermentation process.\n3. **Fermentation time**: Monitor the fermentation time and adjust it based on the dough's progress. A slower rise may take longer, but you can still achieve great results with patience and attention.\n\nBy adjusting the yeast amount, salt content, and other factors, you can create a delicious Italian bread with a slower rise. Remember to monitor the dough's progress and make adjustments as needed to ensure the best results.",
