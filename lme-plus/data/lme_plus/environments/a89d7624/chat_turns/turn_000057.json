You'll not only save money but also experience the local culture.\n\nRegarding a part-time job, it's a great idea to supplement your scholarship! A part-time job can help you:\n\n1. Increase your income: Extra money can go towards savings, debt repayment, or covering unexpected expenses.\n2. Gain work experience: You'll develop new skills, build your resume, and make industry connections.\n3. Improve your time management: Balancing work and studies will help you prioritize tasks and manage your time more efficiently.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the impact on your studies and overall well-being. Make sure you:\n\n1. Check your scholarship terms: Ensure that taking on a part-time job won't affect your scholarship eligibility.\n2. Set realistic expectations: Don't overcommit yourself; 10-15 hours of work per week is a good starting point.\n3. Choose a job that fits your schedule: Select a job with flexible hours or one that's close to your university to minimize travel time.\n\nAssuming you find a part-time job that pays around $15-20 AUD per hour, and you work 12 hours a week, your additional monthly income would be:\n\n$15-20 AUD/hour x 12 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = $720-960 AUD per month\n\nThis extra income can significantly boost your budget. Let's reassess your budget allocation:\n\n* Essential Expenses (Needs): 50% of $2,500 (scholarship) + $720-960 (part-time job) = $1,250 + $360-480 = $1,610-1,730\n* Non-Essential Expenses (Wants): 30% of $2,500 (scholarship) + $720-960 (part-time job) = $750 + $216-288 = $966-1,038\n* Savings: 20% of $2,500 (scholarship) + $720-960 (part-time job) = $500 + $144-192 = $644-692\n\nWith a part-time job, you'll have more room for savings, entertainment, and personal expenses. However, remember to prioritize your studies and maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n\nBefore you start applying for jobs, consider the following:\n\n* Update your resume and LinkedIn profile to increase your chances of getting hired.\n* Look for job opportunities on campus, as they might offer flexible schedules and be more understanding of your student commitments.\n* Be prepared to discuss your availability and schedule with potential employers.\n\nHow do you feel about taking on a part-time job? Are you ready to start exploring job opportunities or do you have any concerns about balancing work and studies?",
