I'm excited to hear that you're committed to adding core exercises to your weightlifting sessions and focusing on proper form and engagement.\n\nRemember to be patient and consistent, and don't be afraid to adjust your routine as needed. It's great that you're starting with 20-30 second holds for planks and gradually increasing the duration as you build endurance. This will help you build a strong foundation and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nKeep in mind that core strength takes time to develop, so don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Stick to your routine, and with consistent effort, you'll start to notice improvements in your overall strength, stability, and athletic performance.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm here to help you achieve your fitness goals!\n\nRemember to stay hydrated, listen to your body, and get enough rest and recovery time. You got this!",
