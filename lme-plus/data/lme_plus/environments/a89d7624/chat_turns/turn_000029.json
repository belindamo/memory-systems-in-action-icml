  "content": "I'm happy to help you with setting reminders for your online meetings! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to directly set reminders on your device. But I can guide you on how to do it yourself.\n\nTo set reminders for your online meetings, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your calendar app (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Microsoft Outlook) on your device.\n2. Create a new event or appointment for Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2:00 PM.\n3. Add a reminder for each event, choosing the time and frequency that works best for you (e.g., 30 minutes before the meeting).\n4. Make sure to save the events and reminders.\n\nIf you want to set reminders on your phone, you can also use a reminder app like Any.do, Todoist, or Reminders (on iOS).\n\nIt's great to hear that you're enjoying your morning yoga classes! Consistency is key, so keep up the good work.\n\nIf you need help with anything else or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",
