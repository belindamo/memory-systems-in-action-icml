Since you're familiar with the roads around 5th street, I've incorporated that area into the route. Here's a suggested route for you:\n\n**Downtown 20-Mile Cycling Route**\n\n**Section 1: Warm-up (4 miles)**\n\n* Start at the sports store on 5th street where you bought your new running shoes.\n* Head east on 5th street towards Main street.\n* Turn left onto Main street and continue north for about 1 mile.\n* Turn right onto 10th avenue, which has a dedicated bike lane.\n\n**Section 2: Loop around the Park (6 miles)**\n\n* Continue on 10th avenue for about 2 miles until you reach the park.\n* Enter the park and take the bike path that loops around the perimeter. This section is relatively flat and has minimal traffic.\n* Exit the park and rejoin 10th avenue.\n\n**Section 3: Riverfront Ride (6 miles)**\n\n* Head south on 10th avenue towards the riverfront area.\n* Turn left onto Riverfront Drive, which has a dedicated bike path along the river.\n* Follow the bike path north along the river for about 3 miles, enjoying the scenic views.\n* Turn around at the north end of the path and head back south.\n\n**Section 4: Return to 5th Street (4 miles)**\n\n* Once you reach the south end of the riverfront path, turn left onto 10th avenue.\n* Continue north on 10th avenue for about 2 miles until you reach Main street.\n* Turn right onto Main street and head south for about 1 mile.\n* Turn left onto 5th street, which will take you back to the starting point.\n\nThis route should give you a good 20-mile ride with minimal traffic and bike lanes throughout. You can adjust the route as needed to fit your personal preferences or to add more distance. Make sure to stay safe, follow traffic laws, and enjoy your ride!",
