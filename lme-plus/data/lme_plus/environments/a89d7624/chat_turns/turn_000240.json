  "content": "Soy sauce is a staple in many kitchens! I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations.\n\nThere are several good brands and types of soy sauce out there, but here are a few popular ones:\n\n1. **Kikkoman**: A well-known and widely available brand, Kikkoman offers a range of soy sauces, including regular, low-sodium, and organic options.\n2. **Pearl River Bridge**: This brand is popular among Chinese cooks and offers a rich, savory flavor. They have various types, including light and dark soy sauce.\n3. **Nama Shoyu**: If you're looking for a high-quality, artisanal soy sauce, Nama Shoyu is a great option. It's made with high-quality ingredients and has a rich, complex flavor profile.\n4. **Tamari**: Tamari is a type of soy sauce that's gluten-free and has a slightly sweeter, nuttier flavor than regular soy sauce.\n\nWhen it comes to types of soy sauce, you can choose from:\n\n* **Light soy sauce**: Lighter in color and flavor, this is great for marinades and stir-fries.\n* **Dark soy sauce**: Thicker and richer, this is often used for braising and sauces.\n* **Regular soy sauce**: A balanced, all-purpose soy sauce for everyday cooking.\n\nAs for restocking your pantry staples, it's great that you're keeping track of your expenses! $85 for a grocery haul isn't bad, considering you've been doing a lot of cooking lately. You might want to consider making a list of the items you need to restock and prioritize the essentials.\n\nDo you have any specific pantry staples you're running low on, or would you like some suggestions on what to stock up on?",
