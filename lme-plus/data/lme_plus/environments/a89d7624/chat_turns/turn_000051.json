  "content": "Styling a leather jacket with your white off-the-shoulder top and flowy maxi skirt can add a cool, edgy touch to your outfit. Here are some tips to consider:\n\n**Add a contrasting texture**: The flowy maxi skirt and white off-the-shoulder top create a soft, feminine look. Adding a leather jacket introduces a contrasting texture that adds depth and interest to the outfit.\n\n**Balance the look**: Since the leather jacket is a bold piece, balance it with the flowy skirt and delicate top. You can do this by keeping the jacket open or slightly undone to reveal the top underneath.\n\n**Play with proportions**: The flowy maxi skirt creates a lot of volume, so balance it with the fitted leather jacket. You can also try layering a denim or suede jacket over the leather jacket for a more relaxed, layered look.\n\n**Add some edge with accessories**: To really drive home the edgy vibe, add some statement accessories like a chunky belt, bold earrings, or a fedora hat.\n\n**Try different ways to wear the jacket**: Don't be afraid to experiment with different ways to wear the leather jacket. You can wear it open, closed, or even tied around your waist for a more casual look.\n\nHere's an example of how you could style the outfit:\n\n* White off-the-shoulder top\n* Flowy maxi skirt\n* Black leather jacket (open or slightly undone)\n* Chunky belt to define your waist\n* Black ankle boots (like your Stuart Weitzman boots)\n* Bold earrings or a statement necklace to add some edge\n\nRemember, the key is to balance the look and have fun with it!",
