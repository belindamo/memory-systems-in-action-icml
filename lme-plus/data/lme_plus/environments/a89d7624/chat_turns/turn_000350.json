  "content": "You're planning to grab dinner at The Ship Rock Grille before the concert, and you're wondering if they have outdoor seating with a view of Red Rocks? Yes, they do!\n\nThe Ship Rock Grille has a large outdoor patio area with seating that offers stunning views of the Red Rocks Amphitheater. You can enjoy your meal while taking in the breathtaking scenery of the surrounding red rock formations. It's a perfect spot to relax and get ready for the concert.\n\nThe patio area is partially covered, providing shade from the sun during the day, and it's also heated during the cooler months, making it a comfortable spot to dine year-round. Plus, the patio is pet-friendly, so you can bring your furry friend along!\n\nKeep in mind that the patio can get busy, especially on concert nights, so it's a good idea to arrive early or make a reservation to ensure you can grab a table with a view. The Ship Rock Grille also offers indoor seating with large windows that offer views of the amphitheater, in case the patio is full.\n\nEnjoy your dinner and the views at The Ship Rock Grille before the concert!",
