End of April is a fantastic time to visit Hawaii, the weather is usually warm and sunny, and it's before the peak summer season, so you might be able to find some good deals on hotels and activities.\n\nSince you're planning the trip with friends, I'm sure you'll have an amazing time exploring the island together. Make sure to consider hotels that have amenities that cater to your group's needs, such as rooms with multiple beds, a pool, and a location that's close to the beach and other attractions.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider booking a hotel that offers activities and amenities that are geared towards groups, such as:\n\n* A hotel with a game room or lounge area where you can hang out and socialize\n* A hotel that offers group-friendly activities, such as surf lessons or snorkeling trips\n* A hotel with a restaurant or bar that can accommodate large groups\n* A hotel that offers a free breakfast or happy hour, which can be a great way to start or end the day with your friends\n\nSome popular hotels in Waikiki that might fit the bill include:\n\n* The Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort & Spa, which has a large pool area and a game room\n* The Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa, which has a rooftop pool and a bar with live music\n* The Alohilani Resort Waikiki Beach, which has a rooftop pool and a restaurant with a focus on local cuisine\n\nRemember to also consider the location of the hotel and how it will impact your plans. If you want to be close to the beach, look for hotels that are located on or near the beach. If you want to be close to the action, look for hotels that are located in the heart of Waikiki.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you and your friends will have an amazing time in Hawaii!",
