  "content": "Sure, here's an example code snippet in Python for making a fetch request using the `requests` library:\n```python\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('https://example.com/data')\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    print(data)  # Do something with the data\nelse:\n    print(f\"Request failed with status code {response.status_code}\")\n```\nIn this example, we're using the `requests` library to make a GET request to the URL `https://example.com/data`. We're checking the `status_code` attribute of the response object to make sure that the request was successful (status code 200).\n\nIf the request was successful, we're using the `json()` method to convert the response content to a Python object. We can then do something with this data (in this example, we're simply printing it to the console).\n\nIf the request failed for some reason, we're printing an error message indicating the status code that was returned.",
