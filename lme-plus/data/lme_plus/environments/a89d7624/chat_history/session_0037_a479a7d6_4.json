For a California trip, here are some essentials you might consider adding to your list:\n\n1. **Sunscreen and sun protection**: California sun can be intense, so pack a broad-spectrum sunscreen with high SPF, lip balm, and a hat or sunglasses to protect your skin and eyes.\n2. **Lightweight and breathable clothing**: California's weather can be quite warm, especially in the summer months.

You may also want to consider packing a small daypack or backpack for day trips and outings.\n\nLastly, since you're working on improving your packing habits, here are a few general tips:\n\n* Roll your clothes to save space and reduce wrinkles.\n* Pack multipurpose items, like a sarong that can serve as a blanket, towel, or dress.\n* Wear your heaviest or bulkiest items (like your coat or boots) on the plane to save space in your luggage.\n* Consider packing a packing cube or organizers to keep your belongings organized and easy to find.\n\nSafe travels to California, and enjoy your trip!"
