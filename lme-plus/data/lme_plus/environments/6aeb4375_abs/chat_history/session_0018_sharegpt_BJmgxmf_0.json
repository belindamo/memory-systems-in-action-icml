      "content": "CDHR Preamble: \"Reaffirming the civilizing and historical role of the Islamic Ummah which Allah made as the best nation that has given mankind a universal and well-balanced civilization, in which harmony is established between this life and the hereafter and knowledge is combined with faith; and realizing that the Islamic Ummah which Allah has guided and entrusted with implementing its Shariah (Divine Law) is the most distinguished Ummah and the best nation ever raised up for mankind;\"\n\nComment: The CDHR preamble does not directly address the idea of disregarding and contempt for human rights leading to barbarous acts. Instead, it emphasizes the historical role and importance of the Islamic Ummah in implementing Shariah law. This may reflect a different emphasis in the values and principles underpinning the CDHR compared to the UDHR."

The court shall be obligated, in the course of achieving justice, to consult the Shari\u2019ah (Divine Law).\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 14 addresses the right to a fair trial, but with the qualification that the trial must be conducted in an Islamic manner and that the court must consult the Shari\u2019ah in achieving justice. This differs from the UDHR Article 10, which emphasizes the importance of a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of rights and obligations, without any reference to a particular legal or religious tradition."

The punishment of any offence is left to the discretion of the court, which must follow the guidelines and basis for judgement laid down in the Shari'ah.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 19 does not directly address the idea of the presumption of innocence until proven guilty in a public trial, nor does it provide any specific guarantees for the defense. Instead, it emphasizes that the punishment for any offense must be in accordance with the Shari'ah, and the discretion of the court must follow the guidelines and basis for judgement laid down in the Shari'ah. This differs from the UDHR Article 11, which specifies the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a public trial with all the necessary guarantees for the defense."

      "content": "No one shall be held guilty of any penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed.

Everyone shall have the right to advocate what is right, and propagate what is good, and warn against what is wrong and evil according to the norms of Islamic Shari'ah.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 22 does not directly address the idea of the prohibition of retroactive penal legislation and the prohibition of imposing heavier penalties than those applicable at the time of the offense. Instead, it emphasizes the right to express one's opinion freely, subject to the principles of the Shari'ah. This differs from the UDHR Article 15, which specifically addresses the prohibition of retroactive penal legislation and the prohibition of imposing heavier penalties than those applicable at the time of the offense."

The CDHR does not appear to have an article that directly corresponds to UDHR Article 12."

This differs from the UDHR Article 13, which emphasizes the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state, without any religious or cultural qualification."

It is prohibited to exercise any form of compulsion on man or to exploit his poverty or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to atheism.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 10 does not address the idea of the right to leave any country, including one's own, and to return to their country. Instead, it emphasizes the prohibition of exercising any form of compulsion on man or exploiting their poverty or ignorance to convert them to another religion or atheism. This differs from the UDHR Article 13, which specifically addresses the right to leave any country and to return to one's own country, without any mention of religion or coercion."

The country sought refuge in shall be obliged to provide protection to him against any danger and to provide him with any aid he may require. If it happens to be established that a person has sought refuge in another country for any reason of a criminal nature, or because he was involved in some criminal act, or if it should be proved that he has committed a breach of peace in the country he has come from, he shall not be entitled to any such asylum or protection.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 12 does address the right to seek asylum, but it qualifies this right within the framework of the Shari'ah and includes the caveat that a person is not entitled to asylum or protection if they have committed a criminal act or a breach of peace in their country of origin. This differs from the UDHR Article 14, which emphasizes the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution, without any mention of religious or legal qualifications."

Actions leading to suspension of individual's freedom such as the imposition of house arrest, or the prohibition of free movement shall not be taken unless such is necessary in the interest of Islam and its security.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 19 does not directly address the idea presented in UDHR Article 14, which concerns the right to seek asylum from persecution. CDHR Article 19 emphasizes the prohibition of arbitrary arrest or detention and limits actions that may lead to the suspension of an individual's freedom unless deemed necessary in the interest of Islam and its security. The CDHR does not mention the right to seek asylum, nor any exceptions to this right, as stated in UDHR Article 14."
