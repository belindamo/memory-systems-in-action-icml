  "content": "That's great advice, thanks! I'll definitely follow those steps when introducing a new cat to Luna. I think I'll start by preparing a separate room for the new cat and getting Luna used to the new cat's scent. I'll also make sure to update Luna's vaccinations and health checks before bringing the new cat home. Do you have any recommendations for how to find a compatible cat to pair with Luna? I've been browsing Petfinder and local rescue websites, but I'm not sure what to look for in a compatible cat.",
