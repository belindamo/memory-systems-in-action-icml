  "content": "CDHR Article 22: \"Everyone shall have the right to express his opinion freely in such manner as would not be contrary to the principles of the Shari'ah. Everyone shall have the right to advocate what is right, and propagate what is good, and warn against what is wrong and evil according to the norms of Islamic Shari'ah.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 22 does not directly address the idea of the prohibition of retroactive penal legislation and the prohibition of imposing heavier penalties than those applicable at the time of the offense. Instead, it emphasizes the right to express one's opinion freely, subject to the principles of the Shari'ah. This differs from the UDHR Article 15, which specifically addresses the prohibition of retroactive penal legislation and the prohibition of imposing heavier penalties than those applicable at the time of the offense.",
