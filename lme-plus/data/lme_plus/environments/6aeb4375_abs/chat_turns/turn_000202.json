It's a beautiful way to symbolize the release of old patterns and the renewal of the spirit. I'm excited to see how this will unfold.\n\nMoving on, I was thinking about the journaling exercise you mentioned earlier. Would you like to incorporate a prompt or question related to the theme of renewal and reflection? Perhaps something like \"What do I want to release or let go of in my life?\" or \"What are my intentions for personal growth and renewal during this retreat?\"",
