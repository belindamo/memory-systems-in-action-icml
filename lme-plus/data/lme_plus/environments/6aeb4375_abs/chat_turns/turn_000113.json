It ushered in the era of industrialization, innovation, and mass production, leading to the development of new technologies, urbanization, and a significant shift in the way people lived and worked.\n\nMoreover, the Age of Exploration (15th to 17th centuries) was also a significant event that led to the discovery of new lands, trade routes, and cultures, facilitating the exchange of ideas and goods between Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. This period also contributed to the formation of new empires, colonization, and the spread of Christianity.\n\nHowever, the Vikings were undoubtedly among the most influential groups in European history. The sheer scope of their impact on various aspects of life across the continent is evidence of their significance.",
