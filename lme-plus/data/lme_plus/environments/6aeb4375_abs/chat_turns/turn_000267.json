  "content": "Yes, after the first few weeks of life, when the calf is able to stand and walk, it starts to nibble on vegetation, but still, milk is the main source of food for the calf during the first year of life. The mother giraffe's milk provides all the necessary nutrients for the calf's growth and development, including protein, fat, lactose, vitamins, and minerals. As the calf grows older, it will start to eat more solid food, but will continue to nurse from the mother until the lactation period ends. Giraffes have a unique digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from tough, fibrous plant material, which they will start to eat more of as they mature.",
