Since you mentioned you're interested in camping, I'd recommend making a reservation at Upper Pines Campground, as it's a popular spot with amenities like flush toilets and potable water. If you're looking for a more rustic experience, Tuolumne Meadows Campground is a great option, but keep in mind it's only accessible via Highway 120.\n\nFor hiking, I'd suggest the Mist Trail to Vernal Fall. It's a challenging hike, but the scenic views of Vernal Fall and the Merced River are breathtaking. If you're looking for a more moderate hike, the Four Mile Trail offers stunning views of Yosemite Valley and the surrounding mountains.\n\nRemember to book your campsite and activities well in advance, especially during peak season. And don't forget to store your food and trash properly to avoid encounters with black bears!\n\nWhat's your preferred hiking style? Are you looking for a leisurely stroll or a more challenging adventure?",
