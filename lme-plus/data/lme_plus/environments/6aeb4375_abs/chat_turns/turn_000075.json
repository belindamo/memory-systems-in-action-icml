  "content": "I understand your concern. In such situations, you may want to take an assertive yet composed approach to deal with the problem. Here are a few steps that might help:\n\n1. Politely ask them to move away without causing a scene. Be assertive yet respectful.\n\n2. If this doesn't work, try creating a physical barrier using your belongings or bag.\n\n3. You could also try moving to a different space or seat, so you are not in close proximity to them.\n\n4. If the situation continues, request help from an authority figure as discreetly as possible.\n\nIt's important to remember that you have the right to be comfortable in your personal space, and you deserve to be treated with respect. If your request is not being respected, and you feel uncomfortable, don't hesitate to seek help from authorities.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can protect your personal space without disrupting the environment or attracting unwanted attention to yourself.",
