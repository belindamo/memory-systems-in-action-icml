  "content": "Yes, giraffes are fascinating animals and can run quite fast when needed. Although they look slow and graceful, they can reach speeds of up to 35 miles per hour (56 km/hr) over short distances of about 200 yards (182 meters). Giraffes have elongated legs that are able to generate a powerful forward thrust, which allows them to maintain high speeds for short periods of time. Running at such speeds helps giraffes escape potential predators like lions and hyenas, which although are able to catch up with them but only after a lot of effort.",
