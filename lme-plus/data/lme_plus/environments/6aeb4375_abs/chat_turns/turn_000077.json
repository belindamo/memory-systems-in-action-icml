  "content": "Yes, you can choose to ignore the situation and move on, but you have to understand that such behavior could become problematic later on. If you don\u2019t respect your own boundaries, why will someone else respect them? It is your right to your personal space, and you do not have to tolerate infringing behavior if it\u2019s making you uncomfortable. Sometimes, gentle confrontation can go a long way in settling things without causing escalation. At the same time, not acknowledging the problem doesn't mean it just goes away.\n\nIf you decide to ignore the situation, try to find a middle ground where you can still be comfortable. Try moving slightly away from the individual who's invading your personal space, or use your own belongings to create a barrier. Ultimately, whether or not to confront the person depends on your own comfort levels and the specific situation at hand.",
