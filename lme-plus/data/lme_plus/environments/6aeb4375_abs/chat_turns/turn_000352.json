  "content": "Turkey and cheese sandwiches, sliced apples, and grapes are a winning combination for a picnic! \n\nTo keep the sandwiches fresh during the picnic, here are a few tips:\n\n1. **Use a cooler**: If you have a cooler, pack the sandwiches in it with some ice packs to keep them at a safe temperature (below 40\u00b0F or 4\u00b0C). This is especially important if you're planning a longer picnic or if the weather is warm.\n2. **Wrap sandwiches individually**: Wrap each sandwich in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent them from getting crushed or drying out. You can also use reusable containers or bags with a tight seal.\n3. **Pack in a shaded area**: If you don't have a cooler, try to pack the sandwiches in a shaded area of your picnic basket or backpack to keep them out of direct sunlight.\n4. **Use a thermally insulated bag**: If you have a thermally insulated bag, use it to keep the sandwiches warm or cool. These bags are designed to keep food at a consistent temperature for several hours.\n5. **Pack just before leaving**: Try to assemble the sandwiches just before leaving for the picnic to ensure they're fresh and don't sit out for too long.\n\nFor the juice boxes, you can pack them in a separate container or bag with some ice packs to keep them cool. You might also consider packing some water bottles or refillable containers to encourage the kids to drink plenty of water during the picnic.\n\nNow that you have your menu and packing strategy in place, I hope you're all set for a fun and delicious picnic!",
