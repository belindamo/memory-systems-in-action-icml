As I mentioned earlier, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I don't recall you wearing black leather boots to a dinner party on January 10th or any other date. You're having a conversation with me, and I'm trying to help you with your outfit concerns.\n\nHowever, I can still offer you general advice! If you've worn the same boots to a dinner party before and received compliments, it's likely they worked well in that setting. But, it's always a good idea to consider the specific occasion, venue, and dress code (if any) before deciding on an outfit.\n\nIf you're still unsure about the dressiness of the boots, you could try pairing them with the dark blue dress and see how you feel. Take a few selfies, ask a friend or family member for their honest opinion, or even try on a few different combinations to get a sense of what works best.\n\nRemember, fashion is all about expressing yourself and feeling confident in what you're wearing. If you feel great in the boots and dress, you'll likely look great too!",
