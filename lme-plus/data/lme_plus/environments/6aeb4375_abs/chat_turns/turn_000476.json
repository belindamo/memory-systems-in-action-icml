  "content": "Let's go to the next section, with Tommy feeling increasingly isolated and struggling to cope with the pressures of middle school. Start with the end of the school, Tommy getting his bike and riding it home and some teens in a car yell at him (provide specifics) and even threaten him with the car in some way. He gets home and goes to his room has an emotional moment (not crying, just some type of emotional thing - maybe slamming the door?) and then engages in some geeky activity (perhaps something that would be leftover from elementary school). Then he tries to study his and do some homework. 700 words. Please please please DON'T narrate his feeling and make sense of them, rather, demonstrate his emoitonal state by descriving whats in his room what activity he is doing. Focus on description - even on how he looks and what he is wearing?",
