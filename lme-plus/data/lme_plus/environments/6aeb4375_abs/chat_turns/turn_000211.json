The court shall be obligated, in the course of achieving justice, to consult the Shari\u2019ah (Divine Law).\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 14 addresses the right to a fair trial, but with the qualification that the trial must be conducted in an Islamic manner and that the court must consult the Shari\u2019ah in achieving justice. This differs from the UDHR Article 10, which emphasizes the importance of a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of rights and obligations, without any reference to a particular legal or religious tradition.",
