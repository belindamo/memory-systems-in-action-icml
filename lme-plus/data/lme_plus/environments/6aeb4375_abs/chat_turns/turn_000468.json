  "content": "The FurHaven Pet Products Cat Tree is a fantastic choice! The carpeted surfaces are indeed easy to clean, and FurHaven uses a high-quality, plush carpet that's designed to withstand scratching and clawing. The carpet is also removable and machine washable, making it easy to keep clean and fresh.\n\nAs for climbing, the FurHaven Cat Tree is designed with ease of access in mind. The multiple levels are spaced comfortably, allowing Luna to climb up and down with ease. The perches and ledges are also wide and sturdy, providing a secure surface for your cat to land on. The carpeted surfaces will also provide good traction, making it easier for Luna to grip and climb.\n\nIt's great to hear that you washed Luna's favorite blanket! Cats have a strong sense of smell and can be very particular about their bedding and blankets. Washing it regularly can help keep it fresh and clean, and it's wonderful that you're taking the time to do so.\n\nYou might consider placing the blanket on the FurHaven Cat Tree, perhaps on one of the perches or in the hammock. This can help make the cat tree feel more inviting and comfortable for Luna, and she may even start to associate the cat tree with her favorite blanket.\n\nOne more tip: when introducing the new cat tree, you might want to place it near Luna's favorite sleeping spot or where she likes to relax. This can help her feel more comfortable and inclined to explore the new structure.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure Luna will love her new FurHaven Cat Tree!",
