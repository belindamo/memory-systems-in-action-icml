  "content": "Including a brief mention of your grandmother's passing can be a thoughtful way to provide context for guests who may not be aware of her passing. However, it's essential to consider the tone and phrasing of the invitation to ensure it remains respectful and celebratory.\n\n**Including the Date of Passing**\n\nMentioning the date of passing, August 15th, 2022, in the invitation is a personal decision. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Keep it brief**: If you do decide to include the date, keep the mention brief and concise. You can simply state \"Grandma Jean passed away on August 15th, 2022\" or \"After a life well-lived, Grandma Jean passed away on August 15th, 2022.\"\n2. **Focus on the celebration**: Remember, the primary focus of the invitation is to celebrate your grandmother's life, not to dwell on her passing. Keep the tone positive and uplifting.\n3. **Consider the audience**: If you're sending the invitation to a wide range of guests, including those who may not have been close to your grandmother, it might be helpful to provide some context. However, if the guests are primarily close family and friends, they may already be aware of the details.\n\n**Example Wording**\n\nHere's an example of how you could mention the date of passing in the invitation:\n\n\"You are invited to join us for a Celebration of Life in memory of our beloved Grandma Jean Smith, who passed away on August 15th, 2022. We will gather to share stories, memories, and reflections on her life, love, and legacy. A reception will follow the service.\n\nPlease join us as we celebrate her life and cherish the memories we shared with her.\"\n\nAlternatively, you could omit the date and focus on the celebration of her life:\n\n\"You are invited to join us for a Celebration of Life in memory of our beloved Grandma Jean Smith. After a life filled with love, laughter, and adventure, she left us too soon. We will gather to share stories, memories, and reflections on her life, love, and legacy. A reception will follow the service.\n\nPlease join us as we celebrate her life and cherish the memories we shared with her.\"\n\nUltimately, the decision to include the date of passing is up to you and your family. If you do choose to include it, make sure it's done tastefully and doesn't overshadow the celebratory tone of the invitation.",
