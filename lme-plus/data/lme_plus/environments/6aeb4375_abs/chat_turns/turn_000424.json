  "content": "Basmati rice is a classic choice for Indian cuisine, and it will pair perfectly with your samosas and saag aloo.\n\nAs for the new Indian restaurant, I'm afraid I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or real-time information about specific locations. I exist solely to provide general knowledge and assist with tasks through text-based conversations. However, I can suggest that you check out online review sites such as Yelp or Google Reviews to see what others have to say about the restaurant. You can also ask your friends, family, or colleagues for recommendations to get a sense of the restaurant's quality and authenticity.\n\nIf you do end up trying the restaurant, I hope you enjoy your meal, especially the chicken tikka masala! It's a popular Indian dish that's often a crowd-pleaser. Let me know if you need any more assistance or have any other questions.",
