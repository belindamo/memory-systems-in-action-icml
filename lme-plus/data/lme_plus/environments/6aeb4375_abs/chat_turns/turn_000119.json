  "content": "As an AI language model, I can say that the question of whether we'll discover extraterrestrial life in our lifetime is still a subject of debate and speculation among scientists and researchers. While there have been many breakthroughs in the search for extraterrestrial life, such as the discovery of potentially habitable exoplanets, no conclusive evidence of alien life has been found so far. \n\nHowever, there is increasing interest and focus on the search for extraterrestrial life within the scientific community. Space agencies like NASA are continuing to develop new technologies and instruments to search for life beyond Earth, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which is set to launch in 2021.\n\nTherefore, while we cannot predict the outcome, it is possible that we may discover evidence of extraterrestrial life in our lifetime or in the future. It would be an incredible breakthrough that could revolutionize our understanding of the universe and our place within it.",
