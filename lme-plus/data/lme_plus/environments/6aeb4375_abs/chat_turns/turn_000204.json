I especially like the one about gratitude and release - it's so important to acknowledge what we're letting go of and what we're making space for.\n\nI was thinking, since we're incorporating the water and herb ritual into the welcome ceremony, we could also tie it into the journaling exercise. Maybe we could have participants write down something they want to release or let go of on a small piece of paper, and then have them symbolically release it into the water during the ceremony. It could be a powerful way to visualize and manifest their intentions.\n\nWhat do you think? Would that be a good way to tie the two exercises together?",
