  "content": "CDHR Article 10: \"Islam is the religion of true unspoiled nature. It is prohibited to exercise any form of compulsion on man or to exploit his poverty or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to atheism.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 10 does not address the idea of the right to leave any country, including one's own, and to return to their country. Instead, it emphasizes the prohibition of exercising any form of compulsion on man or exploiting their poverty or ignorance to convert them to another religion or atheism. This differs from the UDHR Article 13, which specifically addresses the right to leave any country and to return to one's own country, without any mention of religion or coercion.",
