That's a great find!\n\nDetermining the rarity of cards from the original 1995 set can be a bit challenging, but I'm happy to help you out. Here's a brief guide to get you started:\n\n**Rarity Symbols:**\nIn the original 1995 set, rarity is indicated by a symbol in the bottom right corner of each card. The symbols are:\n\n* Circle (): Common\n* Diamond (): Uncommon\n* Star (): Rare\n* Holographic Foil Stamp (): Holographic Rare (only on certain rare cards)\n\n**Holographic Cards:**\nHolographic cards are a special subset of rare cards that feature a shiny, holographic foil stamp. These cards are particularly valuable and highly sought after. In the 1995 set, holographic cards are only found in booster packs and have a unique holographic foil stamp.\n\n**Card Numbering:**\nEach card in the 1995 set has a unique card number, ranging from 1 to 102. The card number can give you an idea of the card's rarity. Generally, cards with lower numbers (1-30) are more common, while cards with higher numbers (70-102) are rarer.\n\n**Card Condition:**\nThe condition of your cards also affects their value and desirability. Cards in near-mint condition, with minimal wear and tear, are generally more valuable than those that are worn or damaged.\n\n**Checklists and Price Guides:**\nTo get a better understanding of the rarity and value of your cards, I recommend consulting online price guides, such as Beckett Grading Services or PSA CardFacts. You can also find checklists and rarity guides online, which can help you identify the cards in your booster pack and their corresponding rarity.\n\n**Open Your Pack and Enjoy!**\nNow that you know the basics, it's time to open your booster pack and start exploring! Take your time, carefully remove the cards from the pack, and examine each one. Check the rarity symbol, card number, and condition to get an idea of what you've got. Who knows, you might have pulled a rare holographic card or a highly sought-after Pok\u00e9mon!\n\nRemember to handle your cards with care, as they can be fragile and valuable. Consider getting a protective sleeve and top-loader to store your cards and keep them in mint condition.\n\nHappy collecting, and I hope you enjoy your 1995 Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game booster pack!",
