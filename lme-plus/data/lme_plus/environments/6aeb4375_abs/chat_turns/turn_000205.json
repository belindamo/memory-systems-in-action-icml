The act of writing down what they want to release and then symbolically letting it go into the water will help them to:\n\n1. Acknowledge and process their emotions\n2. Release attachments to old patterns or habits\n3. Create space for new growth and renewal\n4. Visualize and manifest their intentions\n\nThis exercise will also help participants to connect with the theme of renewal and reflection on a deeper level, and the water and herb ritual will provide a beautiful, symbolic way to seal their intentions.\n\nHere's an updated outline for the journaling exercise and water and herb ritual:\n\n**Journaling Exercise: Reflection and Release**\n\n1. Distribute journals or paper and pens/pencils to each participant.\n2. Introduce the journaling exercise and explain that it's a personal reflection time to explore their thoughts, feelings, and intentions.\n3. Provide the prompt or question, such as \"What do I want to release or let go of in my life?\"\n4. Encourage participants to take 10-15 minutes to write, reflect, and explore their thoughts.\n5. After the journaling exercise, ask participants to tear out the page or write down their answer on a small piece of paper.\n\n**Water and Herb Ritual: Symbolic Release**\n\n1. Place a small bowl of water and a few sprigs of rosemary or lavender in the center of the circle.\n2. Invite participants to come forward and symbolically release their written intention into the water.\n3. As they release the paper, encourage them to take a deep breath, let go of any attachments, and visualize their intention being released and transformed.\n4. After everyone has released their intention, take a moment of silence to reflect on the collective energy and intention of the group.\n\nThis is a beautiful way to tie the journaling exercise and water and herb ritual together, and I think it will create a powerful and memorable experience for the participants.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify in this exercise?",
