  "content": "Certainly! Here's an example of a research question that could be investigated in a laboratory experiment:\n\nResearch Question: Does exposure to blue wavelength light during sleep affect the amount of melatonin produced by the body? Hypothesis: If participants are exposed to blue light during sleep, then they will produce less melatonin than participants who are not exposed to blue light. Independent Variable: Exposure to blue wavelength light during sleep. Dependent Variable: Amount of melatonin produced by the body. Experiment Design: Participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group (exposed to blue light during sleep) or the control group (not exposed to blue light during sleep). Melatonin levels will be measured using blood or saliva samples taken at regular intervals during the night. By analyzing the data and comparing the melatonin levels between the two groups, the study can determine whether exposure to blue light during sleep affects the amount of melatonin produced by the body.",
