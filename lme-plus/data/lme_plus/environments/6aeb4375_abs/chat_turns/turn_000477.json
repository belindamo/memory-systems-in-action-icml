  "content": "Tommy sighed with relief as he finally got out of the school building. He had hoped the teasing and insults would be left behind with the walls of the school, but he was wrong. A group of older teens in a car sped by him and yelled out their window. \"Hey, nerd!\" one of them shouted. \"Watch out or we might just run you over!\" Tommy was frozen in place for a moment, heart racing, until they drove away.\n\nHe got on his bike and rode the short distance to his house, trying to shake off the feeling of dread. When he got home, he threw his backpack on the floor and went straight to his room. The walls were adorned with posters of his favorite comic book characters and action figures were scattered on the shelves. He sat down at his desk and opened up his laptop, hoping to distract himself with some of his favorite online forums.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he slammed the laptop shut and let out a frustrated groan. He felt disconnected from everything and everyone around him. He got up and walked over to his bookshelf, looking for something to take his mind off of the day's events. He settled on an old science fiction novel that he had read a dozen times before.\n\nAs he began to read, he felt his heart rate slow and his breathing return to normal. He was able to escape the cruel reality of his day and become lost in a world of spaceships and distant planets.\n\nAfter a while, he put down the book and opened up his textbook, determined to get some studying done. He had always been a good student, and he hoped that his grades would provide some sense of validation in a world where he felt constantly put down.\n\nBut as he read the pages, he found himself unable to concentrate. He felt like he was drowning in a sea of words and numbers, and no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't keep up.\n\nHe let out a frustrated growl and slammed his textbook shut. He sat back in his chair and looked around his room. His eye caught on a small Lego set that he had built when he was much younger. He hesitated for a moment, then got up and started putting the pieces together.\n\nAs he built, he felt his mind relax and his thoughts wander. For a moment, he forgot about the teasing and the isolation and just focused on the simple task at hand. It was a small moment of peace, but it was enough to make him feel just a little bit better.\n\nEventually, he finished the Lego set and looked at his clock. He realized that he had spent much more time building than he had intended and now had a pile of homework to do. He let out a sigh and picked up his textbook again, determined to get through the work, even if it took all night.",
