  "content": "CDHR Article 19: \"There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Shari'ah. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. Actions leading to suspension of individual's freedom such as the imposition of house arrest, or the prohibition of free movement shall not be taken unless such is necessary in the interest of Islam and its security.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 19 does not directly address the idea presented in UDHR Article 14, which concerns the right to seek asylum from persecution. CDHR Article 19 emphasizes the prohibition of arbitrary arrest or detention and limits actions that may lead to the suspension of an individual's freedom unless deemed necessary in the interest of Islam and its security. The CDHR does not mention the right to seek asylum, nor any exceptions to this right, as stated in UDHR Article 14.",
