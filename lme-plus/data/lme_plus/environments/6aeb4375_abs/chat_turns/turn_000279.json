Designating the area as protected and preventing further deterioration would be a positive step towards conserving and restoring the ecosystem. However, it should be noted that the degree of damage and the time it takes for recovery can vary and depend on various factors such as the nature and intensity of the disturbance, current environmental conditions, and available resources for conservation and restoration efforts. Consistent and long-term efforts to improve water quality, restore habitats, and protect vulnerable species through policies and regulations can help sustainably manage the ecosystem and support its recovery.",
