Remember to have fun, be kind to yourself, and enjoy the process of learning and growing.\n\nPlease do keep me updated on how the class goes! I'd love to hear about your experience, what you learn, and how you feel about the style. It's always great to share our experiences and learn from each other.\n\nRemember, dance is a journey, not a destination. It's about growth, self-expression, and having fun. You're already taking a huge step by trying something new, and that takes a lot of courage. Be proud of yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need any further advice, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I'm always here to help and support you on your dance journey!\n\nBreak a leg (not literally, of course!) and have an amazing time in your contemporary dance class!",
