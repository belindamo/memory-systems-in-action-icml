The Revell 1/48 F-15E Strike Eagle is a great choice, and I'm sure you're learning a lot from it.\n\nConsidering your experience, I think you're ready to tackle most of the car kits I mentioned earlier. However, some kits might be more suitable for you than others. Here's a breakdown of the kits I listed earlier, with a difficulty level assessment based on your experience:\n\n**Easier to Moderate:**\n\n1. Revell '69 Chevrolet Camaro SS (kit #85-4231) - This kit is a great choice for you. It's a well-engineered kit with relatively simple construction and few parts. The Camaro's design is also quite forgiving, making it an excellent choice for practicing your skills.\n2. Revell '68 Shelby Mustang GT500 (kit #85-4241) - Similar to the Camaro, this kit is well-designed and has a moderate part count. The Mustang's lines are a bit more complex than the Camaro's, but it's still a great choice for your skill level.\n\n**Moderate to Challenging:**\n\n1. Tamiya Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 (kit #24343) - This kit is a step up in complexity, but still within your reach. It has a higher part count and more intricate details, but Tamiya's instructions and engineering are generally excellent.\n2. Aoshima Honda NSX (kit #05035) - This kit has a moderate part count and some complex curves, but it's still a great choice for practicing your skills. Be prepared to spend some time on the bodywork and paint.\n\n**Challenging:**\n\n1. Tamiya Nissan GT-R (R35) (kit #24355) - This kit has a high part count, complex engine and chassis details, and requires more advanced techniques like multi-part bodywork and intricate paint masks. While it's still possible for you to tackle, it might be more challenging than the others.\n2. Italeri Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder (kit #3644) - This kit has a high part count, complex curves, and requires more advanced techniques like photo-etch and delicate assembly. It's a beautiful kit, but it might be more suitable for someone with more experience.\n\nConsidering your current project, the Revell 1/48 F-15E Strike Eagle, you're likely developing skills that will translate well to car kits. The F-15E has a higher part count and more complex details than some of the car kits mentioned, so you're building a strong foundation.\n\nIf you're looking for a new challenge, I'd recommend starting with the Revell '69 Chevrolet Camaro SS or the Revell '68 Shelby Mustang GT500. Both kits are well-suited for your skill level, and you'll have a great opportunity to practice your skills and build confidence.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a kit that you're excited to build and enjoy the process!",
