Lay the shirt flat and cut off the sleeves, collar and bottom hem. \n2. Cut along the side seams to create two separate pieces of fabric.\n3. Iron the pieces of fabric flat.\n4. Place the two pieces of fabric on top of each other, right sides facing each other.\n5. Pin the sides together, leaving the top open.\n6. Sew along the sides with a sewing machine or needle and thread, using a \u00bc inch seam allowance. \n7. Turn the bag right side out and fold the opening down about \u00bd inch, then iron it flat. \n8. Fold the opening down again, about 1 \u00bd inches this time. Pin it in place.\n9. Sew around the folded edge to create a hem, leaving a \u00bd inch gap on each side of the bag opening.\n10. Cut four strips of fabric from the leftover scraps of the shirt. They should each measure about 1 inch wide and 12 inches long.\n11. Fold each strip in half lengthwise and iron it flat. Then unfold it and fold each side in towards the center fold, and iron it flat again.\n12. Fold each strip in half again and sew along the length of the strip to close it. Repeat for all four strips.\n13. Attach the strips to the inside of the bag at the top, in line with the gap in the hem. Sew them securely, ensuring the straps are even on each side.\n14. Fold the bag in half along the hem, with the straps inside, and sew along the bottom to create the final seam. \n15. Turn the bag right side out, and it's ready to use!\n\nYou now have a tote bag made from a recycled cotton shirt that is both eco-friendly and fashionable.",
