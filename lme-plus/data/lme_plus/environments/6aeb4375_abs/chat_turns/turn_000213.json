  "content": "CDHR Article 19: \"There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Shari'ah. The punishment of any offence is left to the discretion of the court, which must follow the guidelines and basis for judgement laid down in the Shari'ah.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 19 does not directly address the idea of the presumption of innocence until proven guilty in a public trial, nor does it provide any specific guarantees for the defense. Instead, it emphasizes that the punishment for any offense must be in accordance with the Shari'ah, and the discretion of the court must follow the guidelines and basis for judgement laid down in the Shari'ah. This differs from the UDHR Article 11, which specifies the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a public trial with all the necessary guarantees for the defense.",
