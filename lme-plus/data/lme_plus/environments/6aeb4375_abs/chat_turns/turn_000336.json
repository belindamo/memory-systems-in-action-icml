  "content": "I think there might be some confusion here! Galarian Pok\u00e9mon figures are from the Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield series, which is a much newer generation of Pok\u00e9mon. The figures you received are likely from the 2019-2022 era, whereas the 1995 Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game set is from the original Base Set, which is a completely different generation.\n\nThe value of your 1995 Pok\u00e9mon cards is not directly affected by the Galarian Pok\u00e9mon figures you received. The value of your 1995 cards is determined by factors such as their rarity, condition, and demand, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe Galarian Pok\u00e9mon figures and the 1995 Pok\u00e9mon cards are two separate collectibles, each with their own market and value. The value of one does not directly impact the value of the other.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the popularity of Pok\u00e9mon as a franchise can have a general impact on the collectibility and value of all Pok\u00e9mon-related items, including vintage cards. If Pok\u00e9mon continues to be popular, it's possible that the demand for vintage cards like your 1995 set may increase, which could affect their value.\n\nBut again, the specific value of your 1995 cards is determined by their individual characteristics, such as rarity, condition, and demand, rather than the value of unrelated collectibles like Galarian Pok\u00e9mon figures.",
