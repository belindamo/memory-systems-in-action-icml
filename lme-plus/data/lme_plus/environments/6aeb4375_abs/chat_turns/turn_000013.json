During the ninth to seventh centuries BCE, Assyria expanded its territory and established itself as a dominant power in the region, which enabled them to control key trade routes, extract resources and tributes from conquered territories, and establish lucrative markets.\n\nHowever, Assyria's aggressive and exploitative approach towards its neighbors led to strained relationships, constant rebellions, and costly military campaigns that drained its wealth and resources. Additionally, the corrupt and inefficient administration of the empire resulted in social unrest, political instability, and loss of public trust.\n\nFurthermore, Assyria's constant warring and conquests made them vulnerable to attacks from external powers like the Babylonians, who eventually overthrew the Assyrian Empire in 612 BCE.\n\nIn conclusion, Assyria's aggressive foreign policy and flawed governance contributed significantly to their economic and political decline, as it weakened their power and gave rise to internal and external threats that eventually led to their downfall.",
