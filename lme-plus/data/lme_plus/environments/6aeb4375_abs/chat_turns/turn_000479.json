  "content": "Japan Airlines (JAL) is a great choice for flying to Tokyo!\n\nJapan Airlines' economy class experience is generally considered to be one of the better ones among Asian carriers. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Seat and Legroom:** JAL's economy class seats on long-haul flights typically have a pitch of 34 inches (86 cm) and a width of 18.5 inches (47 cm). While not the most spacious, the legroom is still relatively decent compared to some other carriers. You'll have enough space to stretch out a bit, but you might feel a bit cramped if you're taller or prefer more legroom.\n\n**Food and Drink:** JAL's economy class meals are often praised for their quality and variety. They offer a range of Japanese and international dishes, and you can expect a decent selection of snacks and drinks throughout the flight. On longer flights, you might even get a special \"Sky Premium\" menu, which features more premium options.\n\n**In-flight Entertainment:** JAL's in-flight entertainment system, MAGIC, offers a wide selection of movies, TV shows, music, and games. The screen size varies depending on the aircraft, but you can expect a decent size screen with a user-friendly interface.\n\n**Service:** JAL is known for its excellent customer service, and the staff are usually friendly, attentive, and efficient.\n\n**Amenities:** You'll receive a complimentary amenity kit, which typically includes items like eye masks, earplugs, and a toothbrush set. You might also get a small pillow and blanket to help you stay comfortable during the flight.\n\n**Fare Deals:** As for your goal of finding a similar deal to your previous $850 round-trip economy ticket, it's definitely possible. Keep an eye on JAL's website and other online travel agencies (OTAs) like Expedia, Kayak, or Skyscanner for sales and promotions. You can also consider flying during the off-peak season (usually November to March) or booking in advance to increase your chances of scoring a better deal.\n\nSome tips to help you find a good deal:\n\n1. Be flexible with your travel dates.\n2. Consider flying into Haneda Airport (HND) instead of Narita Airport (NRT), as Haneda is often cheaper.\n3. Book at least 2-3 months in advance to get the best prices.\n4. Look for error fares or special promotions, which can offer significant discounts.\n5. Use fare comparison tools to track prices and find the best deals.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy flying with Japan Airlines!",
