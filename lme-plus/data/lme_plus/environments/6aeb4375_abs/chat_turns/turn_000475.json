As he made his way towards the back of the room, he spotted the boy sitting by himself, staring at his phone.\n\n\"Hey,\" Tommy said, taking a seat across from him. \"We have English together, right?\"\n\nThe other boy looked up, startled. \"Yeah, I think so. You're Tommy, right?\"\n\nTommy nodded. \"Yeah, that's me. And you're...?\"\n\n\"Mark,\" the boy said. \"Mark Reynolds.\"\n\nThey sat in silence for a moment, the sounds of the other students eating and talking around them. Tommy didn't know what to say, but he could sense that Mark was feeling just as awkward as he was.\n\n\"So, uh, how's English going for you?\" Tommy asked, grasping for a topic of conversation.\n\nMark shrugged. \"It's okay, I guess. I hate writing papers, though.\"\n\nTommy nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, me too. It's like, how are we supposed to know what they want us to say?\"\n\nThey both laughed, and for a moment, Tommy felt like he might have found a kindred spirit.\n\nBut then, the sound of raucous laughter caught their attention. Tommy turned to see a group of boys approaching their table, led by a tall, broad-shouldered kid with a sneer on his face.\n\n\"Well, well, well, what do we have here?\" the kid said, glancing between Tommy and Mark. \"Looks like a couple of losers trying to make friends.\"\n\nTommy's heart sank. He had seen this kid around school before, but he didn't know his name. All he knew was that he was one of the popular kids, and he and his friends seemed to take pleasure in tormenting anyone they saw as weak or different.\n\n\"Leave us alone,\" Tommy said, trying to sound tough.\n\nThe kid just laughed. \"Or what? You gonna cry to your mommy?\"\n\nThe other boys around him snickered, and Tommy felt a familiar surge of anger and despair. He hated feeling so powerless, so vulnerable, but he didn't know what to do to make it stop.\n\nMark shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \"Come on, guys, leave them alone.\"\n\nBut the tall kid just turned his sneer on Mark. \"Who asked you, Reynolds? Go back to your little hole and play on your phone.\"\n\nMark's face flushed with anger, but he didn't say anything else. He just stood up and started to back away.\n\nTommy felt a surge of desperation. He didn't want to be left alone with these bullies again. He didn't want to feel so weak and helpless.\n\nBut he didn't know what to do.\n\nThe tall kid leaned in closer. \"What's wrong, Tommy? Cat got your tongue?\"\n\nTommy clenched his fists, but he didn't say anything. He just glared at the kid, hoping that somehow he could make him go away.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThe other boys started to join in, calling him names and making fun of his clothes, his hair, everything about him.\n\nTommy felt a sense of numbness wash over him. He didn't know how much longer he could take this.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, the bullies started to back away. Tommy looked up to see a teacher walking towards them, and the tall kid and his friends started to scatter.\n\nBut the damage was already done.\n\nTommy felt more alone and hopeless than ever, and he knew that he was in for a long, painful",
