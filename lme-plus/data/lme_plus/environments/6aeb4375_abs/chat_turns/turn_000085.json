Kerastase Resistance Length Strengthening Scalp Serum\n3. Redken Extreme Anti-Snap Leave-In Treatment\n4. Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Strengthening Treatment Oil\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right brush and comb to prevent breakage, it's best to opt for those specifically designed for detangling and reducing stress on the hair. Wide-tooth combs and brushes with soft bristles are generally the best options. It's also important to be gentle when brushing and combing your hair, especially when it's wet. Start at the ends and work your way up to the roots, rather than pulling through tangles from the roots. In addition to using hair products and tools designed to reduce breakage, it's also important to eat a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get regular trims to keep split ends at bay.",
