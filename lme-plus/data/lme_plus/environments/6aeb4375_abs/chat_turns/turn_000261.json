I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or plans, but I'm happy to help you with yours!\n\nHowever, I can provide you with more information and suggestions based on your interests. Since you're planning a camping trip to Yosemite, I'd be happy to help you with camping reservations, hiking trails, and other activities.\n\nIt sounds like you're interested in camping at Upper Pines Campground, which is a great choice. If you're looking for a more rustic experience, Tuolumne Meadows Campground is a fantastic option, but keep in mind that it's only accessible via Highway 120.\n\nFor hiking, the Mist Trail to Vernal Fall is an excellent choice. It's a challenging hike, but the scenic views of Vernal Fall and the Merced River are truly breathtaking. If you're looking for a more moderate hike, the Four Mile Trail offers stunning views of Yosemite Valley and the surrounding mountains.\n\nRemember to book your campsite and activities well in advance, especially during peak season. And don't forget to store your food and trash properly to avoid encounters with black bears!\n\nWhat's your preferred hiking style? Are you looking for a leisurely stroll or a more challenging adventure?",
