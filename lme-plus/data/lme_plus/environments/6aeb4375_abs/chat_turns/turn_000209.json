  "content": "CDHR Preamble: \"Reaffirming the civilizing and historical role of the Islamic Ummah which Allah made as the best nation that has given mankind a universal and well-balanced civilization, in which harmony is established between this life and the hereafter and knowledge is combined with faith; and realizing that the Islamic Ummah which Allah has guided and entrusted with implementing its Shariah (Divine Law) is the most distinguished Ummah and the best nation ever raised up for mankind;\"\n\nComment: The CDHR preamble does not directly address the idea of disregarding and contempt for human rights leading to barbarous acts. Instead, it emphasizes the historical role and importance of the Islamic Ummah in implementing Shariah law. This may reflect a different emphasis in the values and principles underpinning the CDHR compared to the UDHR.",
