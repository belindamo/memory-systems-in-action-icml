  "content": "That's amazing! Five Ruby-throated Hummingbirds at a time on your feeder is a great sight! You must have a wonderful setup for them.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you're hoping to spot new species on your trip. Remember to keep your eyes peeled for the areas I mentioned earlier, and don't hesitate to explore different habitats, such as woodlands, shrubby areas, or even gardens near the lake.\n\nSince you're already familiar with Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, you might be able to recognize other species more easily. Keep in mind that hummingbirds can be tricky to ID, especially when they're flying quickly, so take your time and observe their behavior, plumage, and size.\n\nIf you're lucky, you might spot some other bird species that are attracted to the same areas as hummingbirds, such as orioles, warblers, or tanagers.\n\nDon't forget to enjoy the experience and take in the beauty of nature around you. Birding is not just about spotting new species, but also about appreciating the environment and the creatures that inhabit it.\n\nHave a fantastic time on your trip, and I hope you come back with some amazing birding stories and photos to share!",
