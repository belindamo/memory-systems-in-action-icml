  "content": "Location is a crucial factor when choosing an Airbnb, especially in a vibrant city like Tokyo.\n\nGiven your preference for being close to Shibuya Station and amenities, I'd recommend focusing on the following neighborhoods:\n\n1. **Shibuya-ku:** This is the heart of Shibuya, with the famous scramble crossing and Shibuya Station. You'll find plenty of options within walking distance to the station.\n2. **Shibuya-ward:** This area includes the surrounding neighborhoods of Shibuya-ku, such as Shibuya, Harajuku, and Yoyogi. You'll still be within a short walk or train ride to Shibuya Station.\n3. **Dogenzaka:** This hillside neighborhood is just north of Shibuya Station and offers a more laid-back atmosphere while still being close to the action.\n\nWhen searching for an Airbnb, use the following keywords to find places with a similar location:\n\n* \"Shibuya Station\"\n* \"Shibuya-ku\"\n* \"Shibuya-ward\"\n* \"Dogenzaka\"\n* \"Walking distance to Shibuya Station\"\n* \"Close to Shibuya Crossing\"\n\nYou can also use Airbnb's map feature to filter listings by location. Zoom in on the Shibuya area and apply the \"Distance\" filter to find places within a certain radius of Shibuya Station.\n\nSome examples of Shibuya Airbnbs with great locations include:\n\n* **Cozy Studio near Shibuya Station** (\u00a56,500 per night, around $59 USD) - A compact studio just a 5-minute walk from Shibuya Station.\n* **Shibuya Apartment with Tokyo Views** (\u00a57,500 per night, around $68 USD) - A modern apartment with a great view of Tokyo, located a 10-minute walk from Shibuya Station.\n* **Dogenzaka Hideaway** (\u00a56,000 per night, around $55 USD) - A charming apartment in the Dogenzaka neighborhood, just a 10-minute walk from Shibuya Station.\n\nRemember to always check the listing's details, reviews, and photos to ensure the place meets your needs and expectations.\n\nI hope this helps you find a great Airbnb with a similar location to your previous one!",
