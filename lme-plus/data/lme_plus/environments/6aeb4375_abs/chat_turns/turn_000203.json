  "content": "What a great idea! Incorporating a journaling prompt or question related to the theme of renewal and reflection will help participants dive deeper into their personal journey and set intentions for the retreat. The prompts you suggested are excellent, and here are a few more ideas to consider:\n\n* \"What am I grateful to release or let go of in my life, and what will I replace it with?\"\n* \"What are the old patterns or habits that no longer serve me, and what new habits or practices do I want to cultivate?\"\n* \"What is one area of my life where I feel stuck or stagnant, and what small step can I take to move forward?\"\n* \"What are my core values, and how can I align them with my daily actions and decisions?\"\n* \"What is my heart's deepest desire for this retreat, and what do I hope to achieve or experience?\"\n\nYou could also consider providing a few quotes or inspirational passages related to renewal and reflection to spark creativity and reflection.\n\n**Journaling Exercise: Reflection and Intention**\n\n1. Distribute journals or paper and pens/pencils to each participant.\n2. Introduce the journaling exercise and explain that it's a personal reflection time to explore their thoughts, feelings, and intentions.\n3. Provide the prompt or question, and encourage participants to take 10-15 minutes to write, reflect, and explore their thoughts.\n4. Encourage them to be honest, authentic, and kind to themselves as they reflect on their journey.\n5. After the journaling exercise, invite participants to share their insights, if they feel comfortable doing so, or to simply take a moment of silence to reflect on their experience.\n\nRemember to create a safe, non-judgmental space for participants to express themselves freely. The goal of this exercise is to help them connect with their inner selves, identify areas for growth, and set intentions for the retreat.\n\nHow do these ideas resonate with you? Are there any other prompts or questions you'd like to add to the journaling exercise?",
