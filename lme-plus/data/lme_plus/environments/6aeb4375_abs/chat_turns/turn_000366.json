  "content": "Yes, Punic had loanwords from several non-Semitic languages that were spoken in the ancient Mediterranean region. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Greek: Punic borrowed many words from Greek, particularly in the areas of commerce, art, and religion. For example, the Punic word \"dowr,\" meaning \"gift\" or \"sacrifice,\" is derived from the Greek word \"doron.\"\n\n2. Latin: Punic came into contact with Latin when the Romans conquered Carthage in 146 BCE. As a result, Punic borrowed several words from Latin, including \"gloria\" (glory) and \"munitio\" (fortification).\n\n3. Berber: As Punic was the language of the Carthaginians, who had extensive contact with the Berber tribes of North Africa, it is likely that Punic had some Berber loanwords. For instance, the Punic word \"tamesna,\" meaning \"land of the sun,\" is believed to come from a Berber word.\n\n4. Egyptian: It is also possible that Punic borrowed some words from Egyptian, which was a major language of the Mediterranean region during the time of the Carthaginians. However, due to the lack of written records in Punic, it is difficult to say for certain which words may have been borrowed from Egyptian.\n\nOverall, Punic's loanwords from non-Semitic languages suggest that it was a language that was heavily influenced by the cultures and languages of the people with whom the Carthaginians came into contact in the ancient Mediterranean world.",
