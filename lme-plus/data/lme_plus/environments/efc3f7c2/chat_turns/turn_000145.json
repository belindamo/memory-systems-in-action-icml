This assumes you'll be driving moderately, with some city driving, highway cruising, and a bit of off-the-beaten-path exploration.\n\nKeep in mind that this estimate may vary depending on factors like:\n\n* Your driving habits (e.g., speed, acceleration, idling)\n* Road conditions (e.g., hills, construction, traffic)\n* Weather (e.g., hot temperatures, strong headwinds)\n* The weight and aerodynamics of the vehicle with the camping gear\n\nIt's always a good idea to fill up when you have the opportunity, especially when driving through remote areas with limited gas stations. You may also want to consider downloading a gas station finder app or website to help you plan your fuel stops along the way.\n\nEnjoy your road trip to the Grand Canyon!",
