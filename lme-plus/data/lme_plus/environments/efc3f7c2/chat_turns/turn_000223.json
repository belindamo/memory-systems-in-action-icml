Her set paid tribute to the rich history and culture of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and featured a stunning display of choreography, fashion, and music. Beyonc\u00e9's performance was not just a cultural celebration, but it was also a political statement that highlighted black excellence and empowerment. It was amazing to see her use her platform to elevate and celebrate black communities in this way, and her fans were undoubtedly proud to be a part of it.
