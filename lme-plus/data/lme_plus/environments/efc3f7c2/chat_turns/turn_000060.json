Assess your garden space:**\nTake stock of your garden's dimensions, sunlight, and soil conditions. Consider the mature size of each plant, including your cherry tomatoes, and leave enough space for air circulation and easy access.\n\n**2. Group plants by growing requirements:**\nDivide your garden into sections based on the growing requirements of each plant. For example:\n\t* Full sun (6+ hours of direct sunlight): Cherry tomatoes, basil, marigold, and nasturtium.\n\t* Partial shade (4-6 hours of direct sunlight): Oregano, parsley, and cilantro.\n\t* Soil preferences: Group plants with similar soil needs, such as those that prefer well-draining soil (cherry tomatoes, carrots) or those that thrive in rich soil (borage, comfrey).\n\n**3. Create a rough layout:**\nSketch out a rough plan of your garden, considering the mature size of each plant and their growing requirements. You can use graph paper or online gardening tools to help you visualize your layout.\n\n**4. Intercrop and stagger planting:**\nInterplanting involves planting different vegetables or flowers together in the same bed. Staggering planting means planting rows or blocks of plants at different times to promote diversity and reduce pests. For example:\n\t* Plant a row of cherry tomatoes, followed by a row of basil and marigold.\n\t* Stagger the planting of cherry tomatoes every 1-2 weeks to promote continuous harvest and reduce disease spread.\n\n**5. Consider a square foot garden layout:**\nDivide your garden into square sections (typically 1x1 foot) and plant a different crop in each section. This layout allows for efficient use of space and easy access to each plant.\n\n**6. Leave space for pathways:**\nMake sure to leave enough space between beds for comfortable pathways (around 2-3 feet). This will allow you to easily access your plants for maintenance and harvesting.\n\n**7. Be flexible:**\nDon't be afraid to adjust your layout as needed. As your plants grow, you may need to prune or relocate them to ensure they receive the right amount of sunlight and space.\n\nHere's an example layout to get you started:\n\n**Cherry Tomato Garden Layout:**\n\n* Bed 1: Cherry tomatoes (3-4 plants), basil (3-4 plants), marigold (6-8 plants)\n* Bed 2: Oregano (6-8 plants), parsley (6-8 plants), cilantro (6-8 plants)\n* Bed 3: Carrots (12-16 plants), radish (12-16 plants), nasturtium (6-8 plants)\n* Bed 4: Borage (3-4 plants), comfrey (3-4 plants), dill (3-4 plants)\n\nRemember to plant according to the specific growing requirements of each plant, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or need further guidance. Happy gardening!",
