Here's a picture of a Mellotron:\n\n![Mellotron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Mellotron_ATV3.jpg/400px-Mellotron_ATV3.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, it's a fairly large keyboard instrument with a wooden case and a row of buttons above the keyboard. These buttons correspond to different tape recordings of instruments, and the player can choose which sound they want to play by pressing the appropriate button. On the right side of the keyboard, there are two pitch control knobs, which allow players to slightly adjust the pitch of the sound.\n\nThe panel with the buttons lifts up, revealing the tapes inside that produce the sound. Each key on the keyboard activates a different tape head, which plays a recording of a particular note or sound.\n\nMellotrons can be quite heavy and bulky, so they're not the easiest instruments to move around! However, their unique sound and playing characteristics have made them a favorite of keyboardists in many different genres of music.",
