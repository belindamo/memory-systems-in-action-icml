  "content": "Electronic Performance Support Systems (EPSS) are computer-based systems that provide on-the-job support to workers by supplying them with information and tools to help them perform their tasks more effectively. EPSS can be used in a variety of settings, including education, training, and business. The use of EPSS has been shown to improve performance, increase efficiency, and reduce errors.\n\nSeveral studies have examined the factors that influence the acceptance and adoption of EPSS. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) are two frameworks that have been used to understand the adoption of EPSS. According to TAM, the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of a technology are important determinants of acceptance. TPB posits that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence an individual's intention to adopt a technology.\n\nSeveral studies have also examined the role of interfunctional communication in the acceptance of EPSS. Ashraf et al. (2017) found that interfunctional communication is an important predictor of acceptance of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, which are a type of EPSS. Chen and Popovich (2003) similarly found that effective communication between different functional units is critical for the successful implementation of CRM systems.\n\nIn addition to interfunctional communication, other factors that have been found to influence the acceptance of EPSS include user satisfaction (Navimipour & Soltani, 2016), the presence of adequate training and support (Gal & Nachmias, 2012), and the alignment of EPSS with organizational goals and objectives (Rajan & Baral, 2015).\n\nInstructional designers play a key role in the development and implementation of EPSS. Boling et al. (2017) conducted a study on the core judgments made by instructional designers in practice, and found that designers must consider factors such as the alignment of EPSS with learning objectives and the needs of the target audience. Klein and Kelly (2018) identified a set of competencies that instructional designers should possess in order to effectively design and implement EPSS.\n\nEPSS can be implemented using a variety of technologies, including desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices. Chao (2019) found that the intention to use mobile learning, which is a type of EPSS delivered via mobile devices, is influenced by factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence.\n\nThere is evidence that EPSS can be effective in improving performance and increasing efficiency. Gal et al. (2017) conducted a case study on the use of tablet-based EPSS for technicians' training in the Israeli Air Force and found that the use of EPSS resulted in improved performance and efficiency. Sezer (2021) similarly found that an EPSS designed for academic performance resulted in improved grades and reduced time spent on coursework.\n\nHowever, the adoption and implementation of EPSS can also pose challenges. Frey and Osborne (2017) found that the automation of tasks through the use of EPSS can lead to job displacement, particularly in industries with a high degree of automatable tasks. Robey et al. (2000) noted that the successful implementation of EPSS requires a focus on organizational learning and the ability to effectively integrate EPSS into existing processes and systems.\n\nOverall, the literature suggests that EPSS can be a valuable tool for improving performance and increasing efficiency, but their successful adoption and implementation requires careful consideration of factors such as interfunctional communication, user satisfaction, training and support, and the alignment of EPSS with organizational goals and objectives. The role of instructional designers in the design and implementation of EPSS is also critical. Future research should continue to explore the factors that influence the acceptance and effectiveness of EPSS in different contexts",
