  "content": "Electronic Performance Support Systems (EPSS) are computer-based systems that provide on-the-job support to workers by supplying them with information and tools to help them perform their tasks more effectively. EPSS can be used in a variety of settings, including education, training, and business.\n\nEPSS typically have a number of key features that make them useful for performance support. Some of these features include:\n\n1. Accessibility: EPSS should be easily accessible to users when they need it. This may involve being available on demand, or being integrated into the workflow of the user.\n2. Customization: EPSS should be tailored to the needs of the user, taking into account the user's role, tasks, and goals.\n3. Contextual support: EPSS should provide support that is relevant to the user's current situation and needs.\n4. Interactive: EPSS should allow users to interact with the system, either through search functions or other interactive elements.\n5. Up-to-date: EPSS should be regularly updated with new information and resources to ensure that they remain relevant and useful to users.\n6. Scalability: EPSS should be able to adapt to the needs of different users and organizations, regardless of size or complexity.\n7. Integration: EPSS should be able to integrate with other systems and technologies, such as enterprise software or mobile devices.\n\nOverall, the key features of EPSS are designed to make them easy to use, relevant, and effective at improving performance and increasing efficiency.",
