  "content": "Adding lunch prep to your morning routine can be a great way to save time and ensure a healthy meal.\n\nConsidering your current routine, I'd suggest fitting in lunch prep between your meditation and gym sessions. Here's an updated routine:\n\n**Monday to Friday**\n\n* 6:30 AM - Wake up\n* 6:40 AM - Meditation session (10-15 minutes)\n* 6:55 AM - Prepare lunch (20 minutes)\n* 7:15 AM - Get ready for the gym\n* 7:30 AM - Gym session\n\nThis way, you'll have a short break between meditation and lunch prep, and then another short break before getting ready for the gym. This should give you enough time to prepare a healthy lunch without feeling rushed.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider preparing your lunch immediately after your gym session, around 8:00-8:20 AM. This might be a good option if you need a bit more time to recover after your workout before getting ready for the day.\n\nWhich time slot do you think would work better for you?",
