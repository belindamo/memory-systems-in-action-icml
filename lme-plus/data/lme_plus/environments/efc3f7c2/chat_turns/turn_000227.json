  "content": "Yes, Embraer has faced challenges in meeting regulations and standards set by governmental organizations and regulatory bodies. \n\nFor example, in 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an airworthiness directive for Embraer's E190 and E195 commercial jets after a safety analysis determined that certain parts of the planes' hydraulic systems could fail. Embraer had to make modifications and improvements to the affected parts and systems to meet the FAA's safety standards.\n\nIn addition, Embraer has faced challenges in meeting environmental regulations and standards. The European Union's emissions standards for aviation, known as the Aviation EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), require aircraft operators to limit their carbon dioxide emissions. Embraer has invested in new technology and sustainable aviation solutions to reduce the emissions of its aircraft and meet these regulations.\n\nOverall, meeting regulations and standards set by governmental organizations and regulatory bodies can be a challenge for Embraer, but it is necessary for the safety and sustainability of its products.",
