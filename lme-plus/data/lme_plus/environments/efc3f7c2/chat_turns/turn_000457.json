What are your top priorities, and what tasks do you need to accomplish? Are there any appointments or meetings you need to attend?\n\nAlso, do you have any breaks or self-care activities you'd like to make time for, such as exercise, meditation, or lunch with a friend?\n\nWith your 6:00 AM wake-up time, we can work backwards to create a schedule that fits your needs and helps you make the most of your day.",
