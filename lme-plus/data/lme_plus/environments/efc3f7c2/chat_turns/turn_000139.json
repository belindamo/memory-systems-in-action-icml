  "content": "In the Romanian problem, the true cost of the optimal path from Arad to Bucharest is 418 kilometers, which is the actual distance between the two cities.\n\nAn example of an admissible heuristic for the Romanian problem is the straight-line distance heuristic, also known as the Euclidean distance heuristic. This heuristic estimates the distance to the goal as the straight-line distance between the current node and the goal node, ignoring any obstacles or barriers in the way. The straight-line distance from Arad to Bucharest is approximately 366 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the estimated cost of the optimal path from Arad to Bucharest using the straight-line distance heuristic is less than or equal to 366 kilometers, which is an admissible estimate of the true cost of 418 kilometers.",
