However, from sources, Chaotic focuses on a trading card game that brings the game's monsters to life.\n\nIn general, in a trading card game show, different contestants would have different card decks, giving them different fighting strategies, strengths, and weaknesses. Thus, they would have varying backgrounds in the game and different personalities that would inform how they approach the game.\n\nThe contestants' personalities would affect their playing style, with some being more aggressive, defensive, or strategic than others. Additionally, their backgrounds might also inform why they chose specific cards and cards combinations over others and how their decisions affect the outcome of the game.",
