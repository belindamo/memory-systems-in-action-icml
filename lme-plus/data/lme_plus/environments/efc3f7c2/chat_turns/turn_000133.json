  "content": "Sure, here's an example of a heuristic function that can overestimate the number of steps to the goal:\n\nConsider a grid-like environment, where the starting node is in the top-left corner and the goal node is in the bottom-right corner. A possible heuristic function for this problem is to calculate the Manhattan distance between the current node and the goal node. The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences between the x and y coordinates of the current node and the goal node. For example, if the current node is at position (2, 3) and the goal node is at position (5, 7), the Manhattan distance would be:\n\nh(n) = abs(2 - 5) + abs(3 - 7) = 7\n\nWhile this heuristic function is admissible and never underestimates the cost to the goal, it can overestimate the cost in some cases. For example, if there is a wall or obstacle in the direct path to the goal, the true cost of the path might be higher than the estimated cost using the Manhattan distance. In this case, the heuristic function would overestimate the number of steps required to reach the goal.\n\nIn summary, an overestimation of the number of steps to the goal can occur when the heuristic function is not admissible, meaning it can sometimes overestimate the true cost of the optimal path to the goal.",
