Schedule your workouts: Treat your workout as an essential part of your daily routine and schedule it into your calendar to make sure you stay committed.\n\n2. Exercise in small intervals: You may not have long stretches of time dedicated to exercise, but you can still get a good workout in a shorter amount of time. Try breaking up your exercise into smaller intervals throughout the day, such as a 10-minute quick workout in between study sessions.\n\n3. Make exercise social: Find a workout buddy or join a fitness class to make exercise more fun and to hold yourself accountable. This can help you stick to your workout routine even when you feel unmotivated.\n\n4. Make use of your surroundings: You don't necessarily need a gym to work out. Jogging, walking or doing yoga in a local park or outdoor space can be a great way to enjoy nature while exercising.\n\n5. Multitask: Find activities that serve as both exercise and a break from studying, like taking a power walk during a study break or using a stationary bike while you read.\n\n6. Use workout videos: Follow workout videos online or through a fitness app to create an effective workout routine at your own pace.\n\nRemember, staying active can help you maintain your energy levels and focus better throughout the day despite a busy schedule of studying. So, be creative and find ways to incorporate exercise into your routine to maintain your physical and mental wellbeing.",
