The Handmaid's Tale and The Women's War are both thought-provoking novels that explore themes of power, oppression, and resistance.\n\nRegarding character development, I'd be happy to recommend some books that delve deep into the complexities of human characters. Since you mentioned Sarah Taylor's insights on character development, I'll suggest authors and books that are known for their nuanced and well-crafted characters:\n\n**Books:**\n\n1. **The Song of Achilles** by Madeline Miller: A beautifully written novel that reimagines the Trojan War from the perspective of Achilles' lover, Patroclus. It's a stunning exploration of human relationships, love, and identity.\n2. **The Night Circus** by Erin Morgenstern: A magical realist novel set in a mystical circus, where two young magicians engage in a competition that spans decades. The characters are richly drawn, and their relationships are complex and multifaceted.\n3. **The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August** by Claire North: A thought-provoking novel that explores reincarnation, time travel, and the consequences of human actions. The protagonist, Harry August, is a complex and deeply human character.\n4. **The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake** by Aimee Bender: A magical realist novel that explores the complexities of family relationships, love, and identity through the eyes of a young girl who can taste people's emotions through the food they prepare.\n5. **The Buried Giant** by Kazuo Ishiguro: A haunting and introspective novel set in post-Arthurian England, where an elderly couple embarks on a journey to find their son. The characters are nuanced and complex, and the novel explores themes of memory, aging, and the power of stories.\n\n**Authors:**\n\n1. **Alice Munro**: A masterful short story writer known for her nuanced and detailed character studies. Try her collection **Runaway** or **Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage**.\n2. **Michael Cunningham**: An author known for his lyrical prose and complex characters. Try **The Hours** or **By Nightfall**.\n3. **Jeffrey Eugenides**: A author who explores the complexities of human relationships and identity in his novels. Try **Middlesex** or **The Marriage Plot**.\n4. **Donna Tartt**: An author known for her dense, atmospheric novels that explore the intricacies of human relationships and the power of stories.
