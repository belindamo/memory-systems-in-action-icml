  "content": "I'm interested in The Song of Achilles and The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August. Both books seem to have complex characters and intriguing plots. I've also been meaning to read more books by authors of color, so could you recommend some authors or books that explore character development in a similar way? Additionally, I recently participated in an online book club discussion on Facebook about \"The Power\" by Naomi Alderman, and I was impressed by how the group analyzed the themes of power dynamics and feminism.",
