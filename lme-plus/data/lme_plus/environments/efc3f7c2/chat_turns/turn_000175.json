Here's how to prepare the black beans for the Quinoa and Black Bean Bowl recipe:\n\n**Cooking Black Beans:**\n\n1. **Rinse and drain**: Rinse the dried black beans and drain them well.\n2. **Soak (optional)**: You can soak the black beans overnight or for at least 8 hours to reduce cooking time. If you choose to soak, drain and rinse the beans before cooking.\n3. **Saute onions and garlic**: Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 small onion, diced, and 1 clove of garlic, minced. Cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.\n4. **Add black beans and spices**: Add the rinsed black beans, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon chili powder (optional) to the saucepan. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.\n5. **Add liquid**: Add 4 cups of water or vegetable broth to the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer.\n6. **Cook until tender**: Cook the black beans for 20-25 minutes or until they're tender. You can also use a pressure cooker to cook the black beans for 10-15 minutes.\n7. **Season with salt**: Once the black beans are cooked, season with salt to taste.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* You can use canned black beans as a shortcut, but cooking dried black beans from scratch will result in a better flavor and texture.\n* If using canned black beans, drain and rinse them before using.\n* You can also add diced bell peppers, diced tomatoes, or other spices to the black bean mixture for added flavor.\n\nNow that you have your black beans cooked, you can assemble the Quinoa and Black Bean Bowl by combining the cooked quinoa, black beans, diced tomatoes, avocado, and any other desired toppings.
