It's a simple yet effective technique that can help you quickly identify key takeaways, areas for further clarification, and action items.\n\nBy using green for important takeaways, you're able to highlight the most critical information that you need to remember. Yellow for questions or areas needing further clarification is also a great way to identify potential knowledge gaps or areas where you need more information. And using orange for action items or tasks helps you focus on what needs to be done and creates a sense of accountability.\n\nThis visual system can also help you to:\n\n* Quickly scan your notes and identify key points\n* Focus on the most important tasks and action items\n* Identify patterns or connections between different ideas or concepts\n* Review and reflect on your notes more efficiently\n\nIt's also a great way to make your notes more engaging and interactive, which can help to increase your retention and recall of the information.\n\nI'm curious, have you found that this system has helped you to stay organized and focused in your work or studies?
