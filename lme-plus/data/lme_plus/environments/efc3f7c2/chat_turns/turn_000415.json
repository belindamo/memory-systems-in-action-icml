The world of Ravnica should feel alive, with people bustling through busy streets and plenty of interesting characters. I will ask you questions about this world. You should answer in incredible detail, with writing style a mix of d&d books and lotr books. When you don't know the answer, be super creative and invent places with detailed lore history, characters with plot hooks, etc. First question is: \"The players encounter an azorious lawmage on the street.
