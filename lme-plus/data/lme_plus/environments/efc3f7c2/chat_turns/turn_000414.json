  "content": "Yes, it is likely that we will see more robots doing tasks like painting and plastering in the near future. These tasks can be repetitive and time-consuming, and robotic systems can perform them quickly and with greater accuracy. Furthermore, robots also come with sensors that can detect the surface and temperature of the material they are painting or plastering, reducing the risk of errors or damage to structures.\n\nSeveral companies are already working on developing robotic systems capable of performing these types of tasks. For example, researchers at the University of Stuttgart have developed a robotic system that scans a building's layout and uses this information to plaster walls. Similarly, construction robotics company, Fastbrick Robotics, has developed a brick-laying robot named \"Hadrian\" that can also perform plastering and rendering tasks.\n\nWith the increased use of robotic systems in construction, it is likely that we will see even more specialized robotic solutions for various construction tasks in the future.",
