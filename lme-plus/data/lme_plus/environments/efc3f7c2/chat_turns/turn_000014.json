Here are some lens recommendations:\n\n1. **Wide-angle prime lens**:\n\t* **Sony E 10-18mm f/4 OSS** (for Sony mirrorless): A compact, lightweight lens with a wide angle of view (10-18mm) and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization.\n\t* **Fujifilm XF 10-24mm f/4 R OIS** (for Fujifilm mirrorless): A high-quality, weather-sealed lens with a wide angle of view (10-24mm) and optical image stabilization.\n2. **Standard zoom lens**:\n\t* **Sony E 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS** (for Sony mirrorless): A compact, lightweight lens with a versatile zoom range (16-50mm) and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization.\n\t* **Fujifilm XF 16-55mm f/2.8 R LM WR** (for Fujifilm mirrorless): A high-quality, weather-sealed lens with a wide zoom range (16-55mm) and a constant f/2.8 aperture.\n\nThese lenses will give you a good starting point for capturing cityscapes like the Park Hyatt Tokyo views. The wide-angle prime lens will provide a more dramatic perspective, while the standard zoom lens will offer more flexibility.\n\n**Additional lens considerations:**\n\n1. **Telephoto lens**: If you want to capture more detailed shots of cityscapes or landmarks, consider a telephoto lens like the Sony E 55-210mm f/4.5-6.3 OSS or the Fujifilm XF 55-200mm f/3.5-4.8 R LM OIS.\n2. **Prime lenses**: If you want to experiment with different focal lengths, consider prime lenses like the Sony E 35mm f/1.8 OSS or the Fujifilm XF 35mm f/2 R WR. These lenses are great for street photography, portraits, and low-light shooting.\n\n**Tips for capturing cityscapes:**\n\n1. **Shoot during the golden hour** (just before sunset) for warm, soft light.\n2. **Use a tripod** to stabilize your camera, especially in low light.\n3. **Shoot in RAW** to capture more image data and flexibility in post-processing.\n4. **Experiment with different angles** and perspectives to add creativity to your shots.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with your mirrorless camera and lens selection!",
