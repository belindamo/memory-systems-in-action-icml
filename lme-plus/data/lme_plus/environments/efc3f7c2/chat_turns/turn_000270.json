  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or observations, but there have been some changes in the way French people use language in everyday conversation. For example, many people are becoming more aware of the importance of using gender-inclusive language and are beginning to adopt new practices in their everyday speech. This may include using gender-neutral pronouns or avoiding gendered language when it's not necessary.\n\nIn addition, as mentioned earlier, the use of English words and expressions is becoming more common among French speakers, particularly in certain contexts such as technology and business. This trend is likely to continue as English continues to be the dominant language of international commerce and communication.\n\nOverall, the changes in the way French people use language in everyday conversation reflect broader shifts in society towards more inclusive and globalized forms of communication.",
