The two routers are connected via VXLAN tunnel and can communicate with each other over the VLANs 100 and 200. OSPFv3 is also configured to allow the routers to exchange routing information within the network.\n\nThe route map is used to optimize traffic flow and fine-grain control over packet traversal. In this example, we have used a prefix list to identify the prefixes to be optimized. The \"optimize\" route map is applied to the BGP neighbor relationship, and it sets a local preference of 200 for the prefixes that match the prefix list. This will ensure that traffic destined for those prefixes will be preferred over other paths when possible, resulting in better performance and lower latency.\n\nOverall, this configuration provides a reliable and optimized network topology for the overlay routers using OSPFv3, BGP, and VXLAN. The fine-grained control over packet traversal using the route map will help to optimize network performance and ensure efficient use of network resources.",
