To keep your cherry tomato plants healthy and thriving, here are some additional tips to prevent pests and diseases:\n\n1. **Water wisely**: While it's great that you're enjoying watering your herb garden every morning, be cautious not to overwater your tomato plants. Cherry tomatoes need about 1-2 inches of water per week, either from rain or irrigation. Avoid getting water on the leaves to prevent fungal diseases. Instead, water at the base of the plant, allowing the soil to absorb the water.\n2. **Provide good air circulation**: Cherry tomatoes need air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. Make sure to space your plants about 2-3 feet apart and remove any weeds that may be competing for air and nutrients.\n3. **Monitor for pests**: Keep an eye out for common tomato pests like:\n\t* Hornworms: Hand-pick them off the plants or use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) to control them.\n\t* Aphids: Spray with water or use neem oil to control infestations.\n\t* Whiteflies: Use sticky traps or insecticidal soap to control populations.\n4. **Prevent diseases**: Regularly inspect your plants for signs of disease like yellowing leaves, black spots, or powdery mildew. Common diseases in cherry tomatoes include:\n\t* Early blight: Remove infected leaves, improve air circulation, and apply a fungicide if necessary.\n\t* Septoria leaf spot: Remove infected leaves, and apply a fungicide if necessary.\n\t* Powdery mildew: Remove infected leaves, improve air circulation, and apply a fungicide if necessary.\n5. **Maintain soil health**: Cherry tomatoes love well-draining, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Add organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil structure and fertility.\n6. **Pruning**: Prune your cherry tomato plants to promote healthy growth and encourage fruiting. Remove lower leaves, weak growth, and any branches that are crossing or rubbing against each other.\n7. **Crop rotation**: Rotate your cherry tomato plants to a different location in your garden each season to avoid depleting the soil of specific nutrients and to reduce the risk of disease buildup.\n8. **Keep the area clean**: Remove any debris or weeds around your plants to prevent pests and diseases from spreading.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to growing healthy, productive cherry tomato plants. Enjoy your morning watering routine, and happy gardening!",
