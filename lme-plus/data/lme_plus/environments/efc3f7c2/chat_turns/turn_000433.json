  "content": "Example #1\nFocus Area: Health Science Futures\nTitle: Custom Body Parts In-vivo\nProposed transformation:\nMinimally invasive 3D printing in patients of functional tissues and organs on\ndemand.\nHow is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice:\n3D bio-constructs can be printed, cultured ex-vivo, and successfully\ntransplanted.\nWhat is new, and why do you think it will be successful and transformational:\nPrinting tissues (and possibly organs) on demand in-vivo enables the just-intime mass customization of body parts on demand.\nEvidence Citation:\nAdib, A Asghari, et al. \u201cDirect-Write 3D Printing and Characterization of a\nGelma-Based Biomaterial for Intracorporeal Tissue\nEngineering.\u201d Biofabrication, vol. 12, no. 4, 2020, p. 045006.,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1088/1758-5090/ab97a1.\nEvidence Summary:\nDemonstrated robotically controlled bio-fabrication of anchored 3D crosslinked tissue engineering scaffold and bio-ink for spatially accurate minimally\ninvasive printing inside of a living patient.\n\nPage 2 of 3\nExample #2\nFocus Area: Health Science Futures\nTitle: Mind Meld\nProposed transformation:\nRestoration of voluntary muscle movement via minimally invasive untethered\nbrain motor neuroprosthesis to provide functional independence of impaired\nindividuals.\nHow is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice:\nImplanted brain-computer interfaces utilizing either penetrating or subdural\narrays have demonstrated high-fidelity device control but require burr hole\ncraniotomy for implantation.\nWhat is new, and why do you think it will be successful and transformational:\nFunctional high-fidelity wireless motor cortex communication without\npenetrating the skull enables robust untethered digital device control and\ngreater individual independence.\nEvidence Citation:\nOxley, Thomas J, et al. \u201cMotor Neuroprostheses Implanted with\nNeurointerventional Surgery Improves Capacity for Activities of Daily Living\nTasks in Severe Paralysis: First in-Human Experience.\u201d Journal of\nNeuroInterventional Surgery, vol. 13, no. 2, 2020, pp. 102\u2013108.,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016862.\nEvidence Summary:\nDemonstrated minimally invasive fully implanted wireless electrode array to\ntransmit signals from the motor cortex for control of digital devices in humans\nwith flaccid upper limb paralysis.\n\nPage 3 of 3\nExample #3\nFocus Area: Proactive Health\nTitle: Windows to the Soul\nProposed transformation:\nAI systems can perform key healthcare tasks, such as diagnosing disease as\nwell as or better than humans enabling providers to focus on uniquely human\nskills like empathy and big-picture integration.\nHow is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice:\nCurrent biomarkers of vascular health require invasive blood sampling, blood\npressure, or pulse wave measurement.\nWhat is new, and why do you think it will be successful and transformational:\nAI-enabled retinal vasculature scans offer a non-invasive prognostic\nbiomarker of vascular health with potentially greater community reach to\nidentify individuals requiring further clinical assessment.\nEvidence Citation:\nRudnicka, Alicja Regina, et al. \u201cArtificial Intelligence-Enabled Retinal\nVasculometry for Prediction of Circulatory Mortality, Myocardial Infarction and\nStroke.\u201d British Journal of Ophthalmology, vol. 106, no. 12, 2022, pp. 1722\u20131729.,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1136/bjo-2022-321842.\nEvidence Summary:\nAn AI algorithm evaluating retinal images delivers 10-year risk scores for\nstroke and heart disease equal to one of the most commonly used diagnostic\ntools (Framingham Risk Score).",
