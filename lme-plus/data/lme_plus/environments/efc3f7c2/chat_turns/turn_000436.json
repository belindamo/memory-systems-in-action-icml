The system will use advanced analytics to identify patterns and detect disease outbreaks early, allowing healthcare providers to implement timely and effective interventions to minimize the spread of the disease and prevent pandemics. The system will be designed to be adaptable to various healthcare settings, including hospitals, clinics, and public health agencies.\n\nHow is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice:\nDisease surveillance and outbreak response are primarily carried out through manual data collection and analysis, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and can result in delayed responses to outbreaks.\n\nWhat is new, and why do you think it will be successful and transformational:\nThe proposed system will leverage emerging technologies, such as AI, machine learning, and natural language processing, to automate disease surveillance and response, enabling healthcare providers to respond more quickly and efficiently to outbreaks. The system will provide real-time insights into emerging disease outbreaks, enabling healthcare providers to take proactive measures to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nEvidence Citation #1:\nAlamo, T., Reina, D.
