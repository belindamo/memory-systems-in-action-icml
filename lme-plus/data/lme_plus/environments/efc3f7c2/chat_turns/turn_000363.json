  "content": "Wow, that's quite a list! I appreciate the suggestions. I'm particularly interested in The Handmaid's Tale and The Power-adjacent, The Women's War. I've heard great things about Atwood's work, and The Women's War sounds like it explores similar themes to The Power. By the way, I recently attended a book reading event at my local library where author Sarah Taylor discussed her latest novel, \"The Lost City\", and I was impressed by her insights on character development. Do you think you could recommend some books that explore character development in a similar way?",
