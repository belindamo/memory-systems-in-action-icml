  "content": "I'm glad you found the tips helpful! I've been thinking about my own antique collection and how I can incorporate more velvet and rich fabrics into my design. Speaking of which, I recently attended an antique auction at a local auction house in late June, where I won a beautiful set of antique silverware from the 1800s. I've been searching for a replacement fork handle ever since, but no luck so far. Do you think I could use a similar technique to find vintage or antique hardware for my trunk restoration project?",
