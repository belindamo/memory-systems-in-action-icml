It should display their current leave balances, any pending leave requests, and any important notices or messages from HR.\n2. **Request Leave**: This page allows employees to submit a request for leave by selecting the type of leave, the start and end dates, and providing any necessary notes or attachments.\n3. **View Leave Requests**: This page allows employees to view their past and current leave requests, including the type of leave, the dates requested, the status of the request, and any notes or attachments.\n4. **Cancel Leave**: This page allows employees to cancel any previously approved leave requests if their plans change and they no longer need the time off.\n5. **View Leave Balances**: This page allows employees to view their remaining leave balances for each type of leave, so they can plan their future time off accordingly.\n6. **Profile**: This page allows employees to view and edit their personal information, such as their name, contact details, and emergency contact information.\n\n**For HR Manager:**\n\n1. **Dashboard**: The HR dashboard should display important analytics and data related to leave usage, trends, and forecasting, as well as any pending leave requests that require attention.\n2. **View Leave Requests**: This page allows HR Managers to view all leave requests in the system, filter by status or date, and approve or reject requests as needed.\n3. **View Leave Balances**: This page allows HR Managers to view the leave balances of all employees, so they can monitor usage and forecast future needs.\n4. **Configure Leave Types**: This page allows HR Managers to create, edit, or delete leave types and their associated parameters, such as the maximum number of days allowed and the approval workflow.\n5. **Reports**: This page allows HR Managers to generate reports on staff leave usage, trends, and forecasting, which can help with resource planning and budgeting.\n6. **Profile**: This page allows HR Managers to view and edit their personal information, such as their name, contact details, and job title.\n\nThese pages provide a range of functionality for both staff and HR Managers in the employee leave management system, allowing them to efficiently manage and track leave requests, balances, and types."

      "content": "Sure, here is a requirement specification for the employee leave management system and an algorithm for implementation:\n\n**Requirement Specification:**\n\n**Purpose:** The employee leave management system is designed to enable employees to request for leave, HR Managers to approve or reject leave requests and monitor employee leave history and usage.\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\n\n1. Staff should be able to request for leave by providing their staff ID, type of leave, start and end date, and reason.\n2. Staff should be able to view their leave history and current leave balance.\n3. Staff should be able to cancel their leave request before it is approved.\n4. HR Managers should be able to view all pending leave requests and approve or reject them.\n5. HR Managers should be able to view all employee leave history and usage.\n6. The system should be able to validate that the requested leave dates are valid, i.e., not on weekends, holidays or after an employee has exhausted their leave balance.\n7. The system should be able to update the employee's leave balance when a leave request is approved.\n8. The system should be secure, allowing only authorized users to access the system.\n9. The system should have a user-friendly interface that allows staff and HR Managers to easily navigate and use the system.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n\n1. The system should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime for maintenance.\n2. The system should be scalable to accommodate future growth in the number of employees and leave types.\n3. The system should be fast and responsive, with minimal page load times and data processing time.\n4. The system should be compatible with different web browsers and operating systems.\n\n**Algorithm for Implementation:**\n\n1. Define the database schema to store employee details, leave requests, and leave types.\n2. Implement the user authentication module to ensure only authorized users can access the system.\n3. Implement the staff pages, including the request leave page, view leave history page, and cancel leave request page.\n4. Implement the HR Manager pages, including the view pending leave requests page, view employee leave history page, and approve/reject leave requests page.\n5. Implement the validation module to ensure the requested leave dates are valid, i.e., not on weekends, holidays or after an employee has exhausted their leave balance.\n6. Implement the approval workflow to notify HR Managers of new leave requests, and to update the status of leave requests once they are approved or rejected.\n7. Implement the leave balance update module to update the employee's leave balance when a leave request is approved.\n8. Implement the reporting module to generate reports on staff leave usage, trends, and forecasting.\n9. Implement the user interface module to ensure the system is user-friendly and easy to navigate.\n10. Test the system thoroughly to ensure it meets all functional and non-functional requirements.\n\n**Note:** It is possible to implement the system without a leave balance table by using a formula to calculate the available leave balance for each employee based on their leave history and the configured maximum leave days allowed. However, using a leave balance table allows for faster and more accurate calculations of leave balances and reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies in the data."
