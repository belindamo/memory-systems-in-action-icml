Now, let's explore some additional ways to improve your laptop's performance and address the issues with your wireless mouse:\n\n**1. Update your operating system and software:**\n Ensure your macOS is up-to-date, as newer versions often include performance enhancements and bug fixes. Also, update your software and apps to the latest versions, as outdated software can slow down your laptop.\n\n**2. Close unnecessary apps and background processes:**\nMany apps run in the background and consume system resources, slowing down your laptop. Use Command + Option + Esc to open the Force Quit window and close any unnecessary apps. You can also use the Activity Monitor (in Applications/Utilities) to identify resource-intensive processes and terminate them if needed.\n\n**3. Disable animations:**\nAnimations can consume system resources and slow down your laptop. To disable them, go to System Preferences > Accessibility > Display, and check the box next to \"Reduce motion.\"\n\n**4. Manage your storage:**\nLow disk space can slow down your laptop. Check your available storage by clicking the Apple logo > About This Mac > Storage. Delete unnecessary files, empty the Trash, and consider upgrading your storage or using an external hard drive if needed.\n\n**5. Clean up your startup programs:**\nSome apps might be set to launch at startup, consuming resources without your knowledge. Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items, and remove any unnecessary apps from the list.\n\n**6. Reset your System Management Controller (SMC):**\nThe SMC manages various system functions, including battery life, display brightness, and wireless connectivity. Resetting the SMC can sometimes resolve issues with your wireless mouse. To do this, press the power button, the Command + Option + Shift + Power buttons, or the Power button and the Volume Down button (depending on your Mac model), and hold them for 10 seconds.\n\n**7. Update your wireless mouse drivers:**\nOutdated drivers can cause issues with your wireless mouse. Check the manufacturer's website for updates and install the latest drivers.\n\n**8. Reset your wireless mouse:**\nTry resetting your wireless mouse by turning it off, waiting for 10 seconds, and then turning it back on. This can sometimes resolve connectivity issues.\n\n**9. Check for dust and debris:**\nDust and debris can accumulate in your laptop's vents and fans, causing overheating and slowing down your laptop. Use compressed air to clean out the vents and fans.\n\n**10. Consider upgrading your RAM:**\nIf your laptop is running low on RAM, adding more memory can significantly improve performance. Check if your laptop's RAM is upgradable and consider adding more memory if possible.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you should see an improvement in your laptop's performance and potentially resolve the issues with your wireless mouse.",
