However, before we dive into that, I want to address the issue with your bathroom fan. It's possible that the candle smoke might be contributing to the weird noise, but it's also important to ensure that your fan is properly maintained and cleaned. Make sure to dust and clean the fan regularly to prevent dust buildup, which can cause unusual noises.\n\nNow, about scented candles! Here are some popular and highly-rated options:\n\n1. **Jo Malone London**: Known for their luxurious and sophisticated scents, Jo Malone candles are a great choice for a bathroom. Try their \"Grapefruit\" or \"Lemon & Blossom\" scents for a refreshing and uplifting atmosphere.\n2. **Diptyque**: This French brand offers a range of elegant and complex scents that can elevate your bathroom experience.
