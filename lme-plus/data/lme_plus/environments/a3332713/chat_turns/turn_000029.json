Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Scale:** Think about the size of the room, furniture, and decor in your friend's apartment. A large vase can overwhelm a small space, while a small vase might get lost in a large room.\n2. **Table or shelf size:** Consider the size of the table, shelf, or surface where the vase will be placed. Make sure the vase fits comfortably and doesn't hang over the edge.\n3. **Visual balance:** Balance the size of the vase with the surrounding decor. A large vase might require larger decorative items nearby to create visual balance.\n4. **Filler capacity:** If your friend plans to use the vase for flowers or branches, consider the size of the stems and the amount of filler material needed. A larger vase might require more filler material.\n\nHere are some general size guidelines:\n\n* Small vases (6-8 inches tall): Perfect for small tables, shelves, or desks.\n* Medium vases (10-14 inches tall): Suitable for coffee tables, side tables, or console tables.\n* Large vases (16-20 inches tall): Ideal for floor vases, entryway tables, or large shelves.\n\nWhen shopping at West Elm and CB2, you can filter their vase selection by size to find the perfect fit. You can also read reviews and product descriptions to get a better sense of the vase's dimensions and proportions.\n\nRemember, the size of the vase is a personal preference, so consider your friend's style and the overall aesthetic they're aiming for in their new apartment. If you're still unsure, you could always ask for their input or opt for a gift receipt, so they can exchange it for a different size if needed.",
