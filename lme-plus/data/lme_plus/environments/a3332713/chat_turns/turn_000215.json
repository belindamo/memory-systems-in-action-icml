  "content": "I'm glad to hear that the face mask helped with your skin! As for body lotion sales, I don't have real-time access to current sales or promotions at specific stores. However, I can suggest a few options to help you find deals:\n\n1. **Check online retailers**: Websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Ulta often have sales or discounts on body lotions. You can filter by brand, price, and customer reviews.\n2. **Sign up for newsletters**: Register for newsletters from your favorite beauty or skincare brands, as well as retailers like Sephora, Bath & Body Works, or CVS. They often send exclusive offers, promotions, and sale notifications to subscribers.\n3. **Follow social media**: Keep an eye on your favorite brands' social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) for flash sales, promo codes, or limited-time offers.\n4. **Use cashback apps**: Cashback apps like Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates), TopCashback, or Fetch Rewards offer a percentage of your purchase back as cash or rewards. You can use these apps to earn cashback on your body lotion purchases.\n5. **Check coupon websites**: Sites like RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, or CouponCabin aggregate promo codes and discounts for various retailers.\n6. **Visit store websites**: Directly check the websites of stores you frequent, such as Walgreens, Rite Aid, or Costco, for sales or promotions on body lotions.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of any sale or promotion before making a purchase. Happy shopping!",
