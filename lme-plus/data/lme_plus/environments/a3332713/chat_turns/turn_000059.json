However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal conversations or recall previous conversations, so I didn't know about your bedroom makeover.\n\nBut I'm happy to chat with you about it now! It's great that you've noticed a positive impact from simplifying your bedroom space. A simple white duvet cover can really help to create a calm and serene atmosphere. Adding a peace lily will likely enhance that feeling, and it's a great way to bring in some natural beauty and freshness to the space.\n\nRemember, minimalism is a personal choice, and it's all about creating a space that feels peaceful and functional to you. By making intentional decisions about the items you bring into your bedroom, you can create a sanctuary that promotes relaxation and rejuvenation.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance on minimalist decorating or plant care, feel free to ask!",
