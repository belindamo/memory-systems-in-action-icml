If so, you might want to reassess your gift-giving budget.\n2. **The recipient's perspective:** Does your mom (or other loved ones) truly appreciate the expensive gifts, or would they be just as happy with a more thoughtful, yet less expensive, gift?\n3. **The emotional value:** Are you buying gifts to impress or to show love and appreciation? Focus on the thought and effort behind the gift, rather than the price tag.\n4. **Alternative ways to show love:** Consider experiences, handwritten notes, or quality time spent together, which can be just as meaningful as physical gifts.\n\nYou don't necessarily need to cut back drastically, but being mindful of your spending habits can help you make more intentional decisions. You might consider setting a budget for gifts and sticking to it, or exploring more affordable yet thoughtful options.\n\nRemember, it's the thought that counts, not the price tag. Your mom will likely appreciate the personalized photo album, not just because of its monetary value, but because of the love and effort you've put into creating it.\n\nHow do you feel about exploring alternative ways to show love and appreciation, beyond physical gifts?",
