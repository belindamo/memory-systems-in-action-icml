Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide a list of highly rated plumbers in your specific area. However, I can offer some general tips to help you find a reliable and skilled plumber:\n\n1. **Ask for referrals**: Ask friends, family, neighbors, or coworkers who have recently had plumbing work done for recommendations. They can provide valuable insights into a plumber's quality of work, communication, and pricing.\n2. **Online review sites**: Check online review platforms like:\n\t* Yelp\n\t* Google Reviews\n\t* Angie's List (paid subscription)\n\t* HomeAdvisor\n\t* Thumbtack\n\t* Facebook Reviews\n\t* Nextdoor (if you're a member)\n\nFilter the results by rating, distance, and services offered. Pay attention to the overall rating and read the reviews to get a sense of the plumber's reputation.\n3. **Check licenses and certifications**: Ensure the plumber is:\n\t* Licensed: Check with your state's licensing board to verify the plumber's license.\n\t* Insured: Make sure they have liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance.\n\t* Certified: Look for certifications like Master Plumber, Journeyman Plumber, or specialized certifications like Medical Gas Systems or Hydronic Heating.\n4. **Get multiple quotes**: Reach out to at least three plumbers and ask for quotes over the phone or through their website. Compare prices, services, and warranties offered.\n5. **Check their experience**: Ask about their experience with similar issues (e.g., toilet repairs) and if they have any specialized equipment or expertise.\n6. **Verify their physical address**: A legitimate business should have a physical address, not just a PO box.\n7. **Check for 24/7 emergency services**: If you need urgent assistance, ensure the plumber offers emergency services and has a clear process for handling after-hours calls.\n\nOnce you've narrowed down your options, ask the following questions before hiring a plumber:\n\n* What's the estimated cost of the repair?\n* What's the warranty or guarantee on the repair?\n* Do you provide a detailed invoice or estimate before starting work?\n* Can you provide references or examples of similar work?\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well on your way to finding a reliable and skilled plumber to fix your toilet.",
