  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on finding affordable alternatives to high-end skincare products. I recently splurged on a $150 moisturizer, but I'm wondering if there are similar products out there for a lower price. By the way, I've been noticing a trend in my spending habits - like yesterday, I saw a similar-looking bag at Forever 21 for $30, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had made a mistake by spending so much money on a designer handbag last month.",
