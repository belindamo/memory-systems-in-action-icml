While you can substitute butter with oils in some recipes, oatmeal raisin cookies might not be the best candidate for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Flavor profile**: Butter contributes a rich, caramel-like flavor to oatmeal raisin cookies, which is an essential part of their character. Avocado oil and grapeseed oil have distinct flavor profiles that might alter the overall taste of the cookies. Avocado oil has a mild, nutty flavor, while grapeseed oil has a neutral, slightly sweet flavor.\n2. **Texture**: Butter provides tenderness and structure to the cookies. Oils, being liquid at room temperature, can make the dough more prone to spreading and result in a cookie that's more delicate or even fragile. This might affect the texture and appearance of the cookies.\n3. **Fat content**: Butter contains around 80% fat, which helps to create a tender, chewy cookie. Avocado oil and grapeseed oil have a lower fat content (around 10-15%), which can affect the cookie's texture and moisture levels.\n\nThat being said, if you still want to experiment with oils, here are some tips to consider:\n\n* **Use a neutral-tasting oil**: Grapeseed oil might be a better choice than avocado oil due to its neutral flavor profile. However, keep in mind that it still won't provide the same richness as butter.\n* **Reduce the amount of oil**: Since oils are more dense than butter, you'll need less of it to achieve the same consistency. Start with a smaller amount (around 1/4 cup) and adjust as needed.\n* **Add extra liquid**: Oils can make the dough more dry, so you might need to add an extra tablespoon or two of liquid (such as milk or egg) to achieve the right consistency.\n* **Be prepared for a different texture**: Oatmeal raisin cookies made with oil will likely have a different texture and spread more during baking. They might be more delicate and crumbly than traditional cookies made with butter.\n\nIf you do decide to experiment with oils, I'd love to hear about your results! Just remember that it's all about trial and error, and you might need to make some adjustments to the recipe to get the desired outcome.\n\nWould you like to try a different recipe that's specifically designed for using oils, like a cookie recipe that incorporates olive oil or coconut oil?",
