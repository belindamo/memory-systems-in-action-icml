I'm particularly interested in learning more about biology and chemistry, so I'll start with \"Stuff You Should Know\" and \"Ologies\". Thanks for the recommendations!\n\nBy the way, I've been listening to \"The Daily\" from The New York Times almost every day, and it's been keeping me up-to-date on current events. Do you have any other news or politics podcasts that you'd recommend?",
