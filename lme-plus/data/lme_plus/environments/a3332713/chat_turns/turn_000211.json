As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal preferences or experiences, but I can provide some general tips and popular recommendations for body lotions that might help:\n\n1. **Moisturize immediately after showering**: Apply lotion within 3 minutes of showering, while your skin is still damp. This helps lock in moisture.\n2. **Look for humectants**: Ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and ceramides help retain moisture in the skin.\n3. **Choose a rich, non-comedogenic lotion**: Opt for a thick, creamy lotion that's labeled \"non-comedogenic\" or \"hypoallergenic\" to reduce the risk of clogged pores.\n4. **Consider your skin type**: If you have dry skin, look for lotions specifically formulated for dry skin or sensitive skin. If you have oily skin, look for lightweight, oil-free lotions.\n\nSome popular body lotion brands and products that you might find helpful:\n\n* **CeraVe Moisturizing Body Lotion**: Fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and rich in ceramides.\n* **Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Body Lotion**: Contains oatmeal to soothe dry, itchy skin.\n* **L'Occitane Shea Butter Extra Gentle Body Cream**: Rich in shea butter and vitamin E to nourish dry skin.\n* **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Body Gel Cream**: Lightweight, non-greasy, and hydrating.\n* **Jergens Ultra Healing Moisturizer**: Provides long-lasting hydration and helps repair dry skin.\n\nRemember to always read reviews, check the ingredient list, and patch test a new lotion on a small area of skin before using it on your entire body.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best in finding a great plumber and a wonderful body lotion to soothe your dry skin!",
