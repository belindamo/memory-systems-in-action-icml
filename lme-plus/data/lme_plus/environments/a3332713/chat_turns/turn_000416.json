Some popular options include:\n\n1. **Soapstone**: A popular choice for beginners, soapstone is soft, easy to carve, and comes in a variety of colors.\n2. **Alabaster**: Another soft stone, alabaster is often used for carving and is a great choice for beginners.\n3. **Calcite**: A relatively soft stone, calcite is easy to carve and can be found in a range of colors.\n\n**Avoid hard stones**: Steer clear of stones with a Mohs hardness of 6 or higher, like quartz, agate, or jasper, as they can be challenging to carve and may require specialized tools.\n\n**Consider the color and pattern**: Choose a stone with a color and pattern that you like, as it will make the project more enjoyable.
