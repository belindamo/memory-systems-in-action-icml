  "content": "Yes, it was difficult for Johnson to balance the needs of those who wanted change with those who opposed it. Johnson was a skilled politician, and he recognized that enacting civil rights legislation would require working with both supporters and opponents of these policies. \n\nOn one hand, Johnson believed in the urgent need to address the systemic inequality and discrimination that African Americans faced. On the other hand, he was conscious of the country's deep racial divides and the political challenges inherent in pushing for civil rights reforms. \n\nTo achieve success, Johnson relied on his formidable political skills to build a broad-based coalition of support for civil rights legislation. He used his considerable skills of persuasion and negotiation to bring together people with different political perspectives and priorities.\n\nUltimately, Johnson's ability to build support for civil rights legislation was key to his success in enacting it into law.",
