It's possible that the battery drain issue affected the performance of your wireless mouse as well.\n\nHere are a few potential connections between the two issues:\n\n1. **Battery drain:** If your laptop's battery was draining quickly, it's possible that the wireless mouse's battery was also affected, leading to connectivity issues.\n2. **Power management:** When your laptop's battery is low, the system might prioritize power allocation to essential components, which could cause issues with peripheral devices like your wireless mouse.\n3. **Radio frequency interference (RFI):** If your laptop's battery was experiencing a high drain, it could have caused RFI, which can interfere with the wireless signal between your mouse and the receiver.\n\nTo further troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Check your wireless mouse's battery level:** Make sure the batteries are not running low. Try replacing them or charging them if they're rechargeable.\n2. **Restart your laptop and wireless mouse:** Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve connectivity issues.\n3. **Move the wireless receiver:** Try moving the wireless receiver to a different location or orientation to see if it improves the signal strength.\n4. **Check for interference:** Identify potential sources of interference, such as other wireless devices, cordless phones, or microwaves, and move them away from your laptop and wireless mouse.\n\nIf you've tried these steps and the issue persists, it might be worth resetting your wireless mouse or contacting the manufacturer's support for further assistance.\n\nRemember to also keep an eye on your laptop's battery life and performance to ensure that the issue doesn't return.",
