Both of these spices pair well with cumin and paprika, and they'll complement the sweetness of the sweet potatoes beautifully.\n\n**Chipotle Peppers:**\n\nChipotle peppers are smoked jalape\u00f1os that add a rich, smoky heat to dishes. They're a great addition to Mexican-inspired recipes and pair well with cumin, paprika, and sweet potatoes. If you're using chipotle peppers, you can add them to the pot during the braising process to infuse the sweet potatoes with their smoky heat.\n\n**Ancho Chili Powder:**\n\nAncho chili powder is made from dried ancho chilies and has a mild to medium heat level. It adds a rich, slightly sweet, and slightly smoky flavor to dishes. Ancho chili powder pairs well with cumin and paprika, and it's a great addition to Mexican-inspired recipes.\n\nWhen using either chipotle peppers or ancho chili powder, start with a small amount and adjust to taste.
