It's wonderful that you're seeing roots forming.\n\nWhen roots start to appear, it's a sign that the cutting is starting to establish itself. Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Wait for more root development:** Although you're seeing roots, it's essential to wait until the roots are a bit more developed and robust before transferring the cutting to soil. This will increase the chances of success. You can wait for another week or two to allow the roots to grow stronger.\n2. **Prepare the soil:** Before transferring the cutting to soil, make sure you have a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for cacti and succulents. This will help prevent waterlogged soil and root rot.\n3. **Transfer carefully:** When you're ready to transfer the cutting to soil, gently remove it from the water, taking care not to disturb the roots. Plant the cutting in the soil, making sure the roots are buried and the leaf is above the soil surface. Water sparingly until the soil is moist but not waterlogged.\n4. **Provide proper care:** Once the cutting is in soil, make sure it receives bright, indirect light, and maintain a consistent watering schedule. Succulents need infrequent but thorough watering, so wait until the soil is dry to the touch before watering again.\n\nSome popular succulent species can take longer to root, so be patient and don't get discouraged if it takes a bit more time. You're doing great, and with proper care, your new succulent should thrive!\n\nWhat type of succulent are you propagating, and have you propagated succulents before?",
