I think we've got it!\n\nSo, let's update the total:\n\n* $100 for your brother's graduation gift\n* $75 for your sister's birthday gift\n* $20 for your best friend's housewarming gift\n* $100 for your coworker's baby shower gift\n\nThat adds up to a total of $295. And if we subtract that from the original $500, we're left with...\n\n$500 - $295 = $205\n\nIt looks like we've accounted for all but $205 of your gift expenses! You're doing great!\n\nDo you think there might be anything else you're forgetting, or are you feeling pretty confident that we've got everything?",
