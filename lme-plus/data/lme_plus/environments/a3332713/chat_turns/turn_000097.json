It's awesome that you're already doing well with meal prep, and now you can focus on extending that to your snacks.\n\nFinding healthier alternatives to your favorite junk foods is a great strategy. Baked sweet potato fries are a fantastic option, and it's even better that you're experimenting with different seasonings to keep things interesting. Paprika and garlic powder are both great choices - have you tried smoked paprika or chili powder for a spicy kick?\n\nAnd remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. When you do give in to cravings, don't beat yourself up over it. Instead, acknowledge the setback, and get back on track as soon as you can. You're making positive changes, and that's something to be proud of!\n\nKeep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more tips or advice. You got this!",
