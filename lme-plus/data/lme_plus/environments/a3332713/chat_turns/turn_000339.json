Spider plants are heavy feeders and will benefit from regular fertilization, especially during the growing season (spring and summer). You can use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) and dilute it to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots. Feed your spider plant once a month, and you'll likely see an increase in foliage growth and more vibrant colors.\n\nAs for your snake plant, it's not surprising that the soil was dry to the touch after three weeks without watering. Snake plants are known for their ability to survive with neglect, but they still need some TLC. It's great that you checked the soil moisture and watered it accordingly. February 10th might be a bit early to start watering more frequently, depending on your climate and indoor conditions. Keep an eye on the soil moisture, and water your snake plant when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. You can gradually increase the frequency of watering as the weather warms up and the plant becomes more active.\n\nRemember to also monitor the lighting, temperature, and humidity levels for both plants to ensure they're thriving in their environment. Happy planting!",
