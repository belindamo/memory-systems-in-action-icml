Remember to stay calm and clear about the issue, and don't hesitate to ask for assistance or clarification if needed.\n\nRegarding your grandmother's antique pearl necklace, it's difficult for me to determine its current market value without more information or seeing the piece in person. However, an appraisal of $2,000 suggests that it's a valuable and potentially sought-after item.\n\nIf you're considering selling the necklace, here are some general tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Get a current appraisal**: Since the original appraisal was done in the past, it's a good idea to get an updated appraisal to determine the necklace's current market value. This will help you set a realistic price and provide potential buyers with confidence in the piece's value.\n2. **Research the market**: Look for similar antique pearl necklaces sold at auction houses, online marketplaces, and reputable jewelry dealers to gauge their prices. This will give you an idea of what buyers are willing to pay for similar pieces.\n3. **Consider consignment or auction**: You may want to consider consigning the necklace to a reputable dealer or auction house that specializes in antique jewelry. They'll take a commission, but they'll handle the sale and marketing of the piece.\n4. **Gather documentation**: Collect any documentation related to the necklace, such as the original appraisal, proof of provenance (e.g., family history, certificates of authenticity), and any maintenance or restoration records.\n5. **Prepare for negotiation**: Be prepared to negotiate the price with potential buyers. Consider setting a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.\n\nKeep in mind that selling a family heirloom can be an emotional process, and it's essential to be prepared for the possibility that the necklace may not sell for the appraised value.\n\nIf you decide to sell the necklace, I recommend consulting with a professional appraiser, jewelry expert, or reputable dealer to get a more accurate assessment of its current market value.",
