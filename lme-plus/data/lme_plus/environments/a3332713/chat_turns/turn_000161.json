I'm working on a report and I wanted to make sure I have the latest info on our workflow model. Could you send me an updated version of the diagram and any notes about any changes made?\n\nIf possible, I'd appreciate it if you could send it over by Wednesday. That way I can make sure to include everything in my report.\n\nThanks a ton!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
