It's made a huge difference in my workflow and I feel more efficient now.\n\nAs for exploring other genres, I'm actually interested in learning more about science and technology. I've listened to a few episodes of \"Radiolab\" and loved it, so I'm looking for more podcasts like that. Do you have any recommendations?",
