However, here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Production time: 3-5 business days (this can take longer if the retailer has a high volume of orders or if the design is complex)\n* Shipping time:\n\t+ Standard shipping: 5-7 business days (this can take longer during peak holiday seasons)\n\t+ Expedited shipping: 2-3 business days\n\t+ Express shipping: 1-2 business days\n\nTo ensure you receive the photo album on time for your mom's anniversary, I recommend the following:\n\n* Order the album at least 2-3 weeks before the anniversary date to account for production and shipping time.\n* Choose expedited or express shipping to reduce the shipping time.\n* Check the retailer's website for any production and shipping deadlines, especially during peak holiday seasons.\n\nIt's always better to err on the side of caution and plan ahead to avoid any last-minute stress.\n\nBy the way, that's thoughtful of you to get a gift receipt for your coworker's baby shower gift! It's considerate of you to think about their preferences and potential returns.\n\nNow, back to the photo album: have you thought about the design and layout of the album? Would you like to include captions or quotes alongside the photos?",
