It's a natural insecticide that can help control a wide range of pests, including spider mites, mealybugs, aphids, and whiteflies.\n\nTo use neem oil on your African violet, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Mix the neem oil with water:** Dilute the neem oil with water according to the product's instructions, usually 2-4 teaspoons of neem oil per quart of water.\n2. **Spray the plant:** Spray the neem oil solution on all surfaces of the African violet, making sure to cover the undersides of the leaves and the soil. Repeat every 7-10 days for 2-3 weeks to ensure that all stages of the spider mite lifecycle are affected.\n3. **Monitor and adjust:** Keep an eye on your plant's response to the neem oil treatment. If you still see spider mites after 2-3 weeks, you may need to repeat the treatment or adjust the frequency of application.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind when using neem oil:\n\n* **Test a small area first:** Before spraying the entire plant, test the neem oil solution on a small, inconspicuous area to ensure the plant doesn't have any adverse reactions.\n* **Avoid spraying in direct sunlight:** Neem oil can cause leaf burn if sprayed in direct sunlight, so it's best to spray in the morning or evening when the sun is not intense.\n* **Don't overdo it:** Neem oil can be toxic to plants if used excessively, so be sure to follow the product's instructions and avoid over-treating your African violet.\n\nIn addition to using neem oil, make sure to provide your African violet with good air circulation, high humidity, and regular watering to help prevent spider mite infestations.\n\nHow long have you been struggling with spider mites on your African violet, and have you tried any other treatments before?",
