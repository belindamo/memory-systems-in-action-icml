  "content": "That's a great approach! It's wonderful that Max is enjoying the steamed veggies, and it's essential to monitor his digestion over time to see if you notice any positive changes.\n\nRemember to keep an eye out for signs of improved digestion, such as:\n\n* More regular and consistent bowel movements\n* Less gas or bloating\n* Improved stool quality (e.g., more formed, less loose)\n* Reduced symptoms of digestive discomfort (e.g., less whining, panting, or restlessness)\n\nIt's also important to maintain a consistent feeding schedule and portion control to ensure that the addition of vegetables isn't disrupting Max's overall diet.\n\nIf you're unsure about any changes or have concerns, it's always best to consult with your veterinarian for personalized guidance. They can help you assess Max's response to the added veggies and provide recommendations for future adjustments.\n\nKeep me updated on Max's progress, and I'll be happy to offer any further advice or support!",
