      "content": "Give me an outline for how to write a scientific style paper based on the following prompt: \"Nuclear energy plays a significant role in the net zero goal. Nuclear reactors are an attractive technology to power multiple applications, particularly hydrogen production [1], synthetic fuels, polymers, chemicals, minerals production, refineries, thermal storage [2] and district heating, where clean, reliable energy and/or high-quality heat is needed with very high availability. Nuclear reactors offer the ability to provide this heat and electricity at the location where it is needed, greatly reducing the cost to transmit/distribute energy. A coupling between a power plant and some other application, such as a chemical production or heating system, is usually referred as an integrated energy system (IES) [3]. Your paper will focus on describing and analyzing an IES or non-direct power generation applications of nuclear energy.\""
