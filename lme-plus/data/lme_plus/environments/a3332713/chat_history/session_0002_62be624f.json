      "content": "A decorative vase can be a beautiful addition to your friend's new apartment. Both unique shapes and colorful vases can be stunning, but it ultimately depends on your friend's personal style and the overall aesthetic she's aiming for in her space. Here are some considerations to help you decide:\n\n**Unique Shape:**\n\n* A vase with an unusual shape can be a conversation starter and add visual interest to a room.\n* Consider a vase with clean lines, geometric shapes, or an asymmetrical design to add a touch of modernity.\n* A unique shape can also help to create a focal point in a room or draw attention to a particular area.\n* If your friend likes minimalism, a simple, sculptural vase with a unique shape can be a great choice.\n\n**Colorful Vase:**\n\n* A colorful vase can add a pop of color and energy to a room, making it a great option if your friend wants to inject some personality into her space.\n* Consider a vase with a bold, bright color or a subtle, pastel shade, depending on your friend's taste.\n* A colorful vase can also help to tie in with other decorative elements in the room, such as throw pillows, rugs, or wall art.\n* If your friend loves bohemian or eclectic styles, a colorful vase with a unique pattern or design can be a great fit.\n\n**Combining Both:**\n\n* Why not consider a vase that combines both a unique shape and a colorful design? This can add even more visual interest and create a truly eye-catching piece.\n* Look for a vase with a bold, geometric shape in a bright, contrasting color to create a striking effect.\n\nUltimately, think about your friend's style and preferences:\n\n* Does she like bold, statement pieces or more understated, minimalist designs?\n* Is she drawn to bright, cheerful colors or more muted, neutral tones?\n* Does she have a favorite color or pattern that you could incorporate into the vase?\n\nBy considering these factors, you can choose a vase that not only reflects your friend's style but also becomes a beautiful addition to her new apartment."

      "content": "Yes, considering the size of the vase is crucial to ensure it fits perfectly in your friend's new apartment. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Scale:** Think about the size of the room, furniture, and decor in your friend's apartment. A large vase can overwhelm a small space, while a small vase might get lost in a large room.\n2. **Table or shelf size:** Consider the size of the table, shelf, or surface where the vase will be placed. Make sure the vase fits comfortably and doesn't hang over the edge.\n3. **Visual balance:** Balance the size of the vase with the surrounding decor. A large vase might require larger decorative items nearby to create visual balance.\n4. **Filler capacity:** If your friend plans to use the vase for flowers or branches, consider the size of the stems and the amount of filler material needed. A larger vase might require more filler material.\n\nHere are some general size guidelines:\n\n* Small vases (6-8 inches tall): Perfect for small tables, shelves, or desks.\n* Medium vases (10-14 inches tall): Suitable for coffee tables, side tables, or console tables.\n* Large vases (16-20 inches tall): Ideal for floor vases, entryway tables, or large shelves.\n\nWhen shopping at West Elm and CB2, you can filter their vase selection by size to find the perfect fit. You can also read reviews and product descriptions to get a better sense of the vase's dimensions and proportions.\n\nRemember, the size of the vase is a personal preference, so consider your friend's style and the overall aesthetic they're aiming for in their new apartment. If you're still unsure, you could always ask for their input or opt for a gift receipt, so they can exchange it for a different size if needed."
