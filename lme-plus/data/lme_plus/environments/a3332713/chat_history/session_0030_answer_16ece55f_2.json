You've already accounted for $100 of that with the graduation gift to your brother in May. That leaves $400 unaccounted for.\n\nCan you think of any other gifts you've given recently? For example:\n\n* Birthday gifts for friends or family members\n* Holiday gifts (e.g. Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.)\n* Wedding gifts or baby shower gifts\n* Any other special occasions or celebrations\n\nTry to recall any gifts you've given in the past few months, and we can work together to break down the remaining $400.",
