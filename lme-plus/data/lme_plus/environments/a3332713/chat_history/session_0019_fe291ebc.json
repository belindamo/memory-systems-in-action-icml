Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide a list of highly rated plumbers in your specific area. However, I can offer some general tips to help you find a reliable and skilled plumber:\n\n1. **Ask for referrals**: Ask friends, family, neighbors, or coworkers who have recently had plumbing work done for recommendations. They can provide valuable insights into a plumber's quality of work, communication, and pricing.\n2. **Online review sites**: Check online review platforms like:\n\t* Yelp\n\t* Google Reviews\n\t* Angie's List (paid subscription)\n\t* HomeAdvisor\n\t* Thumbtack\n\t* Facebook Reviews\n\t* Nextdoor (if you're a member)\n\nFilter the results by rating, distance, and services offered. Pay attention to the overall rating and read the reviews to get a sense of the plumber's reputation.\n3. **Check licenses and certifications**: Ensure the plumber is:\n\t* Licensed: Check with your state's licensing board to verify the plumber's license.\n\t* Insured: Make sure they have liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance.\n\t* Certified: Look for certifications like Master Plumber, Journeyman Plumber, or specialized certifications like Medical Gas Systems or Hydronic Heating.\n4. **Get multiple quotes**: Reach out to at least three plumbers and ask for quotes over the phone or through their website. Compare prices, services, and warranties offered.\n5. **Check their experience**: Ask about their experience with similar issues (e.g., toilet repairs) and if they have any specialized equipment or expertise.\n6. **Verify their physical address**: A legitimate business should have a physical address, not just a PO box.\n7. **Check for 24/7 emergency services**: If you need urgent assistance, ensure the plumber offers emergency services and has a clear process for handling after-hours calls.\n\nOnce you've narrowed down your options, ask the following questions before hiring a plumber:\n\n* What's the estimated cost of the repair?\n* What's the warranty or guarantee on the repair?\n* Do you provide a detailed invoice or estimate before starting work?\n* Can you provide references or examples of similar work?\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well on your way to finding a reliable and skilled plumber to fix your toilet."

As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal preferences or experiences, but I can provide some general tips and popular recommendations for body lotions that might help:\n\n1. **Moisturize immediately after showering**: Apply lotion within 3 minutes of showering, while your skin is still damp. This helps lock in moisture.\n2. **Look for humectants**: Ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and ceramides help retain moisture in the skin.\n3. **Choose a rich, non-comedogenic lotion**: Opt for a thick, creamy lotion that's labeled \"non-comedogenic\" or \"hypoallergenic\" to reduce the risk of clogged pores.\n4. **Consider your skin type**: If you have dry skin, look for lotions specifically formulated for dry skin or sensitive skin. If you have oily skin, look for lightweight, oil-free lotions.\n\nSome popular body lotion brands and products that you might find helpful:\n\n* **CeraVe Moisturizing Body Lotion**: Fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and rich in ceramides.\n* **Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Body Lotion**: Contains oatmeal to soothe dry, itchy skin.\n* **L'Occitane Shea Butter Extra Gentle Body Cream**: Rich in shea butter and vitamin E to nourish dry skin.\n* **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Body Gel Cream**: Lightweight, non-greasy, and hydrating.\n* **Jergens Ultra Healing Moisturizer**: Provides long-lasting hydration and helps repair dry skin.\n\nRemember to always read reviews, check the ingredient list, and patch test a new lotion on a small area of skin before using it on your entire body.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best in finding a great plumber and a wonderful body lotion to soothe your dry skin!"

      "content": "I'm happy to help you with that! Cleaning the bathroom mirror can be a chore, but I've got some tips to make it easier for you.\n\n**Water spots:**\n\n1. **White vinegar and water**: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the mirror and wipe clean with a lint-free cloth or paper towel. The acid in the vinegar helps break down mineral deposits causing water spots.\n2. **Microfiber cloth and water**: Use a microfiber cloth and warm water to wipe down the mirror. The microfiber cloth is gentle and effective at removing water spots.\n3. **Glass cleaner and newspaper**: Spray a glass cleaner onto the mirror and wipe clean with a newspaper page. The ink from the newspaper can help remove water spots.\n\n**Toothpaste splatters:**\n\n1. **Toothpaste remover**: Look for a toothpaste remover or a bathroom cleaner specifically designed to remove toothpaste stains.\n2. **Baking soda and water**: Make a paste by mixing baking soda and water. Apply the paste to the toothpaste stain and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Then, scrub the area with a soft cloth and rinse with warm water.\n3. **Hydrogen peroxide**: Apply hydrogen peroxide to the toothpaste stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe clean with a cloth.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Dry the mirror**: After cleaning, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe down the mirror and remove any excess water or cleaning solution. This will help prevent water spots from forming again.\n2. **Regular cleaning**: Clean your bathroom mirror regularly to prevent water spots and toothpaste splatters from building up.\n3. **Use a squeegee**: Consider using a squeegee after showering or brushing your teeth to remove excess water from the mirror.\n\nI hope these tips help you get your bathroom mirror sparkling clean again!"
