      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences. But typically, ranking systems for PvP (player vs player) matches are based on the Elo rating system. The basic concept is that each player starts with a certain rating, and then their rating goes up or down depending on whether they win or lose matches. The actual number of points earned or lost is based on various factors, such as the player's rating compared to their opponent's, the margin of victory, and the number of games played.\n\nPlayers are usually placed into different tiers, or rankings, based on their Elo rating. For example, in a game with 10 tiers, players with the highest Elo ratings might be in the top tier, while players with lower Elo ratings might be in the lower tiers. Players can move up or down the tiers based on their performance in matches.\n\nSome PvP ranking systems also incorporate other factors, such as player behavior or contribution to team objectives, to determine ranking. Overall, the goal of the ranking system is to provide a fair, competitive environment where players can understand their skill level and work towards improving it."

However, many games do offer rewards or incentives for reaching higher tiers in their ranking systems. These rewards could range from cosmetic items such as new character skins or badges to in-game currency, virtual items, or game-changing perks. The rewards could be given out at the end of a competitive season, or players could earn them as they progress to higher ranks. The exact rewards offered could vary from game to game, and even between different competitive modes in the same game. It's best to check with the specific game's developer or community to learn more about the rewards system for reaching higher tiers."
