Some customers have reported that grinds stick to the cup and fall all over the counter and floor, while others have noted that there is a problem with static electricity in the canister causing grinds to stick to the sides. Additionally, some customers found it difficult to remove the container from the grinder body without spilling grinds. The reviews also mention that the grinder is fast and quiet but the design flaw and mess it causes are not worth it."
