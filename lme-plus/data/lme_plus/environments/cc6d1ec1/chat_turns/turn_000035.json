  "content": "Since I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or celebrations, so I won't be personalizing any messages. However, I can suggest some ideas for you to consider:\n\n**General message:**\n\n* A simple \"Thank you for celebrating with me!\" or \"Thanks for being an amazing friend/family member!\"\n* A heartfelt message like \"You're the best part of my life\" or \"I'm grateful for our friendship\"\n\n**Specific to the occasion or 30th birthday celebration:**\n\n* \"Cheers to 30 and many more adventures together!\"\n* \"Thirty, flirty, and thriving thanks to friends like you!\"\n* \"Here's to another decade of making memories together!\"\n* \"Thanks for helping me celebrate this milestone birthday in style!\"\n\n**Inside joke or personalized reference:**\n\n* If you have a inside joke or a special phrase that's unique to your group, consider incorporating it into the message.\n* You could also include a reference to a shared experience or memory that's specific to your group.\n\nRemember to keep the message concise, as it will be displayed on a small keychain or coaster. You want to make sure it's easy to read and understand.\n\nWhat do you think? Do any of these ideas stand out to you, or do you have something else in mind?",
