Repurposing your pottery pieces into decorative wall art can be a fantastic way to showcase your ceramics and add a unique touch to your home or studio.\n\nThe framing shop on Main St might be a good option to explore, but it depends on their expertise and experience with ceramics. Some framing shops may not have the necessary knowledge or equipment to work with three-dimensional objects like pottery.\n\nBefore taking your pieces to the framer, you might want to ask them a few questions:\n\n1. Have they worked with ceramics or pottery before?\n2. Do they have experience with shadow boxing or deep frames that can accommodate 3D objects?\n3. Can they provide recommendations for the best way to display your specific pieces?\n\nIf the framer seems unsure or inexperienced, you might want to consider alternative options:\n\n1. **Local craft fairs or markets**: Look for events where you can showcase and sell your pottery pieces as is, or consider partnering with other artisans to create a collaborative display.\n2. **Home decor or furniture stores**: Reach out to local businesses that focus on unique, handmade, or artisanal pieces. They might be interested in showcasing your work or know of customers looking for one-of-a-kind decorative items.\n3. **Online marketplaces**: Consider selling your pottery pieces on platforms like Etsy, eBay, or Redbubble, which cater to handmade or unique items. You can also create your own website or social media profiles to showcase and sell your work.\n4. **Local art galleries or studios**: Research galleries or studios that focus on ceramics or mixed media art. They might be interested in featuring your work or know of artists who can help you create a display piece.\n\nRemember to take high-quality photos of your pottery pieces and create a portfolio or online presence to showcase your work. This will make it easier to share your art with potential buyers, collaborators, or display opportunities.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find the perfect way to showcase your beautiful pottery pieces!",
