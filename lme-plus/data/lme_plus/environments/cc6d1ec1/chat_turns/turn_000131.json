  "content": "I think we're having a repeat scenario! FashionFiesta is also a fictional store, which means it doesn't exist and therefore doesn't have an end-of-season sale or any other promotions.\n\nIf you're interested in learning about end-of-season sales or promotions at a specific store, I'd be happy to help you research that store's sales schedule and discounts. Please let me know the name of the store you're interested in, and I can try to provide you with more information.\n\nIf you're looking for general advice on when end-of-season sales typically happen, I can offer some insights. End-of-season sales usually occur when stores are clearing out old inventory to make room for new products. This can happen at the end of winter, spring, summer, or fall, depending on the type of products and the store's inventory cycle. Discounts can vary, but you can often expect 20-50% off regular prices or even deeper discounts on clearance items.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",
