  "content": "I ended up getting a Sonos Beam soundbar, and I'm really happy with it so far. The setup was easy, and it's been a huge upgrade from my TV's built-in speakers.\n\nAs for my viewing habits, I think having a soundbar has made me more inclined to watch movies at home rather than on my laptop. The improved sound quality has definitely enhanced my overall viewing experience, and I've been enjoying movies more than ever.\n\nSpeaking of which, I've been keeping track of my movie watching habits, and I realized that I've watched a total of 25 movies in the past three months. That's a lot more than I expected! Do you have any recommendations for tools or apps that can help me track my movie watching habits more easily?",
