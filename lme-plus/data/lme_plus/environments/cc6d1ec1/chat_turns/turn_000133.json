  "content": "I think we're having a repeat scenario again! FashionFiesta is a fictional store, which means it doesn't exist, and therefore, it doesn't have a cashback rewards program, VIP membership, or sales.\n\nAs a friendly AI, I'm here to help you with your questions, but I need to clarify that FashionFiesta is not a real store. If you're planning to shop at a specific store, I'd be happy to help you research their rewards program, sales, and promotions. Please let me know the name of the store you're interested in, and I'll do my best to provide you with accurate information.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to fact-check and verify the existence of stores, promotions, and rewards programs before making plans or assuming they exist.",
