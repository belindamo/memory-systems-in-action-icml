QuickBooks Self-Employed and Artwork Archive can definitely help you stay organized and on top of your finances.\n\n**Separate business bank account:**\n\nYes, I highly recommend opening a separate business bank account, especially as you start selling your art online. Here's why:\n\n1. **Separation of personal and business finances:** A separate business account helps you keep your personal and business finances separate, which is essential for tax purposes and financial clarity.\n2. **Professionalism:** Having a business bank account makes you appear more professional to clients, galleries, and other art industry professionals.\n3. **Easier expense tracking:** A dedicated business account makes it easier to track business expenses, income, and payments, which is crucial for tax deductions and financial planning.\n4. **Limited personal liability:** If you're operating as a sole proprietorship (which is likely, as an artist), a separate business account can help protect your personal assets in case of any business-related issues.\n\nYou can open a business bank account at a traditional bank, credit union, or online banking platform. Some popular options for small businesses and freelancers include:\n\n1. Chase Bank\n2. Bank of America\n3. Wells Fargo\n4. Capital One Spark Business\n5. Axos Bank\n6. Novo Bank\n\nWhen choosing a business bank account, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Fees:** Look for accounts with low or no monthly fees, especially if you're just starting out.\n2. **Interest rates:** If you expect to hold a significant balance in your account, look for a high-yield business savings account.\n3. **Online banking and mobile banking:** Ensure the bank offers a user-friendly online platform and mobile app for easy access to your account.\n4. **Customer support:** Choose a bank with reliable customer support, in case you need assistance with your account.\n\nBy separating your personal and business finances, you'll be better equipped to manage your art business and make informed financial decisions.\n\nRemember, as you start selling your art online, it's essential to stay organized, keep track of your finances, and plan for taxes. You got this!",
