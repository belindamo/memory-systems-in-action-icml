  "content": "Selling original artworks on Saatchi Art, Etsy, and Shopify can be a great way to reach a targeted audience. Here's a breakdown of the costs associated with each platform, including payment processing fees:\n\n**Saatchi Art**\n\n* **Commission fee:** 35% of the artwork's sale price\n* **Payment processing fee:** Saatchi Art doesn't charge a separate payment processing fee, as it's included in the commission fee.\n* **Listing fee:** None\n* **Other costs:** None\n\nSaatchi Art handles payment processing, shipping, and customer service, which can be convenient, but it means you'll need to factor in their commission fee when pricing your artwork.\n\n**Etsy**\n\n* **Listing fee:** $0.20 per listing (expires after 4 months or when the item sells)\n* **Transaction fee:** 3.5% of the sale price (including shipping)\n* **Payment processing fee:** 3% + $0.25 per transaction (PayPal payment processing fee)\n* **Other costs:** Optional: $10-$30 per month for promoted listings or advertising\n\nEtsy's fees can add up, but it's a popular platform for handmade and unique items, including art. You can factor the listing and transaction fees into your pricing, and consider using Etsy's payment processing system or PayPal to streamline transactions.\n\n**Shopify**\n\n* **Monthly subscription fee:** $29 (Basic Shopify), $79 (Shopify), or $299 (Advanced Shopify)\n* **Payment processing fee:** 2.9% + 30\u00a2 per online transaction (using Shopify Payments)\n* **Transaction fee:** None (if using Shopify Payments), or 2.0% + 30\u00a2 per online transaction (using third-party payment gateways)\n* **Other costs:** Optional: theme customizations, app subscriptions, or third-party payment gateway fees\n\nShopify is an e-commerce platform that gives you more control over your online store, but you'll need to handle payment processing, shipping, and customer service yourself. You can choose from various payment gateways, including Shopify Payments, which offers competitive rates.\n\nWhen calculating your pricing, consider the following:\n\n* **Saatchi Art:** Add 35% to your desired sale price to cover the commission fee.\n* **Etsy:** Add the listing fee, transaction fee, and payment processing fee to your desired sale price. For example, if you want to sell an artwork for $100, you might list it for $115 to cover the fees ($100 + $0.20 listing fee + $3.50 transaction fee + $3 payment processing fee + $8.30 profit margin).\n* **Shopify:** Factor in the monthly subscription fee, payment processing fee, and any other costs (e.g., theme customizations) when determining your pricing. You may want to consider a higher sale price to cover these expenses.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just the platform fees, and you should also consider other expenses, such as materials, shipping, and marketing costs, when pricing your artworks.",
