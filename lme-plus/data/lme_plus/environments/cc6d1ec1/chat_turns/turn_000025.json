  "content": "Happy belated 30th birthday! I'm glad to hear that your surprise party was a success!\n\nAs for finding a venue for your get-together, I'd be happy to help. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't provide specific recommendations for local restaurants. But I can offer some general tips and suggestions to help you find a suitable venue:\n\n1. **Check online review sites**: Websites like Yelp, Google Reviews, or TripAdvisor can give you an idea of which restaurants in your area have good reviews and can accommodate large groups.\n2. **Call ahead**: Reach out to restaurants directly to inquire about their private dining options, capacity, and menu offerings.\n3. **Consider event spaces**: If you're looking for a more private setting, consider event spaces or banquet halls that can be rented for private events.\n4. **Look for restaurants with party rooms**: Some restaurants have dedicated party rooms or areas that can be reserved for large groups.\n5. **Check menus and pricing**: Make sure the restaurant's menu and pricing fit your group's preferences and budget.\n\nTo get started, can you please share your city or zip code with me? That way, I can provide more tailored suggestions and recommendations.\n\nGood luck with your venue search, and I hope your get-together is a success!",
