Attracting birds to your yard can be a wonderful hobby.\n\nChoosing the right seed mix is an important part of attracting a variety of birds to your feeder. A good all-purpose seed mix should include a blend of seeds that cater to different bird species and their feeding preferences. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Black oil sunflower seeds**: These are a staple in many bird seed mixes. They're high in fat and protein, making them a favorite among cardinals, finches, and sparrows.\n2. **Nyjer seed** (thistle): This tiny seed is rich in oil and preferred by finches, sparrows, and other small birds.\n3. **Safflower seeds**: These seeds are a good alternative to sunflower seeds, as they're less likely to attract squirrels and other mammals. They're a favorite among cardinals, finches, and doves.\n4. **Suet**: A high-energy food made from animal fat, suet is often mixed with seeds and nuts. It's a great attractant for woodpeckers, nuthatches, and chickadees.\n5. **Fruit and nuts**: Adding some dried fruits, like cranberries or cherries, and nuts, like peanuts or hazelnuts, can attract birds like blue jays, woodpeckers, and robins.\n\nWhen selecting a seed mix, look for a blend that includes a mix of these ingredients. A good all-purpose mix should contain:\n\n* 20-30% black oil sunflower seeds\n* 20-30% Nyjer seed\n* 20-30% safflower seeds\n* 10-20% suet\n* 10-20% fruit and nuts\n\nSome popular bird seed brands that offer good all-purpose mixes include:\n\n* Audubon Park\n* Perky-Pet\n* Wild Birds Unlimited\n* Droll Yankees\n\nRemember to choose a seed mix that's fresh and stored properly to ensure the seeds remain viable and attractive to birds.\n\nIn addition to the seed mix, consider the following tips to attract a variety of birds to your feeder:\n\n* Place your feeder in an area that receives morning sun and is protected from strong winds and predators.\n* Keep your feeder clean and well-maintained to prevent mold and bacteria growth.\n* Provide a source of water, like a birdbath or pond, for birds to drink and bathe in.\n* Plant native vegetation and flowers that provide shelter, food, and nesting sites for birds.\n\nEnjoy your bird watching hobby, and happy birding!",
