Could you please provide me with the following information:\n\n1. Processor (CPU): What's the model and clock speed of your processor? (e.g., Intel Core i5-11600K, AMD Ryzen 5 5600X)\n2. Graphics Card (GPU): What's the model and VRAM of your graphics card? (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070, AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT)\n3. RAM: How much RAM does your PC have, and what's the speed? (e.g., 16 GB DDR4 3200 MHz)\n4. Operating System: Are you running Windows 10 or another operating system?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can give you an idea of whether your PC can handle Cyberpunk 2077's system requirements.\n\nBy the way, that's awesome that you're enjoying Rocket League with your friends! Ranking up to platinum is a great goal. Do you have a favorite car or playstyle?\n\n(Note: If you're not sure about your PC's specs, you can check them in Windows 10 by pressing the Windows key + Pause/Break, or by using a tool like CPU-Z, GPU-Z, or System Information.)",
