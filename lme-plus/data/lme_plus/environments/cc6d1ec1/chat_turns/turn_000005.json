  "content": "The way the characters are interconnected is one of the strengths of the book, isn't it? Taylor Jenkins Reid does a great job of weaving together the different storylines and characters to create a rich and complex narrative.\n\nEvelyn's backstory as a Cuban immigrant is so powerful, and it's great that you were drawn in by that aspect of the story. It's a really important part of her character, and it informs so much of her behavior and motivations throughout the book. The way she navigates the challenges of being a woman, a Latina, and an immigrant in Hollywood is really compelling, and it adds so much depth to the story.\n\nAnd of course, the mystery surrounding her husbands is a big part of the book's appeal! I think it's safe to say that each of Evelyn's husbands plays a significant role in her life, and their stories are all intertwined in interesting ways. As you continue reading, you'll learn more about each of them and how they fit into Evelyn's narrative.\n\nOne of the things that's so impressive about Taylor Jenkins Reid's writing is the way she's able to balance the glamour and excitement of Evelyn's celebrity life with the more serious themes and emotions that underpin the story. It's a really skillful balancing act, and it makes the book feel both escapist and thought-provoking at the same time.\n\nWhat do you think of Monique, the journalist who's writing Evelyn's biography? Do you think she's a good narrator for the story, or do you wish we were seeing things more from Evelyn's perspective?",
