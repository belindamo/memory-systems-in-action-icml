  "content": "Exactly! Monique is a great narrator because she's not just a passive observer, but an active participant in the storytelling process. She's got her own biases and motivations, and that adds an extra layer of complexity to the story. It's also interesting to see how Monique's own life and experiences influence her perceptions of Evelyn and her story.\n\nI think Monique's character also serves as a kind of stand-in for the reader. We're learning about Evelyn's life through Monique's eyes, and Monique's reactions and thoughts help to guide our own understanding of the story. It's a clever narrative device, and it adds to the sense of intimacy and immediacy that makes the book so compelling.\n\nAnd you're right, Monique's own life and biases do influence her perceptions of Evelyn. She's got her own struggles and insecurities, and those inform the way she approaches Evelyn's story. It's a great example of how our own experiences and biases can shape the way we see the world and the people in it.\n\nI think Taylor Jenkins Reid does a great job of using Monique's character to explore some really interesting themes, like the nature of celebrity and fame, the power dynamics between women, and the way that our personal experiences shape our perceptions of the world. It's a really nuanced and thought-provoking book, and Monique's character is a big part of what makes it so effective.\n\nWhat do you think about the way the book explores the theme of identity? Evelyn's identity is so tied up in her celebrity persona, but we're also seeing glimpses of her inner life and her true self. Do you think that's something that resonates with you, or is it more of a fascination with the glamour of celebrity culture?",
