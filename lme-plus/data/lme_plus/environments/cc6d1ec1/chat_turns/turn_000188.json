More importantly,\nfewer correct responses occurred when the distractor matched the\ncolor from the memory display, suggesting that the irrelevant color\nguided attention to distractors that contained this color. However,\nthe effect of color match was strongly attenuated with separate\ncolor presentation. To corroborate these observations, we first conducted an omnibus analysis of variance (ANOVA) on all conditions. The planned t tests between no-match and distractor-match\nconditions were carried out after obtaining a significant two-way\ninteraction. A 2 (color presentation: combined, separate) 3 3\n(color match: target match, distractor match, no match) repeatedmeasures ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of color\nmatch, F(2, 24) = 142.88, p , .01, hp\n2 = .923, and a significant\ninteraction, F(2, 24) = 21.94, p , .01, hp\n2 = .646. The interaction\nshowed that the effect of color match was stronger when color and\nshape were combined than when they were separated. Planned t\ntests confirmed fewer correct responses in the distractor-match\nthan the no-match condition. The difference was reliable when\ncolor was combined with shape in the memory display (52% vs.\n78%), t(12) = 8.81, p , .01, Cohen\u2019s dz = 2.44, and when color\nand shape were separate (68% vs. 75%), t(12) = 2.96, p = .01,\nCohen\u2019s dz = .82. Importantly, the difference between distractormatch and no-match conditions was larger in the combined than in\nthe separate condition (difference of 26% vs. 6%), t(12) = 5.00,\np , .01, Cohen\u2019s dz = 1.39. The no-match condition did not differ\nsignificantly between combined and separate presentation (78%\nvs. 75%), t(12) = 1.92, p = .08, Cohen\u2019s dz = .53.\nNext, we subjected individual medians of saccadic RTs to the\nsame 2 3 3 ANOVA. There was a significant main effect of color\nmatch, F(2, 24) = 5.12, p = .01, hp\n2 = .299, showing that RTs were\nshorter in the target-match (207 ms) than in the distractor-match\n(214 ms) or no no-match (213 ms) conditions. No other effect\nreached significance, ps . .21.",
