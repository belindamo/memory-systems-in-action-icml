Offering a few smaller gifts can provide a nice variety for your guests, and it's a thoughtful way to show your appreciation.\n\nThe customized keychains or coasters with a special message will make for a lovely token of appreciation, and they're practical too! Guests can use them daily, and the message will serve as a reminder of the special celebration.\n\nThe set of three smaller candles in different scents is also an excellent idea. It allows guests to experience different fragrances and can cater to varying tastes. Plus, who doesn't love candles? It's a thoughtful gift that can add a touch of warmth and coziness to any space.\n\nTogether, the customized keychains or coasters and the set of candles will make for a lovely gift combination. It's a nice balance of something practical and something indulgent, and it shows you've put thought into selecting gifts that your guests will appreciate.\n\nRemember to consider the packaging and presentation as well. You could place the keychain or coaster in a small gift bag or box, and the candles could be packaged in a decorative box or bag with a personalized label or card. This will add a nice touch to the overall gift-giving experience.\n\nI think you're making great choices, and your guests are sure to appreciate the thought and effort you're putting into making this celebration special!",
