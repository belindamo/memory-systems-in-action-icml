If you're looking for more contemporary fiction novels with strong female protagonists and complex relationships, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **The Devil Wears Prada** by Lauren Weisberger: While not exactly like Evelyn Hugo, this classic novel explores the complex relationship between a demanding boss and her assistant, with a strong focus on female characters and relationships.\n2. **The Mothers** by Brit Bennett: This novel follows a young girl's coming-of-age in a tight-knit Southern California community, exploring themes of motherhood, identity, and complex relationships between women.\n3. **The Girls** by Emma Cline: Set in the 1960s, this novel follows a group of teenage girls who get caught up in a Manson-esque cult, exploring themes of female relationships, identity, and the power dynamics between women.\n4. **The Interestings** by Meg Wolitzer: This novel follows a group of friends who meet at a summer camp for the arts, exploring their complex relationships and the ways in which they shape each other's lives over the years.\n5. **Conversations with Friends** by Sally Rooney: This novel follows the complex relationships between two young women and the couple they become embroiled with, exploring themes of power, identity, and desire.\n6. **The Female Persuasion** by Meg Wolitzer: Another novel by Wolitzer, this one follows a young woman's complex relationships with her mentor, a famous feminist, and explores themes of identity, power, and relationships between women.\n7. **The Last Romantics** by Tara Conklin: This novel follows four siblings who grow up together, exploring their complex relationships and the ways in which they shape each other's lives over the years.\n8. **The Age of Light** by Whitney Scharer: This novel is based on the true story of Lee Miller, a model and photographer who was part of the Parisian avant-garde in the 1920s and 1930s. It explores her complex relationships with the men in her life, as well as her own identity and desires.\n\nThese novels all feature strong female protagonists and complex relationships, although some may not have the same level of glamour and celebrity as Evelyn Hugo. I hope you find something that interests you!\n\n(By the way, I'm curious: what do you think of the themes and characters in Evelyn Hugo so far? Do you have a favorite character or plot thread?)",
