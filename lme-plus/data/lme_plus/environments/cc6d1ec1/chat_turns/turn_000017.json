Cardboard boxes and paper bags are perfect materials to get started. Here are some tips to help you create a fun and challenging course for Luna:\n\n1. **Start simple**: Begin with a simple course and gradually add more complexity as Luna becomes more confident and skilled.\n2. **Use a variety of obstacles**: Incorporate different types of obstacles, such as:\n\t* Tunnels: Use cardboard boxes or paper bags to create tunnels for Luna to navigate through.\n\t* Jumps: Place small boxes or books on the floor for Luna to jump over.\n\t* Weave poles: Set up a series of cardboard tubes or paper rolls for Luna to weave through.\n\t* Climbs: Use stacked boxes or a small cat ladder for Luna to climb.\n\t* Mazes: Create a maze using boxes or paper bags for Luna to navigate through.\n3. **Encourage exploration**: Place treats or toys along the course to encourage Luna to explore and investigate each obstacle.\n4. **Vary the layout**: Change the layout of the course regularly to keep Luna engaged and challenged.\n5. **Make it sensory-friendly**: Incorporate different textures, such as carpet, paper, or cardboard, to provide a variety of sensory experiences for Luna.\n6. **Add vertical elements**: Incorporate vertical elements, like cat shelves or boxes, to encourage Luna to climb and jump.\n7. **Keep it safe**: Ensure the course is safe and stable, with no loose objects that can fall or harm Luna.\n8. **Encourage problem-solving**: Add obstacles that require problem-solving, such as a box with a small hole to crawl through or a paper bag with a treat inside.\n9. **Make it fun**: Most importantly, make it fun for Luna! Encourage her to play and explore the course, and reward her with treats and praise when she completes it.\n\nSome specific ideas for your course could include:\n\n* A \"paper bag tunnel\" where Luna has to crawl through a series of connected paper bags\n* A \"box jump\" where Luna has to jump from one box to another\n* A \"cardboard maze\" where Luna has to navigate through a complex series of cardboard boxes\n* A \"climbing wall\" where Luna has to climb up a series of stacked boxes to reach a treat\n\nRemember to always supervise Luna when she's using the agility course, and encourage her to take breaks to avoid exhaustion. With a little creativity, you can create a fun and challenging course that will keep Luna engaged and active for hours!",
