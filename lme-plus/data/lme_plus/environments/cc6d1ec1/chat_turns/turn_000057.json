Here are my top picks:\n\n1. **Hyatt Centric South Beach Miami**:\n\t* Pool: Yes, rooftop pool with ocean views\n\t* Beach Access: Direct access to South Beach\n\t* Walking Distance: Restaurants, shops, and bars along Lincoln Road Mall and Ocean Drive\n\t* Price: Around $250-350 per night\n2. **The Confidante Miami Beach**:\n\t* Pool: Yes, outdoor pool with lounge chairs and cabanas\n\t* Beach Access: Direct access to Mid-Beach\n\t* Walking Distance: Restaurants and shops along 41st Street and Indian Creek Drive\n\t* Price: Around $280-380 per night\n3. **The Shelborne Wyndham Grand South Beach**:\n\t* Pool: Yes, rooftop pool with ocean views\n\t* Beach Access: Direct access to South Beach\n\t* Walking Distance: Restaurants, shops, and bars along Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue\n\t* Price: Around $300-400 per night\n4. **Cadillac Hotel & Beach Club**:\n\t* Pool: Yes, outdoor pool with lounge chairs and cabanas\n\t* Beach Access: Direct access to Mid-Beach\n\t* Walking Distance: Restaurants and shops along 39th Street and Indian Creek Drive\n\t* Price: Around $250-350 per night\n\nAll of these hotels offer a great balance of amenities, location, and price. However, if I had to pick one, I'd recommend the **Hyatt Centric South Beach Miami**. It's a modern hotel with a rooftop pool, direct beach access, and is located in the heart of South Beach, within walking distance to many restaurants, shops, and bars.\n\nPlease note that prices may vary depending on the time of year, room type, and availability. I recommend checking the hotels' websites or a hotel booking website like Expedia or Booking.com for the most up-to-date prices.\n\nWhich one of these options sounds most appealing to you?",
