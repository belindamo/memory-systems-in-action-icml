  "content": "* Experiment investigated attentional guidance by irrelevant features stored in integrated or separate feature templates\n* Participants were first-year psychology students at the University of Geneva\n* The trial started with the presentation of the fixation display, followed by the memory display and a blank screen\n* In the memory display, the target shape was presented in the center, surrounded by a ring. The irrelevant color was either combined with the target shape or shown separately on the ring\n* In the saccadic choice display, a shape was shown on the left and right of central fixation and participants had to make a saccade to the target shape\n* The color match between memory and saccadic choice display was manipulated in three conditions (target match, distractor match, no match)\n* Results showed fewer correct responses in the distractor-match than the no-match condition and the difference was larger in the combined than in the separate condition\n* RTs were shorter in the target-match than in the distractor-match or no-match conditions\n* Discussion suggests that attentional guidance by irrelevant color feature was reduced when separated from the relevant target shape, possibly because of reduced encoding of color into working memory.",
