  "content": "From an ethical standpoint, the use of gene therapy in animals for agricultural or research purposes may be more acceptable than its use in humans. This is because animals are not seen as having the same level of moral status as humans and are often used for the benefit of humans. \n\nHowever, there are still ethical considerations to take into account when using gene therapy in animals. One concern is the potential for unintended consequences or harm to the animals themselves, as well as the potential for negative environmental impacts from genetically modified animals. Additionally, the issue of animal welfare must be taken into account, as gene therapy may involve invasive procedures or genetic manipulation that could cause suffering.\n\nIn comparison, the use of gene therapy in humans raises a host of complex ethical issues, including concerns about safety, access, equity, and the potential for unintended consequences or harm. There are also concerns about the social and cultural implications of genetic manipulation in humans, with some arguing that it could lead to discrimination or stigmatization of certain individuals or groups.\n\nUltimately, both the use of gene therapy in animals and in humans require careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks, as well as a commitment to ethical principles like respect for autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence.",
