Here are some tips to help you keep track:\n\n**1. Label and date containers:** Use a marker to label each container with the date it was prepped, the meal name, and any reheating instructions. This way, you can quickly identify what you have and how long it's been stored.\n\n**2. Create a meal prep calendar:** Designate a calendar or planner page for your meal prep schedule. Write down the meals you've prepped, the date, and the expiration date. This visual aid will help you stay organized and ensure you're using older meals before they expire.\n\n**3. Use a meal prep app:** There are many meal prep apps available that allow you to track your prepped meals, including their expiration dates. Some popular options include:\n\t* Mealime: A meal planning and grocery list app that also tracks your prepped meals.\n\t* Plan to Eat: A meal planning app that allows you to track your prepped meals and generate a grocery list.\n\t* FreshBox: A meal prep app that helps you track your prepped meals, including expiration dates and nutritional information.\n\n**4. Set reminders:** Set reminders on your phone or calendar to check your meal prep containers and consume meals before they expire.\n\n**5. Store meals in order:** Store your prepped meals in your refrigerator or freezer in the order they need to be consumed. This way, you'll ensure that older meals are used before newer ones.\n\n**6. Freeze meals:** Consider freezing meals that can be safely frozen, like soups, stews, or casseroles. This way, you can extend their shelf life and enjoy them at a later date.\n\n**7. Check expiration dates regularly:** Regularly check your meal prep containers for expiration dates and consume or freeze meals before they spoil.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you'll be able to keep track of your prepped meals, reduce food waste, and enjoy healthy, convenient lunches and snacks all week long!\n\nHow do you think you'll keep track of your meal prep?
