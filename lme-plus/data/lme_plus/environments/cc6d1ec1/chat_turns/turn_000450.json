While suet can be an attractive offering for many woodpeckers, unfortunately, Red-headed Woodpeckers are not typically drawn to suet.\n\n**Red-headed Woodpecker habits:**\n\nRed-headed Woodpeckers are open-country birds that prefer grasslands, savannas, and agricultural areas with scattered trees. They're omnivores, which means they eat a wide variety of foods, including:\n\n1. **Insects**: Grasshoppers, crickets, and other insects are a staple in their diet.\n2. **Fruits and berries**: They enjoy fruits like cherries, blueberries, and blackberries.\n3. **Nuts and seeds**: They'll eat seeds from grasses, weeds, and crops, as well as nuts like acorns and beechnuts.\n\n**Tips to attract Red-headed Woodpeckers:**\n\nWhile suet might not be the best attractant, you can try the following to increase your chances of spotting a Red-headed Woodpecker:\n\n1. **Open areas**: Create or maintain open areas in your yard, such as meadows or grasslands, with scattered trees.\n2. **Native plants**: Plant native grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs that produce fruits, berries, and seeds, like coneflower, blackberry, or dogwood.\n3. **Insect-friendly habitat**: Create a habitat that attracts insects, such as a pollinator garden or a brush pile, which will attract Red-headed Woodpeckers searching for food.\n4. **Water source**: Provide a water source, like a shallow dish or birdbath, as Red-headed Woodpeckers need water for drinking and bathing.\n5. **Be patient**: Red-headed Woodpeckers are relatively rare and nomadic, so it may take time and patience to spot one in your area.\n\n**Suet for other woodpeckers:**\n\nWhile suet might not attract Red-headed Woodpeckers, it's still a great attractant for other woodpecker species, like Downy, Hairy, and Red-bellied Woodpeckers. Offer suet in combination with the tips above, and you might attract a variety of woodpeckers to your yard.\n\nRemember to keep your eyes peeled for other bird species that might visit your yard, and enjoy the process of creating a welcoming habitat for all birds!",
