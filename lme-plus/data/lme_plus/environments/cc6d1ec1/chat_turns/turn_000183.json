  "content": "* The study involved two conditions for the mode of color presentation:\n\t1. The irrelevant color in the memory display was combined with the target shape\n\t2. The irrelevant color in the memory display was shown separately on the ring.\n* The color match between memory and saccadic choice display was manipulated in three conditions:\n\t1. Target-match condition (25% of trials): the target shape in the saccadic choice display was in the color from the memory display, and the distractor was in a different color.\n\t2. Distractor-match condition (25% of trials): the distractor was in the color from the memory display, and the target shape was in a different color.\n\t3. No-match condition (50% of trials): both target and distractor shapes were in colors different from the memory display.\n* The study consisted of 384 trials, with each mode of color presentation having 96 trials in the no-match condition, and 48 trials each in the target- and distractor-match conditions.\n* The target and distractor objects were selected randomly and without replacement from the 510 available shapes.\n* The four colors and the two lateral target positions were equally likely.",
