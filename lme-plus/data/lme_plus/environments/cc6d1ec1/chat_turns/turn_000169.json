  "content": "Yes, there can be a downside to technology's influence on how we perceive global issues. While technology can help us access vast amounts of information, it can also lead to an overload of information, which can be harmful. When we are exposed to too much information, it can become overwhelming, confusing, and may lead to misinformation or fake news.\n\nAnother downside of technology's influence on how we perceive global issues is the issue of filter bubbles. Filter bubbles occur when individuals only consume content that fits their pre-existing opinions and beliefs. This can lead to a lack of exposure to diverse perspectives, which can prevent individuals from critically analyzing and understanding global issues.\n\nMoreover, the rise of conspiracy theories and fake news is another major concern that has emerged due to the increased influence of technology on public opinion. These issues can create confusion, polarization and discredit scientific facts, which can be harmful to society as a whole.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to use technology in a critical and responsible way by consuming content from a variety of sources, fact-checking information, and avoiding echo chambers to maintain well-informed opinions of global issues.",
