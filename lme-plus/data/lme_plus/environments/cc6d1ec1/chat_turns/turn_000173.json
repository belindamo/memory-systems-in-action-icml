However, it is worth noting that the ethical concerns associated with gene therapy are not exclusively linked to the species involved, but also to the context and purpose of the therapy. \n\nIf gene therapy is applied to improve the health and well-being of individuals or ecosystems, without causing harm or violating ethical principles, it may gradually gain wider acceptance among various species. However, given the complex nature of genetic manipulation and the potential for unintended consequences, it is important to carefully assess and monitor the risks and benefits of such therapies, regardless of the species involved. Ongoing ethical debates and regulations will likely continue to shape the use of gene therapy in different contexts and species, with the goal of ensuring responsible and ethical practices.",
