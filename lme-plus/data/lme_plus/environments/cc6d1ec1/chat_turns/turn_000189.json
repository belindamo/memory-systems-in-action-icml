  "content": "Results of the study showed that more correct responses were made when the target in the choice display matched the color from the memory display, and fewer correct responses were made when the distractor matched the color from the memory display. However, the effect of color match was weaker when color and shape were presented separately. The difference between distractor-match and no-match conditions was larger in the combined than in the separate condition. The results showed that individual median saccadic reaction times were shorter in the target-match condition compared to the distractor-match and no-match conditions.",
