  "content": "Yes, you're right that Mellotrons can be quite expensive due to the amount of labor and specialized parts required to build them. However, Mellotrons are indeed still being produced today, thanks to a handful of manufacturers dedicated to keeping the instrument alive.\n\nOne of the biggest of these companies is Streetly Electronics, which was founded in the UK by the Bradley brothers who originally invented the Mellotron. Streetly Electronics produces a range of Mellotron models, including the M4000D, which is a digital version of the classic instrument that uses high-quality samples of Mellotron sounds.\n\nOther manufacturers include Mellotronen in Sweden and Markus Resch in Germany, both of whom make authentic reproductions of vintage Mellotrons using original parts and materials. There are also several companies that make software versions of the Mellotron, which can be used on computers and synthesizers.\n\nBecause the Mellotron is still a niche instrument, it's not as widely produced as other keyboard instruments like synthesizers. However, there's still a loyal following of musicians and collectors who love the Mellotron's unique sound and playing feel, so it's likely that we'll continue to see new Mellotrons being built for years to come!",
