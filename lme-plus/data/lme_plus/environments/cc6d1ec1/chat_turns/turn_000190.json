The target shape\nwas presented at the start of a trial and had to be memorized until\nthe saccadic choice display was presented. In the combined condition, the target shape was shown in the irrelevant color. In the separate condition, the target shape was gray, and the irrelevant color\nwas shown on a surrounding ring. We observed that attentional\nguidance by the irrelevant color feature was strongly reduced when\nit was separated from the relevant target shape. This pattern of\nresults is consistent with the idea that attention is guided by integrated feature templates, resulting in more saccades to objects containing the irrelevant color. In contrast, guidance of attention by\nseparate feature templates is less efficient. However, alternative\ninterpretations exist. Notably, it may be that encoding of the irrelevant color into WM was less likely when color was presented separately on the ring compared to when it was combined into a single\nobject. Previous research on WM has suggested that whenever a\nrelevant feature of an object is encoded into WM, the irrelevant features follow (Ecker et al., 2013; Saiki, 2016; Shen et al., 2013).\nIndeed, object-based attention may be necessary to maintain these\nrepresentations (He et al., 2020; Matsukura & Vecera, 2009). Thus,\nseparating color from shape may have prevented color from being\nencoded in WM so that the reduced attentional guidance by color\ncomes as no surprise",
