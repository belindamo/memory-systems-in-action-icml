As I mentioned earlier, ShopSmart is a fictional store, so it doesn't exist and therefore doesn't have any promotions, loyalty programs, or deals.\n\nIf you're interested in learning about upcoming promotions or deals at a specific store, I'd be happy to help you research that store's loyalty program or promotional schedule. Please let me know the name of the store you're interested in, and I can try to provide you with more information.",
