Anticipations (response times [RTs] shorter than 100 ms), late trials (RTs longer than 350 ms), imprecise initial fixations (outside the\n1.4\u00b0 3 1.4\u00b0 fixation window), delayed initial fixations (where it\ntook longer than 2 s to identify a valid initial fixation), and amplitude errors (saccadic amplitudes smaller than half the eccentricity).\nError percentages are reported in Table 1. Overall, 15.8% (SD =\n10.5%) of trials were removed, ranging from 3% to 41%2 / 2",
