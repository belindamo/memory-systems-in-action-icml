      "content": "10.5%) of trials were removed, ranging from 3% to 41%.\nFigure 2 shows that relative to the no-match condition, more\ncorrect responses occurred when the target in the choice display\nmatched the color from the memory display. More importantly,\nfewer correct responses occurred when the distractor matched the\ncolor from the memory display, suggesting that the irrelevant color\nguided attention to distractors that contained this color. However,\nthe effect of color match was strongly attenuated with separate\ncolor presentation. To corroborate these observations, we first conducted an omnibus analysis of variance (ANOVA) on all conditions. The planned t tests between no-match and distractor-match\nconditions were carried out after obtaining a significant two-way\ninteraction. A 2 (color presentation: combined, separate) 3 3\n(color match: target match, distractor match, no match) repeatedmeasures ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of color\nmatch, F(2, 24) = 142.88, p , .01, hp\n2 = .923, and a significant\ninteraction, F(2, 24) = 21.94, p , .01, hp\n2 = .646. The interaction\nshowed that the effect of color match was stronger when color and\nshape were combined than when they were separated. Planned t\ntests confirmed fewer correct responses in the distractor-match\nthan the no-match condition. The difference was reliable when\ncolor was combined with shape in the memory display (52% vs.\n78%), t(12) = 8.81, p , .01, Cohen\u2019s dz = 2.44, and when color\nand shape were separate (68% vs. 75%), t(12) = 2.96, p = .01,\nCohen\u2019s dz = .82. Importantly, the difference between distractormatch and no-match conditions was larger in the combined than in\nthe separate condition (difference of 26% vs. 6%), t(12) = 5.00,\np , .01, Cohen\u2019s dz = 1.39. The no-match condition did not differ\nsignificantly between combined and separate presentation (78%\nvs. 75%), t(12) = 1.92, p = .08, Cohen\u2019s dz = .53.\nNext, we subjected individual medians of saccadic RTs to the\nsame 2 3 3 ANOVA. There was a significant main effect of color\nmatch, F(2, 24) = 5.12, p = .01, hp\n2 = .299, showing that RTs were\nshorter in the target-match (207 ms) than in the distractor-match\n(214 ms) or no no-match (213 ms) conditions. No other effect\nreached significance, ps . .21."

      "content": "Results of the study showed that more correct responses were made when the target in the choice display matched the color from the memory display, and fewer correct responses were made when the distractor matched the color from the memory display. However, the effect of color match was weaker when color and shape were presented separately. The difference between distractor-match and no-match conditions was larger in the combined than in the separate condition. The results showed that individual median saccadic reaction times were shorter in the target-match condition compared to the distractor-match and no-match conditions."

      "content": "Discussion\nWe measured attentional guidance by an irrelevant feature stored\neither in integrated or separate feature templates. The target shape\nwas presented at the start of a trial and had to be memorized until\nthe saccadic choice display was presented. In the combined condition, the target shape was shown in the irrelevant color. In the separate condition, the target shape was gray, and the irrelevant color\nwas shown on a surrounding ring. We observed that attentional\nguidance by the irrelevant color feature was strongly reduced when\nit was separated from the relevant target shape. This pattern of\nresults is consistent with the idea that attention is guided by integrated feature templates, resulting in more saccades to objects containing the irrelevant color. In contrast, guidance of attention by\nseparate feature templates is less efficient. However, alternative\ninterpretations exist. Notably, it may be that encoding of the irrelevant color into WM was less likely when color was presented separately on the ring compared to when it was combined into a single\nobject. Previous research on WM has suggested that whenever a\nrelevant feature of an object is encoded into WM, the irrelevant features follow (Ecker et al., 2013; Saiki, 2016; Shen et al., 2013).\nIndeed, object-based attention may be necessary to maintain these\nrepresentations (He et al., 2020; Matsukura & Vecera, 2009). Thus,\nseparating color from shape may have prevented color from being\nencoded in WM so that the reduced attentional guidance by color\ncomes as no surprise"
