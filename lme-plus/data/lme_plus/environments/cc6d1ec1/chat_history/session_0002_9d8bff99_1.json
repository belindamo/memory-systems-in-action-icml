However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't provide specific recommendations for local restaurants. But I can offer some general tips and suggestions to help you find a suitable venue:\n\n1. **Check online review sites**: Websites like Yelp, Google Reviews, or TripAdvisor can give you an idea of which restaurants in your area have good reviews and can accommodate large groups.\n2. **Call ahead**: Reach out to restaurants directly to inquire about their private dining options, capacity, and menu offerings.\n3. **Consider event spaces**: If you're looking for a more private setting, consider event spaces or banquet halls that can be rented for private events.\n4. **Look for restaurants with party rooms**: Some restaurants have dedicated party rooms or areas that can be reserved for large groups.\n5. **Check menus and pricing**: Make sure the restaurant's menu and pricing fit your group's preferences and budget.\n\nTo get started, can you please share your city or zip code with me? That way, I can provide more tailored suggestions and recommendations.\n\nGood luck with your venue search, and I hope your get-together is a success!"

Offering a few smaller gifts can provide a nice variety for your guests, and it's a thoughtful way to show your appreciation.\n\nThe customized keychains or coasters with a special message will make for a lovely token of appreciation, and they're practical too! Guests can use them daily, and the message will serve as a reminder of the special celebration.\n\nThe set of three smaller candles in different scents is also an excellent idea. It allows guests to experience different fragrances and can cater to varying tastes. Plus, who doesn't love candles? It's a thoughtful gift that can add a touch of warmth and coziness to any space.\n\nTogether, the customized keychains or coasters and the set of candles will make for a lovely gift combination.
