The barber, a diehard Nas fan, couldn't believe that anyone could think Jay Z was better.\n\n\"Jay Z is a talentless hack,\" the barber said, his voice rising in anger. \"Nas has been spitting real bars for decades. He's the true king of hip hop.\"\n\nJoel tried to calm the situation down, but the barber was having none of it. \"You can't deny Nas's lyrical genius,\" the barber insisted. \"Jay Z is just a corporate sellout, trying to make a quick buck off of the culture.\"\n\nThe argument continued to escalate, with both men getting more and more heated. Finally, Joel had had enough. \"Listen, I respect your opinion, but I'm not going to sit here and let you disrespect Jay Z like that,\" he said, standing up from the chair.\n\nThe barber sneered at Joel. \"Oh, so now you're going to try and defend him? Please. You can't even hold a candle to Nas's talent.\"\n\nJoel's temper snapped. \"You know what? I'm done with this conversation. I'm not paying for this haircut. Keep the money,\" he said, storming out of the barbershop. The argument had turned explosive, and Joel knew it was time to get out before things got even more out of hand."
