      "content": "Certainly! Based on the samples you provided, I can tell that your fictional writing style is characterized by a strong emphasis on descriptive language and imagery. You use metaphors and similes to create vivid mental images for the reader, and you have a tendency to use flowery or poetic language to convey emotion and atmosphere. Your fictional writing also tends to focus on character development and exploring themes or ideas.\n\nYour technical writing style, on the other hand, is more straightforward and focused on conveying information in a clear and concise manner. You use technical terms and jargon specific to the field you are writing about, and you organize your writing into sections or bullet points to make it easier to digest. You also tend to use more formal language and avoid contractions or colloquialisms."

      "content": "Damian, here is an example of a application I wrote, please remember all of the details about me and my writing style:\n\nAt Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I have grown extensively personally and academically. I was molded from a high school senior with big dreams to a researcher with the capabilities to achieve my dreams. Due to its project-based education and academic rigor, I chose to attend WPI and major in Biomedical Engineering. Each class was an invaluable experience requiring me to learn the material and apply it in an actual project. While at WPI, I nurtured skills such as biomedical engineering design, cell passaging, circuit design, and fabrication, as a few examples. This approach allowed me to truly understand the topics I was learning rather than just memorizing concepts. However, the primary reason I want to attend WPI is the overwhelming support from the staff at WPI. With the help of the many wonderful professors I had the privilege of meeting, I grew as a researcher and person in the last four years. Now, I hope to continue my growth at WPI and help others as I was once helped. \n My ambitions as a researcher have shifted while at WPI. However, the core notion remains the same. I am highly interested in pursuing neural interfaces. My goal is to one day start a research company based on developing brain-computer interfaces(BCIs) to help treat neurological disorders and enhance the human brain.\n In pursuing this goal, I was accepted into the 2020 summer undergraduate research program in Computational Neuroscience hosted by Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Despite the coronavirus and my lack of formal training in neuroscience, independent research, and preparation allowed me to thrive in a research environment. I worked in Dr. Aaron Batista\u2019s lab under the guidance of his graduate student Erinn Grigsby where another student and I studied the impact of neuron dropping on decoder performance. By utilizing my skills in Matlab, which I learned at WPI, we created three different Kalman filters and linear regression decoders. Each decoder contained different position, velocity, and velocity-position decoders to test the most robust decoder. The experience enriched my ability to decipher through papers to find the pertinent information needed to complete the project. It strengthened my ability to pose a question and find an objective method to answer it. Most importantly, I gained an in-depth knowledge of how brain-computer interface decoders operate and first-hand experience developing and designing them. \nI applied this experience to my MQP project that Prof. Dirk Albrecht headed. My group designed a programmable electrical stimulator to study Deep Brain Stimulation in C. elegans worms. Despite the difficulties of remote learning, we had a successful MQP with results that asked more questions than answered, which I would like to pursue during my graduate studies at WPI. I was constantly tasked to evolve as an engineer/researcher to understand problems and find solutions quickly throughout the process. I learned several new skills, such as COMSOL analysis and microfluidic device fabrication, and refined my laboratory experience.\nMy academic goal at WPI is to receive my master\u2019s in Neuroscience and my Ph.D. in biomedical engineering with a concentration in neuroscience. After obtaining my Ph.D. from WPI, I plan to start a research company dedicated to designing and building minimally invasive, high-resolution, and bidirectional neural interfaces. Many scientific advancements will be required before such devices could feasibly be made, which I hope to be a part of. With the knowledge gained from my research experiences, I hope to mentor the next generation and help them answer their questions about the world, just like those at WPI who helped me along the way."
