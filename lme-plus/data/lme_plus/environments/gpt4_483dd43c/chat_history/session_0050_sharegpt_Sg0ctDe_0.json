After the AD 106 Roman conquest of the area, the place was known as Municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napoca.\n\n\u201cSeveral fragments of a Roman road were found, covered with slabs and built of river stones, sometimes glued with mortar, at a depth of about 80 cm. The orientation of the road is north-south, and it is probably related to the street network of the Roman settlement of Napoca,\u201d archaeologist Cristian Dima from the National History Museum of Transylvania told Agerpres.\nAccording to Cristian Dima, the roads made by the Romans were used for a long time after the fall of the Roman Empire, and some are still used today, at least as their route. In fact, many of today\u2019s roads preserve at least the course of the roads from 2,000 years ago.\n\n\u201cRoman roads, like in everything that was the Roman Empire, were reused after the fall of the empire. There are many examples in Italy, Via Apia, etc. They are reused. In our country, the Middle Ages begin somewhere in the 14th century, in Cluj, with the foundation of the citadel. Of course, the Austrians reused them in their period, after that the street layout and today\u2019s layout is still preserved, more or less, as it was in the Roman period. Several roads are identified, both in the Roman civil settlements and in the military settlements, in particular. In Alba, many roads are discovered, right in the area of \u200b\u200bthe XIII Gemina castle, in Turda, a few more roads are discovered. The imperial road that we, those from the Cluj Museum, discovered during the excavations in 2021, on the highway route, the road discovered in the area of \u200b\u200bthe Roman fort at Sutor, etc.\u201c, the archaeologist from Cluj also said.\n\u201cPart of the Roman road networks/routes are still preserved today,\u201d Cristian Dima said, adding that this is especially true in rural areas. \u201cIn larger cities, where there are more interventions, these are not kept exactly. Between localities, mostly the same routes are used. In Transylvania, where the Habsburg and Austro-Hungarian Empires were, they did a lot of construction works, many of them were modified.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that the strength and durability of roads and other structures built by the Romans derive from their later reuse and maintenance, as well as the Roman technology that was developed for the time.\n\u201cThey had quite advanced technology for the time. [\u2026] A fairly solid structure was made, with large stones at the base, then with small stones and then large slabs at the top, more or less processed. Feleac tiles, some of them rounded, were used in Cluj. On a smaller scale, it closely resembles what is preserved today in Pompeii,\u201d Cristian Dima explained.\n\nThe Roman roads were notable for their straightness, solid foundations, cambered surfaces that aided drainage, and the use of concrete made of pozzolana (volcanic ash) and lime. Roman roads were very quick and safe to travel large distances.\n\nWhen ancient Romans built something, it was meant to last. Countless examples clearly show why historians and archaeologists often refer to ancient Romans as famous builders who left behind many bridges, aqueducts, canals, stone-paved roads, and other engineering masterpieces all throughout the Roman Empire. \"\n\n\"The vast Roman Empire boasted a large and extensive network of roads. It is estimated that the roads in the network were more than 400,000 km long and over 80,500 km out of those were stone-paved. The road network was important in maintaining the stability of the empire and its expansion.\" \nDiscovering ancient Roman roads is important to scientists as they give a better understanding of Europe's history. A while back, archeologists unearthed a well-preserved ancient road that offers evidence Romans moved much deeper into Wales than historians previously thought.\n\n\"For some reason, the road had been completely missed, but knowing about its existence will shed new light on Roman\u2019s presence in Britain.\" 2 \n\nArchaeologists in the UK have also stumbled upon a hidden 2,000-year-old Roman road that could be of \u2018global importance.\u2019 By mapping newly unearthed ancient Roman roads with the ones discovered earlier, scientists can eventually improve their understanding of movement across the European continent at the peak of the Roman Empire and even after it fell.\n\nArchaeologists in Romania now report they, too, have unearthed an ancient Roman road that is still in excellent condition. The 2,000-year-old road was discovered in Cluj-Napoca, a city in northwestern Romania, the Transylvania region's unofficial capital.\n\"Several fragments of a Roman road were found, covered with slabs and built of river stones, sometimes glued with mortar, at a depth of about 80 cm. The orientation of the road is north-south and is probably connected to the city's street network Roman Napoca\", archaeologist, Cristian Dima from the National History Museum of Transylvania, told Agerpres, the National News Agency of Romania.\n\nAccording to Dima, many ancient Roman roads were used long after the fall of the Roman Empire and some are still used today.\n\n\"Roman roads were reused after the empire's fall, just like everything else left by ancient Romans. There are many examples in Italy, Via Apia, etc., where we find reused Roman roads. In our country, the Middle Ages began somewhere in the 14th century, in Cluj, with the citadel's foundation. Of course, the Austrians reused them during this period. After that, the street layout and the one of today are still preserved, more or less, as it was in the Roman period.\n\nSeveral roads have been identified in the settlements of Roman civilians and the military settlements, in particular. Many roads have been discovered in Alba, right in the area of the Gemina castle, and a few more roads have been unearthed in Turda,\" Dima told Agerpres.\n\nDima explained that part of the Roman road networks/routes is still preserved today, especially in rural areas. In the bigger cities, where there are more interventions, they are not exactly preserved, but one can still find evidence of the ancient Roman presence in the region.\n\nHe emphasizes that the strength and durability of roads and other constructions made by the Romans are not only because they were reused and maintained later but also to the Roman technology, which was advanced for that time.\n\n\"They had pretty advanced technology for the time. They did the job pretty well. It was a rather solid structure, with big stones at the base, small stones, and big slabs on top. In Cluj, Feleac tiles were used, some of them rounded. On a smaller scale, they are quite similar to what is preserved today in Pompeii. The resistance of Roman constructions is also due to the mortar they invented then, but also their subsequent reuse, through which those who reused them took care to preserve them\", the archaeologist from Cluj explains.\n\nOne of the reasons ancient Romans still last is because very resistant concrete was used for the construction. Scientists have long tried to solve is why Roman concrete often lasted thousands of years, but ours decays in mere decades. However, researchers recently discovered that an unexpected ancient manufacturing strategy might hold the key to designing concrete that lasts millennia."
