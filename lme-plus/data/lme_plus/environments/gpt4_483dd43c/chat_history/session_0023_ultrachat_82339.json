      "content": "Yes, you can substitute whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour in this recipe for a healthier option. However, keep in mind that using whole wheat flour may result in a denser and darker muffin texture than using all-purpose flour. You may need to adjust the baking time slightly and possibly experiment with other ingredients such as honey or maple syrup to add more sweetness to the muffins since whole wheat flour has a deeper flavor."
