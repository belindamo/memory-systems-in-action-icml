  "content": "Eliza Gardner was the daughter of Marie Therese Raison de la Geneste and Joseph Gardner. She was born around 1820, likely in Virginia or West Virginia. Eliza was of mixed-race descent, with African and European ancestry. Her mother Marie Therese was also of mixed-race, and her father Joseph Gardner was a white man.\n\nNot much is known about Eliza's life, but it is known that she married William Mueller, a German immigrant, in 1843. They had at least one child together, a son named Joseph Mueller (later known as Joseph Miller), who would become a lawyer and work for the IRS during the presidency of Grover Cleveland. Eliza and William later divorced, and Eliza remarried to a man named Samuel Gardner.\n\nEliza's life and the lives of her family members reflect the complexities of race and identity in the United States during the 19th century, particularly for those of mixed-race heritage.",
