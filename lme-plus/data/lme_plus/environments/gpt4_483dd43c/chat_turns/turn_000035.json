Here are some interesting facts about the castle:\n\n- The castle was built on top of the remains of a Roman temple to the god Claudius, destroyed during the infamous Boudica rebellion in AD 60. - The castle was constructed in the 11th century and was one of the largest and most important strongholds in England at the time. - During the English Civil War, the castle was used as a prison for captured Royalist soldiers. - The castle's museum holds one of the most important collections of Roman archaeology in the country, including a Roman chariot and some of the finest Roman mosaics in Britain. - The castle is also believed to be haunted by several ghosts, including a Roman soldier and a woman in white who is said to have jumped from the castle tower in the 17th century.
