  "content": "I'm interested in exploring more books that delve into the complexities of human relationships, particularly those that involve themes of mental health, grief, and trauma. Since I recently attended a book reading event at the local library where author Rachel Chu discussed her new novel, \"The Last Leaf\", I'm drawn to books that feature complex characters and relationships. Can you recommend some novels that explore these themes in a way that feels authentic and relatable?",
