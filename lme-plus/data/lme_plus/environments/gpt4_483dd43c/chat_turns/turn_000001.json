  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal experience, but from what has been observed in others as well as textbooks, when conflict arises between peers in a project, the following can lead to a decreased quality of work:\n\n1. Lack of Communication: When peers are at odds with each other, they may avoid communication or become defensive when there is a need for discussion. Consequently, important updates and project details might not be shared among team members or may be withheld from the discussion.\n\n2. Stress: The conflict-induced stress that comes with peer disagreements could result in a tense feeling among team members, which could lead to decreased concentration and work efficiency.\n\n3. Lack of Cooperation: Personal issues between colleagues could lead to a hostile work environment, and team members may feel more focused on their individual goals instead of contributing to a successful project completion.\n\n4. Dissension: Peer conflict within a project team could create an atmosphere of opposition in which a rival mentality is prevalent. This could cause team members to intentionally sabotage the work of others or refuse to collaborate on shared tasks.\n\n5. Losing Sight of Project Objectives: When team members engage in conflict, they become more concerned with trying to dominate one another than they are with the original project objectives. This can lead to spending too much time attempting to outdo one other rather than achieving shared goals.",
