The pills symbolize the importance of making choices and accepting the consequences.\n\n2. \"The Great Gatsby\" - The green light at the end of Daisy's dock symbolizes Gatsby's hopes and dreams for the future, as well as his longing for his lost love. The light represents the American Dream and the idea that anything is possible if you work hard enough.\n\n3. \"The Silence of the Lambs\" - The moths that are used as a symbol for transformation and metamorphosis.
