The coin's design is simple yet striking, making it a beloved collector's item.\n\n**Rarity and Significance:**\n\nThe 1967 Canadian penny is considered a rare and sought-after coin for several reasons:\n\n1. **Mintage**: Only 248,395,000 pennies were minted in 1967, which is a relatively low mintage compared to other Canadian coins.\n2. **Error Coins**: Some 1967 pennies were struck with errors, such as misaligned dies, off-center strikes, or double strikes, which make them highly valuable to collectors.\n3. **Condition**: Many 1967 pennies were circulated extensively, which means they may have been worn down or damaged, reducing their condition and value.

Here are some approximate values:\n\n* Circulated coins in good condition: $0.10 to $1.00\n* Uncirculated coins (MS-60 to MS-65): $5.00 to $50.00\n* Error coins or high-grade coins (MS-66 or higher): $100.00 to $1,000.00 or more\n\n**Authenticity and Grading:**\n\nTo ensure your coin is genuine and accurately graded, consider having it authenticated and graded by a reputable third-party service, such as the Canadian Numismatic Corporation or the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS).\n\nI hope this information helps you appreciate your 1967 Canadian penny even more!",
