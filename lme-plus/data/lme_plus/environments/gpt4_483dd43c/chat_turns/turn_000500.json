You can use a specific genre classification system, such as:\n\n* Rock: sub-genres like classic rock, punk, indie, alternative, etc.\n* Jazz: sub-genres like traditional, bebop, swing, Latin, etc.\n* Classical: sub-genres like orchestral, chamber, choral, opera, etc.\n\nYou can also add additional columns or sub-columns to further categorize your records, such as:\n\n* **Sub-Genre**: to specify a more precise genre classification (e.g., progressive rock, acid jazz, baroque classical)\n* **Format**: to track the type of vinyl (e.g., 12\", 10\", 7\", LP, EP, single)\n* **Speed**: to note the playback speed (e.g., 33 1/3, 45, 78 RPM)\n* **Reissue**: to indicate if the record is a reissue or a original pressing\n\nRemember, you can always add or remove columns as needed to fit your specific collection and organizational preferences!",
