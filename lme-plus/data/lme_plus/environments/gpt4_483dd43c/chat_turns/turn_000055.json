It's also a good idea to pack a travel adapter for France (or any foreign country) that fits your phone's charging port.\n\nIn addition to a portable charger, consider packing:\n\n1. **A phone case with a built-in card slot**: This can help you carry your travel documents, like your hotel reservation or metro tickets, while keeping your phone protected.\n2. **A small power bank for your watch or other devices**: If you have a smartwatch or other devices that need charging, a small power bank can be a lifesaver.\n3. **A universal travel adapter**: A universal travel adapter can help you charge your devices in foreign outlets, eliminating the need for multiple adapters.\n4. **A waterproof phone pouch or bag**: A waterproof phone pouch or bag can protect your phone from water damage when exploring rainy or wet environments.\n5. **A phone camera lens or portable camera**: If you want to capture high-quality photos, consider packing a phone camera lens or a portable camera.\n\nBy packing these essentials, you'll be well-prepared to stay connected, navigate unfamiliar streets, and capture amazing memories during your trip.\n\nNow, let's talk about packing clothing and accessories!",
