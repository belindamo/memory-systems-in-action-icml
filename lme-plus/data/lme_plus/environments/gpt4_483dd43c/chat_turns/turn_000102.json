  "content": "The Thule Hitch Mount Bike Rack is a fantastic choice!\n\nTo determine if the Thule Hitch Mount Bike Rack will fit your Honda Civic, we need to check a few things:\n\n1. **Hitch type**: The Thule Hitch Mount Bike Rack is designed for Class I, II, III, or IV hitches. You'll need to check if your Honda Civic has a hitch installed, and if so, what type of hitch it is.\n2. **Hitch receiver size**: The Thule Hitch Mount Bike Rack fits a 1.25\" or 2\" hitch receiver. You'll need to check the size of your hitch receiver to ensure it's compatible.\n3. **Vehicle compatibility**: Thule provides a fit guide on their website. According to their guide, the Thule Hitch Mount Bike Rack is compatible with the following Honda Civic models:\n\t* 2016-2022 Honda Civic Sedan (with a Class I hitch)\n\t* 2017-2022 Honda Civic Hatchback (with a Class I hitch)\n\nIf your Honda Civic has a hitch installed and meets the above requirements, the Thule Hitch Mount Bike Rack should fit. However, to be absolutely sure, I recommend:\n\n1. **Check your vehicle's owner's manual**: Verify the type of hitch and receiver size on your Honda Civic.\n2. **Visit Thule's website**: Use their fit guide tool to enter your vehicle's make, model, and year to confirm compatibility.\n3. **Contact a local dealer or Thule customer support**: Reach out to a local bike shop or Thule's customer support to double-check compatibility and get more information on the installation process.\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation and ensure that your bike rack is properly secured to your vehicle before hitting the road.\n\nI hope this helps!",
