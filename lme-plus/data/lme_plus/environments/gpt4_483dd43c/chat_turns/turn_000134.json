  "content": "To start with the assignment, we need to import the required libraries and load the data into a pandas DataFrame. We will use matplotlib for plotting the data, numpy for mathematical operations, and pandas for data manipulation.\n\nHere's how we can do that:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('9641-20220308-F1.csv', names=['x', 'y', 'value'], header=None)\n\n# Plot the magnetic field data\nplt.scatter(df['x'], df['y'], c=df['value'], cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.show()\n```\nThis code will load the data from the csv file and plot a scatter plot of the magnetic field values, with the color representing the value. The `cmap` argument sets the color map to be used for the color values.\n\nThe resulting plot will show the variation of the magnetic field values across the field. We can use this plot to identify any anomalous areas where the magnetic field values are significantly different from the surrounding areas, which could be indicative of buried ordnance.\n\nNote: The above code assumes that the csv file is located in the current working directory. If the file is located elsewhere, the file path needs to be specified in the `read_csv` function.",
