  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal information, including your loyalty points with Wingspan Travel. I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, and I don't retain any information from previous conversations.\n\nTo find out how many points you have and when they expire, I recommend checking your account directly with Wingspan Travel. You can:\n\n1. Log in to your Wingspan Travel account online or through their mobile app.\n2. Check your email inbox for any notifications or statements from Wingspan Travel.\n3. Contact Wingspan Travel's customer service directly via phone or email to inquire about your points balance and expiration date.\n\nOnce you have the information, you can start planning your trip to Hawaii! If you need help with that, I'd be happy to assist you with recommendations on where to go, what to do, and how to make the most of your trip.",
