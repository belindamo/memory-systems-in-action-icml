  "content": "I'll try searching online for tailors in my area and ask around for recommendations. I've been meaning to get it done for weeks, so I should finally take care of it this weekend. Speaking of weekends, I need to return my brother's coat that I borrowed last winter. Do you have any tips on how to clean it before returning it to him? It's a wool coat, and I'm not sure how to get rid of a small stain on the sleeve.",
