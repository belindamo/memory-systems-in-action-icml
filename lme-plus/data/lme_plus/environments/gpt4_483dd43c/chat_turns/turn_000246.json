Here are some suggestions to help you categorize and store your coins:\n\n**Categorization:**\n\n1. **By Country**: Organize your coins by country of origin. This is a good starting point, as it allows you to see the diversity of your collection.\n2. **By Denomination**: Group coins by their face value, such as 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, etc.\n3. **By Date**: Organize coins chronologically, either by year or by era (e.g., ancient, medieval, modern).\n4. **By Series**: Collect coins from specific series, such as Olympic coins, commemorative coins, or error coins.\n5. **By Metal**: Categorize coins by their metal composition, like copper, silver, gold, or bi-metallic.\n\n**Storage:**\n\n1. **Coin Albums**: Use albums specifically designed for coins, like the one you mentioned. These albums have pockets or pages that protect and display your coins.\n2. **Coin Folders**: Similar to albums, but more compact and often less expensive.\n3. **Coin Cases**: Individual cases or capsules to store and protect individual coins.\n4. **Coin Boxes**: Small boxes or containers to store coins, often used for bulk storage.\n5. **Coin Binders**: Three-ring binders with pages designed to hold coins, ideal for larger collections.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Handle coins carefully**: Always handle coins with clean, dry hands or gloves to prevent damage or contamination.\n2. **Store coins in a cool, dry place**: Avoid exposing coins to direct sunlight, moisture, or extreme temperatures.\n3. **Keep coins away from chemicals**: Don't store coins near chemicals, cleaning products, or other substances that could damage them.\n4. **Catalog your collection**: Keep a record of your coins, including their country, denomination, date, and any other relevant information.\n5. **Consider grading and authentication**: If you have rare or valuable coins, consider getting them graded and authenticated by a reputable third-party service.\n\nFor your 1967 Canadian penny, you can start by storing it in a protective case or album page specifically designed for Canadian coins. You can then categorize it by country (Canada), denomination (1 cent), and date (1967).\n\nRemember to enjoy your collection and have fun organizing your coins!",
