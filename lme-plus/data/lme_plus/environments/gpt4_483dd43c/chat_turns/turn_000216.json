  "content": "I think there might be some confusion here! As a conversational AI, I don't have any information about your personal life, including your husband Mark or any emails you may have received from Expedia.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general advice: if you're considering booking a cruise with someone, it's always a good idea to check their availability before making a commitment. You might want to have a conversation with your husband Mark to see if he's interested in going on a cruise and if he's available in February.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to discuss other details such as your budget, preferences, and any other important factors that might affect your decision. It's always better to have an open and honest conversation with your travel partner to ensure you're both on the same page.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need help with planning your trip, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you!",
