If it says dry clean only, it's best to take it to a professional cleaner.\n2. **Inspect the stain**: Take a closer look at the stain on the sleeve. If it's a small, recent stain, you might be able to remove it at home.

This will help remove any lingering odors or moisture.\n\n**Tips for wool coats:**\n\n1. **Avoid machine washing**: Wool coats should not be machine washed, as the agitation and spin cycle can damage the fibers.\n2. **Avoid heat**: Never use hot water, hot irons, or dry cleaning solvents on wool coats, as they can shrink or felt the fabric.\n3. **Use a wool-specific cleaner**: If you need to use a cleaning product, make sure it's specifically designed for wool.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to remove the stain and clean the coat before returning it to your brother.
