  "content": "Archaeologists from the National Museum of the History of Transylvania in Romania have made a significant discovery of a well-preserved 2,000-year-old Roman road in Cluj-Napoca, in the country's northwest region. Cristian Dima, an archaeologist from the National History Museum of Transylvania, explained that the road was made up of several fragments covered with slabs and built of river stones, sometimes glued with mortar at a depth of approximately 80cm. The road is oriented north-south and is likely to be related to the street network of the Roman settlement of Napoca. The Romans built roads that were known for their straightness, solid foundations, cambered surfaces, and use of concrete made of pozzolana and lime. Many of these roads were used long after the fall of the Roman Empire and some are still used today. The Roman Empire had an extensive network of roads, with more than 400,000 km long and over 80,500 km out of those were stone-paved.\n\nThe discovery of ancient Roman roads is essential to scientists as it gives a better understanding of Europe's history. Earlier, archeologists found a well-preserved ancient road that provides evidence that the Romans traveled deeper into Wales than previously thought. Similarly, archaeologists in the UK discovered a hidden 2,000-year-old Roman road that could be of 'global importance.' By mapping newly unearthed ancient Roman roads with the ones discovered earlier, scientists can enhance their understanding of movement across the European continent during the peak of the Roman Empire and after its fall.\n\nCristian Dima explained that the roads made by the Romans were used for a long time after the fall of the Roman Empire, and some are still used today, at least as their route. In fact, many of today's roads preserve at least the course of the roads from 2,000 years ago. He emphasized that the strength and durability of roads and other structures built by the Romans derive from their later reuse and maintenance, as well as the Roman technology that was developed for the time. \"They had quite advanced technology for the time. [...] A fairly solid structure was made, with large stones at the base, then with small stones and then large slabs at the top, more or less processed. Feleac tiles, some of them rounded, were used in Cluj. On a smaller scale, it closely resembles what is preserved today in Pompeii,\" Cristian Dima explained.\n\nWhile the Middle Ages began in the 14th century in Cluj with the foundation of the citadel, the Austrians reused many Roman roads in their period. Today, the street layout is still preserved, more or less, as it was in the Roman period. Several roads are identified in both the Roman civil and military settlements, particularly in Alba, where many roads are discovered in the area of the XIII Gemina castle, and in Turda, where several more roads are discovered. Archaeologists also discovered the imperial road in Cluj during excavations in 2021, on the highway route, and the road found in the area of the Roman fort at Sutor.\n\nRoman roads are considered an engineering masterpiece of the Roman Empire, which boasted many bridges, aqueducts, canals, and other structures built to last. The vast Roman Empire had an extensive network of roads, which was crucial in maintaining the empire's stability and expansion. Roman roads were very quick and safe to travel long distances.",
