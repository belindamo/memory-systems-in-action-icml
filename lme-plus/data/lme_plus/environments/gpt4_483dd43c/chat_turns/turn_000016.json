We don't have any specific traditions, but we do like to have some snacks and drinks to make it feel more like a social gathering.\n\nOur discussions are usually pretty free-flowing, and we just kind of go around the circle and share our thoughts and opinions about the book. We try to keep it pretty relaxed and avoid getting too bogged down in spoilers, since not everyone might have finished the book. But we do like to dive deep into the themes and characters, and we often find ourselves getting into some pretty interesting debates.\n\nI think what I love most about our book club is that it's not just about the books themselves, but about the community and camaraderie that's developed around it. We've all become pretty close friends, and it's nice to have a regular excuse to get together and catch up.\n\nSpeaking",
