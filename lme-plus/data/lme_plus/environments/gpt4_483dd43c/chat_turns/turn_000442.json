However, in general, any form of physical activity or sports can be beneficial for mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Aerobic exercise, in particular, has been found to be particularly effective in improving mood and reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Some sports that incorporate aerobic exercise and can also offer additional mental health benefits are:\n\n1. Running or jogging\n2. Swimming\n3. Cycling\n4. Boxing or martial arts\n5. Yoga or Pilates\n\nIt's important to find a physical activity that you enjoy because it's easier to stick to it long-term.
