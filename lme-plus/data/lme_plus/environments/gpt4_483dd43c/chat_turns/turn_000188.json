I'm happy to recommend some fantasy shows that you might enjoy:\n\n1. **Westworld**: Set in a futuristic theme park, this HBO series explores the intersection of humanity and technology, with a touch of fantasy and sci-fi elements.\n2. **Outlander**: While you mentioned you've seen some shows on my previous list, I had to include Outlander again, as it has a strong fantasy element, especially in its later seasons.\n3. **Vikings**: A historical fantasy series that follows the adventures of Ragnar Lothbrok, a legendary Viking warrior, and his raids on England and France.\n4. **The Witcher**: A Netflix original series based on the popular video game and book franchise, it follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter with supernatural abilities.\n5. **Shadow and Bone**: Another Netflix series, based on the Grishaverse novels by Leigh Bardugo, it's set in a fantasy world inspired by Russian folklore and follows a young orphan who discovers her powers.\n6. **The Shannara Chronicles**: A MTV series based on the book series by Terry Brooks, it's set in a post-apocalyptic world where magic and technology coexist.\n7. **American Gods**: A Starz series based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, it follows an ex-con who becomes embroiled in a battle between ancient gods and new gods in modern-day America.\n8. **Penny Dreadful**: A horror-fantasy series set in Victorian London, featuring iconic characters from Gothic literature, including Dr. Frankenstein and his monster.\n9. **The Magicians**: A Syfy series based on the book series by Lev Grossman, it follows a group of young adults as they discover their magical abilities and battle evil forces.\n10. **Carnival Row**: An Amazon Prime Video series set in a fantasy world where mythical creatures coexist with humans, it follows a detective who must solve a series of murders in a mystical city.\n\nThese shows offer a mix of epic storytelling, complex characters, and fantastical world-building that might appeal to fans of \"Game of Thrones.\" Enjoy your fantasy binge-watching adventures!\n\nRemember, some of these shows might have a slower burn than \"Game of Thrones,\" but they're all worth investing time in.
