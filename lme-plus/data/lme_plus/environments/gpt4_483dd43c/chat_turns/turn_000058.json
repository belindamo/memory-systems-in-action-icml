Your tips are very helpful, especially making digital copies and leaving a copy with a friend or family member.\n\nOne thing I'd like to add is to also pack a small notebook and a pen. You never know when you might need to jot down important notes, phone numbers, or addresses. Plus, it's always handy to have a physical notebook for writing down memories or ideas that come to you during your trip.\n\nWhat do you think about packing a small first-aid kit? I remember mentioning earlier that I need to remember to pack a small first-aid kit with pain relievers, band-aids, and antacids. Do you have any thoughts on that?",
