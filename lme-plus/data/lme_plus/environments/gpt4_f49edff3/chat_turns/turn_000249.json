  "content": "The tomato and mozzarella salad is a classic for a reason - it's simple, flavorful, and perfect for warm weather.\n\nI'm happy to help with tips on keeping the salad fresh and preventing it from getting soggy:\n\n1. **Use fresh ingredients**: The key to a great tomato and mozzarella salad is using fresh, high-quality ingredients. Choose ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and fragrant basil leaves.\n2. **Assemble just before serving**: To prevent the salad from getting soggy, assemble it just before serving. This will help prevent the tomatoes from releasing their juices and making the salad soggy.\n3. **Pat dry the tomatoes**: Gently pat the tomatoes dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. This will help prevent the salad from becoming too watery.\n4. **Use a shallow container**: Use a shallow container to assemble the salad, so the ingredients aren't stacked on top of each other. This will help prevent the salad from becoming soggy.\n5. **Don't overdress**: Use a light hand when dressing the salad. A simple drizzle of olive oil and balsamic glaze is enough. Avoid over-dressing, as this can make the salad soggy.\n6. **Keep it chilled**: Keep the salad refrigerated until serving. This will help keep the ingredients fresh and prevent the salad from getting soggy.\n7. **Use a breathable cover**: If you need to transport the salad, cover it with a breathable material like parchment paper or a paper towel. Avoid using plastic wrap or airtight containers, as they can trap moisture and make the salad soggy.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your tomato and mozzarella salad fresh and prevent it from getting soggy.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your mac and cheese was a hit at the family picnic! It's always great to share delicious food with loved ones.\n\nDo you have any other questions or concerns about the salad or your BBQ preparations?",
