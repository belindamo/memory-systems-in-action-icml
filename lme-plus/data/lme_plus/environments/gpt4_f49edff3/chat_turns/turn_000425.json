You could express your congratulations, wish them well, and mention how excited you are to meet the baby. A simple message like \"Wishing you all the best as you embark on this new chapter\" or \"Congratulations on the new addition to your family!\" can go a long way.\n2. **Keep it professional (but still warm)**: If you want to maintain a professional tone, you could opt for a more formal message like \"Congratulations on the arrival of your baby! Wishing you all the best.\" or \"Best wishes to you and your growing family.\"\n3. **Add a decorative touch**: Consider adding some decorative elements to the gift basket, like a ribbon or a small bouquet of flowers. This can make the presentation feel more special and celebratory.\n4. **Include a gift tag**: If you prefer a more subtle approach, you could attach a gift tag to the basket with a simple message like \"Congratulations!\" or \"Welcome to the world, baby!\"\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to come from a place of kindness and thoughtfulness. Your coworker will appreciate the effort you put into selecting the gift and presenting it in a caring way.\n\nWhen you give the gift, you could say something like, \"I wanted to bring by a small gift to celebrate the new addition to your family. I hope you find these items useful and enjoy this special time with your baby.\"",
