However, I can tell you that the organ is still being used in contemporary music, and there are several recent examples of notable songs that feature the organ. \n\nFor instance, \"Hold Out Your Hand\" by Brandi Carlile, released in 2021, prominently features a church organ throughout the track. Additionally, \"Willow\" by Taylor Swift, also released in 2021, has a creepy organ interlude towards the end of the song. \n\nOther recent songs that incorporate the organ include \"Little Bit of Love\" by Tom Grennan and \"US\" by James Bay. \n\nSo, while the use of the organ in popular music may not be as widespread as it once was, it continues to be a powerful and impactful instrument in modern music.",
