  "content": "Dear Ece,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up with you regarding the proposal document for Concreate creating tutorials for Lokum Tech. Tofi informed me that you were supposed to send the proposal to us, but we have not received it yet. Could you please let us know the status of the proposal?\n\nAlso, I wanted to discuss the revenue streams from this model. We are interested in exploring different options for monetizing the tutorials, and we believe that this could be a mutually beneficial partnership. It would be great to schedule a call to discuss this in more detail.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
