Check the shelves, drawers, and countertops to see if you spot any onions or other ingredients you need.\n2. **Check your fridge and pantry labels**: If you have labeled your fridge and pantry containers or shelves, you can quickly check the labels to see if you have onions or other ingredients.\n3. **Use a pantry app**: If you have a pantry management app like StillTasty, FreshBox, or Out of Milk, you can quickly check your inventory and add/remove items as needed.\n4. **Make a mental or written list**: Take a minute to think about the ingredients you commonly use and what you might have purchased recently. Write down the items you think you have, and then check your fridge and pantry to confirm.\n5. **Ask a family member or roommate**: If you live with others, ask them if they've seen any onions or other ingredients in the fridge or pantry recently.\n\nIf you still can't find onions, you can consider substituting with other aromatics like shallots, scallions, or leeks, or omitting them altogether.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to keep an inventory of your fridge and pantry contents to avoid food waste and make meal planning easier. You can use a physical notebook, a spreadsheet, or a pantry app to keep track of your ingredients.",
