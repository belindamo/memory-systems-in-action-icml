I'm happy to share some tips to help you achieve professional-looking results:\n\n1. **Use a level**: Invest in a good-quality level, either a bubble level or a laser level. This will ensure your artwork is perfectly horizontal or vertical.\n2. **Measure, measure, measure**: Measure the width of the artwork, the distance between the hanging points, and the distance from the top of the frame to the hanging point. This will help you determine the exact spot to place the nail or screw.\n3. **Use a pencil mark**: Lightly mark the wall with a pencil at the spot where you want to place the nail or screw. This will give you a reference point.\n4. **Check the wall type**: If you have a plaster or drywall, use a anchor screw or a hollow-wall anchor to ensure the nail or screw doesn't fall out. For solid walls, a regular nail or screw should work.\n5. **Hang the artwork with a friend**: Having someone to help you hold the artwork in place while you step back to check the level and make adjustments can be super helpful.\n6. **Use a hanging kit**: Many frames come with a hanging kit that includes a small level and a marker. These kits can be very useful, especially if you're not comfortable with DIY projects.\n7. **Check the artwork's weight**: Make sure the nail or screw can hold the weight of the artwork. You don't want it to fall and damage the wall or the frame.\n8. **Step back and adjust**: Once you've hung the artwork, step back and check if it's level and straight. Make adjustments as needed.\n\nTo avoid wonky artwork, especially when rearranging furniture, consider these additional tips:\n\n1. **Use a template**: Create a template of your furniture arrangement and mark the spot where each piece of artwork should go. This will help you maintain the same layout even when you move things around.\n2. **Take photos**: Take photos of your artwork and furniture arrangement before you move anything. This will give you a reference point when you're putting everything back together.\n3. **Label and store hardware**: Keep track of the hardware (nails, screws, etc.) for each piece of artwork and store them in a safe place. This will ensure you have the right hardware when you need it.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to hang your artwork perfectly level and straight. Happy decorating!",
