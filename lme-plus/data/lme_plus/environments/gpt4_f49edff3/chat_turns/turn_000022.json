  "content": "Calculating progress payments under the NSW HIA Lump Sum Contract involves a specific formula based on the value of the work completed and the payment schedule. The payment schedule outlines the percentage of the contract price that the builder is entitled to receive for each stage of work completed. To calculate progress payments, the percentage outlined in the payment schedule is applied to the value of work completed at that stage. The value of work completed is determined through a site inspection by a qualified inspector or quantity surveyor. The calculation of progress payments should be done carefully to ensure that both parties receive their rightful payment, and any disputes regarding payment can be avoided.",
