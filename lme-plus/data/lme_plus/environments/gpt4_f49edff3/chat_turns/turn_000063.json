I'd be happy to recommend some recent RPGs that would work well with the processor you choose.\n\nHere are some fantastic RPGs from the past few years, categorized by their system requirements:\n\n**Less Demanding RPGs (Should run smoothly on mid-range CPUs):**\n\n1. **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt** (2015) - A classic action RPG with a deep storyline and engaging combat.\n2. **Divinity: Original Sin 2** (2017) - A highly interactive RPG with a rich story, complex combat, and co-op multiplayer.\n3. **Pillars of Eternity** (2015) - A CRPG with a deep story, engaging combat, and a beautiful world to explore.\n4. **Tyranny** (2016) - A dark fantasy RPG with a strong focus on storytelling and player choice.\n\n**Moderately Demanding RPGs (Should run smoothly on mid-to-high-end CPUs):**\n\n1. **Cyberpunk 2077** (2020) - A futuristic RPG with a rich storyline, engaging combat, and a vast open world to explore.\n2. **The Outer Worlds** (2019) - A sci-fi RPG with a humorous tone, engaging combat, and a rich storyline.\n3. **Borderlands 3** (2019) - A cooperative first-person shooter RPG with a colorful art style and addictive loot system.\n4. **Wasteland 3** (2020) - A post-apocalyptic RPG with tactical combat, a rich story, and co-op multiplayer.\n\n**Demanding RPGs (May require high-end CPUs for optimal performance):**\n\n1. **Elder Scrolls Online** (2014, but with frequent updates) - A massive MMORPG with a rich storyline, engaging combat, and a vast open world.\n2. **Final Fantasy XV** (2016) - An action RPG with a beautiful open world, engaging combat, and a deep storyline.\n3. **Monster Hunter: World** (2018) - An action RPG with a vast open world, intense combat, and co-op multiplayer.\n4. **Dragon Age: Inquisition** (2014) - A high-fantasy RPG with a rich story, engaging combat, and a vast open world.\n\nKeep in mind that system requirements can vary depending on the specific game settings and resolutions you choose. However, these recommendations should give you a good starting point.\n\nWhen choosing a processor, consider the following:\n\n* If you prefer less demanding RPGs, a mid-range processor like the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i5-11600K should be sufficient.\n* For moderately demanding RPGs, a mid-to-high-end processor like the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Intel Core i7-11700K would be a good choice.\n* If you want to play the most demanding RPGs at high settings, a high-end processor like the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X or Intel Core i9-11900K would be the way to go.\n\nRemember to also consider other system components, such as your graphics card, RAM, and storage, when building your gaming PC.",
