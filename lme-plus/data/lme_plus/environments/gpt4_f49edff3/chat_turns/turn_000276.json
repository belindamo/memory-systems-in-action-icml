  "content": "I like the idea of serving Fresh Fruit Skewers and Bruschetta with Fresh Fruit. They're easy to make and look colorful and refreshing. Since I've been enjoying my morning walks on the first day of spring, I think these light and fruity appetizers will fit perfectly with the season. Can you give me some suggestions on how to arrange the fruit skewers to make them visually appealing?",
