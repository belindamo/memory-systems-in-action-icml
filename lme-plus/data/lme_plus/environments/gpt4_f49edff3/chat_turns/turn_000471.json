Here are some suggestions to help you keep track of expiration dates:\n\n**1. Label and Date Containers:**\n\n* Use a permanent marker to write the date you purchased or opened the item on the container or packaging.\n* Consider using a \"Date Label\" or \"Expiration Label\" sticker to make it easy to identify the date.\n\n**2. Create a \"Use-By\" Calendar:**\n\n* Create a calendar or spreadsheet to track the expiration dates of your perishable items.\n* Update the calendar regularly to ensure you're aware of upcoming expiration dates.\n\n**3. Use a Pantry Inventory App:**\n\n* Apps like StillTasty, FreshBox, or Out of Milk allow you to track your pantry inventory, including expiration dates.\n* Receive reminders and notifications when items are approaching expiration.\n\n**4. Designate a \"Use-Up\" Shelf:**\n\n* Designate a shelf or bin in your pantry or fridge for items nearing expiration.\n* This visual reminder will encourage you to use up these items before they expire.\n\n**5. Store Items by Expiration Date:**\n\n* Store items with the closest expiration date at the front of the shelf or in a prominent location.\n* This ensures you'll use the oldest items first and reduces the likelihood of expired items getting pushed to the back.\n\n**6. Check Expiration Dates Regularly:**\n\n* Set a reminder to check your fridge and pantry regularly (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) for expired or near-expired items.\n* Remove or use up expired items to maintain a fresh and safe food supply.\n\n**7. Keep a \"First-In, First-Out\" Policy:**\n\n* Store new items behind existing ones to ensure older items are consumed before newer ones.\n* This helps prevent older items from getting pushed to the back and expiring.\n\n**8. Take Photos of Expiration Dates:**\n\n* Take a photo of the expiration date on the packaging with your phone or tablet.\n* Store the photo in a designated album or note-taking app for easy reference.\n\nBy implementing one or more of these strategies, you'll be better equipped to keep track of expiration dates and reduce food waste.",
