  "content": "A gift basket with a few essentials is a wonderful idea!\n\nA baby carrier or sling can be a fantastic addition to the basket, but it's indeed a more personal preference item. Some parents swear by baby carriers and use them extensively, while others might not be comfortable with the idea of wearing their baby or might have a different preference for baby-wearing styles.\n\nIf you're considering including a baby carrier in the basket, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Check with the parents**: If you're close to your coworker, you could ask them if they're interested in a baby carrier or if they have a specific brand/style in mind.\n2. **Choose a neutral option**: Opt for a neutral-colored, simple design that can be easily adjusted to fit different body types. This will increase the chances of the parents finding it comfortable and usable.\n3. **Consider a soft-structured carrier**: Soft-structured carriers are often more versatile and easier to use than wraps or slings. They can be a good option for new parents who might not be familiar with baby-wearing.\n4. **Make it a smaller part of the basket**: If you do decide to include a baby carrier, consider making it a smaller part of the overall basket. You could pair it with some other essentials like onesies, burp cloths, and a baby book, so the parents have a variety of items to choose from.\n\nIf you're unsure, you could always opt for a different item that's more universally useful, like a set of baby washcloths, a baby blanket, or a set of baby bottles. These items are often appreciated and can be used by most parents.\n\nRemember, the thought and effort you put into the gift basket are what truly matter. Your coworker will appreciate the gesture, and the new parents will be grateful for the practical items that will make their lives a little easier.",
