Here are a few:\n\n1. **Han no Daidokoro Sushi Ko**: While not entirely Korean, this restaurant serves a unique fusion of Korean-Japanese cuisine, including Korean-style BBQ and hot pot. They have a private room that can seat up to 12 people.\n2. **Korean Kitchen**: A casual, no-frills Korean restaurant with a wide variety of dishes, including bibimbap, bulgogi, and kimchi stew. They have a private room that can accommodate up to 15 people.\n3. **Onnuri**: A modern Korean restaurant with a focus on high-quality ingredients and creative dishes. They have a private room that can seat up to 12 people, and their lunch menu is very reasonably priced.\n4. **K-Pub**: A Korean-style gastropub with a wide variety of small plates, including Korean fried chicken, kimchi pancakes, and bibimbap. They have a private room that can accommodate up to 15 people, and it's a great spot for a casual, lively lunch.\n5. **Gwangjang**: A popular Korean restaurant with a wide variety of dishes, including Korean-style BBQ, hot pot, and naengmyeon (cold noodles).
