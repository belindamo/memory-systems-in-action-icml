  "content": "The most commonly used tests to diagnose heart failure are the echocardiogram, blood tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG). These tests are non-invasive, readily available, and can provide important information about the structure and function of the heart. Chest X-rays and cardiac catheterization are less frequently used, as they are more invasive and may carry more risk. However, they can be useful in certain cases where additional information is needed to diagnose or manage heart failure.",
