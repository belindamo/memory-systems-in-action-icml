  "content": "The final progress claim is the last payment request made by the builder under the NSW HIA Lump Sum Contract. It usually includes the remaining amount owing to the builder for the completed work. Homeowners need to ensure that they pay the final progress claim promptly to avoid any legal disputes. If the builder does not receive the final payment, they may seek legal action and charge interest on the outstanding amount. Additionally, the final progress claim should only be paid once the homeowner is satisfied with the completed work, as it is challenging to claim for defects or unfinished work once payment has been made. Homeowners should always ensure that the final payment is made only after receiving a final inspection report and a certificate of occupancy.",
