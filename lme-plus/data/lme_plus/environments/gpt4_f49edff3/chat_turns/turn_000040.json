  "content": "HURD is designed to be compatible with GNU/Linux and POSIX standards, so many programs written for those systems should be able to run on HURD without modification. However, there may be some compatibility issues, particularly with software that relies on specific kernel features or system calls that are not directly available in HURD. \n\nTo address this compatibility issue, HURD implements a compatibility layer, which includes translations of system calls specific to other operating systems, such as Linux. The compatibility layer allows programs compiled for GNU/Linux to run on HURD without major modifications. Additionally, some software may require tweaking or recompilation to work correctly on HURD, particularly if they rely on specific hardware features or low-level kernel functionality.\n\nSo while HURD may not offer full compatibility with all software designed for other operating systems, it does offer a reasonable level of compatibility that makes it feasible for many applications to be ported to HURD with moderate effort.",
