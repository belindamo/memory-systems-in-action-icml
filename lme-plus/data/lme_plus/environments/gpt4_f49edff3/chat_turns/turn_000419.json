What a thoughtful colleague you are!\n\nIt's great that you helped your cousin with her baby shower shopping, and you've already got some essential items covered, like diapers, wipes, and a baby monitor. Here are some other ideas for essential items that new parents usually appreciate:\n\n1. **Clothing**: Onesies, sleepers, and footed rompers are always a hit. Consider a set of neutral-colored, mix-and-match pieces in various sizes to accommodate the baby's growth.\n2. **Burp cloths**: These are a must-have for feeding and burping. Look for soft, absorbent cloths that can be easily washed and reused.\n3. **Swaddle blankets**: Swaddling helps babies feel secure and comfortable. Choose lightweight, breathable blankets with a simple design.\n4. **Bath time essentials**: A soft, gentle baby wash, baby towels, and a baby bathtub or sink insert can make bath time a breeze.\n5. **Feeding accessories**: A baby bottle brush, pacifiers (if needed), and a breast pump (if the mother is breastfeeding) can be very useful.\n6. **Sleeping essentials**: A set of crib sheets, a mobile, or a white noise machine can help create a soothing sleep environment.\n7. **Baby gear**: A baby carrier or sling, a stroller, or a baby gym can be very practical and enjoyable for new parents.\n8. **Personalized items**: A personalized baby blanket, onesie, or picture frame with the baby's name or initials can make a thoughtful gift.\n9. **Self-care items**: A cozy robe, a good coffee mug, or a gift certificate for a postpartum massage can help new parents relax and recharge.\n10. **Practical books or apps**: A baby care book, a parenting guide, or a subscription to a parenting app like Baby Connect or Glow can provide valuable resources and support.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to check with your coworker beforehand to see if they have any specific preferences or needs. You can also consider a gift card to their favorite baby store or online retailer, so they can choose something they really need.\n\nI hope these ideas help!",
