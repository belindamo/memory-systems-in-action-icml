Introducing someone to gaming can be a wonderful experience, and it's awesome that you're considering getting him his own console.\n\nFor a beginner-friendly gaming console, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **PlayStation 4**: Since your brother is already familiar with the PS4 and enjoys Spider-Man and Uncharted 4, getting him his own PS4 console would be a great idea. The PS4 has an excellent library of exclusive games, and it's relatively affordable.\n2. **Nintendo Switch**: The Switch is an excellent console for beginners, with a vast library of games that cater to different tastes. It's also very portable, making it easy to play both at home and on-the-go. Popular games like Mario, Zelda, and Pok\u00e9mon are perfect for new gamers.\n3. **Xbox One S**: If you think your brother might be interested in exploring Xbox exclusive titles like Halo, Gears of War, or Forza, the Xbox One S is a great option. It's a more affordable version of the Xbox One X, with a smaller footprint and a built-in 4K Blu-ray player.\n\nConsider the following factors when choosing a console:\n\n* **Game library**: Think about the types of games your brother enjoys playing. If he likes Spider-Man and Uncharted, he might prefer the PS4. If he's interested in Nintendo franchises or wants a more portable option, the Switch might be the way to go.\n* **Price**: Consoles can range from around $200 to over $500, depending on the model and bundles. Set a budget and look for deals or bundles that fit within it.\n* **Controller**: If your brother is already comfortable with the PS4 controller, he might prefer the DualShock 4. The Xbox One controller is also a great option, and the Nintendo Switch has a unique Joy-Con design.\n\nTo make the gift even more special, consider bundling the console with a few of his favorite games or some new ones you think he'll enjoy. You could also add a few accessories, like an extra controller, a gaming headset, or a gift card to his favorite gaming store.\n\nRemember to set up the console and a few games before giving it to him, so he can dive right in and start playing on his birthday!",
