  "content": "Observational humor is a great way to connect with audiences, and online dating is a rich topic for comedy. Here are some tips to help you craft a joke around the weirdness of online dating:\n\n**Tip 1: Identify the absurdity**\nHighlight the ridiculousness of the situation. In this case, the disconnect between people's online personas and their real lives.\n\n**Tip 2: Exaggerate for comedic effect**\nTake the phenomenon to an absurd extreme. For example, instead of just saying people use old photos, you could say they're using photos from their high school prom.\n\n**Tip 3: Add a personal touch**\nShare a personal experience or a friend's experience to make the joke more relatable and authentic. This can also help you find the humor in the situation.\n\n**Tip 4: Play with language**\nUse clever wordplay, double meanings, or witty one-liners to add humor to your joke.\n\nHere's an example joke based on your idea:\n\n\"I've been online dating, and I've realized that 'outdoorsy' is just code for 'I have a friend with a hiking Instagram filter.' I mean, I've seen people's profiles with pictures of them summiting mountains, and I'm like, 'No, you're not a mountaineer, you're a couch potato with a Fitbit.'\"\n\nOr:\n\n\"I've been swiping through dating apps, and I've come to a realization: the only people who are actually adventurous are the ones who are 45 and have three kids. Everyone else is just using a 10-year-old photo from college spring break.\"\n\n**Other ideas to explore:**\n\n* The ridiculousness of dating app bios (e.g., \"Sarcastic, coffee snob, and dog lover\" \u2013 what does that even mean?)\n* The phenomenon of people only posting group photos to make themselves look more popular\n* The absurdity of online dating conversations that start with \"Hey, how's it going?\" and go nowhere\n* The irony of people complaining about ghosting, but then ghosting others themselves\n\nRemember, the key to writing a great joke is to find the humor in the situation and exaggerate it for comedic effect. Keep writing, and don't be afraid to try out new material on friends, family, or at open mics!\n\nDo you have any other ideas or topics you'd like to explore in your comedy set? I'm here to help!",
