  "content": "The Killers' setlist was amazing, they played all their hits like \"Mr. Brightside\", \"Somebody Told Me\", and \"When You Were Young\". The whole crowd was singing along, it was such a great vibe! As for the atmosphere, I think the music festival had a more energetic and lively vibe, whereas I'm expecting the John Mayer concert to be more intimate and focused on his guitar playing.\n\nBut anyway, I was thinking, since I've been to a few concerts recently, I might want to explore some new music and artists. Do you have any recommendations for music blogs or websites that can help me discover new music?",
