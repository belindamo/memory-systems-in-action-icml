Yes, submarine crews may experience difficulty adjusting to the constant shift changes required by watchstanding schedules. Sleep disruptions can lead to fatigue, irritability, and reduced cognitive and physical performance. To help mitigate these effects, submarine crews undergo extensive training on how to maintain good sleep hygiene, which includes things like avoiding caffeine and alcohol, finding a consistent sleep schedule, and using relaxation techniques.\n\nAdditionally, submariners have access to tools and resources that can help them adjust to the constant shift changes. Some crews use lighting systems that mimic natural circadian rhythms, while others use adjustable workstations that allow crew members to work in a more comfortable position. Submarine commanders may also take steps to reduce the workload during particularly busy periods, allowing crew members to get more rest and recover from sleep deprivation.\n\nOverall, adapting to the constant shift changes required by submarine watchstanding schedules can be challenging, but with proper training and resources, submarine crews are able to maintain the discipline needed to stay alert and focused on their missions.",
