I don't have the ability to physically travel or visit places, so I didn't have a previous trip to Colorado or any other location.\n\nI exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries to the best of my abilities. My purpose is to help users like you with their questions, provide recommendations, and offer suggestions for their trips and activities.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you plan your upcoming trip to Colorado or answer any questions you may have about the state's attractions, activities, or experiences!",
