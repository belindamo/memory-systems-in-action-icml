  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific church schedules or Gospel readings. The Gospel reading for a particular Sunday mass can vary depending on the liturgical calendar and the church's tradition.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you find out the Gospel reading for this Sunday's 9:30 am mass at St. Mary's:\n\n1. Check the church's website: You can visit St. Mary's church website and look for the \"Mass Schedule\" or \"Liturgical Calendar\" section, which might list the Gospel reading for the upcoming Sunday.\n2. Consult a Catholic online resource: Websites like the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) or Catholic.org provide the daily Gospel readings for the Catholic Church. You can check their websites to find the Gospel reading for this Sunday.\n3. Contact the church directly: You can call or email St. Mary's church office and ask about the Gospel reading for this Sunday's 9:30 am mass. They should be able to provide you with the information.\n\nRemember to double-check the reading with the church or a reliable Catholic resource to ensure accuracy.",
