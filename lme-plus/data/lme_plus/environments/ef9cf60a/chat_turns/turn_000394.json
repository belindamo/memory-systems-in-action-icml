Personal recommendations from friends or online communities can be incredibly powerful in discovering new podcasts that resonate with your interests.\n\nWhile algorithms can suggest podcasts based on your listening history or preferences, they often lack the personal touch and context that a human recommendation provides. A friend or community member can say, \"Hey, I know you love science and storytelling, you'll love Radiolab!\" \u2013 which is exactly what happened in your case!\n\nIn fact, a survey by Edison Research found that 55% of podcast listeners discover new podcasts through word of mouth, while 44% discover them through online searches or social media. So, you're not alone in valuing personal recommendations!\n\nThat being said, algorithms can still be helpful in discovering new podcasts, especially when you're looking for something specific or want to explore a new genre. Many popular podcast apps, like Apple Podcasts or Spotify, use algorithms to suggest podcasts based on your listening history and preferences.\n\nDo you have a favorite way to discover new podcasts, such as following podcasters or industry leaders on social media, or participating in online forums like Reddit's r/podcasts?",
