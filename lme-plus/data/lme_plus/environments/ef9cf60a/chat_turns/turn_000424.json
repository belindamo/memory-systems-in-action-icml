  "content": "1. Null Safety: Kotlin is null-safe, meaning it has null safety by default. Java doesn\u2019t have null safety by default.\n2. Syntax: Kotlin has a more concise syntax compared to Java. It also supports features such as type inference and lambda expressions that Java does not.\n3. Interoperability: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java. This means that Kotlin can access Java libraries and frameworks, and vice versa.\n4. Immutable by default: In Kotlin, variables are immutable by default. In Java, variables are mutable unless declared as final.\n5. Concise Code: Kotlin aims to reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed in Java. This is achieved through features such as data classes, string templates, and extension functions.\n6. Coroutines: Kotlin provides coroutines for asynchronous programming, while Java still relies on the traditional multi-threaded programming model.\n7. Nullability: Kotlin provides better control over nullability than Java.\n8. Operator Overloading: Kotlin supports operator overloading, while Java does not.\n9. Inline functions: Kotlin supports inline functions, which can improve performance and reduce memory usage.\n10. Multi-platform Support: Kotlin has built-in support for multi-platform development, which Java lacks.",
