  "content": "When Knut was initially crowned, he was faced with several Viking raids and incursions, some of which were being led by his own brother Harold. However, over the course of his reign, Knut was able to establish a lasting peace with the Vikings, and his Christian beliefs likely played a role in this approach.\n\nKnut recognized that the Vikings were his kinsmen and shared many cultural and social traits with the Anglo-Saxons of England. As a result, rather than simply waging war against them, he sought to negotiate and establish treaties with Viking leaders. For example, he made a treaty with the Norwegian king Olaf II, which allowed the two rulers to share control over the seas around the British Isles.\n\nIn addition, Knut had a strong personal relationship with the church, and his Christian beliefs likely encouraged him to seek out peaceful resolutions rather than resorting to violence. Finally, Knut also recognized that the Vikings represented a valuable resource for his own armies and navy, and he was able to incorporate many Viking warriors and sailors into his own forces, which helped to quell future incursions.",
