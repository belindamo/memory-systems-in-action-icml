Here's a condensed version that still incorporates the key exercises, but takes only 10-15 minutes in the morning and evening:\n\n**Morning Routine (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Mindfulness Meditation (5 minutes)**: Start with a short, guided meditation or a gentle, loving-kindness meditation to set a positive tone for the day.\n2. **Journaling (3 minutes)**: Write down your thoughts, feelings, and gratitudes. Focus on what you're looking forward to that day and what you're grateful for.\n3. **Deep Breathing Exercise (2 minutes)**: Practice slow, deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and body.\n\n**Evening Routine (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Reflection and Gratitude (3 minutes)**: Reflect on your day, acknowledging accomplishments and challenges. Write down three things you're grateful for.\n2. **Loving-Kindness Exercise (5 minutes)**: Choose a self-compassion phrase, such as \"May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be at peace,\" and repeat it to yourself while taking slow, deep breaths.\n3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (2-5 minutes)**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head.\n\n**Tips to Make it Work**\n\n* Start small and be consistent. Even 5-10 minutes a day can make a big difference.\n* Choose a specific time and place for your routine, so it becomes a habit.\n* Use a timer to keep yourself on track and focused.\n* Be gentle with yourself if you miss a day or two. Just get back on track as soon as you can.\n* Mix and match exercises to keep your routine interesting and engaging.\n\nThis condensed routine still incorporates the key exercises, but is more manageable for those with busy schedules. Remember, the goal is to create a daily routine that helps you feel more grounded, calm, and compassionate towards yourself.\n\nHow does this revised routine sound? Would you like me to suggest any further adjustments?",
