  "content": "I was thinking of mentioning that I got her a gift card to her favorite spa last time, which was $100, and she loved it. Do you think that would be relevant to mention in the note?\nYes, that's a great idea! Mentioning the gift card to her favorite spa can help connect the gift to a positive experience she's already had, and show that you're paying attention to her tastes and preferences. It can also help her appreciate the thought and effort you're putting into this new gift. You could say something like:\n\n\"Dear [Sister's Name], I hope you love this new gift set! I remember how much you enjoyed the gift card to your favorite spa last time, and I wanted to build on that experience. I hope these essential oils bring you even more relaxation and calmness. Love, [Your Name]\"\n\nGo for it!",
