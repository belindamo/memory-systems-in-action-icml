  "content": "I think that's a great idea! Mentioning the gift card to her favorite spa can help connect the gift to a positive experience she's already had, and show that you're paying attention to her tastes and preferences. It can also help her appreciate the thought and effort you're putting into this new gift.\n\nYou could say something like:\n\n\"Dear [Sister's Name], I hope you love this new gift set! I remember how much you enjoyed the gift card to your favorite spa last time, and I wanted to build on that experience. I hope these essential oils bring you even more relaxation and calmness. Love, [Your Name]\"\n\nBy referencing the previous gift, you're showing your sister that you're paying attention to her interests and preferences, and that you're trying to create a cohesive and thoughtful gift-giving experience. It's a great way to make the gift feel more personal and meaningful.\n\nJust be sure to phrase it in a way that feels natural and sincere, and that doesn't come across as bragging or trying to one-up the previous gift. The goal is to show your sister that you care and are thinking of her, not to impress her with your gift-giving skills.",
