Choosing the right wash can be a bit tricky, but I'm here to help. Both dark wash and light wash jeans can be versatile, but they'll give you a slightly different look.\n\n**Dark wash jeans**:\n\n* Are easy to dress up or down\n* Can be paired with a variety of tops, from casual graphic tees to dressier blouses\n* Create a sleek, slimming effect\n* Are suitable for both casual and more formal occasions\n* Can be a good choice if you want to create a neutral background for your graphic tees\n\n**Light wash jeans**:\n\n* Add a casual, laid-back vibe to your outfit\n* Can be paired with lighter-colored tops for a relaxed, summery look\n* Create a nice contrast with darker-colored tops, like your band tee\n* Are perfect for casual, everyday wear\n* Can make your legs appear longer and more toned\n\nConsidering you want a versatile pair of jeans that will be easy to pair with different tops, I'd recommend a **medium wash**. A medium wash offers a great balance between dark and light, making it easy to pair with a variety of tops, from light to dark. It's also a great choice if you want a pair of jeans that will be suitable for both casual and slightly dressier occasions.\n\nHowever, if you still can't decide between dark and light wash, you could consider the following:\n\n* If you have a lot of dark-colored tops, a light wash might provide a nice contrast.\n* If you have a lot of light-colored tops, a dark wash might create a nice balance.\n\nUltimately, the choice between dark, light, or medium wash comes down to your personal style, the color palette of your wardrobe, and the look you're going for.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards a dark, light, or medium wash?",
