  "content": "I actually loved \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" and \"The Nightingale\", they were two of the three books I finished recently. The third one was a thriller, \"The Last Time I Lied\" by Riley Sager. I'm open to all kinds of genres, but I've been enjoying audiobooks lately, so something with a good narrator would be great.",
