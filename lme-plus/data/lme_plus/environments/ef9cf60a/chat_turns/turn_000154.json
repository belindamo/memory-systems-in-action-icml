It's wonderful that you were able to help with crowd control and answer questions from attendees, while also getting to enjoy a screening of \"The Lost Daughter\" as a perk.\n\nVolunteering at film festivals is a great way to get behind-the-scenes experience, network with industry professionals, and meet like-minded film enthusiasts. It's also a wonderful way to give back to the film community and contribute to the success of the festival.\n\n\"The Lost Daughter\" is a great film, by the way! Maggie Gyllenhaal's directorial debut received critical acclaim at the festival, and it's wonderful that you got to catch a screening of it. The film's exploration of motherhood, identity, and relationships is thought-provoking and timely.\n\nIt's great that you made the most of your festival experience by volunteering and attending a screening.
