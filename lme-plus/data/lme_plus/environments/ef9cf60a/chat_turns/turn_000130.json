  "content": "Figure \\ref{fig:perf\\_breakdown} provides a comprehensive breakdown of the speedups achieved over the baseline version. Notably, the workloads that are founded on low-level persistent memory (PM) instructions exhibit superior speedups in comparison to transaction-based workloads. This can be attributed to the fact that the former workloads write data back more frequently, thus demonstrating greater improvement upon being leveraged with PMWeaver.",
