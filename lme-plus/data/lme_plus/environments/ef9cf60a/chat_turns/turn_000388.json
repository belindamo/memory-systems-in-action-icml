  "content": "Great choices! \"The TED Radio Hour\" and \"Lore\" are both excellent podcasts.\n\nRegarding listening to podcasts at 1.5x speed, you're not alone! Many podcast listeners use speed adjustment features to consume content more efficiently. In fact, a survey by Libsyn (a popular podcast hosting platform) found that:\n\n* 44% of podcast listeners speed up their podcasts, with 1.5x being the most common speed.\n* 24% of listeners use 1.25x speed, while 15% use 2x speed or faster.\n\nSpeed listening is particularly popular among busy professionals, commuters, and students who want to fit more content into their busy schedules. However, it's worth noting that some podcasters and audio producers might not be fond of speed listening, as it can affect the tone, pacing, and overall listening experience they intended to create.\n\nThat being said, as a listener, it's totally up to you to consume podcasts in a way that works best for your lifestyle and preferences. If 1.5x speed helps you stay engaged and get through episodes faster, go for it!\n\nDo you find that speed listening affects your comprehension or retention of the material, or do you feel like you're still able to absorb the information just as well at a faster pace?",
