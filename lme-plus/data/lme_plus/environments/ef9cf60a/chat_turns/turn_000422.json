I'd be happy to help you compare the transportation options from the airport to the city center in Las Vegas, Orlando, and San Diego.\n\nHere's a summary of the transportation options from each airport to the city center:\n\n**Las Vegas:**\n\n* McCarran International Airport (LAS)\n* Distance to city center: Approximately 5 miles (8 km)\n* Transportation options:\n\t+ Taxi: $15-$20, 10-15 minutes\n\t+ Uber/Lyft: $10-$15, 10-15 minutes\n\t+ Bus: $2, 30-40 minutes (Route 109 or 119)\n\t+ Shuttle: $10-$15, 20-30 minutes (various companies)\n\t+ Car rental and drive: 10-15 minutes\n\n**Orlando:**\n\n* Orlando International Airport (MCO)\n* Distance to city center: Approximately 10 miles (16 km)\n* Transportation options:\n\t+ Taxi: $25-$35, 20-30 minutes\n\t+ Uber/Lyft: $15-$25, 20-30 minutes\n\t+ Bus: $2, 45-60 minutes (Lynx Bus 11 or 51)\n\t+ Shuttle: $20-$30, 30-45 minutes (various companies)\n\t+ Car rental and drive: 20-30 minutes\n\n**San Diego:**\n\n* San Diego International Airport (SAN)\n* Distance to city center: Approximately 3 miles (5 km)\n* Transportation options:\n\t+ Taxi: $15-$20, 10-15 minutes\n\t+ Uber/Lyft: $10-$15, 10-15 minutes\n\t+ Bus: $2.50, 20-30 minutes (Route 992)\n\t+ Trolley: $2.50, 15-20 minutes (Green Line)\n\t+ Car rental and drive: 10-15 minutes\n\nConsidering Chris's situation, all three cities have relatively convenient transportation options from the airport to the city center. However, if I had to pick one that stands out, I'd say San Diego is the most accessible. Here's why:\n\n* San Diego's airport is the closest to the city center, making it a quick and easy trip.\n* The trolley system is a convenient and affordable option, with a direct line from the airport to the city center.\n* Uber and Lyft are also readily available, and the short distance means prices will be relatively low.\n\nThat being said, Las Vegas and Orlando are still great options, and their transportation options are convenient as well. It ultimately depends on your group's preferences and priorities.\n\nI hope this helps you make a more informed decision for your group trip!",
