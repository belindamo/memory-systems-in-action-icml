In the distance, a giant splash catches your eye, and you turn to see an enormous humpback whale breaching just yards away. It's a moment you and your family will never forget - and one you can experience at the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary in Kihei! This incredible sanctuary, located off the coast of Maui, is home to thousands of humpback whales each year, who come to breed, calve, and nurse their young. Created to offer protection to these majestic creatures, the sanctuary encompasses approximately 1,165 square miles of ocean off the coast of Kihei on the island of Maui.",
