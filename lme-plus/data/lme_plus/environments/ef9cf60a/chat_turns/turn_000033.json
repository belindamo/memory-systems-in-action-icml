  "content": "I'm happy to help you with coffee shop recommendations! However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide specific recommendations based on your office location.\n\nBut I can offer some general tips to help you find a great coffee shop near your office:\n\n1. Ask your colleagues or coworkers for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge on the best coffee spots in the area.\n2. Check online review sites like Yelp or Google Maps to see what other customers have to say about the coffee shops in your area.\n3. Look for coffee shops that source their beans from local roasters or have a reputation for serving high-quality coffee.\n4. Consider factors like atmosphere, Wi-Fi availability, and menu options (if you're looking for a snack or meal to go with your coffee).\n\nAs for your new routine, congratulations on finding something that's working for you! It's great to hear that you've been feeling more energized throughout the day. Two weeks is a great milestone, and I'm curious - what's been the most significant change you've made to your routine that you think is contributing to your increased energy levels?",
