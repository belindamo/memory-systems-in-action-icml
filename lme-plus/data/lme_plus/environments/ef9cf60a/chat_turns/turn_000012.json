  "content": "The author's research focuses on nano functional neural interfaces (nFNIs) to create a high-resolution, bidirectional communication system with the nervous system while being minimally invasive. They have research experience in neuroscience from a summer undergraduate research program and a senior thesis project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. They are conducting a formal independent study into neural nanotransducers and hypothesize that nFNIs can be used as a relay system to send and receive external devices' signals. The author aims to make their dissertation at Rice University on this concept and found a research company centered around further research into nFNIs. They hope to use the BCI to treat neurodegenerative diseases and enhance neuroprosthetics.",
