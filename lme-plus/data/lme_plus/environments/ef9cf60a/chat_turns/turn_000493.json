Here are a few more examples:\n\n1. \"Year in Review\" by Facebook: Facebook's \"Year in Review\" is an annual campaign that provides each user with a personalized video highlighting their most significant moments and interactions on the platform throughout the year. The campaign is a great example of data visualization that uses data collected from the platform to create an engaging and heartwarming connection to users.\n\n2. \"The Dosage Index\" by Tide: Tide's \"Dosage Index\" is an interactive data visualization tool that helps users calculate the correct amount of laundry detergent to use based on the size of their load and the level of soil on their clothes. By providing a useful tool that simplifies and clarifies the process of doing laundry, Tide was able to showcase its expertise and authority within this field while also demonstrating its commitment to creating a sustainable impact in the environment.\n\n3. \"The World According to Amazon\" by Amazon: Amazon's interactive data visualization tool \"The World According to Amazon\" displays a vast amount of information about each of the company's products, social media engagement, and shipping data visually. The result is a useful lens through which to see Amazon's impact on the world of e-commerce, consumers and sellers. According to the project description, \"Every time a customer buys something, Amazon's vast machinery cranks into life to get it to them as quickly as possible. From servers buzzing away in data centers to electric vehicles silently transporting packages, Amazon is a company of increasing complexity and scale\".\n\nThese examples all highlight the power of data visualization to engage and inform customers in new and exciting ways. Whether it's gamifying fitness, personalizing social media experiences, or simplifying the process of doing laundry, data visualization can help brands build stronger connections with their customers by providing engaging and useful experiences.",
