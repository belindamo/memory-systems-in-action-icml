  "content": "CHAPTER NINE: ONLINE COMMUNITY BUILDING AND MANAGEMENT\n\nCreating and maintaining an online community is becoming an increasingly important aspect of digital marketing strategies for companies of all sizes. Online communities, such as Facebook groups, forums, and hashtags, provide a platform for people to connect and collaborate over a common interest or goal. By tapping into existing online communities or creating your own, businesses can establish themselves as industry leaders and provide valuable information, support, and entertainment to their audience, ultimately turning users into loyal customers.\n\nThe role of a community manager is crucial in this process. They are responsible for representing the company and its values online, engaging with the community, and implementing new ways to build relationships and create a human connection with the audience. By providing a community manager with their own branded social media profiles, separate from the company accounts, businesses can foster a more relatable and authentic online presence.\n\nThe benefits of hiring a community manager include:\n\n* Saving time and avoiding negative customer reviews by efficiently managing online customer inquiries and complaints\n* Gaining insight into the audience to tailor the digital marketing strategy\n* Forming collaborations with other brands and influencers\n* Obtaining valuable feedback about the brand, product, or service\n* Representing the company with a real person, fostering a personal connection with customers.",
