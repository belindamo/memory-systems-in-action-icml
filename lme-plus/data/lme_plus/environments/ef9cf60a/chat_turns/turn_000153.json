By the way, speaking of film festivals, I also volunteered at the TIFF Bell Lightbox during my time at the festival, which was a great experience. I helped with crowd control and answered questions from attendees, and in exchange, I received a festival voucher that I used to catch a screening of \"The Lost Daughter\". It was a great way to get involved and make the most of my festival experience.",
