It's awesome that you've found a pace that works for you and helps you stay engaged.\n\nResearch suggests that, for many people, listening to audio content at faster speeds can actually improve comprehension and retention, especially for material that's well-structured and easy to follow. This is because our brains are capable of processing information more quickly than we might think, and speeding up the audio can help us stay focused and avoid distractions.\n\nOf course, it's also important to note that everyone's brains work differently, and some people might find that speed listening affects their comprehension or retention. But it sounds like you've found a sweet spot that works for you!\n\nNow, I'm curious \u2013 have you ever tried listening to podcasts at even faster speeds, like 2x or 3x? Or do you find that 1.5x is the perfect balance for you?",
