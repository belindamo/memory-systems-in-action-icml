  "content": "It's great to hear that the increased exercise from walking to work has been beneficial for your energy levels!\n\nAs for good coffee shops that serve a great cappuccino, I'd love to help you explore options. However, I still don't have access to your location. But I can suggest a few questions to help you find a great cappuccino spot:\n\n1. What do you look for in a great cappuccino? Is it the ratio of espresso to milk, the flavor profile, the texture of the foam, or something else?\n2. Are you open to trying different roasters or do you have a favorite coffee brand?\n3. Do you prefer a cozy, quiet atmosphere or a bustling, energetic vibe?\n\nAnswering these questions can help you refine your search and find a coffee shop that meets your cappuccino standards.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to try searching online for \"best cappuccino near me\" or \"coffee shops near my office\" to find highly-rated options in your area. You can also ask your colleagues or friends for recommendations, as they might have some insider knowledge on the best coffee spots.\n\nRemember to also check out review sites like Yelp or Google Maps to read reviews and see what other customers have to say about the coffee shops you're interested in.",
