However, many current FNIs are highly invasive, not feasible in humans, or can only record from, at most, one region of the brain. My research focuses on nano functional neural interfaces (nFNIs) to solve the stated problems. My penultimate goal is to design and safely implement a system that allows for high-resolution, bidirectional communication with the nervous system while being minimally invasive. I\u2019ve been enthralled with creating this system since I was in elementary school. It is a project that will need many interdisciplinary technological advances to achieve, but I believe that such a system would have many extraordinary impacts on both research and society. \n While I am specifically interested in researching nFNIs, I wanted to ensure that I had a wide range of research experience in neuroscience to better myself as a researcher. I had the honor of taking part in the 2020 summer undergraduate research program in Computational Neuroscience hosted by Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Due to the coronavirus, the internship was converted to an online format, which required me to work mostly independently. I worked in Dr. Aaron Batista\u2019s lab under the guidance of his graduate student Erinn Grigsby where another student and I studied \u201cDecoder Performance Classified as a Function of Neurons.\u201d \nIn this study, we investigated the impact of neuron dropping on decoder performance. By utilizing my skills in Matlab, we created three different Kalman filters and linear regression decoders. Each decoder contained different position, velocity, and velocity-position decoders to test, which was the most robust to neuron dropping. Despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus, we virtually presented our work at the Center of the Neural Basis of Cognition. Getting the chance to work in Dr. Batista\u2019s lab was by far the most rewarding experience in my professional career. The experience enriched my ability to decipher papers to find pertinent information. It strengthened my ability to pose a question and find an objective method to answer it. Most importantly, I gained an in-depth knowledge of how brain-computer interface decoders operate and first-hand experience developing and designing them. On top of my other coursework and projects, I am continuing my research into brain-computer interface decoders with my partner, explicitly investigating how modulation depth and preferred direction factor into decoder performance as neurons are dropped. We hope to see if specific neurons are essential for decoding a particular action than other neurons. \nAs part of my senior thesis at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am a part of a team, under the guidance of Dr. Dirk Albrecht, investigating the dosing of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease, dystonia, essential tremor, and epilepsy. Our primary goal is to find a method of optimizing the procedure of finding the correct dosage of frequency, pulse width, and voltage for each unique individual. We aim to conduct this study utilizing C. elegans as a model system because of the animal\u2019s completed connectome. Knowing the connectome may help see the underlying mechanisms that effectively allow DBS to treat the previously stated diseases. We hope that by identifying the underlying mechanisms of DBS, the treatment might be optimized.\nUsing what I\u2019ve learned from my previous research experiences, I am currently conducting a formal independent study into neural nanotransducers. One of the most considerable problems with non-invasive stimulation and imaging of neurons is that signals are dispersed or attenuated as they pass through the skull and tissue matter. Typically, the trade-off for having a stable signal deeper into the brain is by being more invasive. However, in this study, I hypothesize that nFNIs can be used as a relay system to send and receive external devices\u2019 signals. The hypothesis is based on the biomimicry of neurons themselves. In the example of an \u201cimaging\u201d nFNI, it would receive the information of a neuron firing and transduce the signal. A nearby relay nFNI would then relay that signal until it reached the skull where the signal could be read. The process would function conversely for signals sent to a specific neuron. \nMy current theory is nanowires composed of magnetic nanoparticles bound together by a protein chain could act as the relay nFNIs with magnetoelectric nFNIs at the end to send/receive signals. The wire would self-assemble using the proteins, which would also insulate the signal to reduce noise. Ideally, the wire would attach itself to the skull and the targeted neuron allowing for direct stimulation. The exploration of this concept is what I\u2019d like to make into my dissertation at Rice University. Rice has shown to be the pinnacle in regards to nano neural engineering through countless innovations done by its world-class staff. I knew Rice was perfect for me after pouring over the research conducted as I investigated nFNIs. With their guidance, I can use nFNIs to design and implement a minimally-invasive, bidirectional brain-computer interface.\nAfter my time at Rice University, I hope to found a research company centered around research further into nFNIs and making this BCI safely usable by humans. Ultimately, I hope the BCI would be a versatile treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease by allowing direct activation and monitoring of the affected neurons. The BCI could also enhance neuroprosthetics by allowing sensations such as touch to be sent back to the brain. The number of medical and scientific advancements possible with this technology are genuinely countless. The creation of this system will be my life\u2019s work that I have been doing since I was in middle school. I hope to continue this work at Rice University, where I\u2019ll get the guidance I could not receive anywhere else.",
