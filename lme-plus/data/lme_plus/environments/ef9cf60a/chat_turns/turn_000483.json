Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software: SIEM tools are designed to collect and analyze security event data from various sources within an organization's infrastructure. They provide insights into user activity like logins, file transfers, and data access. 2. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software: DLP tools detect and prevent data breaches. They can monitor sensitive data, like intellectual property, financial information, or personal data, and take action when data is being accessed or moved outside of predefined boundaries. 3. Identity and Access Management (IAM) software: IAM systems centrally manage and control user access to IT resources. They allow organizations to manage user roles, access privileges, and authentication and authorization policies. 4. Employee Monitoring software: Employee monitoring software provides real-time monitoring of employee activity, including keystrokes, web browsing, and application usage, to ensure that employees comply with policies and are working in a productive manner. 5. User Behavior Analytics (UBA) software: UBA software uses machine learning algorithms to detect abnormal user behavior. It analyzes data from various sources, such as logins, file accesses, and email usage, to create user profiles and detect anomalies that may indicate an insider threat.",
