  "content": "The application proposes research into nanotransducers as functional neural interfaces for bidirectional communication with the brain. The proposed study aims to find optimal nanotransducers for imaging neurons, stimulating neurons, and relaying signals. The study will investigate different imaging methods, such as quantum dot imaging, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, and genetically encoded voltage indicators. For stimulation, the study will compare magnetoelectric, piezoelectric, and optoelectric nanotransducers with conventional electrode-based stimulation. The research will be conducted using Caenorhabditis elegans as the model system, investigating the placement of the nanotransducers and their potential toxicity.",
