      "content": "Sure, here's a recipe for wholemeal bread rolls using strong wholemeal bread flour:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 500g strong wholemeal bread flour\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 1 tsp sugar\n* 7g dried yeast\n* 300ml lukewarm water\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the strong wholemeal bread flour, salt, sugar, and dried yeast.\n2. Gradually pour in the lukewarm water while mixing the ingredients together using a wooden spoon or a dough whisk.\n3. Once the dough starts to come together, add in the olive oil and continue to mix until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.\n4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.\n5. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size.\n6. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles and divide it into 12 equal pieces.\n7. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a greased baking tray.\n8. Cover the rolls with a clean tea towel and let them rise again for another 30 minutes.\n9. Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C (180\u00b0C fan)/390\u00b0F/gas mark 6.\n10. Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n11. Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before serving.\n\nEnjoy your freshly baked wholemeal bread rolls!"
