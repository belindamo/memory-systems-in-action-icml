      "content": "Some of the agencies I mentioned earlier can arrange for an ocean-view room as part of their package deals, but it depends on the specific hotel and package you choose. Here's a brief rundown:\n\n1. **All Japan Tours**: They offer a range of hotels, including some with ocean views, particularly in coastal cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Hiroshima. You can request an ocean-view room when booking, but it's subject to availability and may incur an additional fee.\n2. **Japan Deluxe Tours**: As a luxury-focused agency, they often work with high-end hotels that offer ocean views. They can arrange for an ocean-view room as part of their package, but it may depend on the specific hotel and room category. Expect to pay a premium for a luxury ocean-view room.\n3. **Trafalgar**: Trafalgar's hotel selection includes some ocean-view options, especially in coastal areas. They can request an ocean-view room on your behalf, but it's not guaranteed and may incur an additional fee.\n4. **Intrepid Travel**: Intrepid's accommodation options are generally more budget-friendly, and ocean-view rooms might not be as common. However, they may be able to arrange for an ocean-view room in certain locations, such as coastal towns or islands.
