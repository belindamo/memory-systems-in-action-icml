Consequently, the figures reproduced in this work are identical to the original ones. In the interest of conciseness, this report will only showcase the recreated charts, with the exception of figures 1 and 2, which display both the reproduced and original diagrams."

Notably, the workloads that are founded on low-level persistent memory (PM) instructions exhibit superior speedups in comparison to transaction-based workloads. This can be attributed to the fact that the former workloads write data back more frequently, thus demonstrating greater improvement upon being leveraged with PMWeaver."

For instance, the Enc+Veri system demonstrates substantial gains with the use of address-only prediction, whereas the Dedup system primarily derives benefits from data prediction."
