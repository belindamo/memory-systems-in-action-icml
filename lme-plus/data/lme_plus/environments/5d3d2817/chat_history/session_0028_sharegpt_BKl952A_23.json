      "content": "An LPC Associate (Licensed Professional Counselor Associate) is a pre-licensed mental health professional who has completed their educational requirements and is working under the supervision of a fully licensed professional counselor. This is typically a transitional stage for individuals pursuing a career in mental health counseling.\n\nDuring this stage, LPC Associates are required to accrue a specific number of supervised clinical hours before they can apply for full licensure as an LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor). The requirements for becoming an LPC vary by state, but generally include completing a master's degree in counseling or a related field, passing a licensing exam, and completing a certain number of supervised clinical hours. Once fully licensed, LPCs can provide mental health counseling and psychotherapy services independently."
