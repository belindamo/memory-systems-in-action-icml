      "content": "Part 34 We conclude that the date of the FOC is not the date on which the building works were completed and from which the statutory warranty period ran.\nFurthermore, we do not accept that the definition of building works includes the rectification of defects in the building works notified during the defects liability period.\nFirst, such a conclusion does not accord with the definition of building works in cl 1 of the contract; that is, works that are \u201ccarried out, completed and handed over to the owner\u201d. Second, it does not accord with the definition of practical completion in cl 1, which is \u201cwhen building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose\u201d. Third, it does not accord with cl 29.1, which states that the defects liability period commences \u201con and including the date of practical completion\u201d or with cl 29.2, which states that before the end of the defects liability period the owner may give the builder \u201cone list of defects in the building works that appear after the date of practical completion\u201d. Together these clauses support a construction of the contract that differentiates between the building works, the completion of the building works and defect rectification which occurs after the building works are completed and handed over to the owner.\nSection 48K(7) and 3B of the HB Act are also relevant to the date of completion of the works.\nAs at the date of the contract, s 48K(7) stated:\n(7) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction in respect of a building claim arising from a breach of a statutory warranty implied under Part 2C if the date on which the claim was lodged is more than 7 years after:\n(a) the date on which the residential building work the subject of the claim was completed, or\n(b) if the work is not completed:\n(i) the date for completion of the work specified or determined in accordance with the contract, or\n(ii) if there is no such date, the date of the contract.\nSection 3B was introduced by the Home Building Amendment Act 2011. In accordance with Schedule 4 Clause 106(a) of the HB Act, the amendments enacted by that Act were \u201cmade for the purpose of the avoidance of doubt\u201d and those amendments, including s 3B, extend to residential building work commenced or completed before the commencement of those amendments on 1 February 2012. Section 3B therefore applies to the residential building work in this case, notwithstanding that the contract was entered into in 2009.\nSection 3B of the HB Act relevantly provides:\n3B Date of completion of residential building work\n\u2026.\n(1) The completion of residential building work occurs on the date that the work is complete within the meaning of the contract under which the work was done.\n(2) If the contract does not provide for when work is complete (or there is no contract), the completion of residential building work occurs on practical completion of the work, which is when the work is completed except for any omissions or defects that do not prevent the work from being reasonably capable of being used for its intended purpose.\nPlease write in English language."

      "content": "Part 35 The effect of s 3B(1) is that the completion of residential building work occurs on the date that the work is complete within the meaning of the contract under which the work was done. As we have already noted, the contract in this case required the builder to complete the building works and to hand them over to the owners. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the works were not complete until the FOC was provided is inconsistent with the contract and, in our view, is an error of law.\nIf the contract does not provide for when work is complete, s 3B(2) provides that the completion of residential building work occurs on practical completion of the work. As we have noted, practical completion is defined in the contract as the date on which the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. The contract does not require the provision of an FOC as a condition of practical completion.\nSection 3B(3) of the HB Act provides a rebuttable presumption that residential building work is complete when an occupation certificate is issued for the work. However, that presumption only arises where practical completion has occurred and an occupation certificate is issued. In this case, the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the works were not complete until the FOC was issued is inconsistent with practical completion under the contract and, accordingly, s 3B(3) has no application.\nConclusion on Grounds 6 and 7\nFor the reasons set out above, we find that the Tribunal erred in finding that the completion date for the works was 20 October 2010. The completion date for the works was, in our view, the date of practical completion under the contract, which the Tribunal did not expressly find but which, on our interpretation of the contract, would have been some time before 20 October 2010. Given our findings in respect of Grounds 2 and 3, it is not strictly necessary for us to consider whether the Tribunal\u2019s finding was against the weight of evidence, but we note that, in any event, we do not consider that it was.\nAccordingly, we allow Ground 6, set aside the finding of the Tribunal in respect of completion date, and substitute a finding that the completion date for the works was the date of practical completion under the contract.\nGround 7 is not made out."

      "content": "Part 36 (3) It is to be presumed (unless an earlier date for practical completion can be established) that practical completion of residential building work occurred on the earliest of whichever of the following dates can be established for the work\u2014\n(a) the date on which the contractor handed over possession of the work to the owner,\n(b) the date on which the contractor last attended the site to carry out work (other than work to remedy any defect that does not affect practical completion),\n(c) the date of issue of an occupation certificate under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 that authorises commencement of the use or occupation of the work,\n(d) (in the case of owner-builder work) the date that is 18 months after the issue of the owner-builder permit for the work.\nIn our view, in accordance with s 3B(1) of the HB Act, the statutory warranty period commenced on completion of the building works within the meaning of the contract; that is, when the works reached practical completion. If the contract had not provided for when the building works were complete and s 3B(1) was not engaged, then s 3B(2) and s 3B(3) of the HB Act would apply. It is not in dispute that the owners took possession of the works on 13 July 2017. In this case, that would be the relevant date in accordance with s 3B(3)(a) of the Act. Issue of the FOC is not the completion date of the works under s 3B.\nOverall, we conclude that the Tribunal erred in finding that the date of completion of the building works was 20 October 2010, when the FOC was issued. In making this finding, the Tribunal misinterpreted the contract and did not correctly apply sections 48K(7) and 3B of the HB Act. Ground 6 is established. In our view, if the completion date was not the date of practical completion (8 July 2010), it was the date on which the works were handed over the owners (13 July 2021).\nIf we have erred in finding that the Tribunal\u2019s finding in relation to completion date raises a question of law, then for the reasons set out above, we conclude that the Tribunal\u2019s finding in this regard is against the weight of evidence. We would grant leave to appeal on this ground because we consider that the Tribunal\u2019s finding concerning the completion date gives rise to an injustice to the builder which is reasonably clear.\nDisposition of the appeal\nIt follows from our conclusion that the parties did not enter into a new contract or vary their original contract that the respondent\u2019s application to the Tribunal was out of time. This is because the owners\u2019 proceedings were not commenced within seven years of completion of the building works.\nThe Tribunal has no power to extend time for the making of an application under the HB Act: S & G Homes Pty Ltd t/as Pavilion Homes v Owen [2015] NSWCATAP 190 at [53].\nIn such circumstances, the appropriate orders are that the appeal be allowed, the decision under appeal be set aside and the Tribunal proceedings be dismissed.\nCosts of the Tribunal proceedings\nThe Tribunal formed what was expressed to be a \u201cprovisional view\u201d that the builder should be ordered to pay the owners\u2019 costs and made the following costs orders:\n4. Note the provisional view of the Tribunal that the\nrespondent builder pay the applicant owners' costs of\nPlease write in English language."

      "content": "Part 36: The appeal panel concludes that the Tribunal erred in finding that the completion date of the building works was the date the Final Occupation Certificate (FOC) was issued, as this misinterpreted the contract and did not correctly apply the relevant provisions of the Home Building Act (HB Act). They find that the completion date was either the date of practical completion or the date the works were handed over to the owners. As the respondent's application to the Tribunal was out of time, the panel orders that the appeal be allowed, the decision under appeal be set aside, and the Tribunal proceedings be dismissed. The Tribunal has no power to extend time for making an application under the HB Act, and the panel does not consider it appropriate to order costs against the builder."
