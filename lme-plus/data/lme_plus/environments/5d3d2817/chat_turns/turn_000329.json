That's a huge accomplishment, and it's great to hear that it's been making a positive impact.\n\nNow, let's tackle that desk and workspace decluttering project! Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Set a timer**: Schedule a specific time slot, say 30 minutes to an hour, and challenge yourself to declutter your desk and workspace during that time.\n2. **Start with a clear goal**: Decide what you want to achieve. Do you want to free up space, reduce distractions, or improve your productivity? Having a clear goal in mind will help you stay focused.\n3. **Sort items into categories**: Divide items into categories like \"keep,\" \"recycle,\" \"shred,\" \"donate,\" and \"throw away.\" This will make it easier to decide what to do with each item.\n4. **Purge unnecessary items**: Be ruthless \u2013 if you haven't used something in the past month, it's probably safe to get rid of it. Consider recycling or repurposing items that are still in good condition.\n5. **Organize your \"keep\" items**: Once you've purged your unwanted items, organize the remaining items into categories like \"frequently used,\" \"less frequently used,\" and \"rarely used.\" This will help you determine where to store each item.\n6. **Designate a \"home\" for each item**: Assign a specific place for each item, so it's easy to find what you need when you need it. This will also help maintain your newly decluttered space.\n7. **Use storage containers**: Invest in storage bins, baskets, or drawers to keep items that you need but don't use frequently. Label each container so you can easily identify what's inside.\n8. **Keep frequently used items accessible**: Place frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations, like the top drawer or a nearby shelf.\n9. **Consider ergonomics**: Make sure your workspace is set up to promote good posture and comfort. This will help you stay focused and productive.\n10. **Maintain your space**: Set aside a few minutes each day to maintain your newly decluttered workspace. This will help prevent clutter from building up again.\n\nRemember, decluttering your desk and workspace is a process, and it might take some time to get everything organized. But by following these tips, you'll be well on your way to a more productive, stress-free workspace.\n\nWhat's been the most challenging part of maintaining your daily cleaning routine, and how have you overcome those challenges?",
