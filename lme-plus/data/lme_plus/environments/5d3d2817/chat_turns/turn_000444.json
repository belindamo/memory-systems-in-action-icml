Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up lead scoring in HubSpot to trigger workflows based on lead behavior or engagement, specifically for the leads generated from the Tech Expo:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n1. You have a HubSpot Marketing Hub or Sales Hub account.\n2. You have created a list of leads generated from the Tech Expo in HubSpot.\n\n**Step 1: Create a Lead Scoring Property**\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Properties** > **Lead Properties**.\n2. Click **Create a property** and choose **Lead scoring**.\n3. Name your lead scoring property (e.g., \"Tech Expo Lead Score\").\n4. Set the **Scoring type** to **Points-based**.\n\n**Step 2: Define Scoring Criteria**\n\n1. Click **Add a criterion** to define the behaviors or actions that will increase or decrease the lead score.\n2. Choose from various criteria, such as:\n\t* **Page views**: Score leads based on specific page visits (e.g., product page, pricing page).\n\t* **Form submissions**: Score leads based on form submissions (e.g., demo requests, contact forms).\n\t* **Email opens**: Score leads based on email engagement (e.g., opening a specific email).\n\t* **Clicks**: Score leads based on clicks on specific links or CTAs.\n\t* **Custom events**: Score leads based on custom events (e.g., attending a webinar, downloading an asset).\n3. Assign points to each criterion based on its importance (e.g., 10 points for visiting the product page, 5 points for opening an email).\n\n**Example Scoring Criteria:**\n\n* 10 points: Visited the product page\n* 5 points: Opened an email about the Tech Expo\n* 3 points: Clicked on a link to learn more about the AI-powered project management tool\n* -2 points: Did not respond to an email after 3 days\n\n**Step 3: Set Scoring Thresholds**\n\n1. Define the scoring thresholds to trigger workflows or notifications.\n2. Set the **Threshold** to a specific score (e.g., 20 points).\n3. Choose the **Threshold type**:\n\t* ** Static**: Trigger the workflow when the lead reaches the exact score.\n\t* **Dynamic**: Trigger the workflow when the lead's score changes by a certain amount (e.g., increases by 10 points).\n\n**Step 4: Create a Workflow Triggered by Lead Scoring**\n\n1. Navigate to **Workflows** > **Create a workflow**.\n2. Choose **Lead-based workflow**.\n3. Set the **Trigger** to **Lead scoring** and select the lead scoring property created in Step 1.\n4. Set the **Trigger type** to **Threshold reached** and choose the scoring threshold defined in Step 3.\n5. Add actions to the workflow, such as sending a personalized email or assigning a task to a team member.\n\n**Example Workflow:**\n\n* Trigger: Lead score reaches 20 points\n* Action: Send a personalized email with a demo invitation\n* Action: Assign a task to the sales team to follow up with the lead\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use HubSpot's lead scoring feature to identify leads that are ready for sales outreach or nurturing.\n* Create multiple lead scoring properties to track different behaviors or engagement patterns.\n* Use HubSpot's integration with other tools (e.g., CRM, marketing automation) to further enrich lead scoring data.\n* Continuously refine and optimize your lead scoring model based on performance data and feedback.\n\nBy setting up lead scoring in HubSpot, you'll be able to identify and prioritize leads generated from the Tech Expo based on their behavior and engagement, and trigger targeted workflows to nurture and convert them into customers",
