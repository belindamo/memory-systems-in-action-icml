  "content": "Knitting is such a wonderful hobby, and lace knitting can be especially rewarding. The fact that you're enjoying the challenge and finding it relaxing is a testament to the therapeutic benefits of knitting!\n\nA floral motif sounds beautiful, and I can imagine the intricate pattern is keeping your mind engaged during your commute. It's great that you've found a way to make the most of your travel time.\n\nDo you have a favorite knitting technique or stitch pattern that you enjoy working with? And have you thought about what you'll do with the shawl once it's finished? Will you keep it for yourself or gift it to someone special?\n\n(By the way, I'm happy to chat about knitting anytime you'd like. I might not be a knitter myself, but I'm always excited to talk about crafts and creative pursuits!)",
