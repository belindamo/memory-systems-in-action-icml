  "content": "add the following concern to the letter, it is of high importance and the experience has left me scared considering the neighbors had delt with a break in recently. they have fortified their home in the aftermath of the incident. the concern is: this morning we found the gate wide open, it had been secured with the latch and bolted, but due to the lawn maintnece people coming through, my personal masterlock had not been resecured on the latch. we woke up this morning with the side gate completley open. due to the bottom bolt (the one going into the ground) on the gate being shut the night before it is likely that someone hopped the fence to open it. if there was someone casing this house they are now aware of a decent amount of technology inside (personal computers with expensive accessories).",
