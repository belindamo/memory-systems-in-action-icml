  "content": "Sure, here is an updated pitch for Sunstoney that includes the new information you provided:\n\nDear [Writer's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and introduce you to the music of Sunstoney, an up-and-coming artist who is making waves in the indie and psych-pop scenes. With her dreamy and introspective sound, Sunstoney is quickly becoming known for her unique blend of lo-fi R&B and psych-pop, as well as her powerful and uplifting lyrics that explore themes of self-love, body neutrality, and mental health struggles.\n\nSunstoney's latest album, \"2079,\" is set to release on March 8th and features a new direction in her music as she explores a dreamy and experimental sound. Produced in collaboration with Owen Martin (Knifing Around, RVA), the album is a sonic journey of self-discovery, with hypnotic beats, lush soundscapes, and a deep sense of introspection.\n\nAdditionally, Sunstoney is dropping the music video for her latest single, \"Ride,\" today at 12 PM EST. I have included a link to the private SoundCloud for \"Ride\" below:\n\n<https://on.soundcloud.com/jkpTVH4zkTVHc2uHA>\n\nSunstoney's music has been praised for its raw emotion, thought-provoking lyrics, and genre-bending sound. Her music is resonating with a growing audience of indie and psych-pop fans who are looking for something fresh and innovative in today's music scene.\n\nI would love to arrange an interview with Sunstoney or provide you with a review copy of her latest album \"2079\" for your consideration. Please let me know if this is something that interests you, or if there are any other ways we could collaborate in the future.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
