Here's what I have so far:\n\n**Sales Data**\n\n| **Event** | **Date** | **Number of Soaps Sold** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Weekly Farmers' Market | July 17th | 20 |\n| SummerFest Market | July 24th | 15 |\n\nIs there any other sales data you'd like to add to this table? Do you have any other events or markets you've participated in recently? Additionally, do you have any specific goals or questions you'd like to track for the upcoming Harvest Market on September 18th?",
