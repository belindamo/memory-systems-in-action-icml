  "content": "Part 35 The effect of s 3B(1) is that the completion of residential building work occurs on the date that the work is complete within the meaning of the contract under which the work was done. As we have already noted, the contract in this case required the builder to complete the building works and to hand them over to the owners. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the works were not complete until the FOC was provided is inconsistent with the contract and, in our view, is an error of law.\nIf the contract does not provide for when work is complete, s 3B(2) provides that the completion of residential building work occurs on practical completion of the work. As we have noted, practical completion is defined in the contract as the date on which the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. The contract does not require the provision of an FOC as a condition of practical completion.\nSection 3B(3) of the HB Act provides a rebuttable presumption that residential building work is complete when an occupation certificate is issued for the work. However, that presumption only arises where practical completion has occurred and an occupation certificate is issued. In this case, the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the works were not complete until the FOC was issued is inconsistent with practical completion under the contract and, accordingly, s 3B(3) has no application.\nConclusion on Grounds 6 and 7\nFor the reasons set out above, we find that the Tribunal erred in finding that the completion date for the works was 20 October 2010. The completion date for the works was, in our view, the date of practical completion under the contract, which the Tribunal did not expressly find but which, on our interpretation of the contract, would have been some time before 20 October 2010. Given our findings in respect of Grounds 2 and 3, it is not strictly necessary for us to consider whether the Tribunal\u2019s finding was against the weight of evidence, but we note that, in any event, we do not consider that it was.\nAccordingly, we allow Ground 6, set aside the finding of the Tribunal in respect of completion date, and substitute a finding that the completion date for the works was the date of practical completion under the contract.\nGround 7 is not made out.",
