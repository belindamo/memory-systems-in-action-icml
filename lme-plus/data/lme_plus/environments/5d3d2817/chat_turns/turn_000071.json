  "content": "Yes, there has been pushback from some quarters against efforts to eradicate the caste system. Some traditionalists see the caste system as part of Hindu identity and believe that efforts to end it are a threat to their religious and cultural traditions. They see it as an attack on their way of life and fear that it could lead to a loss of social order and stability.\n\nThere is also a section of the population that resents affirmative action policies that provide quotas for people from lower castes in jobs and education. They argue that this is unfair to those from higher castes who have to compete for limited opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, there have been instances where people from lower castes who have sought to challenge the caste system have faced backlash and violence from upper-caste communities. At times, even the police and other authorities have not been supportive of efforts to end caste-based discrimination.\n\nDespite this pushback, the movements to end caste discrimination and promote social justice in India continue to gain momentum. Many Hindus, traditional or otherwise, understand that the caste system is a barrier to progress and development and are supportive of efforts to create a more inclusive and equitable society.",
