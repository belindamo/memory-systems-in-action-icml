  "content": "Congratulations on taking the first step towards your sprint triathlon goal! It's great to hear that you've already started swimming lessons and making progress.\n\nTo create a customized training plan for you, I'll need to know a bit more information. Please provide me with the following details:\n\n1. What is your current fitness level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?\n2. How many weeks do you have until your sprint triathlon?\n3. What are your availability and preferences for training per week (e.g., number of days, morning/evening, specific days off)?\n4. What is your current swimming ability (e.g., comfort level in the water, distance you can swim without stopping)?\n5. Do you have a bike and are you comfortable riding it? If so, what's your current cycling ability (e.g., distance, frequency)?\n6. What's your running experience and current ability (e.g., distance, frequency, pace)?\n7. Are there any specific goals you have for the triathlon (e.g., finish time, place in your age group)?\n8. Are there any injuries or physical limitations I should be aware of when creating your training plan?\n\nRegarding your tennis tournament win, congratulations! However, I'm not sure how that relates to your triathlon training. Unless you'd like to incorporate tennis as a cross-training activity, we can focus on creating a plan that targets swimming, cycling, and running.\n\nOnce I have this information, I'll be happy to help you create a customized training plan tailored to your needs and goals.",
