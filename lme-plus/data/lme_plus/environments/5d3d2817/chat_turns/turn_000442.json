Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up email workflows and task assignments in HubSpot to follow up with leads generated from the Tech Expo:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n1. You have a HubSpot CRM account with the Marketing Hub or Sales Hub enabled.\n2. You have created a list of leads generated from the Tech Expo in HubSpot.\n\n**Step 1: Create a Lead Follow-up Workflow**\n\n1. Log in to your HubSpot account and navigate to **Workflows** under the **Automation** tab.\n2. Click **Create a workflow** and choose **Lead-based workflow**.\n3. Name your workflow (e.g., \"Tech Expo Lead Follow-up\") and add a description.\n4. Set the **Trigger** to **List membership** and select the list of leads generated from the Tech Expo.\n5. Choose the **Trigger type** as **Immediately** to trigger the workflow as soon as a lead is added to the list.\n\n**Step 2: Add Email Actions**\n\n1. Click **Add an action** and choose **Send email**.\n2. Select a template or create a new email template specifically for this follow-up campaign.\n3. In the email template, personalize the content using HubSpot's token system (e.g., `{{ lead.first_name }}`).\n4. Set the **Send email** action to occur at a specific time (e.g., 3 days after the trigger).\n5. Add multiple email actions to create a sequence of follow-up emails.\n\n**Example Email Sequence:**\n\n* Email 1 (sent immediately): \"Thank you for visiting our booth at the Tech Expo!\"\n* Email 2 (sent 3 days later): \"Learn more about our AI-powered project management tool\"\n* Email 3 (sent 7 days later): \"Schedule a demo to see our tool in action\"\n\n**Step 3: Add Task Assignments**\n\n1. Click **Add an action** and choose **Create task**.\n2. Select the task type (e.g., \"Follow up with lead\") and assign it to a specific team member or role.\n3. Set the **Task due date** to a specific time (e.g., 5 days after the trigger).\n4. Add multiple task assignments to create a sequence of tasks for your team.\n\n**Example Task Sequence:**\n\n* Task 1 (due 5 days after trigger): \"Follow up with lead via phone call\"\n* Task 2 (due 10 days after trigger): \"Send additional resources to lead via email\"\n\n**Step 4: Review and Activate the Workflow**\n\n1. Review your workflow to ensure all actions and tasks are correctly configured.\n2. Click **Activate** to enable the workflow.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use HubSpot's lead scoring feature to trigger workflows based on lead behavior or engagement.\n* Add conditional logic to your workflow to branch out different email sequences or task assignments based on lead responses or interactions.\n* Use HubSpot's integration with other tools (e.g., calendar, phone, or chat) to further automate your follow-up process.\n* Monitor and analyze your workflow's performance using HubSpot's reporting and analytics tools.\n\nBy setting up this workflow, you'll be able to automate your follow-up process, ensuring that leads generated from the Tech Expo receive timely and personalized communication from your team.",
