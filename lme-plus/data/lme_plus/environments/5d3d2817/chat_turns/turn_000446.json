Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a lead scoring model that indicates when a lead is sales-ready, specifically for the leads generated from the Tech Expo:\n\n**Step 1: Define Your Sales-Ready Criteria**\n\n1. Identify the behaviors, actions, and characteristics that indicate a lead is ready for sales outreach. These may include:\n\t* Engagement with your content (e.g., visiting the product page, downloading an eBook)\n\t* Demonstrated interest in your product or service (e.g., requesting a demo, attending a webinar)\n\t* Fit criteria (e.g., company size, industry, job title)\n\t* Recent activity (e.g., opened an email, clicked on a link)\n\n**Step 2: Create a Lead Scoring Property**\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Properties** > **Lead Properties**.\n2. Click **Create a property** and choose **Lead scoring**.\n3. Name your lead scoring property (e.g., \"Tech Expo Sales Readiness Score\").\n4. Set the **Scoring type** to **Points-based**.\n\n**Step 3: Assign Points for Sales-Ready Behaviors**\n\n1. Click **Add a criterion** to define the behaviors that indicate a lead is sales-ready.\n2. Assign points to each criterion based on its importance (e.g., 10 points for requesting a demo, 5 points for visiting the product page).\n\n**Example Sales-Ready Criteria:**\n\n* 10 points: Requested a demo of the AI-powered project management tool\n* 8 points: Downloaded an eBook about project management best practices\n* 5 points: Visited the product page within the last 7 days\n* 3 points: Opened an email about the Tech Expo within the last 3 days\n* 2 points: Has a job title of \"Project Manager\" or \"Director of Operations\"\n\n**Step 4: Define a Sales-Ready Threshold**\n\n1. Set a threshold score that indicates a lead is sales-ready (e.g., 25 points).\n2. Choose the **Threshold type**:\n\t* **Static**: Trigger the sales-ready notification when the lead reaches the exact score.\n\t* **Dynamic**: Trigger the sales-ready notification when the lead's score changes by a certain amount (e.g., increases by 10 points).\n\n**Step 5: Create a Workflow for Sales-Ready Leads**\n\n1. Navigate to **Workflows** > **Create a workflow**.\n2. Choose **Lead-based workflow**.\n3. Set the **Trigger** to **Lead scoring** and select the lead scoring property created in Step 2.\n4. Set the **Trigger type** to **Threshold reached** and choose the sales-ready threshold defined in Step 4.\n5. Add actions to the workflow, such as:\n\t* Sending a notification to the sales team\n\t* Assigning a task to a sales representative to follow up with the lead\n\t* Updating the lead's lifecycle stage to \"Sales Qualified Lead\"\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use HubSpot's lead scoring feature to identify leads that are ready for sales outreach, but also consider other factors like lead quality and fit.\n* Create multiple lead scoring properties to track different sales-ready criteria (e.g., one for demo requests, one for content engagement).\n* Use HubSpot's integration with other tools (e.g., CRM, marketing automation) to further enrich lead scoring data.\n* Continuously refine and optimize your lead scoring model based on performance data and feedback.\n\nBy creating a lead scoring model that indicates when a lead is sales-ready, you'll be able to identify high-quality leads generated from the Tech Expo and trigger targeted sales outreach to convert them into customers.",
