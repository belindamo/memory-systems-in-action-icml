At Televero Health, we are specifically looking for psychiatrists and Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs) to join our team.\n\nCould you please confirm if you hold either of these qualifications? If so, I would be more than happy to discuss the counseling and psychiatric opportunities available at Televero Health. You can schedule a time that works best for you using my Calendly link: <https://calendly.com/bailey-baker-1/30min>\n\nIf you do not hold these qualifications but know of any colleagues who do and might be interested in such opportunities, I would greatly appreciate any referrals.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\nBailey",
