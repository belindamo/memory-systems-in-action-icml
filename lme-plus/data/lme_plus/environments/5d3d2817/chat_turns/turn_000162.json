The white and black accents will provide nice contrast and help tie everything together.\n\nFor the fabric calculations, let's break it down:\n\n* Pink: 2/3 of the bright color fabric requirement, which is approximately 1.5-2 yards (1.4-1.8 meters)\n* Yellow: 1/3 of the bright color fabric requirement, which is approximately 0.75-1 yard (0.7-0.9 meters)\n* Coral and Turquoise: Let's allocate 0.5-1 yard (0.5-0.9 meters) for each of these colors, depending on how prominently you want them to feature in the quilt\n* White: 2-3 yards (1.8-2.7 meters) for the background and accents\n* Black: 1-2 yards (0.9-1.8 meters) for the accents\n* Accent fabric (optional): 0.5-1 yard (0.5-0.9 meters) if you want to add some extra interest or texture\n\nFor the texture, you can stick to soft, cuddly fabrics like cotton, cotton blends, or even some minky or fleece for added plushness. The coral and turquoise fabrics can add a nice depth of texture, and you can also consider using some cotton lawn or voile for a softer, more romantic feel.\n\nNow, let's talk about the block layout. With the modern patchwork design, we can create a fun, improvisational look by varying the block sizes and arrangements. Here's a possible approach:\n\n* Use a mix of 10\" (25 cm) squares, 2\" x 10\" (5 cm x 25 cm) rectangles, and 5\" (13 cm) squares to create a playful, uneven grid\n* Alternate between bright color blocks and white or black background blocks to create a sense of movement and energy\n* Place the coral and turquoise blocks strategically to add pops of color and interest\n* Consider adding some \"connector\" blocks in white or black to tie the different color sections together\n\nHow does this sound? Do you have any other ideas or preferences for the block layout, or would you like me to suggest some alternative designs?",
