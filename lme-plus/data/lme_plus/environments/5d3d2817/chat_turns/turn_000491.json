  "content": "I've been meaning to re-read Doctor Zhivago, it's been a while since I last read it. I do have a favorite recipe for roasted butternut squash soup, but I've been wanting to try a new one. Do you have any suggestions for a creamy and comforting recipe? Also, since it's been a month since winter officially started, I was thinking of planning a winter-themed dinner party and was wondering if you could give me some ideas for decorations and ambiance.",
