  "content": "on the topic of construction mess i would also like to inform rent select that the active construction sites have been left in place so long that the sites and items in them are starting to decay. i will attach photos of the front yard site and the backyard area where the gate is to be replaced. the baseboard that the gate will be sitting on is showing signs of the same rot that destroyed the gate. i will attach images of the front construction site. there has been rusty rebar for months sticking out of the ground very close to the neighbors yard. and the actual structure venkatesh is working to build is starting to fall apart due to weathering. on top of that there is starting to be weed growth amongst his construction that i do not feel comfortable having removed from an active construction site with hazards such as rebar posts sticking out of the ground.",
