  "content": "Here's the updated letter with the additional concern:\n\nHello Alex, I hope you\u2019re having a good morning and that this email finds you well.\n\nI wanted to reach out to you with an update regarding the property.\n\nFirstly, I would like to express my gratitude towards the landlord for repairing the dishwasher. The landlord came to take a look at the dishwasher on Monday and successfully repaired it. I had meant to send a thank you email sooner but have been very unwell.\n\nHowever, I do have some other concerns that I would like to bring to your attention. Recently, I found a rusty metal spike sticking out of the ground where the back gate is to be replaced. Venkatesh had informed me that there was construction debris back there but he never mentioned that there were hazards coming out of the ground. I only found this hard spike after hearing an awful shriek from my dog who I can only assume stepped on it as there are no other hazards back there and she was passing by that gate site. I only ever saw the metal posts used for construction laid flat on the ground near the gate site and thought the construction mess was limited to those as I had not been warned about dangerous protrusions from the gravel or ground, the spike had been present for months without being noticed.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to mention that this morning we found the gate wide open, it had been secured with the latch and bolted, but due to the lawn maintenance people coming through, my personal masterlock had not been re-secured on the latch. We woke up this morning with the side gate completely open. Due to the bottom bolt (the one going into the ground) on the gate being shut the night before it is likely that someone hopped the fence to open it. This experience has left me scared, especially considering the neighbors had dealt with a break-in recently. They have fortified their home in the aftermath of the incident. If there was someone casing this house, they are now aware of a decent amount of technology inside, such as personal computers with expensive accessories. This concern is of high importance to me and I hope that you can assist me in resolving it as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your time and attention.",
