  "content": "Part 36: The appeal panel concludes that the Tribunal erred in finding that the completion date of the building works was the date the Final Occupation Certificate (FOC) was issued, as this misinterpreted the contract and did not correctly apply the relevant provisions of the Home Building Act (HB Act). They find that the completion date was either the date of practical completion or the date the works were handed over to the owners. As the respondent's application to the Tribunal was out of time, the panel orders that the appeal be allowed, the decision under appeal be set aside, and the Tribunal proceedings be dismissed. The Tribunal has no power to extend time for making an application under the HB Act, and the panel does not consider it appropriate to order costs against the builder.",
