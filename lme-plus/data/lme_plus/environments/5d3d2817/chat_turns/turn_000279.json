Considering you met her at TechCon, you might have exchanged contact information or connected on LinkedIn. Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Option 1: LinkedIn Message**\n\n* If you're already connected on LinkedIn, a personalized message on the platform can be a great way to reach out.\n* Your message will likely end up in her LinkedIn inbox, which she might check regularly.\n* Keep your message concise, clear, and professional, just like an email.\n\nExample:\n\n\"Hi Sarah, great meeting you at TechCon last week! I'm organizing a meetup for my professional network in June and I think your insights would be a great addition to our panel discussion on [topic]. Would you be interested and available to participate? Let me know, and we can discuss details.\"\n\n**Option 2: Email**\n\n* If you have Sarah's email address, a personalized email can be a good option.\n* Make sure to use a clear and descriptive subject line, so she knows what your email is about.\n* Keep your email concise, just like a LinkedIn message.\n\nExample:\n\nSubject: Invitation to Participate in a Panel Discussion on [Topic]\n\n\"Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our conversation at TechCon last week. I'm organizing a meetup for my professional network in June and I think your expertise would be a great fit for our panel discussion on [topic]. Would you be interested and available to participate? Let me know, and we can discuss details.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\"\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Keep your message concise and to the point.\n* Make sure to mention your connection (meeting at TechCon) to help her remember you.\n* Show that you've done your research and explain why you think she'd be a great fit for the panel discussion.\n* Be clear about the topic and format of the event.\n* Include a clear call-to-action, such as \"Let me know if you're interested and available.\"\n\nChoose the method that you think Sarah is most likely to respond to, or try a combination of both (e.g., send a LinkedIn message and follow up with an email if you don't receive a response). Good luck!",
