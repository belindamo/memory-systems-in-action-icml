You're absolutely right, though - quilting or embroidery can add a beautiful dimension to knitted pieces. The combination of textures and techniques can create a truly unique and stunning result.\n\nYour comment got me thinking, though...

Could we use a simple running stitch or a decorative stitch to add some texture to the quilt? Or maybe we could use embroidery floss to add some delicate, whimsical details to the quilt blocks? The possibilities are endless!",
