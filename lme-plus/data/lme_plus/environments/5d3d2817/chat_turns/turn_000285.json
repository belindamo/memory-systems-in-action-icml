  "content": "Following up with Emily from the Digital Marketing conference in February is a great idea.\n\nSince you already discussed case studies with Emily, it's a good idea to follow up on that thread, regardless of the outcome with Sarah and John. You can send the case studies to Emily now, as it's a separate conversation and not dependent on the other two.\n\nIn fact, sending the case studies to Emily now might even help you:\n\n1. **Stay top of mind:** By following up on your previous conversation, you'll stay top of mind for Emily, which can lead to potential future collaborations or opportunities.\n2. **Demonstrate reliability:** By delivering on your promise to send the case studies, you're showing Emily that you're reliable and follow through on your commitments.\n3. **Keep the conversation going:** Sending the case studies can spark further discussion and potentially lead to new opportunities or introductions.\n\nGo ahead and send the case studies to Emily now, and include a brief, personalized message, such as:\n\n\"Hi Emily, hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation at the Digital Marketing conference in February and send over the case studies we discussed. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!\"\n\nBy sending the case studies now, you're taking care of an existing commitment and keeping the conversation going with Emily, while also allowing yourself to focus on the outreach to Sarah and John.\n\nRemember to keep your messages organized, and consider using a tool like a CRM or a spreadsheet to track your conversations and follow-ups. This will help you stay on top of your outreach efforts and ensure you're not duplicating efforts or missing important follow-ups.",
