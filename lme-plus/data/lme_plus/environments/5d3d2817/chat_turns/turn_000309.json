However, UNC Chapel Hill's athletic program is one of the most well-known in the state and has a long history of success in many sports, including basketball, baseball, and soccer. The UNC Tar Heels basketball program is particularly noteworthy and has won multiple NCAA championships under legendary coach Dean Smith and more recently under coach Roy Williams.
