  "content": "Part 36 (3) It is to be presumed (unless an earlier date for practical completion can be established) that practical completion of residential building work occurred on the earliest of whichever of the following dates can be established for the work\u2014\n(a) the date on which the contractor handed over possession of the work to the owner,\n(b) the date on which the contractor last attended the site to carry out work (other than work to remedy any defect that does not affect practical completion),\n(c) the date of issue of an occupation certificate under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 that authorises commencement of the use or occupation of the work,\n(d) (in the case of owner-builder work) the date that is 18 months after the issue of the owner-builder permit for the work.\nIn our view, in accordance with s 3B(1) of the HB Act, the statutory warranty period commenced on completion of the building works within the meaning of the contract; that is, when the works reached practical completion. If the contract had not provided for when the building works were complete and s 3B(1) was not engaged, then s 3B(2) and s 3B(3) of the HB Act would apply. It is not in dispute that the owners took possession of the works on 13 July 2017. In this case, that would be the relevant date in accordance with s 3B(3)(a) of the Act. Issue of the FOC is not the completion date of the works under s 3B.\nOverall, we conclude that the Tribunal erred in finding that the date of completion of the building works was 20 October 2010, when the FOC was issued. In making this finding, the Tribunal misinterpreted the contract and did not correctly apply sections 48K(7) and 3B of the HB Act. Ground 6 is established. In our view, if the completion date was not the date of practical completion (8 July 2010), it was the date on which the works were handed over the owners (13 July 2021).\nIf we have erred in finding that the Tribunal\u2019s finding in relation to completion date raises a question of law, then for the reasons set out above, we conclude that the Tribunal\u2019s finding in this regard is against the weight of evidence. We would grant leave to appeal on this ground because we consider that the Tribunal\u2019s finding concerning the completion date gives rise to an injustice to the builder which is reasonably clear.\nDisposition of the appeal\nIt follows from our conclusion that the parties did not enter into a new contract or vary their original contract that the respondent\u2019s application to the Tribunal was out of time. This is because the owners\u2019 proceedings were not commenced within seven years of completion of the building works.\nThe Tribunal has no power to extend time for the making of an application under the HB Act: S & G Homes Pty Ltd t/as Pavilion Homes v Owen [2015] NSWCATAP 190 at [53].\nIn such circumstances, the appropriate orders are that the appeal be allowed, the decision under appeal be set aside and the Tribunal proceedings be dismissed.\nCosts of the Tribunal proceedings\nThe Tribunal formed what was expressed to be a \u201cprovisional view\u201d that the builder should be ordered to pay the owners\u2019 costs and made the following costs orders:\n4. Note the provisional view of the Tribunal that the\nrespondent builder pay the applicant owners' costs of\nPlease write in English language.",
