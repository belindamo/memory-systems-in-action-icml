Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a negative scoring criterion in HubSpot:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Negative Behaviors or Characteristics**\n\n1. Identify the behaviors, actions, or characteristics that indicate a lead is not a good fit for your AI-powered project management tool. These may include:\n\t* Lack of engagement with your content (e.g., not opening emails, not visiting your website)\n\t* Incomplete or inaccurate form submissions (e.g., missing company information, invalid email addresses)\n\t* Unqualified job titles or industries\n\t* Low company size or revenue\n\n**Step 2: Create a Negative Scoring Criterion**\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Properties** > **Lead Properties**.\n2. Click **Create a property** and choose **Lead scoring**.\n3. Name your negative scoring criterion (e.g., \"Negative Score for Unqualified Leads\").\n4. Set the **Scoring type** to **Points-based**.\n\n**Step 3: Assign Negative Points**\n\n1. Click **Add a criterion** to define the negative behaviors or characteristics.\n2. Assign negative points to each criterion based on its importance (e.g., -5 points for not opening an email, -10 points for an invalid email address).\n\n**Example Negative Scoring Criteria:**\n\n* -5 points: Did not open an email about the Tech Expo within 7 days\n* -10 points: Provided an invalid email address\n* -8 points: Has a job title of \"Student\" or \"Intern\"\n* -5 points: Company size is less than 10 employees\n\n**Step 4: Set a Negative Scoring Threshold**\n\n1. Set a threshold score that indicates a lead is not a good fit (e.g., -15 points).\n2. Choose the **Threshold type**:\n\t* **Static**: Trigger the negative scoring notification when the lead reaches the exact score.\n\t* **Dynamic**: Trigger the negative scoring notification when the lead's score changes by a certain amount (e.g., decreases by 10 points).\n\n**Step 5: Create a Workflow for Negative Scoring Leads**\n\n1. Navigate to **Workflows** > **Create a workflow**.\n2. Choose **Lead-based workflow**.\n3. Set the **Trigger** to **Lead scoring** and select the negative scoring criterion created in Step 2.\n4. Set the **Trigger type** to **Threshold reached** and choose the negative scoring threshold defined in Step 4.\n5. Add actions to the workflow, such as:\n\t* Sending a notification to the sales team to review the lead\n\t* Updating the lead's lifecycle stage to \"Unqualified Lead\"\n\t* Removing the lead from sales outreach campaigns\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use HubSpot's negative scoring feature to identify leads that are not a good fit for your product or service, and focus your sales outreach on high-quality leads.\n* Create multiple negative scoring criteria to track different negative behaviors or characteristics.\n* Use HubSpot's integration with other tools (e.g., CRM, marketing automation) to further enrich lead scoring data.\n* Continuously refine and optimize your negative scoring model based on performance data and feedback.\n\nBy creating a negative scoring criterion in HubSpot, you'll be able to identify leads that are not a good fit for your AI-powered project management tool and focus your sales outreach on high-quality leads that are more likely to convert into customers.",
