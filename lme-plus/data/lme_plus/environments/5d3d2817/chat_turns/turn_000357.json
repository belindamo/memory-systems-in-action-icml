  "content": "That's wonderful to hear! It's great that your brother Michael is supporting you in preparing your home for the new addition. Safety-proofing the house is a crucial step in creating a safe and welcoming environment for the child.\n\nHaving a support system like Michael can make a big difference in the adoption process. It's not only helpful to have someone to lend a hand with physical tasks like safety-proofing, but also to have someone to talk to and lean on emotionally.\n\nRemember to also take care of yourself during this time. Preparing for a new addition can be overwhelming, and it's essential to prioritize your own physical and emotional well-being. Don't hesitate to ask Michael or other loved ones for help when you need it, and don't be afraid to take breaks when you need to recharge.\n\nIt's also great that Michael is involved in the process and can develop a bond with the child from the start. Having a strong support system can help the child feel more comfortable and secure as they transition into their new home.\n\nKeep up the great work, and I'm sure you'll create a wonderful and safe environment for the new addition!",
