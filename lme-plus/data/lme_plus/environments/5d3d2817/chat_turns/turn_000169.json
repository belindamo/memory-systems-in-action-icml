  "content": "Part 34 We conclude that the date of the FOC is not the date on which the building works were completed and from which the statutory warranty period ran.\nFurthermore, we do not accept that the definition of building works includes the rectification of defects in the building works notified during the defects liability period.\nFirst, such a conclusion does not accord with the definition of building works in cl 1 of the contract; that is, works that are \u201ccarried out, completed and handed over to the owner\u201d. Second, it does not accord with the definition of practical completion in cl 1, which is \u201cwhen building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose\u201d. Third, it does not accord with cl 29.1, which states that the defects liability period commences \u201con and including the date of practical completion\u201d or with cl 29.2, which states that before the end of the defects liability period the owner may give the builder \u201cone list of defects in the building works that appear after the date of practical completion\u201d. Together these clauses support a construction of the contract that differentiates between the building works, the completion of the building works and defect rectification which occurs after the building works are completed and handed over to the owner.\nSection 48K(7) and 3B of the HB Act are also relevant to the date of completion of the works.\nAs at the date of the contract, s 48K(7) stated:\n(7) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction in respect of a building claim arising from a breach of a statutory warranty implied under Part 2C if the date on which the claim was lodged is more than 7 years after:\n(a) the date on which the residential building work the subject of the claim was completed, or\n(b) if the work is not completed:\n(i) the date for completion of the work specified or determined in accordance with the contract, or\n(ii) if there is no such date, the date of the contract.\nSection 3B was introduced by the Home Building Amendment Act 2011. In accordance with Schedule 4 Clause 106(a) of the HB Act, the amendments enacted by that Act were \u201cmade for the purpose of the avoidance of doubt\u201d and those amendments, including s 3B, extend to residential building work commenced or completed before the commencement of those amendments on 1 February 2012. Section 3B therefore applies to the residential building work in this case, notwithstanding that the contract was entered into in 2009.\nSection 3B of the HB Act relevantly provides:\n3B Date of completion of residential building work\n\u2026.\n(1) The completion of residential building work occurs on the date that the work is complete within the meaning of the contract under which the work was done.\n(2) If the contract does not provide for when work is complete (or there is no contract), the completion of residential building work occurs on practical completion of the work, which is when the work is completed except for any omissions or defects that do not prevent the work from being reasonably capable of being used for its intended purpose.\nPlease write in English language.",
