Break down tasks into manageable steps, and celebrate small victories.\n3. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Acknowledge your emotions and remind yourself that it's okay to not have all the answers.\n4. **Celebrate Milestones**: Celebrate small milestones, like completing paperwork or attending a pre-adoption seminar. Acknowledge your progress and accomplishments along the way.\n5. **Seek Professional Help**: If you're experiencing overwhelming anxiety or stress, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with personalized coping strategies and support.\n\nRemember, it's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being during the adoption process.
