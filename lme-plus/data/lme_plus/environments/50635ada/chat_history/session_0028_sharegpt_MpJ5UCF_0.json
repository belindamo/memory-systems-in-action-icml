Ying-ying interprets the broken mirror as a symbol of the dysfunction and lack of communication in Lena's marriage. She believes that Lena and Harold are afraid to confront their problems directly and that they are avoiding the difficult conversations that are necessary for their relationship to thrive. By drawing attention to the broken mirror, Ying-ying encourages Lena to confront the issues in her marriage and to take action to repair the damage that has been done. In this way, the broken mirror serves as a metaphor for the challenges and opportunities for growth that exist in Lena's marriage."
