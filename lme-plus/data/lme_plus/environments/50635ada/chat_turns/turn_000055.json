I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nFull-spectrum lighting is an excellent choice for a home office, as it can help improve focus, productivity, and overall mood. Here are some recommendations for floor lamps and string lights that provide full-spectrum lighting:\n\n**Floor Lamps:**\n\n1. **Verilux HappyLight Deluxe**: This lamp emits a broad-spectrum light that mimics natural outdoor light, helping to boost energy and focus. It's also adjustable, so you can direct the light exactly where you need it.\n2. **Lumiy Light therapy Floor Lamp**: This lamp provides a high-intensity, full-spectrum light that's designed to help regulate your circadian rhythms and improve concentration.\n3. **Daylight Company Floor Lamp**: This lamp uses a specialized LED bulb that mimics natural daylight, promoting focus, energy, and mood enhancement.\n\n**String Lights:**\n\n1. **Luminess Air LED String Lights**: These string lights use LED bulbs that provide a full-spectrum, soft white light that's easy on the eyes. They're also energy-efficient and dimmable.\n2. **Philips Hue Smart Lighting**: While not specifically marketed as full-spectrum lights, Philips Hue bulbs are known for their high-quality, natural light output. You can adjust the color temperature and brightness to create a focus-enhancing atmosphere.\n3. **GE Reveal LED String Lights**: These string lights use a specialized LED bulb that provides a bright, white light that's similar to natural daylight.\n\nFor your den, you might consider adding some table lamps or a floor lamp to supplement the reading lamp you already have. This will create a cozy and inviting atmosphere, perfect for relaxation and reading.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* When choosing a full-spectrum lamp, look for products with a color temperature around 5000-6500K, which is closest to natural daylight.\n* Consider the lumen output of the lamp, as higher lumens can help increase focus and productivity.\n* If you're sensitive to blue light, look for lamps with blue light filtering or use blue light blocking glasses when working under full-spectrum lighting.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect lamps for your home office and den!",
