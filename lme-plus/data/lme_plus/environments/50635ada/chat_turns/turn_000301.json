Through her mother's story, Jing-mei discovers that her mother, Suyuan Woo, had to abandon twin daughters in Kweilin during the chaos of the war. Suyuan had always told Jing-mei that her twin sisters had died, but the truth was that they were still alive. This discovery is a turning point in Jing-mei's relationship with her mother and leads to a deeper understanding and appreciation of her mother's sacrifices and the challenges she faced as an immigrant. The revelation also serves to connect Jing-mei with her Chinese heritage and helps her to reconcile her dual identities as an American-born Chinese person.",
