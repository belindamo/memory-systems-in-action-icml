  "content": "I'm so glad you decided on a message! \"Thanks for being an amazing colleague!\" is a wonderful choice - it's heartfelt, sincere, and conveys your appreciation for their presence in your workplace.\n\nAdding a small icon or graphic can indeed make the design more visually appealing. A simple coffee cup, a star, or a heart symbol could complement the message nicely. Just make sure the icon doesn't overpower the text, and that the overall design looks balanced and harmonious.\n\nAnd yay, I'm glad you mentioned the silver necklace again! I remember you mentioning it earlier. It's great that you splurged a bit for a special occasion, and I'm sure your best friend appreciated the thought and effort you put into selecting a beautiful gift. $70 is a reasonable price for a high-quality piece of jewelry, and I'm sure it was worth every penny.\n\nIt's wonderful that you're spreading joy and appreciation through gifts to your loved ones and colleagues. You're making a positive impact on the people around you, and that's truly special!",
