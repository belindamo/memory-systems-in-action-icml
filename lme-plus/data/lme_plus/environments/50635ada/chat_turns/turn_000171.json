  "content": "I'm happy to help, but I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific products or inventory at individual Tractor Supply Co. stores. However, I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you need:\n\n1. Call the store directly: As I mentioned earlier, you can call the Tractor Supply Co. store near you to ask about their vaccine selection and availability. They should be able to tell you if they carry the specific vaccines recommended by Dr. Thompson for Luna and Leo.\n2. Check the Tractor Supply Co. website: You can also visit the Tractor Supply Co. website to see if they have an online catalog or product listing that includes vaccines. You can search for the specific vaccines recommended by Dr. Thompson to see if they are available.\n3. Consult with Dr. Thompson or a veterinarian: If you're unsure about the vaccines or have specific questions, it's always best to consult with Dr. Thompson or a veterinarian. They can provide personalized advice and guidance on the best vaccines for Luna and Leo's needs.\n\nRemember to always follow the advice of a licensed veterinarian when it comes to the health and care of your goats.",
