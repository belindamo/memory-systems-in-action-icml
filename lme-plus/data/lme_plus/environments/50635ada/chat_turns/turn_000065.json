Adding more lighting to the den can make it an even cozier and inviting space.\n\nSince you mentioned the den could use more lighting, here are some ideas to consider:\n\n1. **Table lamps**: Adding one or two table lamps can provide additional task lighting and create a warm ambiance. You could place them on side tables, consoles, or even a desk.\n2. **Floor lamps**: A floor lamp can add a lot of light to the room and can be placed in a corner or against a wall. Look for one with a slim profile to fit snugly into the space.\n3. **String lights**: String lights can add a cozy, warm glow to the den. You could hang them above a bookshelf, around a window, or even along a staircase.\n4. **Recessed lighting**: If you're comfortable with DIY projects or have an electrician on hand, consider adding recessed lighting to the den. This can provide a lot of ambient light and make the space feel more open.\n\nRemember to consider the den's layout, furniture, and decor when choosing additional lighting. You want to create a cohesive look that enhances the space without overwhelming it.\n\nWhat type of lighting do you think would work best for the den?",
