Here's a shorter version:\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue,\nSpringtime's here, bringing colors anew.\nPink, yellow blooms, morning dew,\nNature wakes, bidding winter adieu.\n\nBees and butterflies dance and play,\nBeneath the sun's warm, gentle ray.\nFlowers burst forth in full bloom,\nSweet perfume fills every room.\n\nLet's celebrate this season's cheer,\nNew beginnings, love, and joy near.\nSpring has come, with endless grace,\nBringing happiness to every place.",
