  "content": "Religion played a significant role in the social structure of Visigothic society. The Visigoths were initially Arian Christians, while the native Hispano-Romans were largely Catholic Christians. The Visigothic kings used religion to unite their subjects and legitimise their rule. Failure to adhere to the established religion was considered a political offense and was severely punished.\n\nThe Visigothic church was a major landowner that controlled vast territories and had significant political power. The church provided education, healthcare, and charitable services to the populace, particularly the poor, which reinforced their influence. Priests and bishops wielded significant authority, often acting as judges and arbitrators in local disputes. They could excommunicate offenders, depriving them of religious and social privileges.\n\nThe church also played a significant role in the legal system. Ecclesiastical law governed issues such as marriage and divorce, while secular law dealt with criminal and civil matters. Church councils were regularly held to establish ecclesiastical law, and the councils' decisions carried considerable weight.\n\nOverall, religion played a crucial role in the social, political, and legal aspects of Visigothic society. It was a unifying force that helped maintain social cohesion and reinforce the ruling authority's legitimacy.",
