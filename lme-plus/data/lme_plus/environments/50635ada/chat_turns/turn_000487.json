A slight micro-bend is okay.\n\n**Tip 2: Engage Your Core**\n\n* Activate your transverse abdominis muscle by drawing your navel towards your spine.\n* This will help stabilize your body and improve balance.\n\n**Tip 3: Focus on Your Drishti (Gaze)**\n\n* Fix your gaze on a point in front of you, about 6-8 feet away.\n* Avoid looking down or around; keep your gaze steady and soft.\n\n**Tip 4: Relax Your Upper Body**\n\n* Keep your shoulders relaxed and down, avoiding tension or scrunching.\n* Let your arms hang relaxed by your sides or bring them to your heart center (Anjali Mudra).\n\n**Tip 5: Play with Weight Distribution**\n\n* Experiment with shifting your weight slightly onto the ball of your standing foot or the heel. Find the sweet spot where you feel most balanced.\n* Try lifting your toes or heels slightly to engage your ankle and calf muscles.\n\n**Tip 6: Breathe and Relax**\n\n* Take slow, deep breaths, feeling the ground beneath your feet.\n* As you inhale, lengthen your spine and feel more grounded.\n* As you exhale, relax and release any tension.\n\n**Tip 7: Practice Variations and Progressions**\n\n* Start with shorter holds and gradually increase your time in the pose.\n* Try practicing with your eyes closed or on a soft surface, like a yoga block or a pillow.\n* Progress to lifting your arms overhead, bringing your palms together, or even closing your eyes.\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n\n* Locking your knee or ankle, which can cause instability.\n* Letting your hips or shoulders sag, which can throw off your balance.\n* Looking down or around, which can distract you from your focus.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n\n* Practice Vrksasana regularly, even if it's just for a few seconds a day.\n* Start with shorter holds and gradually increase your time as you build balance and confidence.\n* Try practicing Vrksasana on both legs to develop symmetry and balance.\n\nRemember, balance is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient, stay consistent, and you'll be standing tall in Tree Pose in no time!",
