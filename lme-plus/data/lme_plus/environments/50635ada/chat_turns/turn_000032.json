  "content": "Yeah, it was a great trip! I think the most memorable part was the bonfire we had on Saturday night. We grilled up some steaks and shared stories about our past fishing trips. It was really nice to relax and enjoy each other's company after a long day of fishing.\n\nAs for the fishing, we found that the walleye were holding pretty close to shore, around 10-15 feet deep. We were targeting areas with a mix of rock and sand, and the silver spinnerbaits seemed to work really well in those conditions. We caught a total of 12 fish, including 3 large mouth bass and 5 walleye, so it was a pretty successful trip overall.",
