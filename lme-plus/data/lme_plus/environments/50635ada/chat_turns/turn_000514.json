  "content": "1. Search toggle (continued): The search toggle button is wrapped inside a `<div>` with the class `.search-toggle`. When users click on the button, it toggles the visibility of the search form located inside the `#search-container` div.\n```html\n<div class=\"search-toggle\">\n  <a href=\"#search-container\" class=\"screen-reader-text\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"search-container\">Search</a>\n</div>\n```\n1. Search form: The search form in Twenty Fourteen is contained within a separate `<div>` with the ID `#search-container` and the class `.search-box-wrapper`. This structure allows for better management and styling of the search form, as well as improved interaction with the search toggle button. The form is initially hidden with the class `.hide` and becomes visible when the search toggle button is clicked.\n```html\n<div id=\"search-container\" class=\"search-box-wrapper hide\">\n  <div class=\"search-box\">\n    <!-- The search form markup -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n1. Primary navigation: The primary navigation in Twenty Fourteen is simplified compared to Twenty Thirteen. It is placed directly inside the `<nav>` element with an ID of `#primary-navigation`. This change streamlines the navigation structure and makes it easier to customize.\n```html\n<nav id=\"primary-navigation\" class=\"site-navigation primary-navigation\">\n  <!-- The menu will be rendered directly here -->\n</nav>\n```\nIn summary, the header markup of the Twenty Fourteen theme has been restructured and refined compared to Twenty Thirteen. The changes include a new header layout with improved organization, simplified site title markup, the addition of a search toggle button, a separate search form container, and a streamlined primary navigation structure. These modifications aim to enhance the user experience, improve design aesthetics, and simplify customization for developers and website owners.",
