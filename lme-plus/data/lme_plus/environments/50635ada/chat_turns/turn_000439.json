  "content": "Hybrid engines combine a traditional internal combustion engine with an electric motor and a battery pack. The engine and motor work together to power the car, with the battery pack providing additional power when needed. When the car is stopped or moving slowly, the engine can turn off and the motor can power the vehicle, resulting in lower fuel consumption and emissions. Hybrid engines also use regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack.\n\nElectric engines, on the other hand, use only electricity to power the car. They are designed with a large battery pack that can be charged by plugging into an electric outlet or using a charging station. The electric motor converts the stored energy in the battery into motion to power the car. Electric engines don't have an internal combustion engine and do not produce any emissions, making them more environmentally friendly. However, they do have limited range due to the battery's capacity and require longer charging times compared to refueling a traditional gasoline vehicle.",
