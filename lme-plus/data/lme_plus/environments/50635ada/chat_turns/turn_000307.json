  "content": "The \"aunties\" gave Jing-mei $1,200 in an envelope as a gift for her trip to China to meet her half-sisters. The gift is a symbol of their love and support for Jing-mei and a way for them to help her on her journey. The aunties wanted Jing-mei to have a memorable and meaningful experience in China and hoped that the gift would help her connect with her roots and understand her mother's past. The gift is also a reminder of the sacrifices the aunties made in their own lives and the importance they place on family and cultural heritage. In this way, the gift represents not only financial support, but also emotional and spiritual support, as Jing-mei embarks on a journey of self-discovery and cultural connection.",
