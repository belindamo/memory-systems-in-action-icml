  "content": "In the \"Rice Husband\" chapter of \"The Joy Luck Club,\" Lena's mother, Ying-ying, notices that the mirror in Lena's bedroom is broken and asks Lena why she hasn't replaced it. Lena responds that she and her husband, Harold, have agreed not to fix it because they are afraid of what might happen if they do. Ying-ying interprets the broken mirror as a symbol of the dysfunction and lack of communication in Lena's marriage. She believes that Lena and Harold are afraid to confront their problems directly and that they are avoiding the difficult conversations that are necessary for their relationship to thrive. By drawing attention to the broken mirror, Ying-ying encourages Lena to confront the issues in her marriage and to take action to repair the damage that has been done. In this way, the broken mirror serves as a metaphor for the challenges and opportunities for growth that exist in Lena's marriage.",
