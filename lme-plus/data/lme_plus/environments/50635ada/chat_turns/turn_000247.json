  "content": "Yes, Liszt had a great admiration for many of Schubert's works, but his favorite piece by Schubert was likely the song cycle \"Winterreise.\" Liszt arranged several of these songs for piano and performed them throughout his career. In fact, Liszt once called \"Winterreise\" a work \"for which gratitude and devotion will never suffice.\" He considered it a masterpiece of German Romanticism, and its influence can be heard in many of Liszt's own compositions.",
