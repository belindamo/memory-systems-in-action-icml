  "content": "Yes, there were conflicts between the Visigothic church and the Catholic church. The Visigothic church was initially Arian Christian, whereas the native Hispano-Romans were largely Catholic Christians. The Catholic church saw the Visigothic church as heretical due to its rejection of the Nicene Creed, which defined Catholic beliefs.\n\nThe Visigothic kings wished to unify their subjects under a single form of Christianity and gradually converted to Catholicism. The Catholic church saw the conversion as an opportunity to reunite the Visigoths with the Great Church and invested heavily in missionary work to convert the Visigothic population.\n\nDespite conversions, tensions between the two churches persisted, and during the reign of King Reccared I, a Church council was held in Toledo in 589 to formally reunite the Visigoths with the Catholic Church.\n\nThe council passed several decrees that established the Catholic Church as the official religion of the Visigothic Kingdom, abolished the Arian faith, and mandated the baptism of all Visigothic subjects. The council also condemned and suppressed any form of dissent or heresy.\n\nAlthough the union of the two churches was official, tensions between Catholics and Visigoths continued as Visigoths remained in power within the church hierarchy. Nonetheless, the Church council of Toledo in 589 marked an important moment that helped to consolidate Catholicism's position as the dominant religion in Visigothic Spain.",
