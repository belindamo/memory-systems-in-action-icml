Here's an estimate of the taxes and fees you might expect to pay for a one-way economy ticket from DC to LA on United Airlines:\n\n**Taxes and Fees:**\n\n* **Federal Excise Tax**: $2.50 (per segment) = $2.50 (since it's a non-stop flight)\n* **Passenger Facility Charge**: $4.50 (per segment) = $4.50\n* **Segment Tax**: $3.90 (per segment) = $3.90\n* **Security Fee**: $5.60 (one-way) = $5.60\n* **California Flight Departure Tax**: $3.00 (per segment) = $3.00\n\n**Total Estimated Taxes and Fees:** $19.50\n\nKeep in mind that these amounts are subject to change, and you may be charged slightly more or less depending on the specific flight and travel dates.\n\n**Additional Fees (if applicable):**\n\n* **Close-in booking fee**: If you book your award ticket within 21 days of departure, United may charge a close-in booking fee of $75.\n* **Phone booking fee**: If you book your award ticket over the phone with a United representative, you may be charged a phone booking fee of $25.\n\nTo get an exact estimate of the taxes and fees, I recommend:\n\n1.

The estimated taxes and fees will be displayed before you confirm your booking.\n\nRemember to factor these costs into your travel budget, as they'll be in addition to the miles you're redeeming for the award ticket.",
