Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through it:\n\n**Step 1: Log in to your Chase account**\n\n* Go to the Chase website ([www.chase.com](http://www.chase.com)) and log in to your account using your username and password.\n* Make sure you have a Chase credit card that earns Ultimate Rewards points, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred, Chase Sapphire Reserve, or Chase Ink Preferred.\n\n**Step 2: Access the Ultimate Rewards portal**\n\n* Once logged in, click on the \"Ultimate Rewards\" tab at the top of the page.\n* This will take you to the Ultimate Rewards portal, where you can view your points balance and redeem points for travel, cash back, or other rewards.\n\n**Step 3: Select \"Transfer to Travel Partners\"**\n\n* In the Ultimate Rewards portal, click on \"Use Points\" and then select \"Transfer to Travel Partners\" from the dropdown menu.\n* This will display a list of Chase's airline and hotel transfer partners, including United Airlines.\n\n**Step 4: Select United Airlines as the transfer partner**\n\n* Click on \"United Airlines\" from the list of transfer partners.\n* You'll be redirected to a page that confirms the transfer details, including the transfer ratio (1:1, in this case).\n\n**Step 5: Enter your United MileagePlus account information**\n\n* Enter your United Airlines MileagePlus account number and last name to link your accounts.\n* If you've transferred points to United before, your account information might be saved. If not, you'll need to enter it manually.\n\n**Step 6: Specify the transfer amount**\n\n* Enter the number of Ultimate Rewards points you want to transfer to your United MileagePlus account.\n* You can transfer points in increments of 1,000, with a minimum transfer of 1,000 points.\n\n**Step 7: Review and confirm the transfer**\n\n* Review the transfer details, including the number of points being transferred and the recipient MileagePlus account.\n* If everything is correct, click \"Confirm\" to initiate the transfer.\n\n**Step 8: Wait for the transfer to process**\n\n* The transfer process is usually instantaneous, but it may take up to 24 hours for the points to appear in your United MileagePlus account.\n* You'll receive an email confirmation from Chase once the transfer is complete.\n\nThat's it! Your Chase Ultimate Rewards points should now be transferred to your United MileagePlus account, ready to be used for your flight to LA.",
