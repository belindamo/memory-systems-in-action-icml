  "content": "Ah, I see what you're asking now! Here are some questions that students can ask themselves or their instructors when seeking feedback on an outline or paper:\n\n1. Does my thesis statement clearly express the main argument or point of my paper? Is it specific and focused enough to guide the rest of my outline or paper?\n2. Are my topic sentences clear and concise, and do they effectively support my thesis statement? Do they use specific examples or evidence to support my claims?\n3. Have I included enough evidence to support my claims, and is that evidence clearly and effectively presented in my outline or paper?\n4. Have I identified and addressed any potential counterarguments or opposing viewpoints, and have I effectively refuted those arguments in my outline or paper?\n5. Is the structure of my outline or paper logical and easy to follow? Does it effectively present my argument in a clear and compelling way?\n6. Have I considered the needs and expectations of my audience, and have I tailored my argument and evidence to address those needs and expectations?\n\nBy asking these kinds of questions, students can identify potential weaknesses or areas for improvement in their outline or paper, and can work to develop a more focused and effective argument that will resonate with their intended readers.",
