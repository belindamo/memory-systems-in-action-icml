Have you noticed any specific symptoms or patterns when the laptop is running slow? For example, is it:\n\n1. Taking a long time to boot up or shut down?\n2. Slowing down when running multiple applications simultaneously?\n3. Experiencing lag or freezing during specific tasks, such as video editing or gaming?\n4. Producing excessive heat or fan noise?\n\nAlso, can you tell me more about the RAM upgrade? What type and amount of RAM did you install, and did you follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation?\n\nAs for the new mouse, it's unlikely that it's causing the performance issues, but I'll keep it in mind as we troubleshoot.\n\nLastly, have you made any other changes to your laptop recently, such as installing new software or drivers, or updating your operating system?\n\nLet's start with these questions, and we can go from there to identify the root cause of the performance issues!",
