I'd be happy to help you find the best deals on round-trip tickets with United Airlines.\n\nTo get started, can you please provide me with some more details?\n\n1. **Travel dates**: Are your travel dates flexible or do you have specific dates in mind? If you have flexibility, I can suggest cheaper days to fly.\n2. **Departure city**: Where are you flying from?\n3. **Class of service**: Are you looking for Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First Class tickets?\n4. **Any loyalty programs or credit cards**: Do you have a United Airlines MileagePlus account or a credit card that offers rewards or discounts with United?\n5. **Budget**: What's your maximum budget for the round-trip ticket?\n\nWith this information, I can provide you with more tailored suggestions on finding the best deals on United Airlines round-trip tickets to San Francisco.\n\nAdditionally, I can also offer some general tips to help you snag a better deal:\n\n* Be flexible with your travel dates, as prices can vary depending on the day of the week and time of year.\n* Consider flying into San Francisco International Airport (SFO) instead of Oakland International Airport (OAK) or San Jose International Airport (SJC), as SFO tends to have more flight options and potentially better deals.\n* Look for error fares, sales, or special promotions on United's website or through their mobile app.\n* Use fare comparison tools like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak to compare prices across different airlines and find the best deals.\n* If you're a student, senior, or military personnel, you may be eligible for discounted fares.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you!",
