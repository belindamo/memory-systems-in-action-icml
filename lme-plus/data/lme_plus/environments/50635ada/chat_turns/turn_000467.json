However, I can guide you on how to do it yourself:\n\n1. **United's Fare Alert**: On United's website, go to the \"Deals\" section and click on \"Fare Alerts.\" Enter your travel dates, route, and preferred fare type (in this case, Economy). You'll receive email notifications when the fare drops.\n2. **Google Flights**: On Google Flights, enter your travel dates and route. Click on the \"Track prices\" button, and you'll receive email notifications when the fare changes.\n3. **Skyscanner**: On Skyscanner, enter your travel dates and route. Click on the \"Get price alerts\" button, and you'll receive email notifications when the fare drops.\n\nAs for earning enough miles to upgrade to Premier Platinum status, it requires a significant amount of flying. Here are the requirements:\n\n* **Premier Platinum**: 75,000 Premier Qualifying Miles (PQMs) or 90 Premier Qualifying Segments (PQSs) within a calendar year.\n\nTo give you an idea of how long it takes to earn enough miles, here are some estimates:\n\n* **Average flight**: 2,465 miles (like your IAD to SFO flight)\n* **Monthly flights**: If you fly 2-3 times a month, you'll earn around 4,930 - 7,395 miles per month.\n* **Time to reach Premier Platinum**: Assuming you fly 2-3 times a month, it would take around 10-15 months to reach 75,000 PQMs.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and your actual mileage earning will depend on your flight frequency, routes, and fare types.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
