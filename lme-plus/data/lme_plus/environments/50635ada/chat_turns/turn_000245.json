  "content": "Yes, Schubert had a significant impact on Liszt's musical career. Liszt was a great admirer of Schubert's music and often performed his compositions. In fact, Liszt arranged many of Schubert's lieder for piano, which helped to popularize the songs beyond the vocal genre. Additionally, Schubert's use of melody and harmony influenced Liszt's own compositions and approach to musical structure.\n\nAs for vice versa, it is unclear if Schubert had any direct impact on Liszt's career since Schubert passed away before Liszt began his own musical career. However, it is possible that Schubert's legacy and influence on the broader musical world may have played a role in shaping Liszt's musical education and interests.",
