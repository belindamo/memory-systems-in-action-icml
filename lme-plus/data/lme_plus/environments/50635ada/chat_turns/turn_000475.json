  "content": "Basketball coaches typically have a set plan or game strategy before each game, but they also adjust their plans based on how the game is going. Coaches will prepare game plans based on their team's strengths and weaknesses and their opponent's strengths and weaknesses. They will also plan on how to best match up against their opponents.\n\nHowever, during the game, coaches will look for weaknesses or tendencies in their opponents' play and adjust their game plan accordingly. They may also adjust their game plan if their team is struggling in certain areas. Additionally, coaches may adjust their lineups or substitute players based on how the game is unfolding.\n\nIn summary, the best coaches have a game plan in place before the game, but they are also adaptable and able to adjust that plan depending on how the game is going.",
