They also provide a great backdrop for adding pops of color or pattern through accessories or other layers.\n\nBohemian styles can be a lot of fun, but it's great that you're aware of not wanting to overdo it. A little bit of fringe or tassel detail can add a lot of interest to an outfit, but too much can make it look try-hard or trendy.\n\nHere are a few tips for incorporating bohemian elements into your outfits while still keeping them classic and timeless:\n\n1. **Start with one statement piece**: Choose one item with a bohemian element, like a cardigan with fringe or a kimono with tassels, and pair it with more classic, timeless pieces.\n2. **Balance volume and texture**: If you're wearing a flowy, voluminous piece like a maxi cardigan or kimono, balance it out with a more fitted top or bottom.\n3. **Mix with clean-lined pieces**: Pair bohemian-inspired pieces with clean-lined, classic pieces like a simple white tee or a pair of dark wash jeans.\n4. **Add a pop of color**: Add a pop of color with a scarf, hat, or shoes to add interest to your outfit without overwhelming it with too much pattern or texture.\n5. **Keep the rest of the outfit simple**: If you're wearing a statement piece with a lot of detail, keep the rest of the outfit simple and understated to let the statement piece shine.\n\nSome great brands to check out for bohemian-inspired pieces with a classic twist include:\n\n1. **Free People**: Free People is a great destination for bohemian-inspired pieces, but they also have a range of more classic, timeless pieces.\n2. **Madewell**: Madewell has a great selection of bohemian-inspired pieces with a more classic twist, like cardigans with subtle fringe or kimonos with simple tassel details.\n3. **J.Crew**: J.Crew has a range of bohemian-inspired pieces, but they're often done in a more classic, timeless way, like a flowy maxi dress with a simple neckline.\n\nDo you have a favorite way of accessorizing your outfits, or are you looking for some new ideas?",
