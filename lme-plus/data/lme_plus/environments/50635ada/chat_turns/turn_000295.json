The Joy Luck Club in Kweilin was formed by the mothers before they immigrated to the United States, and the one in San Francisco was formed after their arrival in the US. These clubs served as a source of comfort, support, and friendship for the women, helping them to maintain a connection to their Chinese heritage in a new and foreign land.",
