  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific products or inventory at Tractor Supply Co. or any other store. But I can suggest some general tips that might be helpful:\n\n1. Look for products labeled as \"natural\" or \"organic\": Many fly sprays on the market are labeled as natural or organic, which might indicate that they use gentler ingredients.\n2. Check the ingredient list: When browsing online or in-store, take a closer look at the ingredient list. Avoid products with harsh chemicals, artificial fragrances, or dyes that might irritate Comet's skin.\n3. Consider pyrethrin-based products: Pyrethrin is a natural insecticide derived from chrysanthemum flowers. It's often used in fly sprays and can be a gentler alternative to synthetic chemicals.\n4. Consult with your veterinarian: Your veterinarian might have recommendations for fly sprays that are safe and gentle on Comet's skin. They can also provide guidance on how to manage fly control for your horse.\n\nRemember to always read product labels carefully and follow instructions for use. It's also a good idea to do a patch test on Comet's skin before using a new fly spray to ensure they don't have any adverse reactions.",
