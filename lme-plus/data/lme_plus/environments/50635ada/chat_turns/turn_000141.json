  "content": "Maasai traditional crafts have evolved over time, with modern influences beginning to creep into their craftsmanship. While many Maasai people still maintain their traditional way of life, others have become more connected to the modern world.\n\nOne significant impact on Maasai crafts has been the increased availability of new materials in recent years. For example, many Maasai women now incorporate plastic beads into their jewelry, as they are cheaper and more readily available than traditional glass beads. Some Maasai crafts have also incorporated synthetic dyes and yarn, which have widened their color palette.\n\nAdditionally, there has been an increasing demand for Maasai crafts in the global market, which has led to some Maasai artisans adapting their traditional crafts to fit the tastes and preferences of the global audience. This has resulted in Maasai crafts being produced with designs and styles that are a fusion of traditional patterns and contemporary styles.\n\nDespite the modern influences, many Maasai people still maintain their traditional crafts and techniques, which have been passed down through generations. Maasai crafts remain an essential part of their culture, and they still hold spiritual and cultural significance.",
