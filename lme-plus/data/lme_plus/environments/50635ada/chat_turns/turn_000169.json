  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific store hours or locations. But I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you need:\n\n1. Check the Tractor Supply Co. website: You can visit the Tractor Supply Co. website and use their store locator feature to find the hours of operation for your local store.\n2. Call the store directly: You can call the Tractor Supply Co. store near you to ask about their hours of operation on Thursdays.\n3. Check their social media or online directory listings: You can also check Tractor Supply Co.'s social media pages or online directory listings like Google Maps to see if they have posted their hours of operation.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're taking good care of your goats! Cleaning their enclosure and providing fresh bedding is important for their health and well-being. I hope you're able to get the organic feed you need and that your goats continue to thrive.",
