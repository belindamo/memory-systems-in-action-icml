Here are a few scenarios:\n\n1. **Functional item**: If your coworker is a coffee or tea lover, they might use the mug regularly in their new office. A customized mug can add a personal touch to their workspace and make their daily routine more enjoyable.\n2. **Keepsake**: Even if your coworker doesn't use the mug daily, they might still appreciate it as a keepsake or memento from their time at your company. They could display it on their desk or shelf as a reminder of their past colleagues and experiences.\n3. **Hybrid**: Your coworker might use the mug occasionally, but also keep it as a reminder of your friendship and appreciation. They might bring it out for special occasions or when they need a pick-me-up.\n\nTo make the mug more likely to be used in their new job, you could consider adding a message or design that's:\n\n* Professional and neutral, avoiding company-specific logos or inside jokes.\n* Inspirational or motivational, providing a daily dose of encouragement.\n* Humorous or lighthearted, adding a touch of personality to their workspace.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want the mug to be more of a keepsake, you could focus on:\n\n* A heartfelt message or inside joke that's specific to your working relationship.\n* A photo or memory that's unique to your time together.\n* A design that's more sentimental or nostalgic, celebrating your coworker's time at the company.\n\nUltimately, the mug's purpose will depend on your coworker's personal preferences and work style. But with a thoughtful design and message, it's sure to be appreciated and cherished, regardless of how they choose to use it!",
