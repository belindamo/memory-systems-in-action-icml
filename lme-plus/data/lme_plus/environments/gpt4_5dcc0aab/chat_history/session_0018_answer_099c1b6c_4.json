I'm planning a trip to the mountains next month and I've narrowed it down to either the Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof or the Keen Targhee II Mid WP. Do you have any information on how they compare in terms of waterproofing and ankle support? By the way, I've been thinking about my shoe maintenance too - I also need to remember to take my brown leather dress shoes to the cobbler to get them polished and conditioned.",

      "content": "Choosing the right hiking boots is crucial for a comfortable and safe trip to the mountains. Both the Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof and the Keen Targhee II Mid WP are excellent options, but they do have some differences in terms of waterproofing and ankle support.\n\n**Waterproofing:**\n\nBoth boots feature a waterproof membrane, but they use different technologies:\n\n* Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof: Uses Gore-Tex technology, which is a well-known and trusted waterproof and breathable membrane. Gore-Tex is highly effective at keeping water out while allowing moisture to escape, preventing blisters and discomfort.\n* Keen Targhee II Mid WP: Features Keen.Dry technology, which is also a waterproof and breathable membrane. While it's not as widely recognized as Gore-Tex, Keen.Dry has received positive reviews for its performance in wet conditions.\n\nBoth boots are designed to keep your feet dry in wet conditions, but the Gore-Tex technology in the Merrell Moab 2 might have a slight edge in terms of durability and reliability.\n\n**Ankle Support:**\n\nBoth boots offer good ankle support, but they have slightly different designs:\n\n* Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof: Has a more substantial and sturdy ankle collar, which provides excellent support and protection from twists and rolls. The boot's mid-cut design also helps to prevent debris from entering the boot.\n* Keen Targhee II Mid WP: Has a slightly more flexible ankle collar, which allows for a bit more mobility and comfort. While it still provides good ankle support, it might not be as robust as the Merrell Moab 2.\n\nIf you prioritize ankle support and stability, the Merrell Moab 2 might be the better choice. However, if you prefer a more comfortable and flexible fit, the Keen Targhee II could be the way to go.\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n* Weight: The Merrell Moab 2 is slightly heavier than the Keen Targhee II.\n* Fit: Both boots are known for their comfortable fits, but the Merrell Moab 2 tends to run a bit narrower than the Keen Targhee II.\n* Traction: Both boots feature aggressive tread patterns, but the Merrell Moab 2 has a slightly more rugged design.\n\nAs for your brown leather dress shoes, it's great that you're thinking about maintenance! Regular polishing and conditioning can extend the life of your shoes and keep them looking their best. Be sure to take them to a reputable cobbler who can provide the right care and attention.\n\nUltimately, the choice between the Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof and the Keen Targhee II Mid WP will depend on your personal preferences and priorities. If you want a more substantial, supportive boot with excellent waterproofing, the Merrell Moab 2 might be the better choice. If you prefer a more comfortable, flexible fit with still-good waterproofing, the Keen Targhee II could be the way to go.",

      "content": "**Weight:**\n\nThe Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof is slightly heavier than the Keen Targhee II Mid WP. Here are the approximate weights for each boot:\n\n* Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof: 2 lbs 1 oz (935g) per pair (men's size 9)\n* Keen Targhee II Mid WP: 1 lb 13 oz (820g) per pair (men's size 9)\n\nThe weight difference is about 4 oz (115g) per pair, which may not be significant for everyone. However, if you're planning a multi-day backpacking trip or prefer a lighter boot, the Keen Targhee II might be a better fit.\n\n**Fit:**\n\nBoth boots are known for their comfortable fits, but they do have some differences:\n\n* **Width:** The Merrell Moab 2 tends to run a bit narrower than the Keen Targhee II. If you have wider feet, you might find the Keen Targhee II more comfortable.\n* **Length:** Both boots have a similar length profile, but the Merrell Moab 2 has a slightly more snug heel fit to prevent slipping.\n* **Toe box:** The Merrell Moab 2 has a slightly more spacious toe box, which can be beneficial for hikers with larger toes or those who prefer a bit more room.\n* **Ankle fit:** As I mentioned earlier, the Merrell Moab 2 has a more substantial ankle collar, which provides excellent support and protection. The Keen Targhee II has a slightly more flexible ankle collar, which allows for a bit more mobility.\n\nIn terms of fit, the Merrell Moab 2 is often described as a more \"performance-oriented\" boot, while the Keen Targhee II is considered a bit more \"relaxed\" or \"comfort-focused.\" If you prefer a more snug, supportive fit, the Merrell Moab 2 might be the better choice. If you prefer a bit more room and comfort, the Keen Targhee II could be the way to go.\n\n**Break-in period:**\n\nBoth boots require a break-in period to mold to your feet. The Merrell Moab 2 might require a slightly longer break-in period due to its more substantial construction and stiffer materials. However, many hikers have reported that both boots are comfortable right out of the box, with only minor adjustments needed during the break-in period.\n\nI hope this helps you make a more informed decision!",
