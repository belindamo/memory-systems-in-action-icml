I do that all the time.\"\n3. Worm: \"No, I mean...don't...don't hurt yourself.\"\n4. Sarah: \"Hurt myself? Why would I want to do that? I'm invincible, remember?\"\n5. Worm: \"Invincible? I don't think that's how it works.\"\n6. Sarah: \"How does it work then? Tell me, worm. You seem to know so much.\"\n7. Worm: \"I know some things, but not everything. I just don't want to see you get hurt.\"\n8. Sarah: \"Hurt? Ha! I've been hurt. I've been broken. I've been destroyed. And I'm still here.\"\n9. Worm: \"But you're not here. Not really. You're in a dangerous place, Sarah.\"\n10. Sarah: \"Dangerous? No, this is the only place I can be myself. The real world is a prison, but here, I can be free.\"",
