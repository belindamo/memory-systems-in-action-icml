  "content": "When the Teacher's followers asked for sacred texts and great works of the past that they could rely on as guides for interpreting his teachings, the Teacher smiled and said, \"The greatest texts are not the ones that have been written, but the ones that are being written now.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that while there were certainly many valuable texts from the past, the world was constantly changing, and new challenges required new insights and approaches. \"Rather than relying solely on the wisdom of the past,\" he said, \"we must also be open to new ideas and new sources of inspiration.\"\n\nThe Teacher encouraged his followers to look to a variety of sources for guidance, including literature, science, philosophy, and art. He emphasized that the key was not to blindly accept any one perspective, but to engage in a process of ongoing exploration and inquiry.\n\nIn this way, the Teacher's teachings continued to evolve and adapt to the changing world, as his followers drew inspiration from a wide range of sources and worked to apply his ideas to new challenges and contexts.",
