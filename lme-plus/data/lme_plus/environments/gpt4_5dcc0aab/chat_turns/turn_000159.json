  "content": "The worm's backstory could be that it was once a mortal who entered the Labyrinth and was eventually transformed into its current form by Jareth as a punishment for disobeying him. Over time, the worm has become disillusioned with Jareth's rule and seeks to overthrow him and take control of the Labyrinth.\n\nAlternatively, the worm could be a loyal servant of Jareth who has been tasked with delivering the self-referential book to each generation's Sarah. However, as it witnesses the suffering that Jareth's pursuit of Sarah causes, the worm begins to question its loyalty and ultimately decides to betray Jareth by giving Sarah the clues she needs to defeat him.\n\nIn either case, the worm's backstory could add depth and complexity to its character and motivations, making its eventual betrayal of Jareth all the more impactful.",
