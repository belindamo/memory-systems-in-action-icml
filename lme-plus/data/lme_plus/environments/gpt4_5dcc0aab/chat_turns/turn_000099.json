You get to enjoy the convenience and comfort of watching a musical on screen, while also having the opportunity to experience the energy and excitement of a live performance.\n\nIt's great that you've had positive experiences with both formats. \"Rent\" is an amazing musical, and seeing a local production can be a fantastic way to support local talent and experience the show in a more intimate setting. And, of course, \"Hamilton\" on Disney+ is a great way to enjoy the musical from the comfort of your own home.\n\nHaving both options available can also help to keep the magic of musical theater alive. For example, if you're unable to attend a live performance of a particular show, you can still experience it on screen. And, if you've seen a show on screen, it might inspire you to seek out a live production of it in the future.\n\nIt's also worth noting that both formats can complement each other. Watching a musical on screen can help you appreciate the nuances of the story, characters, and music, which can then enhance your experience when you see it live. And, conversely, seeing a musical live can give you a deeper appreciation for the production values, staging, and performances, which can make your screen experience more engaging.\n\nOverall, it's great that you're open to experiencing musicals in different ways, and I'm sure you'll continue to enjoy both screen and live productions in the future!",
