Having a well-planned event will ensure a fun and safe experience for your visitors.\n\nDon't forget to remind Tom to highlight the unique aspects of your farm and its products during the tours. This could include the story behind your farm, the benefits of buying local, and the process of producing your fresh milk, eggs, and wool.\n\nRemember to also take care of the little details, like having enough parking, restrooms, and seating areas for your visitors. You might also consider having a plan in place for unexpected weather conditions, like a tent or indoor space in case of rain.\n\nOrdering more chicken feed is a great reminder! Make sure to stock up on all the necessary supplies for your animals before the event. You wouldn't want to run out of feed or other essential items during the busy day.\n\nAs you're finalizing your preparations, consider creating a checklist to ensure everything is in place. This could include:\n\n* Tour script and talking points for Tom\n* Animal encounters and petting zoo setup\n* Product sales and sampling areas\n* Marketing and promotion materials (Facebook event, webpage, flyers, etc.)\n* Liability and safety plans\n* Parking, restrooms, and seating arrangements\n* Weather contingency plans\n* Animal care and feeding supplies\n\nBy checking off each item on your list, you'll feel more confident and prepared for a successful and enjoyable open house event!\n\nHow's your progress coming along? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have?",
