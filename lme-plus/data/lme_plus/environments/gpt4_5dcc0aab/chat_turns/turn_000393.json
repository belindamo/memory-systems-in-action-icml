  "content": "**Ankle Support:** You're right to prioritize ankle support, especially if you'll be tackling rough terrain. The Keen Targhee II Mid WP's higher collar and more substantial ankle support will provide additional stability and protection for your ankles.\n\n**Keen.Dry Membrane:** The Keen.Dry membrane is a proprietary waterproof and breathable technology developed by Keen. It's designed to provide a high level of waterproofness while allowing moisture to escape, preventing blisters and discomfort. Keen.Dry is a hydrophilic (water-loving) membrane that attracts and absorbs water molecules, allowing them to pass through the membrane while keeping larger water droplets out.\n\n**Comparison to Gore-Tex:** Gore-Tex is a well-known and respected waterproof and breathable technology used in many outdoor products. While both Keen.Dry and Gore-Tex are designed to provide waterproofness and breathability, there are some differences:\n\n1. **Waterproofness:** Both membranes are highly waterproof, but Gore-Tex is generally considered to be more waterproof, with a higher water column rating (28,000 mm vs. Keen.Dry's 10,000 mm). This means Gore-Tex can withstand more intense water pressure before water starts to penetrate.\n2. **Breathability:** Keen.Dry is often considered more breathable than Gore-Tex, which can make it a better choice for high-intensity activities or warmer weather. However, this increased breathability might come at the cost of slightly reduced waterproofness.\n3. **Durability:** Gore-Tex is known for its exceptional durability and resistance to abrasion, while Keen.Dry is also durable but might be more prone to scratches or damage.\n4. **Moisture Transfer:** Keen.Dry is designed to transfer moisture more quickly than Gore-Tex, which can help reduce blisters and discomfort.\n\n**In Summary:** Both Keen.Dry and Gore-Tex are high-quality waterproof and breathable membranes. While Gore-Tex is more waterproof and durable, Keen.Dry is more breathable and might be a better choice for high-intensity activities or warmer weather. If you prioritize ultimate waterproofness and durability, Gore-Tex might be the better choice. If you prefer a more breathable membrane with excellent waterproofness, Keen.Dry is a great option.\n\nConsidering your priority on ankle support, the Keen Targhee II Mid WP with its Keen.Dry membrane might be an excellent choice for you. However, if you're willing to compromise on ankle support for a more waterproof and durable membrane, the Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof with Gore-Tex might be the better option.",
