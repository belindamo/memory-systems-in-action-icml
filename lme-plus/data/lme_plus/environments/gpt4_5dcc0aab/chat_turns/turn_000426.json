  "content": "I think I'll explore the concept of karma more in relation to my astrological influences. I've always been interested in the idea that our actions have consequences, and I think understanding my birth chart can help me recognize patterns of behavior that may be driven by past karma.\n\nAlso, I want to learn more about the Five Skandhas and how they relate to my astrological influences. I think this could help me better understand how my Scorpio rising sign affects my perception and mental formations, and how I can work with those energies in my meditation practice.\n\nDo you have any book recommendations on the Five Skandhas or karma in relation to astrology?",
