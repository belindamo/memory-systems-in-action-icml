I had a really thought-provoking conversation with my best friend Rachel, who's been practicing Buddhism for a few years now, about two weeks ago. She shared some valuable insights with me, and I'm curious to explore it further. Can you recommend some beginner-friendly resources or books on Buddhism?",
