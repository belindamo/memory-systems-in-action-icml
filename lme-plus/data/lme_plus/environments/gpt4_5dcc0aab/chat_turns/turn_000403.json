  "content": "Physical therapists and occupational therapists work with patients to help them regain optimal physical and functional capabilities after an injury, illness or surgery. While there is some overlap in the job responsibilities of both professionals, the training and qualifications required for each profession differs.\n\nTraining Required for Physical Therapist:\n\nTo become a physical therapist, a candidate must complete a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree from an accredited physical therapy program, which typically takes three years. A DPT program includes courses in anatomy, physiology, neurology, pharmacology, and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as supervised clinical experience.\n\nQualifications Required for Physical Therapist:\n\nAfter completing the DPT program, a candidate must pass a national licensure examination to get licensed as a physical therapist. Some states may also require additional licensing or certification, depending on the type of services offered.\n\nTraining Required for Occupational Therapist:\n\nTo become an occupational therapist, a candidate must complete a Master of Occupational Therapy (MOT) or Doctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD) from an accredited occupational therapy program, which takes two to three years. A typical MOT or OTD program includes courses in anatomy, physiology, neuroscience, kinesiology, and psychosocial issues, as well as supervised clinical experience.\n\nQualifications Required for Occupational Therapist:\n\nAfter completing the occupational therapy program, a candidate must pass a national licensure examination to get licensed as an occupational therapist. Some states may also require additional licensing or certification, depending on the type of services offered.\n\nComparison:\n\nBoth physical therapists and occupational therapists require advanced education, including a graduate degree, to become licensed practitioners. However, the focus of their training differs. Physical therapists typically focus on improving a patient's movement, balance, and physical abilities. Occupational therapists, on the other hand, focus on helping patients regain their ability to perform their daily activities and achieve independence. Despite these differences, both professions play an important role in rehabilitation and work together towards the common goal of helping patients regain optimal function and quality of life.",
