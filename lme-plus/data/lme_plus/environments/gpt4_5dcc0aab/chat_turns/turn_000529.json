Remember, you can add any other expenses you've had this month, and I'll update the totals accordingly.\n\nBy the way, do you want to separate your non-grocery expenses into categories (e.g., coffee, office supplies, etc.) or keep them all together? Let me know, and I can adjust the tracking accordingly!",
