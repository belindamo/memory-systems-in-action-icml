  "content": "This schedule looks great! I think it's a good balance of cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises. I'm a bit concerned about fitting in the Pilates and yoga videos on Tuesdays and Fridays, since I usually have a lot of work to do on those days. Could I try doing them on Wednesdays instead, and take a rest day on Fridays? Also, can I switch the focus of my bodyweight exercises on Sundays to focus on lower body instead of core?",
