Remember to take breaks and prioritize your tasks, so you don't feel overwhelmed.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that the new water buckets are working out well for the cowshed! It's always satisfying to see new equipment or supplies making a positive impact on your farm.\n\nAs you're getting closer to the event, don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further guidance or advice. I'm here to help. Remember to also take some time to enjoy the experience and interact with your visitors. It's a great opportunity to share your passion for farming and build relationships with your community.\n\nOne more thing to consider: have you thought about having a plan in place for handling sales and payments during the event? You might want to consider having a designated area for sales, with a clear system for processing transactions and handling cash or credit card payments.\n\nKeep up the great work, and I'm sure your open house event will be a huge success!",
