  "content": "The adoption of these advancements in buildings has been increasing over the years, and their implementation has become more widespread than it was in the past. LEDs, for example, have been increasingly used in residential, commercial, and industrial lighting applications. Additionally, lighting controls are becoming more common in new construction projects, and many older buildings are being retrofitted with them. The adoption of smart lighting systems and integrated lighting systems is also on the rise.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in sustainable building design, and many building codes and rating systems now require or incentivize the use of energy-efficient lighting technologies. For example, the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards award points for the use of LED lighting, lighting controls, and daylighting systems. Similarly, the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) requires the installation of occupancy sensors in certain rooms.\n\nOverall, the widespread adoption of these advancements in buildings is still a work in progress, but it is encouraging to see that these technologies are becoming more common as people become more conscious of sustainability and energy efficiency.",
