Categorizing and storing them can be a fun and creative process. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Categorize by trip**: Group souvenirs by trip or destination. This will make it easier to look back on specific memories and relive your travels.\n2. **Use containers and labels**: Use sturdy containers, bins, or boxes to store your souvenirs. Label each container with the destination and the year of the trip. You can also use dividers or smaller boxes within the larger container to separate items further.\n3. **Sort items by type**: Within each trip category, sort items by type, such as:\n\t* Postcards and brochures\n\t* Photos and photo albums\n\t* Small trinkets and knick-knacks\n\t* Clothing and accessories (e.g., scarves, hats, t-shirts)\n\t* Local specialties (e.g., food, spices, wine)\n\t* Artwork or prints\n4. **Consider a shadow box or display case**: If you have larger or more fragile items, like decorative plates, figurines, or ornaments, consider using a shadow box or display case to showcase them. This will allow you to enjoy your souvenirs while keeping them protected.\n5. **Store items in a memory book or scrapbook**: If you have a lot of paper-based souvenirs, like ticket stubs, maps, or receipts, consider creating a memory book or scrapbook. This will help you preserve your memories and make them easier to flip through.\n6. **Keep digital copies**: Take photos of your souvenirs and store them digitally, along with notes about each item. This will help you remember the stories behind each souvenir and make it easier to share them with others.\n7. **Rotate your souvenirs**: If you have limited display space, consider rotating your souvenirs every few months to keep things fresh and interesting.\n8. **Let go of duplicates or items that no longer bring joy**: Be honest with yourself \u2013 if you have multiple items that serve the same purpose or no longer bring you joy, consider letting them go. This will help you declutter your space and focus on the souvenirs that truly matter.\n\nFor your Paris trip souvenirs, you might consider creating a special section or container dedicated to that trip. You could also create a Paris-themed display or vignette in your home, featuring a few select items that evoke the essence of your trip.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and makes you happy. Happy sorting and storing!",
