Pair your distressed denim with a fun graphic tee that adds a pop of color and playfulness to your outfit.\n2. **Blouses with lace or ruffles**: Add a touch of femininity with a blouse featuring lace or ruffles. This contrast between the rugged jeans and delicate top will create a stylish, edgy look.\n3. **Cropped sweaters or cardigans**: A cropped knit top will highlight your waist and create a chic, effortless outfit. Look for pastel shades or bold colors to add visual interest.\n4. **Flowy peasant tops**: A flowy peasant top with bell sleeves or a relaxed fit will create a bohemian vibe that pairs perfectly with distressed denim.\n5. **Denim jackets or vests**: Why not double down on denim? A denim jacket or vest will add a cool, laid-back touch to your outfit.\n6. **Simple white or black tank tops**: A classic white or black tank will create a clean, minimalist look that lets your distressed denim jeans take center stage.\n\nRemember, the key is to balance the ruggedness of the distressed denim with a top that adds a touch of sophistication or playfulness.
