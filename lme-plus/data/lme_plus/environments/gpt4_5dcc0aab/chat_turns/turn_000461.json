Each Rule element contains one or more Check elements, but the Check elements must be grouped together within the same Rule element.\n\nHowever, you can use multiple Rule elements to group related checks together, and you can use Profile elements to group related Rule elements together. This allows you to organize your checks in a way that makes sense for your needs and to create different profiles for different purposes, such as a \"basic security\" profile and a \"high security\" profile.",
