Here's an example of a team that had a weakness and how the coach addressed it:\n\nThe US women's national soccer team (USWNT) won the World Cup in 2015, but leading up to the tournament they had a significant weakness \u2013 their defense.\n\nThe team had allowed multiple goals in several of their pre-World Cup games, and they knew that they needed to address this weakness if they wanted to have a chance at winning the tournament.\n\nTo address their defensive weakness, the USWNT coach, Jill Ellis, made a couple of significant changes:\n\n1. She switched to a 4-3-3 formation: One of the reasons the team was struggling defensively was due to their formation. The team had been playing a 4-4-2 system which allowed the midfielders to drift forward regularly, leaving the defenders exposed. By changing to a 4-3-3 formation, Ellis provided more defensive support to the backline, which helped to reduce the number of goals conceded.\n\n2. She made personnel changes: Ellis also made several personnel changes that helped to shore up the team's defense. For example, she moved Julie Johnston, who was a center back, to a sweeper position where she could help cover for the other defenders. She also gave Ali Krieger, a right-side defender, more playing time, which helped to add more stability to the backline.\n\nOverall, by making these changes to the team's formation and personnel, Ellis was able to address the team's defensive weakness, which helped them to ultimately win the 2015 World Cup.",
