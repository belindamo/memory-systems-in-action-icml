  "content": "No, XCCDF checklists do not support sub-grouping of checks within a single check. Checks in XCCDF are defined as atomic elements and cannot contain other checks as sub-elements.\n\nHowever, XCCDF provides a way to group related rules into `Profile` elements, which can contain multiple rules. This allows you to create different profiles for different purposes, such as a \"basic security\" profile and a \"high security\" profile, and to organize related rules into profiles in a way that makes sense for your organization's needs.",
