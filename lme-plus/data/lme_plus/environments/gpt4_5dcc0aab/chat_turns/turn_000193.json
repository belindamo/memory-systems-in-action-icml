  "content": "**Weight:**\n\nThe Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof is slightly heavier than the Keen Targhee II Mid WP. Here are the approximate weights for each boot:\n\n* Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof: 2 lbs 1 oz (935g) per pair (men's size 9)\n* Keen Targhee II Mid WP: 1 lb 13 oz (820g) per pair (men's size 9)\n\nThe weight difference is about 4 oz (115g) per pair, which may not be significant for everyone. However, if you're planning a multi-day backpacking trip or prefer a lighter boot, the Keen Targhee II might be a better fit.\n\n**Fit:**\n\nBoth boots are known for their comfortable fits, but they do have some differences:\n\n* **Width:** The Merrell Moab 2 tends to run a bit narrower than the Keen Targhee II. If you have wider feet, you might find the Keen Targhee II more comfortable.\n* **Length:** Both boots have a similar length profile, but the Merrell Moab 2 has a slightly more snug heel fit to prevent slipping.\n* **Toe box:** The Merrell Moab 2 has a slightly more spacious toe box, which can be beneficial for hikers with larger toes or those who prefer a bit more room.\n* **Ankle fit:** As I mentioned earlier, the Merrell Moab 2 has a more substantial ankle collar, which provides excellent support and protection. The Keen Targhee II has a slightly more flexible ankle collar, which allows for a bit more mobility.\n\nIn terms of fit, the Merrell Moab 2 is often described as a more \"performance-oriented\" boot, while the Keen Targhee II is considered a bit more \"relaxed\" or \"comfort-focused.\" If you prefer a more snug, supportive fit, the Merrell Moab 2 might be the better choice. If you prefer a bit more room and comfort, the Keen Targhee II could be the way to go.\n\n**Break-in period:**\n\nBoth boots require a break-in period to mold to your feet. The Merrell Moab 2 might require a slightly longer break-in period due to its more substantial construction and stiffer materials. However, many hikers have reported that both boots are comfortable right out of the box, with only minor adjustments needed during the break-in period.\n\nI hope this helps you make a more informed decision!",
