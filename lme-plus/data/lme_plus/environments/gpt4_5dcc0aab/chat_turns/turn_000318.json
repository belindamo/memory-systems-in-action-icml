  "content": "Some of the specific advancements in electric lighting technology that have had a substantial impact on energy efficiency and sustainability in building design are:\n\n1. LED Lighting: LED lights are some of the most efficient lights available in the market. They use up to 80% less energy and last 25 times longer than incandescent bulbs, making them a far more sustainable option.\n\n2. Lighting Controls: The development of lighting controls such as occupancy sensors, daylight harvesting, and timers have contributed significantly to energy efficiency in lighting. Such controls enable lights to be automatically turned off when they are not needed, reducing energy consumption and increasing sustainability.\n\n3. Smart Lighting Systems: The rise of smart lighting systems that can be controlled remotely via a smartphone or tablet has also had an impact in building design. These systems offer greater energy efficiency as lights can be programmed to switch off automatically when no one is in a room and adjust their brightness based on the amount of natural light available.\n\n4. Integrated Lighting Systems: Integrated lighting systems that combine lighting with other building systems such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) have also had a significant impact on energy efficiency in building design. These systems operate using sensors, which detect occupancy and adjust the lighting and climate accordingly, reducing energy waste.\n\n5. Light Pipes and Solar Tubes: Light pipes and solar tubes are devices that capture daylight from rooftops and transport it down into buildings, providing natural light during the day, reducing the need for artificial lighting and decreasing energy costs.",
