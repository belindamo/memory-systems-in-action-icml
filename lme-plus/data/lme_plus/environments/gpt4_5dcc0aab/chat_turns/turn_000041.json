As a conversational AI, I don't have information about specific local businesses, including Fresh Mart or the boutiques you're planning to visit. It's possible that Fresh Mart is a fictional grocery store or not well-known in your area.\n\nHowever, it's great that you're enthusiastic about exploring local businesses and wanting to share your positive experience with others! If you do ask the boutique owners about Fresh Mart, they might not be familiar with it, but you can still have a great conversation about local businesses and recommendations in general.\n\nYou could ask them about their favorite local spots, hidden gems, or recommendations for other stores, restaurants, or services in the area. This can lead to some great conversations and discoveries, and you might even find some new places to explore!\n\nRemember, the goal is to have a friendly and engaging conversation, so don't worry too much about the specifics. Enjoy your boutique hopping adventure, and who knows, you might stumble upon some amazing local finds!",
