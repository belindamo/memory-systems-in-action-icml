Here's a suggested schedule for the next few weeks:\n\n**Week 1-2:**\n\n* Monday: Spin class (30-45 minutes) + 10-minute bodyweight exercises (focus on upper body)\n* Tuesday: Yoga video (30 minutes, focus on hip opening and flexibility)\n* Wednesday: Rest day or active recovery (e.g., light walk or stretching)\n* Thursday: Spin class (30-45 minutes) + 10-minute bodyweight exercises (focus on lower body)\n* Friday: Pilates video (30 minutes, focus on core and flexibility)\n* Saturday: Rest day or active recovery\n* Sunday: Long, slow cardio (e.g., jogging, cycling, or swimming) + 10-minute stretching\n\n**Week 3-4:**\n\n* Monday: Spin class (30-45 minutes) + 10-minute bodyweight exercises (focus on core)\n* Tuesday: Pilates video (30 minutes, focus on hip and hamstring flexibility)\n* Wednesday: Rest day or active recovery\n* Thursday: Spin class (30-45 minutes) + 10-minute bodyweight exercises (focus on upper body)\n* Friday: Yoga video (30 minutes, focus on hamstring and hip flexor stretching)\n* Saturday: Rest day or active recovery\n* Sunday: Long, slow cardio + 10-minute stretching\n\n**Tips to keep in mind:**\n\n* Start with shorter Pilates and yoga videos (20-30 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable.\n* Listen to your body and rest when needed. If you're feeling fatigued, take an extra rest day or modify the intensity of your workouts.\n* Mix and match the videos and exercises to keep things interesting and prevent plateaus.\n* Make sure to warm up before each workout and cool down afterwards to prevent injuries.\n* Stay hydrated and fuel your body with a balanced diet to support your exercise routine.\n\nRemember, consistency is key. Stick to the schedule as much as possible, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Just get back on track and keep moving forward!\n\nHow does this schedule look to you? Do you have any questions or need further modifications?",
