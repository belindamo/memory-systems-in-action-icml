Start by saying a word related to HR systems, such as \"employee\" or \"payroll\".\n3. The person to your right should then say a word that is associated with the word you just said.\n4. Continue around the circle with each person saying a word that is associated with the previous word.\n5. If someone can't think of a word, they are out of the game.\n6. Keep playing until only one person is left, or until you run out of time.\n\nThis activity helps learners to start thinking about the topic of HR systems and gets them engaged and focused on the subject matter.",
