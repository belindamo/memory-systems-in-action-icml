However, I should let you know that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or keep track of time, so I didn't know you went to an amusement park on May 12th. Nevertheless, I'd be happy to help you with a checklist of things to bring to an amusement park!\n\nHere's a comprehensive list of items you may want to consider packing for a fun-filled day at the amusement park:\n\n**Clothing and Accessories:**\n\n* Comfortable clothing and shoes (dress for the weather)\n* Lightweight, quick-drying clothing (in case you get wet on water rides)\n* Socks and undergarments (you never know when you might need a spare!)\n* Hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen for sun protection\n* Light jacket or sweater (depending on the weather)\n* Swimwear (if you plan to enjoy water rides or attractions)\n* Change of clothes (in case you get soaked or want to change into something dry)\n\n**Personal Care Items:**\n\n* Sunscreen and lip balm with SPF\n* Insect repellent\n* First-aid kit (with essentials like band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers)\n* Prescription medications and any necessary documentation\n* Contact lenses and solution (if applicable)\n* Makeup and makeup remover (if applicable)\n\n**Food and Beverages:**\n\n* Reusable water bottle\n* Snacks (e.g., granola bars, fruit, or trail mix)\n* Lunch and/or money for food purchases\n* Cash or credit cards for food and souvenir purchases\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\n* Tickets or season passes\n* Park map or guide\n* Phone and portable charger\n* Camera and charger (if you plan on taking a lot of photos)\n* Small backpack or bag to carry your belongings\n* Cash for parking, lockers, or other incidentals\n* Small umbrella or rain poncho (if there's a chance of rain)\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Check the amusement park's website for specific rules and restrictions on items you can bring into the park.\n* Consider packing a small, portable charger for your phone, as you'll likely be taking plenty of photos and using your phone's GPS to navigate the park.\n* Wear comfortable shoes and dress in layers, as you'll be doing a lot of walking and may encounter varying temperatures throughout the day.\n* Don't forget to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day!\n\nI hope this checklist helps you prepare for a fun and memorable trip to the amusement park!",
