And, yes, I'll make sure to take care of the liability and safety aspects, like having a plan in place for emergencies and posting clear signs with rules and guidelines. As for the timing and scheduling, I'll make sure to avoid conflicting with peak animal feeding or milking times and stagger the tour start times to prevent overcrowding. For marketing and promotion, I'll create a Facebook event and webpage, and share behind-the-scenes content to build anticipation and excitement. Oh, and I need to order more chicken feed; we're running low.",
