Don't hesitate to ask the staff for their opinions or recommendations, as they often have valuable insights and experience with the products they sell.\n\nBreaking in your new boots gradually, as you mentioned, is crucial to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable hiking experience. Wearing them around the house and taking short walks will help your feet adjust to the new shape, material, and weight of the boots.\n\nAnd, of course, don't forget about your brown leather dress shoes! Taking them to the cobbler this Saturday will ensure they receive the TLC they need to look their best again.\n\nRemember to also take care of your feet during the break-in process. If you experience any discomfort, pain, or blisters, stop and rest. It's better to err on the side of caution and take your time breaking in your boots than to risk injury or discomfort on your trip.\n\nHave a great weekend, and I hope you find the perfect pair of hiking boots and get your dress shoes looking sharp again!",
