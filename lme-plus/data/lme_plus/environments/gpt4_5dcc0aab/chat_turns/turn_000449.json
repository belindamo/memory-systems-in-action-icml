This will give you a much-needed break in the middle of the week and allow you to recharge for the rest of the week. Just make sure to prioritize your work commitments on Tuesdays and Fridays, and try to fit in the videos on Wednesdays when you have a bit more time.\n\n**Bodyweight exercises on Sundays:**\n\nYou can definitely switch the focus of your bodyweight exercises on Sundays to lower body instead of core. In fact, it's a great idea to vary the focus of your bodyweight exercises to ensure overall fitness and prevent plateaus. Just make sure to include a mix of exercises that target different muscle groups, such as:\n\n* Squats, lunges, and leg press for legs\n* Calf raises and ankle mobility exercises for calves and ankles\n* Glute bridges and hip thrusts for glutes\n* Leg raises and side leg lifts for hips and lower back\n\n**Revised schedule:**\n\nHere's the revised schedule:\n\n**Week 1-2:**\n\n* Monday: Spin class (30-45 minutes) + 10-minute bodyweight exercises (focus on upper body)\n* Tuesday: Work-focused day\n* Wednesday: Pilates video (30 minutes, focus on core and flexibility)\n* Thursday: Spin class (30-45 minutes) + 10-minute bodyweight exercises (focus on lower body)\n* Friday: Rest day\n* Saturday: Rest day or active recovery\n* Sunday: Long, slow cardio (e.g., jogging, cycling, or swimming) + 10-minute lower body bodyweight exercises\n\n**Week 3-4:**\n\n* Monday: Spin class (30-45 minutes) + 10-minute bodyweight exercises (focus on core)\n* Tuesday: Work-focused day\n* Wednesday: Yoga video (30 minutes, focus on hip and hamstring flexibility)\n* Thursday: Spin class (30-45 minutes) + 10-minute bodyweight exercises (focus on upper body)\n* Friday: Rest day\n* Saturday: Rest day or active recovery\n* Sunday: Long, slow cardio + 10-minute lower body bodyweight exercises\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust the schedule as needed.
