You can use this template to define your project's vision and goals.\n2. **Gantt Chart Template**: A Gantt chart is a visual representation of your project schedule, showing tasks, dependencies, and timelines. You can use online tools like Microsoft Project, Asana, or Trello to create a Gantt chart.\n3. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Template**: A WBS helps you decompose your project into smaller, manageable tasks. This template will help you create a hierarchical structure of tasks and subtasks.\n4. **Project Schedule Template**: A project schedule template outlines the start and end dates for each task, as well as the resources allocated to each task.
