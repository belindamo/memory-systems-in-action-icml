  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to your skin type or personal skincare routine, so I can't make specific recommendations. However, as a general guideline, it's recommended to use a hydrating face mask like the Laneige Water Sleeping Mask 1-2 times a week or as needed to help maintain moisture balance and promote healthy-looking skin. It's important to not overdo it with face masks, as this can potentially irritate the skin. Always follow the instructions on the product packaging and listen to your skin's needs to determine how often to use the mask.",
