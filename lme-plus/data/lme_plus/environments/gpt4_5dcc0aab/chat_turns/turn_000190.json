  "content": "I'm looking for some advice on choosing a new pair of hiking boots. I'm planning a trip to the mountains next month and I've narrowed it down to either the Merrell Moab 2 Mid Waterproof or the Keen Targhee II Mid WP. Do you have any information on how they compare in terms of waterproofing and ankle support? By the way, I've been thinking about my shoe maintenance too - I also need to remember to take my brown leather dress shoes to the cobbler to get them polished and conditioned.",
