It's also about crafting good stories that can help us navigate the world with curiosity and resilience.\"\n\nHe explained, \"We live in a time when the old stories no longer hold the same power they once did. We need new stories to make sense of the world, stories that can help us imagine a better future and inspire us to work towards it.\"\n\nThe Teacher then offered some advice for crafting stories that foster curiosity and resilience. \"First,\" he said, \"make sure your stories are grounded in reality. Don't rely on fanciful tales or wishful thinking. Instead, look for evidence and explore multiple perspectives. This can help you create a more nuanced and accurate picture of the world.\"\n\n\"Second,\" he continued, \"embrace ambiguity and uncertainty. The world is complex, and there are often no easy answers. By acknowledging this complexity and embracing uncertainty, we can cultivate the curiosity and resilience we need to navigate it.\"\n\n\"Third,\" he added, \"focus on connection and community. We are all in this together, and our stories should reflect that. Rather than promoting division or tribalism, our stories should emphasize our shared humanity and our shared goals.\"\n\nThe followers listened to the Teacher's words, then left the garden feeling inspired to craft stories that would help them navigate the meaning crisis and create a better future.",
