  "content": "I'm thinking of hosting the event on a weekend, probably in late July or early August. The main purpose is to showcase our farm and promote our products, like fresh milk, eggs, and wool. As for attendance, I'm expecting around 50-75 visitors. We already have a small parking area, but we might need to set up some temporary restrooms. I'm thinking of having guided farm tours, and we could have some animal encounters, like petting zoos for kids.",
