  "content": "The Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer are both fragrance-free and shouldn't have a strong scent. The Origins Original Skin Retexturizing Mask with Rose Clay has a subtle rose scent, which comes from the natural rose clay used in the formula - this scent should dissipate shortly after applying the mask. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% doesn't have any added fragrance, but some users have reported a slightly unpleasant metallic scent due to the high concentration of zinc. However, this scent should dissipate quickly and shouldn't be too noticeable.",
