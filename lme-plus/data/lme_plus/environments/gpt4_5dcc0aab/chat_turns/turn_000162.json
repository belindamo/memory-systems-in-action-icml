  "content": "The worm would have to have had a close relationship of some sort with the proto-Sarah and either received the book from her after she succumbed to tragedy, or provided her with key information to put into the book, entrusting her with the necessary secrets and power to overcome Jareth that only someone such as the worm might know. Perhaps the worm had a romantic interest in proto-Sarah, and was even initially responsible for guiding her into the labyrinth, where she meets Jareth. The worm may have had good intentions to help her with Jareth's magic, but becomes jealous at Jareth's skill at seducing proto-Sarah, and begins to demonstrate disloyalty to Jareth out of jealousy, ultimately causing harm to not only himself, but to Sarah in the process, and the secrets and stewardship in the book are the worm's way of atoning for causing harm to the one he loved.",
