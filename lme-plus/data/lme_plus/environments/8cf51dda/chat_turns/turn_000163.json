The government's planning a major strike on one of our supply depots in a few days. We need to act fast to prevent it.\"\n\nMoon's face twisted in concern. \"Do we have any specifics? Where is the depot located?\"\n\nTom shook his head. \"Not yet. But I have someone on the inside working on it. We should know more soon.\"\n\nHemlock crossed his arms, his brow furrowed in thought. \"We'll need to rally the troops and set up some defenses. We can't let them take us by surprise.\"\n\nMoon nodded in agreement. \"I'll get started on coordinating with the others. Let's not waste any time.\"\n\nTom gave them a nod. \"I'll keep working on getting more intel. We'll need all the help we can get.\"\n\nAs Tom left to continue his work, Moon turned to Hemlock. \"We've got a lot of work to do. You ready for this?\"\n\nHemlock smiled confidently. \"Always.
