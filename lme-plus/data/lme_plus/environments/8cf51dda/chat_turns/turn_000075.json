  "content": "Hi!\n\nI'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nIt's totally reasonable to categorize your rent under \"Housing\" rather than \"Living Expenses\". Here's why:\n\n* \"Housing\" typically includes all costs related to your accommodation, such as rent, utilities (if not included in the rent), and other expenses like internet or furniture.\n* \"Living Expenses\" usually cover day-to-day costs like food, transportation, entertainment, and miscellaneous expenses.\n\nSo, in your case, the \u20ac800 monthly rent should definitely go under \"Housing\".\n\nBy the way, \u20ac800 might be a bit steep, but as you mentioned, being in the city center can be worth the extra cost. You'll likely save time and money on transportation, and have access to many amenities and attractions right at your doorstep!\n\nIf you need help with budgeting or have any more questions, feel free to ask!",
