  "content": "Yes, Ray Charles faced backlash for his activism throughout his career. One of the most prominent examples was when he canceled a show in Augusta, Georgia, in 1961 because the venue refused to allow mixed-race audiences. This decision generated a lot of negative press and criticism, and Charles received death threats as a result. However, he stood by his decision and continued to speak out against racism and segregation.\n\nIn an interview with Jet magazine in 1962, Charles said, \"I'm not a crusader, but I am a man who believes in equal rights for all. If I can help to bring about change through my music or my personal convictions, then I will do so without fear or hesitation.\"\n\nDespite the criticism and threats, Charles remained committed to his activism and continued to use his fame and influence to fight for social justice until his death in 2004.",
