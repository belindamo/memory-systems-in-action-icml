  "content": "Excellent choices! Surveys and feedback forms are a great way to gather valuable insights from your new hires. Here are some suggestions to create an effective survey or feedback form:\n\n**1. Keep it concise and focused**: Limit the number of questions to 5-10, and make sure they're clear and concise. You want to gather specific feedback without overwhelming the new hires.\n\n**2. Use a mix of question types**: Include a combination of:\n\t* Multiple-choice questions (e.g., Likert scale, rating scales)\n\t* Open-ended questions (e.g., text fields, essay questions)\n\t* Rating scales (e.g., 1-5, 1-10)\n\n**3. Ask specific and actionable questions**: Instead of asking generic questions like \"How was the training?\", ask specific questions like:\n\t* How engaging did you find the storytelling approach?\n\t* How relevant was the story to your role?\n\t* Did the story help you understand the concept better?\n\t* What did you find most valuable about the storytelling approach?\n\n**4. Use scales and anchors**: Use scales with clear anchors to help new hires provide more accurate and consistent feedback. For example:\n\t* How engaging was the storytelling approach?\n\t\t+ 1 (Not engaging at all) to 5 (Very engaging)\n\t* How relevant was the story to your role?\n\t\t+ 1 (Not relevant at all) to 5 (Very relevant)\n\n**5. Provide an opportunity for open-ended feedback**: Include a text field or essay question to allow new hires to provide additional feedback, suggestions, or comments. This can provide valuable qualitative insights.\n\n**6. Keep it anonymous (optional)**: Consider making the survey anonymous to encourage honest feedback. However, if you want to be able to follow up with new hires or provide personalized feedback, you may want to include an optional field for them to provide their name or contact information.\n\n**7. Pilot-test the survey**: Test the survey with a small group of new hires before distributing it to the larger group. This will help you identify any issues, clarify questions, and make adjustments.\n\n**8. Analyze and act on the feedback**: Once you've collected the feedback, analyze the results, identify trends, and make adjustments to your storytelling approach based on the insights gathered.\n\nHere's an example of a simple survey or feedback form to get you started:\n\n**Storytelling in Training Session Feedback**\n\n**Rating Scales:**\n\n1. How engaging was the storytelling approach?\n\t* 1 (Not engaging at all) to 5 (Very engaging)\n2. How relevant was the story to your role?\n\t* 1 (Not relevant at all) to 5 (Very relevant)\n3. Did the story help you understand the concept better?\n\t* 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Very much so)\n\n**Open-Ended Questions:**\n\n1. What did you find most valuable about the storytelling approach?\n2. What did you find least valuable about the storytelling approach?\n3. Do you have any suggestions for improving the storytelling approach in future training sessions?\n\n**Additional Comments:**\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to share about the storytelling approach or the training session in general?\n\nRemember to keep your survey or feedback form concise, focused, and easy to understand. By doing so, you'll increase the likelihood of getting valuable feedback from your new hires and improving your storytelling approach over time.",
