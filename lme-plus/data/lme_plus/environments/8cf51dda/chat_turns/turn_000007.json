  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Visiting your local art studio where you take sculpting classes is a great way to ask for recommendations and get insider knowledge. The instructors or studio owners likely have connections with local artists and may know of sculptors who create pieces similar to Barbara Hepworth's style.\n\nAs a student at the studio, you already have a connection with the community, and they may be more willing to share information or introduce you to local artists. You can ask questions like:\n\n* Do you know any local sculptors who create abstract or modern pieces similar to Barbara Hepworth's style?\n* Are there any upcoming exhibitions or events featuring local sculptors that I shouldn't miss?\n* Can you recommend any local artists who might be open to commissions or collaborations?\n\nThe studio might also have a network of local artists, and they may be able to connect you with someone who shares your interest in Hepworth's style. Additionally, they may have access to resources, such as local art publications or event listings, that can help you discover new artists.\n\nBefore you visit the studio, you might want to prepare by:\n\n* Bringing some examples of Barbara Hepworth's work or pictures of the pieces that inspired you\n* Being clear about what specifically draws you to Hepworth's style (e.g., the use of materials, forms, or themes)\n* Being open to learning about different artists and styles, as you might discover someone who resonates with you even more\n\nBy asking for recommendations and advice from your local art studio, you'll not only get valuable insights but also show your interest in the local art community. Who knows, you might even discover a new favorite artist or find a collaborator for a future project!",
