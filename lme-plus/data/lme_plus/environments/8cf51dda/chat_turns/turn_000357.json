  "content": "I think I'll start by organizing my photos and creating a rough outline of the story I want to tell. Then, I'll choose a digital scrapbooking tool that fits my needs and start designing my digital album. I might create a separate digital album, but I also like the idea of integrating it with my physical one. Maybe I can create a digital version of the album and then print it out as a keepsake.\n\nI'll definitely take a closer look at the options you mentioned and see which one works best for me. Thanks for the recommendations and tips!",
