  "content": "Great job! Your giraffe interpretation is spot on. You reflected back the underlying needs and feelings behind the jackal language.\n\nTo clarify, the speaker in the jackal statement was likely feeling unheard, and had a need for empathy and understanding. They may have also had a need for consideration and collaboration in decision-making. Your response captured those needs perfectly.\n\nKeep up the good work!
