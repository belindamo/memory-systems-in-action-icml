  "content": "The control plane is the part of a network device that is responsible for making routing and switching decisions. It processes incoming packets and determines the best path for them to take based on the routing table and other information.\n\nSome of the functions of the control plane include:\n\n* Exchanging routing table information: The control plane exchanges routing table information with other network devices using routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).\n* Providing CLI access to the network device: The control plane provides the CLI (Command Line Interface) access to the network device, allowing administrators to configure and manage the device.\n* Constructing a routing table: The control plane constructs the routing table based on the routing protocol and other information. The routing table is used by the data plane to forward packets to the next hop.\n\nThe other answer choice, C, is incorrect because the control plane does not look up an egress interface in the forwarding information base. This is the function of the data plane. The control plane uses the information in the routing table to make routing and switching decisions, and the data plane uses the information in the forwarding information base to forward packets to the egress interface.",
