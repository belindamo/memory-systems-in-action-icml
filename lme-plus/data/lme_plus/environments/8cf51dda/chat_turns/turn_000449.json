The officer wants to understand your ties to your home country and your relationships with your family members. Here are some tips to help you approach these questions:\n\n**Be honest and open**: Share your story and your relationship with your family in a honest and open way. Explain your situation, including how you came to the US, how you've been maintaining relationships with your family, and your plans for the future.\n\n**Highlight your efforts to maintain relationships**: Emphasize the ways you've been staying in touch with your family, such as:\n\n* Regular phone calls or video calls\n* Frequent messaging or emailing\n* Sharing photos or updates on social media\n* Sending care packages or gifts\n\n**Talk about your family's support**: If your family has been supportive of your decision to move to the US, mention that. You can say something like:\n\n* \"My family has been very supportive of my decision to move to the US and start a new life. They're excited to see me build a future here.\"\n* \"My mom is my biggest supporter. She's always encouraged me to pursue my dreams, even if it means living far away.\"\n\n**Mention your plans for your family's visit**: Since you're helping your mom with her visitor visa application, you can mention that you're excited to have her visit you in the US. You can say something like:\n\n* \"I'm really looking forward to having my mom visit me this summer. I've been helping her with her visitor visa application, and I'm excited to show her around the US.\"\n* \"I'm hoping to spend quality time with my mom when she visits. We'll catch up on each other's lives and make some new memories together.\"\n\n**Be prepared for questions about your ties to your home country**: The officer may ask questions about your ties to your home country, such as:\n\n* Do you have any property or assets in your home country?\n* Do you have any plans to return to your home country in the future?\n* How often do you plan to visit your home country?\n\n**Show your commitment to the US**: While it's natural to maintain relationships with your family in your home country, it's also important to show your commitment to building a life in the US. You can say something like:\n\n* \"While I'm proud of my heritage and my family, I'm excited to build a new life in the US with my husband. I'm committed to contributing to this country and making it my home.\"\n* \"I'm grateful for the opportunities the US has given me, and I'm excited to make this country my permanent home.\"\n\nRemember to be sincere and genuine in your answers. The officer wants to understand your story and your relationships, so be open and honest about your experiences. Good luck!",
