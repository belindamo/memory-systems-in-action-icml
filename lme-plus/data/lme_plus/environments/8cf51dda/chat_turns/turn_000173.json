We've also managed to recruit a few more people to our cause.\"\n\nHemlock added, \"We've also been working on improving our weapons and gear. I think we're making good progress there.\"\n\nMoon nodded, \"That's great to hear. I've been reviewing the intel we gathered on the Blackwatch lab. We need to come up with a plan to get inside and destroy it.\"\n\nTom leaned forward, \"I've been thinking about that. We could use the codes we've decrypted to get inside without alerting anyone. Then we could plant some explosives and take out the lab.\"\n\nHemlock nodded in agreement, \"That sounds like a solid plan. We'll need to make sure we have enough manpower and supplies for the mission, though.\"\n\nMoon smiled, \"We can work on that. I'll start reaching out to some of the contacts I've made to see if they're willing to help. And we can start gathering supplies and weapons.\"\n\nThe trio spent the rest of the day discussing their plans and making preparations for the mission. They knew it would be risky, but it was worth it to take down Blackwatch and put a stop to their evil experiments.",
