  "content": "If we use the filtro function with coefficients A=0 and B=ones(10,1)/10 to filter the input signal x, we would expect the output y to start at 1/10 for t=1 and increase by 1/10 for each subsequent time step, as we discussed earlier. Therefore, the first 30 samples of the output y would be:\n\ny(1) = 1/10\ny(2) = 2/10\ny(3) = 3/10\ny(4) = 4/10\ny(5) = 5/10\ny(6) = 6/10\ny(7) = 7/10\ny(8) = 8/10\ny(9) = 9/10\ny(10) = 1\ny(11) = 1.1\ny(12) = 1.2\ny(13) = 1.3\ny(14) = 1.4\ny(15) = 1.5\ny(16) = 1.6\ny(17) = 1.7\ny(18) = 1.8\ny(19) = 1.9\ny(20) = 2\ny(21) = 2.1\ny(22) = 2.2\ny(23) = 2.3\ny(24) = 2.4\ny(25) = 2.5\ny(26) = 2.6\ny(27) = 2.7\ny(28) = 2.8\ny(29) = 2.9\ny(30) = 3\n\nThese values reflect the effect of the filter on the input signal x, which is a square wave of amplitude 1 that switches between -1 and 1 every second. The filter smooths out the transitions between the two levels of the square wave, resulting in a gradually increasing output y that starts at 1/10 and reaches a maximum of 3 after 30 samples.",
