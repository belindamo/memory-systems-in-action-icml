  "content": "Yes, judges also have discretion to depart from sentencing guidelines in cases where unique circumstances are present, such as when the defendant has significant mitigating circumstances or when the crime committed is not fully captured by the severity of the offense level prescribed by the guidelines.\n\nIn such cases, the judge may use their discretion to impose a sentence that is commensurate with the offense committed and the unique circumstances of the case. This discretion allows judges to tailor sentences that best meet the needs of justice and the interests of society.\n\nHowever, judges are expected to provide a clear and sufficient justification for any departure from sentencing guidelines, and their decisions may be subject to review by higher courts or review boards.\n\nOverall, judges are entrusted to exercise their discretion with care and fairness, balancing the need to impose appropriate punishment with the need to account for the unique circumstances of the case and the defendant.",
