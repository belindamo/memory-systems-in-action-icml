  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide some points to consider regarding the use of celebrity platforms for activism.\n\nThere is certainly no obligation for celebrities to use their platforms for activism, but many choose to do so because they feel a responsibility to use their influence for good. Celebrities have a unique ability to reach large numbers of people and raise awareness of important issues. By speaking out on behalf of causes they believe in, they can raise public awareness and help to effect change.\n\nHowever, there can also be challenges to using celebrity platforms for activism. Some people may argue that celebrities lack the expertise and experience to speak on complex issues, and that their activism can come across as superficial or self-promoting. There is also the risk of backlash or criticism, as we have seen with activists in the past.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use a platform for activism is a personal one, and each celebrity must weigh the pros and cons and decide what feels right for them. However, it is clear that many celebrities have had a significant impact by using their platforms for activism, and that their efforts have helped to raise awareness and promote positive change.",
