  "content": "Judges are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest, including personal relationships with the parties involved in a case. In situations where an actual or perceived conflict of interest exists, the judge would have to recuse themselves from the case to prevent any undue influence or appearance of impropriety.\n\nIf a judge fails to disclose a potential conflict of interest or refuses to recuse themselves from a case when a conflict exists, they can be subject to disciplinary action and potentially removed from the bench.\n\nAdditionally, courts have established procedural safeguards to prevent potential bias or impropriety. For example, judges are required to rule only on admissible evidence and legal arguments, and parties have the right to challenge any perceived bias or impropriety through legal channels. \n\nOverall, there are a number of measures in place to prevent any real or perceived bias by judges in criminal cases. However, if there is any evidence of bias or impropriety by a judge, it is essential that it is reported and addressed through the appropriate channels to ensure that justice is served fairly and impartially.",
