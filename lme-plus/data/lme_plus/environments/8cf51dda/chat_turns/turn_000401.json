  "content": "You are correct, I apologize for my mistake. The expected value of the output at t=1 using the coefficients A=0 and B=ones(10,1)/10 should be 1/10, as you calculated. However, the output graph starting at 0 is still expected due to the fact that the initial conditions of the filter are all set to zero.\n\nWhen the filter function is called, it initializes the output vector y to all zeros. The filter function then calculates the output y for each time step based on the input x and the filter coefficients A and B, as well as the previous values of y. However, since the initial conditions of y are all zeros, the output at the beginning of the signal will also be zero until enough time has passed for the filter to converge to the desired output.\n\nIn the case of the input square wave with a period of 1 second and a sampling frequency of 50 Hz, the first few cycles of the signal may not be enough for the filter to converge to the correct output, resulting in the initial output values being zero. As more cycles are processed by the filter, the output will eventually converge to the correct values based on the filter coefficients and the input signal.",
