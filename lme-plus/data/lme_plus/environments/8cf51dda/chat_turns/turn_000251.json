However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or direct knowledge about specific travel agencies or their customer service. But I can provide some general advice and suggestions to help you make an informed decision.\n\nWhen researching a travel agency, it's essential to look for reviews and feedback from multiple sources. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Check online review platforms: Look up TravelSphere on review websites like Trustpilot, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews. Pay attention to the overall rating and read the comments to get a sense of the agency's strengths and weaknesses.\n2. Ask for referrals: Ask friends, family, or colleagues who have used TravelSphere in the past about their experiences. Personal recommendations can be a great way to get an honest opinion.\n3. Check industry certifications: Look for industry-recognized certifications like ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents) or IATA (International Air Transport Association). These certifications can indicate that the agency follows certain standards and best practices.\n4. Check their website and social media: Evaluate the agency's website, social media presence, and customer engagement. A professional website and active social media presence can indicate a level of transparency and customer service.\n5. Contact the agency directly: Reach out to TravelSphere's customer service department and ask about their services, policies, and procedures. This can give you an idea of their responsiveness and willingness to help.\n\nRegarding your recent experience with booking a flight to Paris, I'm sorry to hear that you're regretting the seat upgrade. It's essential to carefully review the terms and conditions before making a purchase, especially when it comes to additional fees.\n\nFor your trip to Bangkok, I recommend taking your time to research and compare different travel agencies. Consider factors like pricing, itinerary options, and customer service when making your decision.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!",
