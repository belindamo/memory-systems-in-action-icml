  "content": "I apologize, but the correct answer is actually C. The function of a spine-and-leaf architecture is to mitigate oversubscription by adding a layer of leaf switches. Oversubscription occurs when the capacity of a link is exceeded, causing congestion and reduced performance. By adding a layer of leaf switches, the spine-and-leaf architecture distributes the traffic across multiple links, reducing the risk of oversubscription.\n\nA spine-and-leaf architecture is a network design that uses a layer of central spine switches to connect a layer of leaf switches. The leaf switches are used to connect end devices, such as servers and clients, to the network.\n\nThe other answer choices are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the function of a spine-and-leaf architecture:\n\nA. A spine-and-leaf architecture does not necessarily offer predictable latency of the traffic path between end devices. Latency can be affected by various factors, such as the distance between devices and the load on the network.\n\nB. A spine-and-leaf architecture does not exclusively send multicast traffic between servers that are directly connected to the spine. It can handle any type of traffic, including unicast, multicast, and broadcast.\n\nD. A spine-and-leaf architecture does not limit the payload size of traffic within the leaf layer. It allows any size of traffic to pass through the leaf switches.",
