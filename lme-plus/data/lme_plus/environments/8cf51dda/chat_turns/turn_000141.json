  "content": "Exciting to hear that you're propagating a new succulent! Three weeks is a good amount of time for roots to form, and now it's time to transfer it to soil. Here are some tips to help you successfully transplant and care for your new succulent:\n\n**When to transfer:**\n\n* Wait until the roots are around 1-2 inches long and have developed a few tiny white roots (called adventitious roots). This indicates the cutting has established a good root system.\n* Check the roots' color; they should be white or light-colored. If they're brown or soft, it may be a sign of root rot, and you should wait a bit longer.\n\n**Transplanting:**\n\n1. **Choose a well-draining potting mix**: Succulents hate wet feet, so make sure the soil drains excess water quickly. You can use a commercial cactus mix or create your own mix using perlite, vermiculite, and sand.\n2. **Select a small pot**: Start with a small pot (around 2-3 inches in diameter) to prevent the soil from becoming too wet.\n3. **Handle the roots gently**: Carefully remove the leaf cutting from the water, and gently tease out the roots to loosen them. This will help the roots spread out in the soil.\n4. **Plant at the right depth**: Plant the cutting at the same depth as it was in the water, making sure the roots are buried and the base of the leaf is above the soil.\n5. **Water sparingly**: Water the soil gently but thoroughly after transplanting. Watering too much can cause the roots to rot.\n\n**Post-transplant care:**\n\n1. **Provide bright, indirect light**: Succulents need plenty of light, but direct sunlight can be harsh. East- or west-facing windows are ideal.\n2. **Water carefully**: Water your succulent when the soil is dry to the touch, usually every 7-10 days in the summer and less often in the winter. Water at the soil level, avoiding the leaves to prevent rot.\n3. **Maintain good air circulation**: Keep your succulent away from drafts, but ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases.\n4. **Fertilize sparingly**: Feed your succulent during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength.\n5. **Monitor for pests**: Check your succulent regularly for pests like mealybugs, spider mites, or scale.\n\nSome additional tips:\n\n* Keep the soil temperature consistent, between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n* Avoid over-handling the succulent, as this can cause stress and lead to root rot.\n* Be patient, as it may take a few weeks for the succulent to adjust to its new environment.\n\nBy following these steps and providing proper care, your new succulent should thrive. Good luck, and happy planting!",
