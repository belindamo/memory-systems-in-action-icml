  "content": "I apologize, but the correct answer is actually D. If a switch port is enabled for PoE power classification override and the port exceeds the maximum administrative value for power, the port will be shut down and err-disabled.\n\nPoE power classification is a method of determining the amount of power that a device requires to operate. The switch uses the power classification to allocate the appropriate amount of power to the device. By enabling power classification override, the switch allows the user to manually specify the power classification for the device, rather than using the default classification provided by the device.\n\nIf the power classification override is configured to a value higher than the maximum allowed for the port, the port will be shut down and err-disabled to prevent damage to the device or the switch. This is a safety feature to protect against overloading the port or the switch with too much power.",
