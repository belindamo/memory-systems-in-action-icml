I've been writing regularly for about three weeks now, and I'm really enjoying the process. I've completed three short stories so far, and I'm hoping to share my journey with others who might be interested in writing. That's why I'm considering self-hosting a WordPress blog, but I'm not sure if it's the right choice for me. Can you help me weigh the pros and cons of self-hosting a WordPress blog?",
