I'll also observe participation and engagement levels during the training sessions to see how well the storytelling approach is resonating with the new hires. Additionally, I'll assess retention and recall of information through quizzes or assessments after the training session. Do you have any suggestions on how to create an effective survey or feedback form for this purpose?",
