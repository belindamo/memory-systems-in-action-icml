  "content": "You are correct, my apologies for any confusion. If the coefficients of the filter are set to A=0 and B=ones(10,1)/10, the output of the filter should start at 1/10 for t=1 and increase by 1/10 for each subsequent time step.\n\nThe reason why the output graph starts at zero could be due to a mistake in the implementation or plotting of the filter output. It is possible that the initial values of the output vector were not set correctly or that the plotting function was not used properly. Double-checking the code and ensuring that the initial values of y are set correctly to the expected value of 1/10 at t=1 should result in the correct output graph.",
