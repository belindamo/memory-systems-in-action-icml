  "content": "If a switch port is enabled for PoE (Power over Ethernet) power classification override, the switch will override the power classification of the device connected to the port.\n\nPoE power classification is a method of determining the amount of power that a device requires to operate. The switch uses the power classification to allocate the appropriate amount of power to the device. By enabling power classification override, the switch allows the user to manually specify the power classification for the device, rather than using the default classification provided by the device.\n\nThe other answer choices are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the action taken by a switch port enabled for PoE power classification override:\n\nA. A switch does not pause data flow to a device when checking power usage on a PoE switch port.\n\nB. A switch does not generate a syslog message when a powered device begins drawing power from a PoE switch port.\n\nC. A switch does not disconnect a device if it is using less than the minimum configured power.\n\nD. A switch does not shut down a port and err-disable it if a monitored port exceeds the maximum administrative value for power.",
