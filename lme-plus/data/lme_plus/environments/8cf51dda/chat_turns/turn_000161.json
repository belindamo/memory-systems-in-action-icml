He looked up at Tom and gave him a small smile. \"Good morning,\" he said before turning his attention back to Moon. \"Are you feeling alright?\" he asked, concern lacing his voice.\n\nMoon nodded, feeling a bit embarrassed at their current position. \"Yeah, I feel good. Just a little tired,\" she replied, sitting up in Hemlock's arms.\n\nTom chuckled at their reaction. \"Sorry to interrupt your morning cuddles. But we need to get started on some things before the rest of the team wakes up,\" he said, still teasing.\n\nHemlock sighed but nodded. \"Right, let's get going,\" he said, carefully helping Moon to her feet before standing up himself.\n\nMoon smiled at him gratefully, feeling a warm sense of comfort from the night before. As they made their way back to the base, she couldn't help but feel grateful for having such supportive and caring teammates.",
