It's great that you're being proactive about it.\n\nRemember to also update your travel documents, such as your passport, driver's license, and any loyalty program accounts, to reflect your new last name. It might take some time, but it's worth it to avoid any potential issues or confusion.\n\nIn the meantime, if you need to book a hotel room or travel, it's a good idea to carry a copy of your marriage certificate with you, just in case you need to provide proof of your name change.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or concerns about booking a hotel room or traveling with your new last name. I'm here to help!",
