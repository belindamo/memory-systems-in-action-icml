I've heard that planks are really effective for building core strength. I'll also try to do some glute-strengthening exercises to improve my overall lower body strength. By the way, I was thinking of setting a goal to do a 30-minute jog without stopping by the end of the month. Do you think that's a realistic goal, considering I've been doing 30-minute jogs three times a week for the past month?",
