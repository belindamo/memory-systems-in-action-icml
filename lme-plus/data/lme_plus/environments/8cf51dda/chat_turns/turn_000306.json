  "content": "The data plane within a network device is responsible for forwarding traffic to the next hop.\n\nThe data plane is the part of a network device that handles the actual forwarding of traffic based on the routing and switching decisions made by the control plane. It receives packets from the ingress interface and forwards them to the egress interface based on the information in the forwarding information base (FIB).\n\nThe other answer choices are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the actions taken by the data plane:\n\nA. The data plane does not construct a routing table based on a routing protocol. The control plane is responsible for constructing the routing table based on the routing protocol.\n\nC. The data plane does not look up the egress interface in the forwarding information base. It uses the information in the FIB to forward the packets to the egress interface.\n\nD. The data plane does not provide CLI (Command Line Interface) access to the network device. The control plane provides the CLI access to the network device.",
