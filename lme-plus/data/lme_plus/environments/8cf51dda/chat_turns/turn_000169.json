We want to make sure that there aren't any lasting effects from the virus, and that your body is functioning properly.\" He leaned forward and began to prepare some paperwork. \"I have a few forms for you to fill out, and then we can start the testing.\"\n\nMoon took the forms and began to fill them out, writing down her medical history and any symptoms she had experienced since being infected with the virus. As she filled out the paperwork, she couldn't help but feel a sense of anxiety. She had never been particularly fond of doctors or medical exams, and the thought of having to go through a battery of tests made her uneasy.\n\nProf. Maximus noticed her unease and smiled reassuringly. \"Don't worry, Moon. We're just being cautious. I'm sure everything will be fine.\"\n\nMoon nodded and finished filling out the forms. After a few minutes, Prof. Maximus led her to a nearby examination room, where he began to perform various tests on her. He checked her blood pressure, listened to her heart and lungs, and performed several neurological tests to check for any signs of cognitive impairment.\n\nThroughout the testing, Moon tried to stay calm and focused. She reminded herself that these tests were necessary and that they would give her a better understanding of her overall health. After about an hour, the testing was complete.\n\n\"Well, everything looks good,\" Prof. Maximus said, looking over the results. \"Your blood pressure is a little high, but that's to be expected given your recent experiences. Other than that, your results are all normal.\"\n\nMoon breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's good to hear.\"\n\nProf. Maximus smiled. \"Yes, it is. But I still want to see you back here in a few weeks for a follow-up, just to be safe.\"\n\nMoon nodded. \"Of course. Thank you, Prof. Maximus.\"\n\nAs Moon left the office and made her way back to the base, she felt a sense of relief wash over her. Despite her anxiety, the testing had gone well, and she was reassured that she was in good health. She made a mental note to take care of herself in the coming weeks, to keep her blood pressure under control and to maintain her overall health.",
