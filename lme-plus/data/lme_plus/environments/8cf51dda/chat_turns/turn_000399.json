  "content": "The reason the output graph starts at 0 instead of 1 when the input square wave function starts at 1 when t=0 is due to the characteristics of the filter with coefficients A=0 and B=ones(10,1)/10.\n\nWhen the input signal is a square wave, it contains a DC offset, or a non-zero average value. In this case, the average value of the square wave is 0, as it spends equal time in the positive and negative states. However, the filter with coefficients A=0 and B=ones(10,1)/10 has a characteristic known as zero-phase distortion, which means that it does not introduce any phase shift or time delay to the input signal. This means that the filter does not shift the input signal in time, but only changes its amplitude at each time step.\n\nSince the average value of the square wave is 0, the output of the filter will also have an average value of 0, which is why the output graph starts at 0. This means that the filter is effectively removing the DC offset of the input signal, which can be useful in some applications.\n\nOverall, the specific characteristics of the filter with coefficients A=0 and B=ones(10,1)/10, such as its zero-phase distortion, contribute to the specific output graph that we observe for the given input signal.",
