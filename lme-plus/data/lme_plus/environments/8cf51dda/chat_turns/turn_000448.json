I'm originally from another country, and I've been living in the US for about 5 years now. My mom is still back in my home country, and we keep in touch through regular phone calls and messages. I've been helping her with her visitor visa application, and I'm hoping she can come visit us this summer. How should I approach questions about my family and our interactions?",
