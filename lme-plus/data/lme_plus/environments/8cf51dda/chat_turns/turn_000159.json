  "content": "Hemlock stirred in his sleep and opened his eyes, noticing that Moon was awake. He smiled softly and rubbed her back. \"Good morning,\" he said quietly.\n\nMoon stretched her limbs and smiled at Hemlock. \"Good morning,\" she replied. \"Thank you for last night. I don't remember the last time I felt so safe.\"\n\nHemlock kissed the top of her head. \"Of course, Moon. You don't have to thank me,\" he said. \"I'll always be here for you.\"\n\nMoon's heart swelled with emotion, and she looked up at Hemlock. \"You know, last night when you confessed... I didn't know what to say at first,\" she admitted. \"But I feel the same way, Hemlock. I really care about you.\"\n\nHemlock smiled and stroked her hair gently. \"I know,\" he said softly. \"And I'm so glad to hear it.\"\n\nMoon leaned in for a gentle kiss, and Hemlock kissed her back tenderly. They pulled away, and Hemlock stood up, carrying Moon with him. \"Come on, let's get you some breakfast,\" he said, carrying her to the kitchen.\n\nMoon giggled and wrapped her arms around Hemlock's neck, feeling grateful for his care and affection. As they walked to the kitchen, she knew that she could always count on Hemlock to be there for her, and that made her heart soar.",
