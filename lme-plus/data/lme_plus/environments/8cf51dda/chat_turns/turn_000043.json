  "content": "#TouchdownSmile is a great choice for a hashtag - it's catchy, easy to remember, and conveys the fun and excitement of the Super Bowl party.\n\nI'm glad you liked the custom sign ideas! \"I'm with [Team Name]!\" and \"Referee in Training\" are definitely going to be crowd-pleasers. They'll add a lot of humor and personality to the photos, and your guests will love posing with them.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with the photo booth props and signs. You can also consider adding some fun football-themed accessories like football-shaped sunglasses, football field-printed hats, or even a football-themed backdrop with a goalpost or stadium seating.\n\nIf you need any more help or have any other questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope your Super Bowl party is a huge success, and your guests have a blast taking photos with the fun props and signs!",
