It is used for applications that require guaranteed delivery of data, such as file sharing and web browsing. TCP ensures that all packets are received by the destination and that they are received in the correct order by adding a sequence number to each packet and acknowledging the receipt of each packet. If a packet is lost or corrupted, TCP will retransmit the packet until it is successfully delivered.\n\nUDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that does not require the client and the server to establish a connection before sending data. It is used for applications that do not require guaranteed delivery of data, such as real-time audio and video streaming. UDP does not provide the same level of reliability as"

If a switch port is enabled for PoE power classification override and the port exceeds the maximum administrative value for power, the port will be shut down and err-disabled.\n\nPoE power classification is a method of determining the amount of power that a device requires to operate.

This is a safety feature to protect against overloading the port or the switch with too much power."
