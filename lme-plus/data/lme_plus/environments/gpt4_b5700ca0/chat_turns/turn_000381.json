  "content": "The New South Wales Government has launched a range of financial assistance programs to support individuals who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nOne of these programs is the COVID-19 Disaster Payment, which is a federal program that provides financial support to people who have lost work due to lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and other COVID-19 related measures. The payment amount varies based on the length of the lockdown, but is typically between $375 and $600 per week.\n\nAdditionally, the NSW Government has introduced the Jobs Plus program, which provides businesses with wage subsidies of up to $25,000 for hiring new employees. This program aims to create new job opportunities in the state and boost employment rates.\n\nThe NSW Government has also established the Small Business COVID-19 Support Grant, which provides up to $10,000 in financial assistance to eligible small businesses impacted by the pandemic. There are several other financial assistance programs available for people and businesses affected by the pandemic, details of which can be found on the official NSW Government website.",
