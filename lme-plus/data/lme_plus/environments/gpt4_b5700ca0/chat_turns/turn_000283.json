Here are some tips to help you prepare your fabric:\n\n1. **Pre-wash and dry**: Wash and dry your fabric to remove any finishes or sizing that might affect the embroidery process. This will also help shrink the fabric, ensuring that it won't shrink later and distort your design.\n2. **Iron the fabric**: Iron your fabric to remove any wrinkles and creases. This will help you achieve a smooth, even surface for embroidery.\n3. **Use a stabilizing material**: Metallic threads can be dense and heavy, so it's essential to use a stabilizing material to support your fabric. You can use:\n\t* Interfacing: A layer of interfacing between your fabric and the hoop will provide stability and prevent the fabric from stretching or distorting.\n\t* Water-soluble topping: This is a thin, water-soluble layer that you can place on top of your fabric. It helps to stabilize the fabric and prevents the metallic threads from sinking into the fabric.\n\t* Tear-away stabilizer: This is a thin, paper-like material that you can place behind your fabric. It provides stability and can be torn away once the embroidery is complete.\n4. **Hoop the fabric correctly**: Make sure to hoop your fabric tightly, but not too tightly, as this can cause the fabric to pucker. You want the fabric to be smooth and even, with no wrinkles or creases.\n5. **Use a sharp needle**: Metallic threads can be dense, so it's essential to use a sharp needle that can easily penetrate the fabric. A sharp needle will also help to prevent the thread from tangling or breaking.\n6. **Thread conditioner**: Consider using a thread conditioner or a small amount of beeswax on your metallic threads to help reduce tangling and knotting.\n7. **Test your thread tension**: Before starting your project, test your thread tension by embroidering a small sample on a scrap piece of fabric. This will help you adjust your tension to prevent the thread from breaking or tangling.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well-prepared to start your celestial stars project with confidence. Remember to take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.",
