Creating your own sourdough starter from scratch can be a rewarding experience, and with your experience working with yeast, you're already halfway there. I'd be happy to guide you through the process of creating a sourdough starter and using it to make a delicious boule.\n\n**Creating a Sourdough Starter from Scratch:**\n\nDay 1: Create a Spontaneous Starter\n\n1. Mix 1/2 cup of warm water (around 90\u00b0F to 100\u00b0F) with 1/2 cup of flour in a clean glass or ceramic container.\n2. Cover the container with a cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature (around 70\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F) for 24 to 48 hours. This mixture is called the \"spontaneous starter\" because it allows wild yeast and bacteria present in the flour to start fermenting naturally.\n\nDays 2-6: Feed the Starter\n\n1. After 24 hours, discard half of the starter and add another 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of water. Mix well and cover the container again.\n2. Repeat this process of discarding half of the starter and feeding it fresh flour and water every 24 hours for the next 5 days. This will help the starter to become more active, bubbly, and frothy.\n\nDay 7 and Beyond: Maintaining the Starter\n\n1. Once your starter is active, bubbly, and has a tangy aroma, you can start using it in recipes. To maintain the starter, feed it once a day with 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of water. You can also store it in the refrigerator and feed it once a week.\n\n**Making a Sourdough Boule:**\n\nNow that you have an active sourdough starter, let's make a delicious boule!\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup sourdough starter (active and bubbly)\n* 3 cups bread flour\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 1 tbsp water\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sourdough starter, bread flour, and salt. Mix until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass.\n2. Add the water and mix until the dough is fully hydrated and starts to form a ball.\n3. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky.\n4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it rest at room temperature for 4-5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n5. Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) with a Dutch oven or a stone inside.\n6. Gently deflate the dough and shape it into a boule. Place the boule onto a parchment-lined baking sheet or a peel, if you have one.\n7. Score the boule with a sharp blade or a lame, making 2-3 diagonal cuts on the surface.\n8. Place the boule into the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 205\u00b0F (96\u00b0C).\n9. Remove the boule from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.\n\nTips and Variations:\n\n* Use a consistent feeding schedule for your sourdough starter to maintain its health and activity.\n* Experiment with different types of flour, such as whole wheat, rye, or spelt, to create unique flavor profiles.\n* Add nuts, seeds, or dried fruits to the dough for added texture and flavor.\n* Try using a slower fermentation process, such as a 12-hour bulk fermentation, to develop a more complex flavor.\n\nI hope this helps you in your sour",
