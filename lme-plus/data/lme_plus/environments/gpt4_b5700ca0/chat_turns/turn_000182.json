  "content": "Breads with higher fat and gluten content tend to have a longer shelf life because these ingredients help to keep the bread moist and prevent it from going stale quickly. However, it's important to note that not all breads with high fat and gluten content will necessarily have a long shelf life. Some types of bread, such as artisanal bread, may have high fat and gluten content but still have a shorter shelf life due to their lack of preservatives.\n\nIf you're looking for bread that lasts longer, you should consider breads with preservatives or those labeled \"longer lasting\" or \"extra durable.\" These breads often have additives that help to keep them fresh for longer periods of time. Additionally, breads with thick crusts tend to last longer than those with thin crusts.",
