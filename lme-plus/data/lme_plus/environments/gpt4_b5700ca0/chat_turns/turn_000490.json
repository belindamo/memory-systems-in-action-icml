Make sure it's stable and level, and consider using a tripod with a wide base and a low center of gravity to reduce camera movement.\n2. **Weighted tripod:** Add weight to your tripod by hanging a bag or a weight from the center column. This will help stabilize the tripod and reduce camera movement.\n3. **Use a tripod head with a ballhead or panhead:** A tripod head with a ballhead or panhead allows for smooth and precise adjustments, making it easier to compose your shot and reduce camera movement.\n4. **Compose and focus:** Before you take the photo, compose your shot and focus on your subject. This will help you avoid touching the camera during the exposure and reduce camera movement.\n5. **Use a lens with image stabilization:** If your lens has image stabilization (IS) or vibration reduction (VR), enable it. This will help reduce camera movement and blur caused by handholding the camera.\n6. **Use a camera with sensor-shift stabilization:** Some cameras have sensor-shift stabilization, which can help reduce camera movement and blur during long exposures.\n7. **Use a camera with electronic shutter:** Some cameras have an electronic shutter option, which can help reduce camera movement and vibrations during long exposures.\n8. **Use a camera with live view:** Use live view to compose your shot and focus on your subject. This will help you avoid touching the camera during the exposure and reduce camera movement.\n9. **Use a remote camera trigger:** A remote camera trigger can help reduce camera movement by allowing you to take photos without physically touching the camera.\n10. **Take multiple shots:** Take multiple shots of the same scene, and use the sharpest one. This technique is called \"focus stacking\" or \"image averaging.\"\n11. **Use a camera with a high ISO range:** If you're using a camera with a high ISO range, you may be able to shoot at a faster shutter speed, reducing the need for long exposures and minimizing camera movement.\n12. **Use a camera with a wide-angle lens:** A wide-angle lens can help you capture more of the scene in a single shot, reducing the need for long exposures and minimizing camera movement.\n\nBy following these tips, you can reduce camera movement and capture sharp, stunning images of the city skyline at night.",
