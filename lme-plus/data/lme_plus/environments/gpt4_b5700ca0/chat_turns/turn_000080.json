Reading is an excellent way to reduce screen time, and it's even more enjoyable when you can share it with like-minded people.\n\nStaying organized with your reading list can be a challenge, but I've got some tips to help you keep track of the books you want to read:\n\n**Analog Methods:**\n\n1. **Reading journal**: Keep a dedicated journal to record the books you've read, including title, author, rating, and a brief review.\n2. **Bookshelf or bookcase**: Organize your physical books by genre, author, or color to keep track of your owned books.\n3. **Index card system**: Write down book titles, authors, and a brief summary on index cards, and organize them by genre or category.\n\n**Digital Methods:**\n\n1. **Goodreads**: You're already on Goodreads, which is an excellent platform for tracking your reading list, rating books, and finding new titles.\n2. **Spreadsheets**: Create a spreadsheet to organize your reading list, including columns for title, author, genre, and status (e.g., \"to-read,\" \"reading,\" or \"finished\").\n3. **Book tracking apps**: Explore apps like Libib, BookNerd, or Reading Challenge to help you organize your reading list and track your progress.\n\n**Hybrid Approach:**\n\n1. **Combine analog and digital methods**: Use a reading journal to record your thoughts and ratings, and then update your Goodreads or spreadsheet with the same information.\n2. **Take photos of your bookshelves**: Snap photos of your bookshelves and organize them digitally, making it easier to browse and remember the books you own.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Prioritize your list**: Identify the books you want to read most and move them to the top of your list.\n2. **Create a \"maybe\" list**: Make a separate list for books that catch your attention, but you're not sure if you'll read them.\n3. **Set reading goals and challenges**: Challenge yourself to read a certain number of books within a specific timeframe or explore different genres.\n\nIt's great that you've found a fellow book lover on Goodreads!
