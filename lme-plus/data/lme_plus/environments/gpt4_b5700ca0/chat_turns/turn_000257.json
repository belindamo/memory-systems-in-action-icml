  "content": "Yes, too much cardiovascular exercise can lead to muscle fatigue or injury in high-impact sports such as running or basketball. This is because excessive cardio can cause overuse injuries such as shin splints, IT band syndrome, and plantar fasciitis. It can also cause muscle fatigue and decrease the ability to perform at a high level, leading to poor performance and even possible injury. Balancing cardio with strength training and proper rest is important to prevent these issues.",
