While there's no one-size-fits-all answer, research and studies provide some insights into writing productivity.\n\n**Writing speed:**\n\n* A study by the University of California, Irvine, found that the average writing speed for a college student is around 13-15 words per minute (wpm) [1].\n* Another study by the University of Texas at Austin reported an average writing speed of 20-25 wpm for experienced writers [2].\n\n**Word count per session:**\n\n* A popular writing advice is to aim for 250-500 words per hour, which translates to 125-250 words per 30-minute session [3].\n* NaNoWriMo, a well-known writing organization, suggests an average of 200-250 words per 30-minute session for their participants [4].\n\nConsidering these references, I chose 250-300 words per 30-minute session as a reasonable estimate for an average writer. However, this can vary greatly depending on individual factors, such as:\n\n* Writing experience and skill level\n* Familiarity with the topic or genre\n* Research requirements\n* Writing style and pace\n* Distractions and focus\n\nTo make the estimate more realistic for you, consider your own writing habits and pace. Ask yourself:\n\n* How many words do you typically write in a 30-minute session?\n* Do you write quickly and then revise, or do you take your time to craft each sentence?\n* Are you writing in a genre that requires more research or planning?\n\nAdjust the word count target based on your own writing style and experience. If you find it challenging to meet the initial target, you can always adjust it downward or upward as needed.\n\nRemember, the goal is to set a realistic target that motivates you to make progress on your short story, not to create unnecessary stress or pressure.",
