This will help me better understand your needs and create a more tailored timeline for you. Please provide the following details:\n\n1. What is the original deadline for your project, and when did you add an extra month to your timeline?\n2. What specific area of natural language processing in education are you focusing on (e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification, language modeling, etc.)?\n3. What are the main objectives of your project (e.g., developing a new NLP model, evaluating existing models, exploring applications in educational settings, etc.)?\n4. What tasks have you already completed, and what tasks do you still need to accomplish?\n5. Are there any specific milestones or deliverables you need to meet along the way (e.g., literature reviews, data collection, model development, pilot testing, etc.)?\n6. How many hours per week can you dedicate to working on your project?\n7. Are there any dependencies or critical path activities that need to be considered in the timeline (e.g., waiting for data collection, collaborating with others, etc.)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you break down your project into manageable tasks, estimate the time required for each task, and create a revised timeline to help you stay on track.",
