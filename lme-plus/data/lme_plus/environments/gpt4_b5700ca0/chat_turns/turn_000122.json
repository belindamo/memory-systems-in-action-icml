Let's use a formula to get an estimate.\n\nThe formula to calculate monthly mortgage payments is:\n\nM = P [ (r / n) / (1 - (1 + r/n)^(-nt)) ]\n\nWhere:\n\n* M = monthly payment\n* P = principal loan amount (in your case, $200,000, which is the mortgage amount after your 20% down payment: $250,000 - $50,000)\n* r = monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12)\n* n = number of payments per year (12 for a monthly payment)\n* t = number of years (30 years in your case)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n* P = $200,000\n* r = 4%/12 = 0.003333 (monthly interest rate)\n* n = 12\n* t = 30 years\n\nUsing a calculator or spreadsheet, we get:\n\nM \u2248 $955.66\n\nSo, your estimated monthly mortgage payment would be approximately $955.66.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate and your actual payment may vary depending on other factors, such as:\n\n* Property taxes and insurance: These can increase your monthly payment. You may want to consider including them in your calculation.\n* Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI): If you put down less than 20%, you might need PMI, which would add to your monthly payment.\n* Other loan terms: Your lender may offer different loan terms, such as a 15-year mortgage or an adjustable-rate mortgage, which would change your monthly payment.\n\nIt's always a good idea to review your loan terms and estimated payments with your lender to get a more accurate picture of your mortgage costs.\n\nNow that you have an estimate of your monthly mortgage payment, you can plug it back into your total cost of ownership calculation.",
