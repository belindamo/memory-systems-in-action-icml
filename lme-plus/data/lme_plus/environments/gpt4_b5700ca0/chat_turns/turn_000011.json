However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide specific recommendations for tennis courts in your city.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to find new tennis courts in your area:\n\n1. **Google Search**: Type \"tennis courts near me\" or \"tennis courts in [your city name]\" and Google will show you a list of nearby courts along with their addresses, reviews, and contact information.\n2. **Online Directories**: Websites like **TennisCourtHub**, **TennisCourts.com**, or **Courtfinder** allow you to search for tennis courts by location, zip code, or city.\n3. **Local Parks and Recreation Department**: Contact your city's Parks and Recreation department to inquire about public tennis courts in your area. They might have a list of courts, their availability, and any reservation requirements.\n4. **Ask Around**: Reach out to friends, colleagues, or fellow tennis enthusiasts for recommendations. They might know of some hidden gems or popular courts that you haven't tried yet.\n5. **Tennis Clubs or Facilities**: Look for private tennis clubs, community centers, or sports facilities in your area that offer tennis courts for members or non-members. They might have different court surfaces, amenities, and playing conditions that can add some variety to your games.\n\nRemember to check the court's availability, reservation policies, and rules before heading out to play with Alex. Have fun exploring new courts and enjoying your tennis sessions!",
