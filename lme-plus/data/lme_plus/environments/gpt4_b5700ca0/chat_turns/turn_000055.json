  "content": "It is debatable whether Sibelius' association with the Finnish government and establishment limited his artistic freedom. Some argue that his close relationship with the government allowed him to concentrate on his work without financial worries, and that his status as a national icon gave him the freedom to explore Finnish themes and motifs in his music.\n\nHowever, others contend that Sibelius' close ties to the government and his nationalistic themes did constrain his artistic freedom to some extent. Critics have accused him of being too formulaic in his approach to composing and of relying too heavily on Finnish folk music and mythology in his work, to the neglect of other influences.\n\nUltimately, it is difficult to say whether Sibelius would have produced different or more innovative work had he not been so closely associated with the Finnish government and establishment. However, it is clear that his nationalistic themes and use of Finnish motifs in his music continue to resonate with audiences today and have helped to shape Finland's national identity.",
