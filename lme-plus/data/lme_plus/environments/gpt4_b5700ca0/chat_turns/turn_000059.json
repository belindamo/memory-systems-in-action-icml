I'm a blank slate!\n\nBut I can certainly help you brainstorm and organize your schedule for the past few months. Let's start with the meeting with Rachel on March 3rd as a reference point. Can you tell me more about what happened after that meeting? What were some key events, milestones, or tasks that you accomplished?\n\nAlso, do you have any notes, calendars, or to-do lists from the past few months that you can refer to? If so, feel free to share them with me, and I can help you make sense of them.\n\nLet's work together to reconstruct your schedule and get you prepared for your upcoming project!",
