Bread flour from a local mill is often less processed and has a higher protein content, which can result in a more robust, chewy crumb and a better gluten structure.\n\nWith bread flour, you can try recipes that showcase its strength and texture. Here are a few ideas that would work particularly well with your local mill's bread flour:\n\n1. **Crusty Baguette**: This classic French bread is a great way to showcase the strength and texture of your bread flour. With a higher protein content, your baguette will have a more open crumb and a crispy, golden crust.\n2. **Italian Ciabatta**: Ciabatta is a rustic Italian bread that benefits from a stronger flour. The bread flour will help create a more airy, holey crumb and a crispy crust.\n3. **Pain de Campagne**: This rustic French bread is perfect for showcasing the flavor and texture of your bread flour. The slower fermentation process and the use of a preferment will bring out the best in your flour.\n4. **Sourdough**: If you're feeling adventurous, try creating a sourdough starter using your bread flour. The natural yeast and bacteria in the flour will help create a more complex, tangy flavor and a chewy crumb.\n5. **Country Bread**: A hearty, rustic bread like a country bread is a great way to showcase the texture and flavor of your bread flour. You can add nuts, seeds, or dried fruits to create a more interesting flavor profile.\n\nWhen working with bread flour, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* Use a slightly longer mixing time to develop the gluten, which will result in a more open crumb and a better texture.\n* Use a slower fermentation process to allow the enzymes in the flour to break down the starches and develop the flavor.\n* Be gentle when shaping the dough to avoid over-working it, which can result in a dense, tough crumb.\n* Score the bread just before baking to create a more even, controlled crust.\n\nI hope these recipes and tips inspire you to create some amazing breads with your local mill's bread flour!",
