  "content": "When factoring in the $2,000 credit from the seller for closing costs, you should subtract it from the closing costs. Here's why:\n\n* The credit is specifically intended to help with closing costs, so it makes sense to apply it directly to those expenses.\n* If you subtract it from the purchase price, you'd be reducing the basis of the property, which could affect your property taxes and potentially other costs down the line.\n\nSo, in your calculation, you can subtract the $2,000 credit from the closing costs:\n\nClosing Costs: 3% of Purchase Price = $7,500 - $2,000 (seller credit) = $5,500\n\nThis will give you a more accurate representation of your out-of-pocket expenses at closing.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, here's the revised calculation:\n\nTotal Cost of Ownership (first year):\n\n= $250,000 (Purchase Price) + $5,500 (Closing Costs) + $14,400 (Mortgage Payments) + $3,125 (Property Taxes) + $800 (Homeowners Insurance) + $5,000 (Maintenance and Repairs) + $1,000 (Other Expenses)\n= $279,825\n\nBy subtracting the credit from the closing costs, you'll get a more accurate picture of your total cost of ownership.",
