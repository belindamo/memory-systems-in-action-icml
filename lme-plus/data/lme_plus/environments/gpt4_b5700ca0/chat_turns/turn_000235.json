Here's a quick rundown:\n\n**Westbound (from California):**\n\n1. **Hoover Dam**: The parking lot has designated spaces for larger vehicles, including RVs and trucks. You should be fine parking your F-150, but be prepared for crowds and potential parking lot congestion.\n2. **Lake Mead National Recreation Area**: Most parking areas and scenic overlooks have ample space for larger vehicles. However, some parking lots might have limited spaces or require a short walk to the scenic views.\n3. **Valley of Fire State Park**: The park's parking areas are generally suitable for larger vehicles, but be mindful of the narrow roads and tight turns within the park.\n\n**Eastbound (from Texas, Oklahoma, or Kansas):**\n\n1. **Cadillac Ranch**: The parking area is a large, open field, so you'll have no issues parking your F-150.\n2. **Tucumcari Mountain Road**: The scenic drive is a regular highway, so you'll have no problems navigating with your truck.\n3. **Petrified Forest National Park**: Most parking areas and scenic overlooks are suitable for larger vehicles, but some areas might require a short walk to the trails or scenic views.\n\n**Grand Canyon National Park:**\n\n1. **Mather Point**: The parking lot is large and can accommodate larger vehicles, but it can get crowded during peak season.\n2. **Yavapai Point**: The parking lot is smaller, but there are designated spaces for larger vehicles.
