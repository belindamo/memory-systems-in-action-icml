  "content": "I apologize for the confusion!\n\nYou are correct that your pre-approval amount is $350,000, and you're purchasing the house for $325,000. To calculate the principal loan amount, you need to subtract your down payment from the purchase price.\n\nLet's recalculate the principal loan amount:\n\n* Purchase Price: $325,000\n* Down Payment: 20% of $325,000 = $65,000\n* Principal Loan Amount: $325,000 - $65,000 = $260,000\n\nSo, the principal loan amount is $260,000.\n\nNow, let's recalculate your monthly mortgage payment using the correct principal loan amount:\n\n* Principal Loan Amount: $260,000\n* Interest Rate: 4%/12 = 0.003333 (monthly interest rate)\n* Term: 30 years\n\nUsing a mortgage calculator or the formula, we get:\n\nM \u2248 $1,242.71\n\nYour estimated monthly mortgage payment would be approximately $1,242.71.\n\nPlease note that this calculation assumes you're not paying private mortgage insurance (PMI) and doesn't include other costs like property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Your actual monthly payment may vary depending on your specific situation.\n\nI apologize again for the mistake earlier, and I hope this clears up any confusion.",
