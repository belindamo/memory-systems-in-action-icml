  "content": "You're absolutely on the right track! I love your ideas, and I think they'll help create a beautiful and inviting display at the Night Market. Here are a few more suggestions to build upon your ideas:\n\n* **Risers and levels**: Using risers or stacked crates can add visual interest to your display and create a sense of depth. You can place your products at different levels to draw the customer's eye to specific scents or products.\n* **Grouping by scent**: Organizing your products by scent is a great way to make it easy for customers to find what they're looking for. You can use small signs or cards to label each scent category, like \"Lavender Dreams\" or \"Peppermint Refresh\", as you mentioned.\n* **Signage**: In addition to the scent labels, consider creating a larger sign with your brand name, logo, and a brief tagline or description of your products. This will help attract customers and give them a sense of what your brand is about.\n* **Decorative elements**: Add some decorative elements to your display to make it more visually appealing. You could use fresh flowers, greenery, or branches to add a natural touch, or incorporate decorative items that match your brand's aesthetic, like vintage apothecary jars or rustic wooden accents.\n* **Product placement**: Consider placing your most visually appealing or popular products at eye level or near the front of the table to draw customers in. You can also place smaller or complementary products, like travel-sized soaps or lotion bars, near the back of the table or on lower shelves.\n* **Lighting**: If possible, consider using soft, warm lighting to highlight your products and create a cozy atmosphere. This can be especially effective for a Night Market setting.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, you'll create a beautiful and inviting display that showcases your products and draws customers in. Remember to keep your display simple, yet visually appealing, and make sure it's easy for customers to navigate and find what they're looking for.\n\nI'm so excited to see your display come together! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask.",
