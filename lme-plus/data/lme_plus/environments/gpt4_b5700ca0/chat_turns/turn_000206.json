Its sleek, tapered form is covered in shimmering silver and blue glass panels that create a stunning visual effect.\n\n2. The Dancing House in Prague, Czech Republic: This striking building was designed by architects Frank Gehry and Vlado Miluni\u0107, and is meant to evoke a couple dancing. The building's form is made up of undulating, flowing lines that create an eye-catching facade.\n\n3. The Turning Torso in Malmo, Sweden: This residential tower is designed to look like a twisting torso, with each floor rotating slightly as it rises up. The building's form creates stunning views and is easily recognizable on the Malmo skyline.\n\n4. The Milwaukee Art Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA: This museum was designed by architect Santiago Calatrava and features a stunning white fa\u00e7ade that can be opened up to reveal a movable sunscreen.
