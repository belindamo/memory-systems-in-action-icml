But what constitutes creepy? Is it an underlying intuition? A safe preservation mechanism? Well, Doyle and colleagues (2022) investigated that by employing eye-tracking software to identify precisely where participants were looking the longest when examining thirty faces for attractiveness, trustworthiness, and creepiness. \n\nThey found that the eye region was by far the most looked at and that participants who had previously scored high on ambiguity discomfort were likelier to rate others as \u2018creepy\u2019 compared to those who scored highly on fear of the unknown or uncertainty intolerance (yes, these concepts ARE different).\n\nThe researchers note that while there is no evidence to support the notion that individuals labelled as \u2018creepy\u2019 genuinely pose a threat, this label may cause that individual significant harm. Indeed, our ability to correctly identify people as \u2018creepy\u2019 is essential not just for our self-preservation but for preserving others\u2019 from stigma and social marginalisation. \n\n\u2013 by @diana chiang \n\n### COVID affected the intercultural connections of our hobbies\n\nNaturally following the pandemic, there has been a shift in how we spend our time, who we spend it with, and how much. \n\nBut this also massively differs from culture to culture, country to country. Has COVID made us more locally or globally involved? \n\nUsing network analysis and data gathered from Google Trends based on 50 different countries, Thamprasert, et al. (2021) investigated the interest and country relationships in 10 other hobbies before and after the pandemic. \n\nThe analysis identified that the relationships between hobbies such as art, collecting, and pet care were weak between countries. In contrast, the relationships regarding learning, cooking, music, games, and sports interest became stronger between nations. \n\nThis has exciting applications for widening our understanding of cultural interaction and understanding within a global market.\n\nYou can further explore the specific hobby-based relationships between regions in Thamprasert and colleagues\u2019 (2021) conference paper.\n\n\u2013 by @diana chiang \n\n### Emotional well-being impacts our social connections\n\nThere have been piles of research suggesting that emotional well-being, feelings of agency, and our social relationships are intertwined, so this might not shock us. However, the directionality of these relationships has long been under question. \n\nTo answer this question scientifically, Vella-Brodrick, Joshanloo, and Slemp (2022) conducted a 13-year-long longitudinal study following the lives of more than 22,000 participants. These people came from various backgrounds across Australia and had an average age of 35 at the start of the study. Survey data were collected four times every four years. \n\nThe results showed that contrary to prior research generally referring to mental well-being as an outcome or consequence of good social relationships and high agency perceptions, mental well-being was a predictor of the two variables. In fact, early social relationship connectedness was not a predictor but a consequence of agency and mental well-being.\n\nThese findings pause a long-standing debate and emphasise the importance of taking care of your mental well-being, which will likely yield infinite rewards. \n\n\u2013 by @diana chiang \n\n---\n\n## You probably underestimate thinking\n\nInspired by previous studies exploring spontaneous thinking and metamotivation, a collaboration between Aya Hatano, Cansu Ogulmus, Hiroaki Shigemasu, and Kou Murayama set out to discover [what people think about thinking](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xge-xge0001255.pdf). \n\n### \\*\\*The waiting game\\*\\*\n\nThroughout five studies across the United Kingdom and Japan, the authors found a cross-cultural, significant effect indicating people underestimate the task enjoyment of waiting. The participants were told to sit in a room without distractions and wait for up to 20 minutes, self-assessing their anticipated enjoyment level (low) before and the actual enjoyment they felt after waiting (much higher). \n\n### \\*\\*What\u2019s this mean?\\*\\*\n\nPeople rate free thinking as something to avoid, not because it\u2019s inherently unpleasant, but because they don\u2019t appreciate the opportunity for what it could be. This false expectation might be making us unnecessarily avoid thinking in our daily lives and instead reach for distractions, like our ubiquitous phones.\n\nNot necessarily arguing that thinking is inherently fun and enjoyable, the authors think this is the beginning of synergistic research between intrinsic motivation or curiosity and metacognition. \n\nWho\u2019d a thought?\n\n-by [Lizzie](https://www.notion.so/Lizzie-2d092cfbfa0d45efa90bdeaabde0e40d) \n\n## It could always be better\n\nThis paper is so delightful to read and comes with its own excellent abstract. The authors even preface their work by answering the age old question that yes, it began with an egg. I can\u2019t add an angle (which is ironic in context) to increase Mastroianni and Ludwin-Peery\u2019s paper readability except to provide the spoiler: [our imaginations are biased toward making things better](https://psyarxiv.com/2uxwk/). \n\nRead on!\n\n-by [Lizzie](https://www.notion.so/Lizzie-2d092cfbfa0d45efa90bdeaabde0e40d) \n\n---\n\n## \\*\\*We underestimate our ability to weather emotional storms\\*\\*\n\nUnsurprisingly, we could be better at predicting our future behaviour. However, what is less well known is that this tendency trickles into our ability to forecast our response to bad news. This ignorance of how we cope can compromise our decisions and undermine our happiness. \n\n\\*\\*Why does this happen?\\*\\*\n\nWell, we often don\u2019t consider how positive experiences might buffer the bad, and we are also more skilled than we realise at construing what happens to us in a positive light. In other words, we have a psychological immune system that shelters us from the worst effects of our misfortune (how exciting!).\n\n\\*\\*How is this helpful to know?\\*\\*\n\nNot knowing about this \u2018psychological immune system\u2019 can lead us to make decisions that don't maximize our potential for satisfaction. In the words of Daniel Kahneman, rational planning of action becomes extremely difficult if we don't know what we\u2019re going to want and we don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to feel when we get it. \n\nLet\u2019s try and learn more about this internal tool we have to weather emotional storms so we can put it to better use!\n\n- by Ella Howes ([https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct01/strength](https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct01/strength))\""
