    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, Thai cuisine can be spicy, but not all Thai dishes are extremely hot. In fact, most Thai dishes can be adjusted to your preferred level of spiciness. When ordering food, you can ask for \"mai pet\" (not spicy) or \"pet nit noy\" (a little bit spicy). If you're not sure how spicy a dish is, you can always ask your server for their recommendation. Additionally, many dishes come with a side of fresh herbs like basil or cilantro that can help cool down the heat. So don't worry, even if you don't like spicy food, you can still enjoy many delicious dishes in Thailand. Just be sure to communicate your preferences to your server, and they will be happy to accommodate you."
