Can you tell me more about what happened after that meeting? What were some key events, milestones, or tasks that you accomplished?\n\nAlso, do you have any notes, calendars, or to-do lists from the past few months that you can refer to? If so, feel free to share them with me, and I can help you make sense of them.\n\nLet's work together to reconstruct your schedule and get you prepared for your upcoming project!"
