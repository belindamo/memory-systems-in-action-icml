      "content": "What a great idea! Roasting a big batch of vegetables on Sundays is a fantastic way to meal prep and have healthy snacks throughout the week. Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, and red onions are a fantastic combination, and here are some additional vegetables that pair well with them:\n\n1. **Carrots**: Sliced or chopped carrots roast beautifully and add a sweet, crunchy texture to the mix.\n2. **Cauliflower**: Similar to Brussels sprouts, cauliflower florets roast up tender and caramelized, with a lovely contrast in texture.\n3. **Broccoli**: Another cruciferous vegetable that roasts well, broccoli adds a burst of green to the mix and pairs nicely with the sweetness of sweet potatoes.\n4. **Parsnips**: If you like sweet potatoes, you'll love parsnips! They're sweeter and nuttier, and roast up beautifully.\n5. **Beets**: Beets add a lovely pop of color and a sweet, earthy flavor. They're a bit sweeter than sweet potatoes, so they balance out nicely.\n6. **Celery Root**: If you haven't tried roasting celery root, you're in for a treat! It's similar to sweet potatoes but with a more delicate, celery-like flavor.\n7. **Garlic**: Okay, not a vegetable, but a must-add to your roasting pan! Mince a few cloves of garlic and scatter them throughout the pan for added depth of flavor.\n\nWhen roasting, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* Cut the vegetables into similar-sized pieces so they roast evenly.\n* Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and any other seasonings you like (e.g., dried herbs, paprika, chili flakes).\n* Spread the vegetables out in a single layer on a large baking sheet to ensure even roasting.\n* Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for about 25-35 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and caramelized, flipping halfway through.\n\nEnjoy your roasted vegetable extravaganza, and happy snacking throughout the week!"

Gochujang is a fantastic ingredient to experiment with, and I think you'll find it pairs well with a variety of ingredients.\n\nAnd yay for adding soy sauce to your chicken stir-fry recipe!

Also, feel free to adjust the level of heat to your liking by adding more or less gochujang.\n\nIf you're looking for more Korean-inspired recipes or flavor combinations, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions. Korean cuisine is known for its bold flavors, spices, and fermented ingredients, so there are plenty of exciting options to explore!\n\nKeep experimenting, and I hope you have fun making your Korean-Style Gochujang Vinaigrette this weekend!"
