Money20/20 brings together industry leaders, startups, and innovators to share insights and showcase the latest fintech solutions.\n2. **Shoptalk**: This e-commerce and retail conference is scheduled to take place from March 26-29, 2023, at the LVCC.

PayThink explores the future of payments, digital commerce, and financial innovation.\n\nAs for the Tech Expo 2022, I think there might be some confusion - Las Vegas is a city located in the state of Nevada, so it's possible that the Tech Expo 2022 was indeed held in Las Vegas, but not in a different city within Nevada.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more fintech and e-commerce events in Las Vegas or Nevada, I can suggest some other options:\n\n* **Las Vegas Fintech Week**: This event typically takes place in October and features a series of fintech-focused conferences, workshops, and networking opportunities.\n* **E-commerce Summit**: This event is usually held in June and focuses on the latest e-commerce trends, strategies, and innovations.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like more information on these events or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
