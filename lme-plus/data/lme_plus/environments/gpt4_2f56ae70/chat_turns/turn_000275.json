  "content": "That's a great start! With Disney+ having a vast library of nature documentaries, it might take some digging, but I'll do my best to help you find the one you're thinking of.\n\nBased on your description, here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Our Planet** (2019) - This is a Netflix original series, but Disney+ has a similar series called **One Day at Disney** (2019), which might have similar stunning footage.\n2. **Dynasties** (2018) - This BBC series, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, explores the social dynamics of five endangered species. It's a serious and educational series with breathtaking footage.\n3. **Blue Planet II** (2017) - Another BBC series, also narrated by Sir David Attenborough, this one focuses on marine life. While it's not exclusively produced by Disney, it's available on Disney+.\n4. **Wild Yellowstone** (2020) - This Disney+ original series explores the wildlife and ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park.\n5. **America the Beautiful** (2022) - This Disney+ original series showcases the natural wonders of the United States, with a focus on conservation and the importance of protecting the environment.\n\nIf none of these sound quite right, please let me know and I can continue to ask questions to help narrow down the search. For example:\n\n* Do you remember any specific animals or habitats featured in the documentary?\n* Was there a particular episode or scene that stuck with you?\n* Was the documentary focused on a specific region or ecosystem?\n* Do you remember when you watched it during your free trial (e.g., was it near the beginning or end of the trial)?",
