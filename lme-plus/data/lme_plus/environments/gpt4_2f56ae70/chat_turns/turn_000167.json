He had never seen buildings like these before, with their old-fashioned brick facades and ornate metalwork. Even the cars looked different, with their boxy shapes and bright, bold colors.\n\nAs they walked, they passed by a group of teenagers loitering on the corner, smoking cigarettes and wearing leather jackets.\n\n\"Hey, check out the new kids,\" one of them sneered, taking a drag from his cigarette.\n\nTommy and Mark quickened their pace, feeling uncomfortable under the hostile stares of the group.\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" Mark whispered, tugging on Tommy's arm.\n\nAs they turned the corner, Tommy couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.
