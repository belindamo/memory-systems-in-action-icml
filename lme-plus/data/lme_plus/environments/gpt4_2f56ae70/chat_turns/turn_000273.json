(e.g. nature, history, science, sports, etc.)\n* Was it a series or a standalone documentary?\n* Do you remember any specific scenes, quotes, or images from the documentary?\n* Was it a recent documentary or did it feel like it was older?\n* Was it produced by Disney or was it a third-party production?\n* Did it have a particular tone or style? (e.g. serious, light-hearted, educational, etc.)\n* Was it narrated by a specific person or did it have a particular host?\n\nAny details you can provide will help me narrow down the search.
