  "content": "That sounds like a great plan! Starting with a few new plants and observing how they do will help you refine your care routine and ensure they thrive.\n\nThe shelf near your living room window is an excellent spot for your new plants. Natural light is essential for most plants, and being close to Felix will make it easy for you to monitor their progress and adjust their care as needed.\n\nSince you're placing the plants near Felix, you might want to consider a few things to ensure they coexist harmoniously:\n\n1. **Light competition**: Fiddle leaf figs can grow quite large and might block some of the light from reaching your new plants. Make sure to prune Felix regularly to maintain a balanced shape and allow sufficient light to reach the other plants.\n2. **Watering**: Fiddle leaf figs prefer more water than succulents or air plants. Be cautious not to overwater your new plants, and consider using a moisture meter to ensure the soil isn't too wet or dry.\n3. **Temperature**: Most houseplants prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). Since your new plants will be near Felix, they'll likely be in a similar temperature range.\n\nBy being mindful of these factors, you can create a thriving plant community that brings joy and beauty to your living room.\n\nRemember, it's always exciting to welcome new plants to your family! Enjoy the process of learning and growing with your new additions, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.",
