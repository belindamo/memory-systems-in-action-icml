  "content": "Let me try to dig deeper.\n\nSince you mentioned it was focused on a specific type of animal, I'll ask:\n\n* Was it a mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, or insect-focused documentary?\n* Was it about a well-known animal, like elephants, wolves, or bears, or was it about a more unusual or lesser-known species?\n* Do you remember any specific behaviors or habits of the animals that were showcased in the documentary?\n* Was there a particular habitat or environment that the documentary focused on, such as deserts, oceans, forests, or mountains?\n\nAdditionally, since you mentioned it was really well-made with amazing footage, I'll ask:\n\n* Do you remember any notable camera techniques, such as drone footage, underwater cinematography, or time-lapses?\n* Was the documentary narrated by a specific person, or was it more of a \"fly on the wall\" observational style?\n* Did the documentary have a strong conservation or environmental message, or was it more focused on showcasing the natural behavior of the animals?\n\nAny details you can provide will help me try to find the documentary you're thinking of.",
