It's a serious and educational film that showcases the elephants' social bonds, habitat, and conservation status.\n2. **The Great Bear Rainforest** (2020) - This documentary film, also on Disney+, explores the lives of grizzly bears in the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. It's a serious and informative film that delves into the bears' daily lives, habitat, and the challenges they face in the wild.\n3. **Polar Bear: Spy on the Ice** (2020) - This documentary film, part of the **Spy in the Wild** series, uses innovative camera technology to capture the daily lives of polar bears in the Arctic. It's a serious and educational film that showcases the bears' habitat, behavior, and conservation status.\n\nIf none of these sound quite right, please let me know and I can continue to ask questions to help narrow down the search.\n\nHere are a few more questions to help us get closer:\n\n* Do you remember any specific scenes or moments from the documentary that stood out to you?
