  "content": "Apologies for that mistake earlier. Here's a revision with those changes you requested:\n\nTommy and Mark tried to ignore the bullies, but they persisted. One of them shoved Mark, causing him to stumble backwards.\n\n\"Watch where you're going, fairy boy,\" the bully sneered.\n\nTommy's blood boiled at the insult. He stepped forward to defend his friend, but another bully blocked his way.\n\n\"Where do you think you're going, little girl?\" the bully taunted, a sneer on his face.\n\nTommy's fists clenched, but he knew he was no match for the bigger, older boys. He glanced at Mark, who looked just as scared as he was.\n\n\"Come on, let's get out of here,\" Mark whispered, pulling on Tommy's arm.\n\nBut before they could make their escape, the bullies closed in on them. One of them grabbed Tommy's shirt, pulling him close.\n\n\"What's the matter, princess? You and your boyfriend scared?\" the bully jeered.\n\nTommy tried to push him away, but the bully was too strong. Mark stepped forward to help, but the other bullies surrounded him, throwing punches and insults.\n\n\"Leave us alone!\" Tommy shouted, his voice cracking with fear.\n\nBut the bullies just laughed, continuing their assault.\n\nIt wasn't until an older man came out of a nearby store and intervened that the boys were able to escape. As they ran away, Tommy felt a mix of relief and shame. He couldn't believe that people could be so cruel to others just because they were different.\n\nHe and Mark didn't say anything to each other as they walked back to where they had arrived in the past. They were both lost in their own thoughts, trying to process what had just happened.\n\nAs they stood there in silence, Tommy's eyes fell on the watch on his wrist. He wondered if there was a way to use it to go back to their own time, to escape the harsh realities of the past. But he knew that wasn't possible. They were stuck there, and they would have to face whatever else came their way.",
