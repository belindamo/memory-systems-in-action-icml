  "content": "Tommy and Mark continued to walk down the street, still trying to make sense of their surroundings. As they turned a corner, they saw a group of boys up ahead, gathered around something.\n\n\"What's going on over there?\" Mark asked, his curiosity piqued.\n\nTommy hesitated, a feeling of unease creeping up in his chest. \"I don't know, but maybe we should just keep walking.\"\n\nBut it was too late. One of the boys noticed them and shouted, \"Hey, what are you two queers doing here?\"\n\nTommy and Mark froze, unsure of how to respond.\n\nThe boys advanced towards them, their faces twisted with malice. \"You don't belong here,\" one of them spat. \"Get out before we make you.\"\n\nTommy felt a sense of dread wash over him as he realized that they were being targeted for no other reason than their difference. He had never experienced anything like this before, and he didn't know how to react.\n\nBut Mark was not about to back down. \"Hey, we're just passing through,\" he said, trying to sound confident. \"No need to get all worked up.\"\n\nBut the boys didn't listen. They continued to taunt and jeer, throwing insults at them that Tommy had never heard before. He felt his face flush with shame and humiliation, wishing he could just disappear.\n\nJust then, a man came running out of one of the nearby buildings, shouting at the boys to stop.\n\n\"Leave them alone, you idiots!\" he yelled. \"What do you think you're doing?\"\n\nThe boys scattered, disappearing down different streets. Tommy and Mark were left standing there, feeling shaken and vulnerable.\n\n\"What was that all about?\" Mark asked, still trying to catch his breath.\n\nTommy shook his head, \"I don't know, but I don't like it here. I don't belong in this time.\"\n\nMark put a reassuring hand on his friend's shoulder. \"Don't worry, we'll figure it out. We'll get back home.\"\n\nTommy nodded, but deep down he knew it wouldn't be that simple. The harsh realities of bullying and isolation in the past were much worse than anything he had experienced in his own time, and he wasn't sure he was ready to confront them head-on.",
