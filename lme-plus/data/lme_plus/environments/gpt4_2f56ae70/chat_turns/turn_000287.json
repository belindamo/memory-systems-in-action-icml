Being open to different travel dates can definitely help you score cheaper flights to Paris or Amsterdam. Here are some tips to increase your chances of finding a good deal:\n\n1. **Be flexible with your travel dates**: Consider flying on off-peak days, such as Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Saturdays, when prices tend to be lower.\n2. **Avoid peak travel seasons**: Summer is a popular time to visit both Paris and Amsterdam, so prices might be higher during June, July, and August. If you can, plan your trip during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October), when prices tend to be more reasonable.\n3. **Use fare comparison tools**: Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak allow you to compare prices across different airlines, airports, and dates.\n4. **Set up price alerts**: Services like Scott's Cheap Flights, Airfarewatchdog, or The Flight Deal offer email alerts when prices drop or when error fares become available.\n5. **Consider alternative airports**: If you have multiple airport options, check prices for each airport to find the best deal. For example, Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS) might be cheaper than Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) on certain dates.\n6. **Book in advance**: Generally, the earlier you book, the cheaper the flights. However, it's essential to monitor prices and be prepared to pounce on a good deal when you see one.\n7. **Look for error fares or sales**: Keep an eye on airline websites, social media, or flight deal websites for mistake fares or special promotions.\n\nTo give you a rough idea, here are some approximate round-trip flight prices from a windy city (Chicago, in this case) to Paris and Amsterdam:\n\n* Paris (CDG):\n\t+ Peak season (June-August): $800-$1,200\n\t+ Shoulder season (April-May or September-October): $500-$900\n\t+ Off-peak season (November-March): $400-$700\n* Amsterdam (AMS):\n\t+ Peak season (June-August): $700-$1,100\n\t+ Shoulder season (April-May or September-October): $450-$800\n\t+ Off-peak season (November-March): $350-$600\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and prices can vary depending on the airline, flight duration, and other factors.\n\nBy being flexible with your travel dates and using the right tools, you might be able to find a good deal on flights to Paris or Amsterdam.
