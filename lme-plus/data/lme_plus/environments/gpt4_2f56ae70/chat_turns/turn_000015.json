  "content": "Balanced fertilizers can be a good starting point, but peace lilies do have specific needs.\n\nPeace lilies prefer a fertilizer that's high in phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), as these macronutrients promote healthy root growth, blooming, and overall plant development. A balanced fertilizer with a slightly higher P and K ratio can be beneficial.\n\nHere are some fertilizer recommendations that are gentle on peace lilies:\n\n1. **Miracle-Gro Indoor Plant Food**: This is a popular, water-soluble fertilizer that's specifically formulated for indoor plants like peace lilies. It has a balanced N-P-K ratio of 24-8-16, with a slightly higher phosphorus content to support blooming and root growth.\n2. **Schultz All Purpose Plant Food**: This fertilizer has a balanced N-P-K ratio of 20-20-20, but it's also gentle on plants and won't cause excessive growth or burning. It's a good option if you want a general-purpose fertilizer that won't overwhelm your peace lily.\n3. **Espoma Organic Indoor Plant Fertilizer**: If you prefer an organic option, Espoma's fertilizer is a great choice. It's made from natural ingredients like bone meal, alfalfa meal, and feather meal, and has a slow-release formula that won't cause sudden growth spurts. The N-P-K ratio is 2-2-2, which is gentle on peace lilies.\n4. **E.B. Stone Organics Bloom!**: This fertilizer is specifically designed to promote blooming and fruiting in plants, making it a great option for peace lilies. It has a slightly higher phosphorus content (5-3-4 N-P-K ratio) and is made from natural ingredients like fish bone meal and alfalfa meal.\n\nRemember to always follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging and start with a diluted solution to avoid burning your peace lily's roots. You can also consider fertilizing your peace lily during the growing season (spring and summer) and skipping fertilization during the dormant season (fall and winter).\n\nI hope this helps, and happy fertilizing!",
