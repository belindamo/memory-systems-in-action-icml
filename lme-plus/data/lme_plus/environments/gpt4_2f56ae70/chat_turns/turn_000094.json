  "content": "I'll probably journal right before bed, as part of my relaxing bedtime routine. I think it'll help me unwind and process my emotions before sleep. I'll try to set aside 10-15 minutes each night to journal, and see how it goes. If I need more time, I can always adjust. I'm looking forward to seeing how journaling will help me reflect on my therapy sessions and mental health journey.",
