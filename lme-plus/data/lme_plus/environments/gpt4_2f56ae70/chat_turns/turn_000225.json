  "content": "Yes, during the Vietnam War, women were restricted to serving in certain support roles such as clerks, typists, and telephone operators. While women were technically eligible for service in the military, they were not allowed to serve in combat positions or in positions that brought them too close to combat. This limited their exposure to the dangers of combat and their ability to interact with male soldiers. Despite these restrictions, many women still served bravely and made significant contributions to the war effort, but their experiences were often marginalized and their service was not fully recognized until much later.",
