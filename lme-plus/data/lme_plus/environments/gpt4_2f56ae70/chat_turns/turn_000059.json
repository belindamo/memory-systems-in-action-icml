Women and children: IRC prioritizes women and children, who are the most vulnerable to violence and exploitation during displacement. \n\n2. Survivors of violence: IRC gives priority to refugees who have survived violence, including gender-based violence, torture, or other forms of trauma. \n\n3. People with medical needs: IRC prioritizes refugees with medical needs, such as chronic illnesses or disabilities, who require immediate medical attention or access to care. \n\n4. Unaccompanied or separated children: IRC prioritizes unaccompanied or separated children and works to reunite them with their families or caregivers as quickly as possible. \n\n5. LGBTQ+ refugees: IRC prioritizes LGBTQ+ refugees who can face discrimination, persecution, and violence in their countries of origin and may require additional support and protection. \n\n6. Elderly refugees: IRC prioritizes elderly refugees who may require special assistance and services to meet their unique needs. \n\nOverall, IRC prioritizes refugees based on their vulnerability and need for assistance, with a focus on protecting those who are most at risk. The organization\u2019s goal is to provide support to those who need it most, regardless of their race, religion, or background.",
