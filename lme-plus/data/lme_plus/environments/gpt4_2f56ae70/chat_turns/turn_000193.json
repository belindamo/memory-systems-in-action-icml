  "content": "What a great idea! Roasting a big batch of vegetables on Sundays is a fantastic way to meal prep and have healthy snacks throughout the week. Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, and red onions are a fantastic combination, and here are some additional vegetables that pair well with them:\n\n1. **Carrots**: Sliced or chopped carrots roast beautifully and add a sweet, crunchy texture to the mix.\n2. **Cauliflower**: Similar to Brussels sprouts, cauliflower florets roast up tender and caramelized, with a lovely contrast in texture.\n3. **Broccoli**: Another cruciferous vegetable that roasts well, broccoli adds a burst of green to the mix and pairs nicely with the sweetness of sweet potatoes.\n4. **Parsnips**: If you like sweet potatoes, you'll love parsnips! They're sweeter and nuttier, and roast up beautifully.\n5. **Beets**: Beets add a lovely pop of color and a sweet, earthy flavor. They're a bit sweeter than sweet potatoes, so they balance out nicely.\n6. **Celery Root**: If you haven't tried roasting celery root, you're in for a treat! It's similar to sweet potatoes but with a more delicate, celery-like flavor.\n7. **Garlic**: Okay, not a vegetable, but a must-add to your roasting pan! Mince a few cloves of garlic and scatter them throughout the pan for added depth of flavor.\n\nWhen roasting, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* Cut the vegetables into similar-sized pieces so they roast evenly.\n* Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and any other seasonings you like (e.g., dried herbs, paprika, chili flakes).\n* Spread the vegetables out in a single layer on a large baking sheet to ensure even roasting.\n* Roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for about 25-35 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and caramelized, flipping halfway through.\n\nEnjoy your roasted vegetable extravaganza, and happy snacking throughout the week!",
