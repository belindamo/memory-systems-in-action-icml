  "content": "The \"Calculated fields\" feature in Google Data Studio is a powerful tool that allows you to create custom calculations based on your dataset. Here's an example of how to create a custom calculation based on the blended dataset we created earlier:\n\n**Example: Calculating Conversion Rate**\n\nLet's say you want to calculate the conversion rate of website visitors who make a purchase. You can create a custom calculation to divide the number of sales by the number of sessions.\n\n**Step 1: Access the Calculated Fields panel**\n\n1. Click on the \"Data\" tab in the top navigation menu.\n2. Select the blended dataset that we created earlier.\n3. Click on the \"Calculated fields\" button in the top right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Create a new calculated field**\n\n1. Click on the \"New field\" button.\n2. Enter a name for your calculated field (e.g., \"Conversion Rate\").\n3. Select the \"Formula\" option.\n\n**Step 3: Define the calculation**\n\n1. In the formula editor, enter the following formula: `SUM(Sales) / SUM(Sessions)`\n2. This formula divides the sum of sales by the sum of sessions to calculate the conversion rate.\n3. Click \"Apply\" to apply the formula.\n\n**Step 4: Format the calculated field**\n\n1. In the \"Format\" section, select the format for your calculated field (e.g., \"Percentage\").\n2. Choose the number of decimal places you want to display (e.g., 2).\n3. Click \"Apply\" to apply the format.\n\n**Step 5: Use the calculated field in a chart**\n\n1. Click on the \"Insert\" tab in the top navigation menu.\n2. Select a chart type (e.g., Table) that suits your data.\n3. Drag and drop the chart onto the canvas.\n4. Configure the chart settings:\n\t* Select the blended dataset as the data source.\n\t* Choose the calculated field (Conversion Rate) as the metric.\n\t* Apply any necessary filters or aggregations.\n5. Click \"Apply\" to apply the chart settings.\n\n**Result:**\n\nYou now have a custom calculation that shows the conversion rate of website visitors who make a purchase. You can use this calculated field in various charts and tables to analyze and visualize your data.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use the \"Calculated fields\" feature to create custom calculations based on multiple datasets or blended datasets.\n* Create calculated fields that use conditional statements (e.g., IF, CASE) to handle complex logic.\n* Use the \"Calculated fields\" feature to create custom metrics that are not available in the original dataset.\n* Experiment with different formulas and formats to optimize your calculated fields.\n\nBy creating custom calculations with the \"Calculated fields\" feature, you can unlock new insights and metrics that are specific to your business needs.",
