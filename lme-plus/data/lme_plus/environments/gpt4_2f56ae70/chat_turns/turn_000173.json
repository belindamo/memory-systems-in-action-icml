They couldn't believe how cruel people could be to each other, and they both knew that they had to be careful if they were going to make it out of this era in one piece.\n\nAs they walked back towards the center of town, they noticed that the streets were quieter now. The people they passed seemed more wary, and they couldn't help but feel like they didn't belong here.\n\n\"Tommy, we can't stay here,\" Mark said, breaking the silence between them. \"We have to figure out a way to get back to our own time.\"\n\nTommy nodded, feeling the weight of their situation settling heavily on his shoulders. \"I know,\" he replied, his voice barely above a whisper. \"But how do we do that?\"\n\nMark shrugged, his eyes scanning the unfamiliar streets. \"I don't know, man. But we have to try. We can't stay here forever.\"\n\nAs they continued to walk, Tommy's thoughts drifted back to the boy they had seen being bullied earlier. He wondered what had happened to him and if there was anything he could do to help. He had never felt so helpless in his life, and the memory of the boy's terrified face stayed with him long after they had left the scene.\n\nLittle did Tommy know that he would soon be faced with a similar situation, and this time, he wouldn't be able to walk away.
