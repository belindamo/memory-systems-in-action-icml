After a week of journaling, I hope to feel more mindful and self-aware, with a better understanding of my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I'm hoping to see changes in my ability to manage my anxiety and depression, and to feel more in control of my emotions. I'm also hoping that journaling will help me develop a more positive mindset and increase my self-compassion.",
