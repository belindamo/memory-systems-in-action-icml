  "content": "If you have six measurements spread between before and after transition for each player, a repeated-measures ANOVA would be a suitable method to investigate the development of strength over time.\n\nRepeated-measures ANOVA is used to compare means across multiple time points in a within-subjects design. In this case, the strength measurements taken before and after the transition are the repeated measures. This type of ANOVA can help determine whether there is a significant difference in strength development across time points and whether the transition from academy to elite level has an effect on strength development.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a linear mixed-effects model to account for the repeated measures and individual differences in the data. This type of model can take into account the fact that the measurements are correlated and can also model individual trajectories of strength development.\n\nBoth methods would allow you to investigate the changes in strength over time and how these changes are related to the transition from academy to elite level. The choice between the two methods would depend on the specific research question and the characteristics of the data.",
