But I can suggest a few ways to help you find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. **Check the museum's website**: You can visit the National Museum of History's official website to see their current and upcoming exhibits. They usually have a section dedicated to exhibitions, which lists the title, description, and duration of each exhibit.\n2. **Social media and online calendars**: Follow the museum's social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) or check online event calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Eventbrite) to stay updated on their current and upcoming exhibits.\n3. **Contact the museum directly**: You can call or email the museum's information desk or visitor services department to ask about their current exhibits. They should be able to provide you with the information you need.\n4. **Plan your visit**: Once you have the information, plan your visit according to the exhibits that interest you the most. You can also check if they offer guided tours like the \"Ancient Civilizations\" tour you attended earlier.\n\nIt's great to hear that you enjoyed the guided tour! Guided tours can definitely enhance your museum experience and provide valuable insights into the exhibits.\n\nRemember to check the museum's website or contact them directly for the most up-to-date information on their current exhibits.
