You can always adjust to taste.\n* Whisk or blend the vinaigrette ingredients until smooth and emulsified.\n* Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n* Store any leftover vinaigrette in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.\n\nChoose one of these vinaigrettes, or feel free to experiment with different combinations of herbs and flavors to create your own signature vinaigrette!\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your dinner party will be a huge success!",
