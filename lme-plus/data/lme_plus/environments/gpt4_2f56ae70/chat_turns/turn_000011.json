  "content": "To create a chart that shows the conversion rate over time, you can use a line chart or an area chart. Here's how:\n\n**Step 1: Create a new chart**\n\n1. Click on the \"Insert\" tab in the top navigation menu.\n2. Select a chart type (e.g., Line chart or Area chart) that suits your data.\n3. Drag and drop the chart onto the canvas.\n\n**Step 2: Configure the chart settings**\n\n1. Select the blended dataset as the data source.\n2. Choose the \"Date\" dimension as the X-axis.\n3. Choose the \"Conversion Rate\" calculated field as the Y-axis.\n4. Apply any necessary filters or aggregations.\n\n**Step 3: Customize the chart**\n\n1. Click on the \"Style\" tab in the top navigation menu.\n2. Customize the chart style as desired (e.g., colors, fonts, etc.).\n3.
