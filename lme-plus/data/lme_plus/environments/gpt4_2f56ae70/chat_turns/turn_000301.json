These programs are usually led by experienced park rangers, naturalists, or birding experts who know the best locations, habits, and behaviors of the eagles.\n\n**Check with the Park:**\n\nI recommend contacting the state park directly to inquire about:\n\n1. **Guided Bird Walks**: Ask if they offer guided bird walks or nature programs focused on Bald Eagles or birdwatching in general.\n2. **Eagle-Viewing Tours**: Some parks may offer specialized tours or viewing sessions specifically for Bald Eagles, which might include expert guidance and access to restricted areas.\n3. **Program Schedules**: Find out the schedules for these programs, as they may only be offered on specific days or times of the year.\n4. **Registration and Fees**: Ask about any registration requirements, fees, or limitations for these programs.\n\n**Park Resources:**\n\nAdditionally, you can also:\n\n1. **Check the Park's Website**: Visit the state park's website to look for information on birdwatching, Bald Eagles, or nature programs.\n2. **Contact the Park's Nature Center**: Reach out to the park's nature center or visitor center for information on guided walks, programs, and eagle sightings.\n3. **Follow Park Social Media**: Follow the park's social media accounts, which may post updates on eagle sightings, program schedules, or other birding-related information.\n\nBy taking advantage of these resources, you'll not only increase your chances of spotting Bald Eagles but also gain a deeper understanding of these magnificent birds and their habitats.\n\nRemember to respect the park's rules and regulations, as well as the eagles' habitat, to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for both you and the wildlife.",
