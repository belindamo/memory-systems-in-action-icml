It's also helpful to break down my writing goals into smaller chunks, so I don't feel overwhelmed. Since I've been experimenting with different forms and styles, like haikus and free verse, I think it would be useful to set aside time to focus on one specific form for a few weeks. Do you have any suggestions on how to structure this focused practice, and how often I should review my progress?",
