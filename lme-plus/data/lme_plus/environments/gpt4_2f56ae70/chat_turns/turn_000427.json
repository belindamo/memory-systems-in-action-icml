  "content": "**Using Frozen Bell Peppers:**\nYes, you can definitely use frozen bell peppers for the Grilled Chicken Fajitas! In fact, frozen bell peppers can be just as nutritious and flavorful as fresh ones, especially if they're flash-frozen soon after harvesting. Just thaw them first by leaving them in room temperature for a few hours or by microwaving them according to the package instructions. Pat them dry with paper towels before grilling to remove excess moisture. Keep in mind that frozen bell peppers might be softer and more prone to breaking apart when grilled, so be gentle when handling them.\n\n**Budget-Friendly Side Dish Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Mexican Street Corn**: Grill or boil corn on the cob, then slather with a mixture of mayonnaise, lime juice, chili powder, and crumbled cotija cheese.\n2. **Cilantro Lime Rice**: Cook white or brown rice with diced onion, garlic, and cilantro. Mix in lime juice, salt, and a squeeze of olive oil.\n3. **Roasted Sweet Potato Wedges**: Toss diced sweet potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast in the oven at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n4. **Black Bean Salad**: Mix cooked black beans with diced onion, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Add a splash of olive oil and a pinch of salt.\n5. **Garlic and Herb Roasted Carrots**: Toss carrot sticks with olive oil, minced garlic, chopped fresh herbs (like parsley, thyme, or rosemary), salt, and pepper. Roast in the oven at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n6. **Mixed Greens Salad**: Combine mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a sprinkle of crumbled queso fresco or feta cheese. Drizzle with a homemade vinaigrette made from olive oil, lime juice, and a pinch of salt.\n\nThese side dishes are all easy on the budget and can be prepared in no time. They'll complement your Grilled Chicken Fajitas and other dishes nicely, adding some freshness, texture, and flavor to your dinner party.\n\nI hope this helps!",
