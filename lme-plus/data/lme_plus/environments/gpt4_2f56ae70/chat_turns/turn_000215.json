  "content": "Ancient Egyptian artifacts are always fascinating! While I don't have real-time access to the museum's current exhibits, I can suggest some general information about what you might expect to find.\n\nMany museums with ancient Egyptian collections have exhibits that feature mummies and mummification practices. These exhibits often include interactive displays, videos, and hands-on activities to help visitors understand the process of mummification.\n\nSome possible interactive exhibits or displays you might find at the National Museum of History include:\n\n1. **Mummification simulation**: A digital or hands-on simulation that allows you to explore the step-by-step process of mummification, from evisceration to wrapping the body in linen bandages.\n2. **Virtual unwrapping**: A digital display that uses CT scans or 3D imaging to virtually \"unwrap\" a mummy, revealing the layers of wrappings and the body beneath.\n3. **Conservation labs**: Some museums have glass-enclosed conservation labs where visitors can observe conservators working on ancient artifacts, including mummies. You might be able to ask questions or learn about the latest conservation techniques.\n4. **Interactive displays on mummification techniques**: Exhibits that allow you to learn about the different materials used in mummification, such as natron, resin, and linen, and how they were used to preserve the body.\n5. **Recreations of ancient Egyptian tombs**: Immersive exhibits that recreate the environment of an ancient Egyptian tomb, complete with sarcophagi, mummies, and funerary objects.\n\nKeep in mind that the specific exhibits and interactive displays may vary depending on the museum and their current exhibitions. I recommend checking the museum's website or contacting them directly to confirm what's available during your visit.\n\nEnjoy your visit to the National Museum of History, and I hope you have a fascinating time exploring the ancient Egyptian artifacts!",
