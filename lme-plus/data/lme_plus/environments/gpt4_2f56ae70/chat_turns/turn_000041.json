The Acropolis (Greece): The Acropolis is an ancient citadel located on a rocky hill above the city of Athens. The ancient site had been damaged by pollution, weather and visitors, so in the 1970s, the Greek government launched a major restoration and preservation project that included cleaning, restoration of damaged structures, and new visitor management measures.\n\n2. Angkor Wat (Cambodia): Angkor Wat is a temple complex in Cambodia, and it was built in the early 12th century. The site had been neglected for centuries, and during the 1970s and 80s, looting and deforestation threatened the site's survival. After the end of the Khmer Rouge regime, the site was preserved and restored, and it is now an awe-inspiring tourist attraction.\n\n3. Machu Picchu (Peru): Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel in the Andes Mountains of Peru. In the 1980s, the site was threatened by mass tourism and environmental degradation. In 1993, an organization was established to help restore and preserve the site, including measures to limit visitor numbers, control erosion, and restore damaged structures.\n\n4. Petra (Jordan): Petra is an ancient city carved into the pink sandstone cliffs of southern Jordan. The site was rediscovered in the 19th century and subsequently exposed to the elements and visitors. In 1985, UNESCO, together with the Jordanian government, launched a project to preserve the site, which included restoration of the facades of ancient buildings, stabilization of rock walls, and repair of water systems.\n\nThese examples showcase some of the most successful approaches to landmark preservation, involving a combination of government support, international cooperation, community engagement, and targeted restoration and conservation work.",
