  "content": "IRC prioritizes its assistance to refugees based on vulnerability and need, so refugees who don\u2019t fall into the categories I mentioned earlier are still eligible for assistance based on their individual needs. The organization conducts assessments to identify the needs of refugees and their families, including the elderly, single-parent families, and those with limited education or job skills. IRC also works to empower refugees to become self-sufficient, prioritizing those with the potential to become self-sufficient with the right support. \n\nWhen individuals or families seek assistance from the IRC, they are assessed by a caseworker or social worker who will determine their level of need and provide referrals to appropriate services. Based on this assessment, the IRC will provide refugees with a personalized package of interventions to support their resettlement process, which may include assistance with employment, housing, education, and health care. \n\nIn short, while IRC prioritizes assistance based on certain categories of vulnerability and need, it also provides individualized support to refugees based on their unique circumstances and needs. The organization is committed to offering a comprehensive range of services to help refugees become self-sufficient and rebuild their lives after displacement.",
