They take the form of an animal, and each daemon is unique to its human counterpart. Daemons are:\n\n* **External souls**: Daemons are separate entities from their humans, yet inextricably linked. They can move independently, but if they're separated from their human, they'll eventually fade away.\n* **Shape-shifters**: Daemons can change shape at will, often reflecting their human's personality, mood, or environment. Children's daemons can change shape frequently, while adults' daemons typically settle into a fixed form.\n* **Conscious beings**: Daemons have their own thoughts, feelings, and personalities, but they're also deeply attuned to their human's emotions and needs.\n* **Protectors and companions**: Daemons serve as a person's moral compass, offering guidance and comfort. They're fiercely loyal and will defend their human at all costs.\n\nIn Lyra's World, daemons are an integral part of daily life. People often consult with their daemons, and daemons are considered an extension of their human's identity.\n\n**Dust**\n\nDust, also known as Rusakov particles, is a mysterious, omnipresent substance that permeates the multiverse. It's:\n\n* **A fundamental particle**: Dust is the building block of all matter, energy, and consciousness. It's the fabric that connects all universes and dimensions.\n* **A symbol of original sin**: In the world of Lyra, the Church teaches that Dust is a manifestation of humanity's original sin, corrupting and tainting all living beings.\n* **A source of power**: Dust is coveted by those seeking to understand and control the universe. It's believed to hold the secrets of creation, and those who harness its power can wield immense influence.\n* **A connection to the universe**: Dust is linked to the consciousness of all beings, allowing for a deep connection between humans, daemons, and the natural world.\n\nThe concept of Dust is central to the series, as it's tied to the mysteries of the universe, the nature of consciousness, and the struggle for power. The Magisterium and other factions seek to control Dust, while Lyra and her allies aim to understand and protect it.\n\nThese two concepts \u2013 daemons and Dust \u2013 are deeply intertwined, and as you read the series, you'll discover how they're connected and how they shape the world of Lyra and beyond.\n\nDo you have any more questions about daemons or Dust, or would you like to know more about the world-building or characters in \"His Dark Materials\"?",
