In a state park with lakes, rivers, or coastal areas, they typically hunt for:\n\n1. **Trout**: Rainbow trout, brown trout, and brook trout are common prey in freshwater lakes and streams.\n2. **Bass**: Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and striped bass are often found in lakes and rivers.\n3. **Panfish**: Species like bluegill, sunfish, and crappie are also on the menu.\n\nBald Eagles usually hunt by swooping down from a perch or hovering over the water, scanning for fish. They have exceptional eyesight, with a visual acuity of 4-8 times stronger than humans.\n\n**Specific Areas to Spot Bald Eagles in the Park:**\n\nWhile it's essential to respect the eagles' habitat and not disturb them, here are some areas within the park where you might be more likely to spot them:\n\n1. **Lake Shores and Riverbanks**: Look for areas with shallow water, structure (like rocks or weed beds), and abundant fish populations.\n2. **Fishing Spots**: Popular fishing areas, like piers, boat launches, or areas with fish attractors, may attract Bald Eagles.\n3. **Mouths of Streams or Creeks**: Where freshwater streams or creeks flow into larger bodies of water, you may see Bald Eagles hunting for fish.\n4. **Treetops and Perches**: Scan the treetops and power lines for perched eagles, especially near water bodies or hunting areas.\n5. **Open Water**: Look for Bald Eagles soaring over open water, scanning for fish or riding thermals.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Be aware of your surroundings**: Pay attention to your environment and keep an eye out for other wildlife, like osprey, hawks, or otters, which may indicate the presence of fish and, therefore, Bald Eagles.\n2. **Listen for calls**: Bald Eagles make a distinctive, high-pitched \"kree-kree-kree\" sound, which can help you locate them.\n3. **Dress appropriately**: Wear clothing that blends in with the surroundings, and avoid sudden movements or loud noises that might scare the eagles away.\n\nBy following these tips and being patient, you should increase your chances of spotting Bald Eagles during your visit to the state park. Good luck, and I hope you have a fantastic time!",
