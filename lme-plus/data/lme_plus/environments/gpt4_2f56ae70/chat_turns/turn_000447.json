As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal relationships or interactions with individuals, so I'm not aware of any Alex or their secret BBQ recipe.\n\nHowever, I can provide some general tips on how to politely ask someone for their secret recipe:\n\n1. **Show genuine interest**: Express your admiration for their cooking skills and let them know how much you enjoy their BBQ.\n2. **Be respectful**: Acknowledge that their recipe is a treasured secret and that you're not expecting them to share it with you.\n3. **Offer something in return**: You could offer to share one of your own secret recipes or cooking techniques in exchange for theirs.\n4. **Be prepared for a \"no\"**: The person may not be willing to share their secret recipe, and that's okay. Don't pressure them or get upset if they decline.\n5. **Ask for general tips**: If they're not willing to share their exact recipe, you could ask for general tips or advice on how to improve your own BBQ skills.\n\nRemember to always be respectful and considerate of others' intellectual property and culinary secrets.\n\nNow, go ahead and call Smokey's to check their wait times, and I hope you enjoy your BBQ adventure!",
