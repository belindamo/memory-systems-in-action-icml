      "content": "Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a type of database that is distributed across a network of computers. It allows multiple parties to record and verify transactions without the need for a central authority. DLT can be used to create a variety of applications, including supply chain management, financial transactions, and voting systems.\n\nBlockchain is a specific type of DLT that is best known for its use in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. In a blockchain, transactions are recorded in blocks and added to a chain of blocks in a linear, chronological order. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, which links the blocks together and makes it difficult to alter the transaction data. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology makes it resistant to tampering and censorship.\n\nIn summary, all blockchains are DLTs, but not all DLTs are blockchains."
