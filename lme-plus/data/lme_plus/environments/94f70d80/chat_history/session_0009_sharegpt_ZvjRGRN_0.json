      "content": "The text is a resolution passed by the Kherson District Zemstvo Assembly in 1917. The resolution states that Ukraine should be a part of the federal-democratic Russian Republic as a national territorial autonomous unit, and that the Kherson district has a significant Ukrainian population that cannot be separated from other Ukrainian regions. The resolution also supports the Ukrainian Central Rada and allocates funds to the Ukrainian Central Council."

It only mentions that the Kherson District Zemstvo Assembly, a local government body, recognized the demands of the Universal Central Rada as true and promised to support it morally and materially. It is possible that the Kherson province as a whole may have had a different stance on the matter."

      "content": "It is not clear from the text how Ukraine was associated with the Kherson province. The text mentions that the Kherson District Zemstvo Assembly decided that the Kherson district, although the most Russified of the districts of the Kherson province, still has 75% of the Ukrainian population and cannot be separated from the Ukrainian regions. This suggests that the Kherson district had a significant Ukrainian population and was therefore considered part of the Ukrainian regions. However, it is not clear how the association between Ukraine and the Kherson province was established or what the nature of this association was."
