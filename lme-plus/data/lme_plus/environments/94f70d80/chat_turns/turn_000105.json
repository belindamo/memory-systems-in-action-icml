That there are ways he has been hurt by his own family (use examples from stories in the comics) and then he has acted out in return. He wishes that this cycle would stop with him, and also beginning to realize that everyone is dealing with their own past, even his actual father (Bruce Wayne/Batman) and that even adults have sin they need to repent of and suffering they need help with.
