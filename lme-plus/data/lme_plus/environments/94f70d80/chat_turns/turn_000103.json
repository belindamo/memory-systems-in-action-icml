  "content": "It is not clear from the text how Ukraine was associated with the Kherson province. The text mentions that the Kherson District Zemstvo Assembly decided that the Kherson district, although the most Russified of the districts of the Kherson province, still has 75% of the Ukrainian population and cannot be separated from the Ukrainian regions. This suggests that the Kherson district had a significant Ukrainian population and was therefore considered part of the Ukrainian regions. However, it is not clear how the association between Ukraine and the Kherson province was established or what the nature of this association was.",
