It's always a good idea to ask about getting your belongings back from others, especially when it comes to personal items like jewelry.\n\nYou could casually mention to your roommate that you're planning to get your watch battery replaced and ask if she's had a chance to return your silver hoop earrings yet. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I'm planning to take my watch in for a battery replacement soon. By the way, I was wondering if I could get my silver hoop earrings back from you? I lent them to you a few weeks ago and I'd love to have them back.\"\n\nThis approach is polite and friendly, and it gives your roommate a gentle reminder that you're still waiting for your earrings back. Hopefully, she'll return them to you soon!\n\nRemember to stay calm and respectful when asking for your belongings back, and try not to accuse or blame your roommate for not returning them yet. Good luck, and I hope you get your earrings back soon!",
