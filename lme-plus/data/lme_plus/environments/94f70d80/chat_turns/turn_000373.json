However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to personal experiences or memories, so I don't have any information about your sister's birthday party or your gluten-free baking experiments.\n\nThat being said, I can certainly provide you with a recipe for a delicious chocolate cake with nuts! Here's one that you might enjoy:\n\n**Classic Chocolate Cake with Walnuts**\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the cake:\n\n* 2 \u00be cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 \u00bd cups granulated sugar\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n* 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature\n* 2 large eggs, at room temperature\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1 cup chopped walnuts\n\nFor the frosting:\n\n* 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature\n* 2 cups confectioners' sugar\n* 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder\n* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease two 9-inch (23cm) round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together cocoa powder and milk until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Whisk in the vanilla extract.\n4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the cocoa mixture, whisking until just combined.\n5. Fold in the chopped walnuts.\n6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops.\n7. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n8. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n9. To make the frosting, beat the butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla extract, and beat until combined.\n10. Once the cakes are completely cool, place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a layer of frosting on top. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the entire cake with the remaining frosting.\n\nAs for gluten-free baking, it's great to hear that you've had success with almond flour and coconut flour! Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with the right combination of flours and ingredients, you can achieve delicious results.
