Here are some suggestions to help you prioritize your goals and stay focused on what matters most:\n\n1. **Reconnect with your values**: Take some time to reflect on what's truly important to you in life. What are your core values, and what kind of person do you want to be? When you're clear about your values, you can align your goals with them, which can help you stay motivated and focused.\n2. **Identify your non-negotiables**: What are the things that you absolutely need to prioritize in your life right now? These might include your physical and mental health, relationships, personal growth, or career development. Make a list of your non-negotiables and ensure your goals align with them.\n3. **Use the Eisenhower Matrix**: This decision-making tool can help you prioritize tasks and goals based on their urgency and importance. Divide your goals into four quadrants:\n\t* Urgent and important (Do first)\n\t* Important but not urgent (Schedule)\n\t* Urgent but not important (Delegate)\n\t* Not urgent or important (Eliminate)\n4. **Focus on one goal at a time**: When you're feeling overwhelmed, it's essential to focus on one goal at a time. This will help you make progress and build momentum. Use the Pomodoro Technique: work on your goal for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, and repeat.\n5. **Break down big goals into smaller ones**: Big goals can feel daunting, which can lead to procrastination. Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks that you can complete daily or weekly. This will help you make progress and stay motivated.\n6. **Create a \"Stop Doing\" list**: Identify tasks, activities, or commitments that are draining your energy and preventing you from focusing on your priorities. Stop doing them or delegate them if possible.\n7. **Practice self-compassion**: Remember that you're doing the best you can, and it's okay to make mistakes. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Acknowledge your feelings, and remind yourself that you're capable of overcoming challenges.\n8. **Seek accountability and support**: Share your goals and priorities with a trusted friend or mentor and ask them to hold you accountable. This can provide an added motivation to stay focused on your goals.\n9. **Celebrate small wins**: Celebrate your small victories, even if they seem insignificant. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue working towards your goals.\n10. **Re-evaluate and adjust**: Regularly review your goals and priorities to ensure they still align with your values and needs. Be willing to adjust your goals and priorities as needed.\n\nRemember, prioritizing your goals and staying focused on what matters most takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't give up. You got this!\n\nRegarding the guilt and regret from the fight with your friend, it's essential to acknowledge and process your emotions. Consider journaling, talking to a trusted friend or therapist, or engaging in a self-care activity that helps you release those feelings. As you work through your emotions, you'll become more focused and motivated to prioritize your goals and move forward.",
