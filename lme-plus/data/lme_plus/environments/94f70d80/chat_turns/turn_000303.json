Here are some suggestions on how to combine these materials effectively and some recommendations for findings and clasps:\n\n**Design Ideas:**\n\n1. **Shell and Driftwood Pendant**: Attach a shell to a piece of driftwood, using a strong adhesive like epoxy or jeweler's adhesive. Add a jump ring and a chain to create a unique pendant.\n2. **Driftwood Shell Wrap**: Wrap a piece of driftwood with wire, incorporating shells along the way. Use a clasp or a sliding knot to secure the piece.\n3. **Shell-Adorned Driftwood Charm**: Attach shells to a piece of driftwood using a strong adhesive.

Consider rustic clasps made from copper, bronze, or wood.\n2. **Natural fiber cords**: Use natural fiber cords like cotton, hemp, or jute to add a beachy vibe to your design.
