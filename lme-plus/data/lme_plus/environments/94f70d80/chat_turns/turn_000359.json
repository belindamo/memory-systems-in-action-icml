  "content": "Yes, the artwork for Beach House's album \"7\" is definitely surreal and beautiful. The cover features a painting by artist and designer by Kyle Bobby Dunn, which is called \"Self-Portrait\". The image depicts a woman's face, but with a surreal and abstract twist - the eyes are missing and the face appears to be melting or dissolving into abstract patterns and colors.\n\nThe artwork reflects the album's sound, which is characterized by lush, dreamy, and experimental soundscapes. The image has a timeless quality and seems to capture the essence of the band's music, which is both ethereal and grounded in reality. Overall, the album artwork contributes to the overall experience of the album, adding a layer of visual beauty and complexity to the music.",
