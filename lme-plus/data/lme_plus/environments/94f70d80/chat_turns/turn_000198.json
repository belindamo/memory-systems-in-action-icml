  "content": "I apologize if I skipped the step of researching existing languages, that is an essential step in creating a new language, it will help you to understand how different languages function and to identify what features you want to include or avoid in your new language.\n\nIt's great that you're thinking about creating a new language to address issues with existing languages, and it's a noble goal to create a language that is functional, effective and easy to use.\n\nAs for which part of the structure of the language you should start with, it's up to you, but it's common to start with phonology, then move on to grammar and lexicon.\nPhonology is the study of the sounds of a language and it's the foundation of any language, it's the way that words are pronounced and written. Deciding on the number of sounds, the way they are used to form words, and creating a writing system for your language are all part of the phonology.\n\nOnce you have established the phonology, you can move on to the grammar, which is the set of rules that govern how words are put together to form phrases and sentences. It includes the word order, grammatical categories, and inflectional system.\n\nFinally, you can create a lexicon, which is the set of words that make up a language. Deciding on the type of words that your language will use and creating a vocabulary that is appropriate for the purpose and context of your language is an important step.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that creating a new language is a long and complex process, and it may take a lot of time and effort. But with a clear goal in mind, a thorough understanding of existing languages, and a lot of dedication, it is possible to create a functional and effective language.",
