  "content": "Yes, there are initiatives being undertaken to change the mentality of schools and educators in Japan towards a more holistic approach to education that values both academic accomplishments and student well-being. One such initiative is the introduction of \"Ky\u014diku Kanji\" (Education Kanji) in the curriculum, which aims to promote character education and encourage students to become respectful, responsible, and socially engaged citizens.\n\nAnother initiative is the promotion of \"yutori kyoiku\" (relaxed or spacious education), which aims to reduce the pressure on students and promote a more balanced approach to learning. This initiative seeks to reduce the amount of time that students spend in school and allow them more opportunities for leisure, social interaction, and self-directed learning. The introduction of new subjects such as practical English, liberal arts, and computer education is also intended to provide students with a more well-rounded education.\n\nFurthermore, the Japanese government has launched initiatives aimed at increasing mental health support for students, including increasing the number of school counselors and providing training to educators and parents about mental health awareness and prevention.\n\nWhile there is still much work to be done to change the mentality of the education system as a whole, these initiatives provide a good starting point that may help to reduce the pressure and stress on students and create a more supportive and positive learning environment.",
