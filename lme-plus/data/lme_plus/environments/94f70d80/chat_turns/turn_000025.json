  "content": "In \"Shape of You\" by Ed Sheeran, the rhyme pairs in each verse and chorus are as follows:\n\nVerse 1:\n\n* lover/go\n* shots/talk slow\n* me/conversation\n* chance now/dance\n\nChorus:\n\n* love/me\n* lead/crazy\n* much/touch\n* me/lead\n\nVerse 2:\n\n* you/do\n* too/new\n* new/you\n* body/new\n\nIn addition to these rhyme pairs, the song also uses repetition of the phrase \"I'm in love with your body\" as a refrain throughout the verse and chorus, which helps to add a sense of structure and unity to the song.",
