We packed over 10,000 meals for low-income families, and it was a great team-building activity. I was responsible for packing pasta and sauce into boxes. We even had a competition to see who could pack the most meals in an hour, and my team came in second place. Do you know if there are any food banks in my area that have similar events or activities?",
