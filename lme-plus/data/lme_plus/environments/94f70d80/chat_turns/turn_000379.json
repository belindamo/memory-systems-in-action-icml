Here are some tips on how to store pecans:\n\n**Storing Pecans:**\n\n1. **Cool, dry place:** Store pecans in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, such as a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing them near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight.\n2. **Airtight container:** Use an airtight container, such as a glass jar or a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid, to store pecans. This will help keep moisture and air out.\n3. **Refrigerate or freeze:** If you plan to store pecans for an extended period, consider refrigerating or freezing them. Refrigeration can help keep pecans fresh for up to 6 months, while freezing can extend their shelf life to up to a year.\n4. **Freezer bags:** If you choose to freeze pecans, store them in airtight freezer bags or containers to prevent freezer burn.\n5. **Check on them:** Regularly check on your stored pecans for signs of rancidity, such as an off smell, slimy texture, or mold growth. If you notice any of these signs, it's best to discard the pecans.\n\nAs for your gluten-free banana bread, that's great to hear! Almond flour and coconut flour can be a bit tricky to work with, but it sounds like you've had success with them. Gluten-free baking can be a bit more challenging, but with practice and experimentation, you can achieve great results.\n\n**Tips for gluten-free baking:**\n\n1. **Use a combination of flours:** Gluten-free flours can behave differently, so it's often best to use a combination of flours to achieve the right texture and flavor.\n2. **Use xanthan gum or guar gum:** These gums can help improve the texture and structure of gluten-free baked goods.\n3. **Adjust liquid content:** Gluten-free flours can absorb more liquid than traditional flours, so you may need to adjust the liquid content in your recipe.\n4. **Don't overmix:** Overmixing can result in a dense, tough gluten-free baked good. Mix wet and dry ingredients separately and gently fold them together.\n\nKeep experimenting and having fun with gluten-free baking!
