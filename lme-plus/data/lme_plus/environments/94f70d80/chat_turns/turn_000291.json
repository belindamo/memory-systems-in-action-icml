Making a reservation is a great idea, especially if you're planning to go on a weekend when brunch spots can get busy.\n\nWith a reservation, you can request a table that fits your group size and even specify any special requests, like a quiet corner or a spot with natural light. It's also a good idea to confirm the reservation a day or two before to make sure everything is set.\n\nSince you've been to the caf\u00e9 before, you might also want to consider ordering some dishes to share, like pastries or appetizers, to get the table started. And don't forget to recommend your favorite dishes to your friends!\n\nWhat's the plan for the rest of the day after brunch? Are you guys planning on doing anything else together, or just keeping it a casual, low-key gathering?",
