  "content": "In Japan, many parents are aware of the negative impact that the education system can have on their children's mental health. However, there is also a cultural expectation that children must aspire to high academic achievements, which can contribute to the pressure that students feel.\n\nParents often become caught up in the competitive nature of the education system and feel they must push their children to do well academically to give them the best chance for success in the future. This can manifest in parents placing high expectations and pressure on their children to succeed, which can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout.\n\nHowever, there is also a growing movement of parents and educators seeking to promote a more balanced and holistic approach to education that values both academic achievement and student well-being. This includes initiatives aimed at reducing the emphasis on standardized testing and promoting alternative forms of assessment that focus on developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\nOverall, while some parents may contribute to the pressure that students feel, there is also a growing recognition among parents and educators of the need to create a more nurturing and supportive environment for students that promotes both academic achievement and mental health.",
