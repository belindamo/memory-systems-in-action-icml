Be flexible: Your business plan may change as you learn more about your industry or receive feedback from customers. Don't be afraid to pivot if necessary or adjust your strategy. 5. Balance passion with practicality: While it's important to be passionate about your business, it's also important to be realistic about your goals and financial expectations. 6. Prioritize customer service: Happy customers are essential for the success of any business. Make sure to prioritize excellent customer service and listen carefully to their feedback. 7. Don't forget about the details: While it's easy to get caught up in the big picture, don't neglect the small details. Pay attention to things like branding, marketing, and bookkeeping.
