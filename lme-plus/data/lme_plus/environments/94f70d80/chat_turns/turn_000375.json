Here are some tips on how to toast walnuts:\n\n**How to Toast Walnuts:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven:** Set your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n2. **Spread the walnuts:** Place the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. You can line the sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat to prevent the walnuts from sticking.\n3. **Toast the walnuts:** Place the baking sheet in the oven and toast the walnuts for 5-7 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned. You may need to stir the walnuts halfway through the toasting time to ensure even toasting.\n4. **Check for doneness:** After 5 minutes, remove the walnuts from the oven and check their color and aroma. They should be lightly browned and fragrant. If they're not yet fragrant, return them to the oven for another minute or two.\n5. **Cool the walnuts:** Once the walnuts are toasted, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet.\n6. **Chop the walnuts:** Once the walnuts are cool, chop them coarsely and use them in your recipe.\n\n**Tips for Toasting Walnuts:**\n\n* **Keep an eye on them:** Walnuts can go from perfectly toasted to burnt quickly, so make sure to check on them frequently during the toasting time.\n* **Use fresh walnuts:** Fresh walnuts will have a more robust flavor and aroma than stale ones. Try to use walnuts that are within a few months of their packaging date.\n* **Don't overtoast:** Walnuts can become bitter if they're toasted too long. Stop toasting them when they're lightly browned and fragrant.\n* **Toast in small batches:** If you're toasting a large quantity of walnuts, it's better to toast them in small batches to ensure even toasting.\n\nBy following these tips, you should end up with beautifully toasted walnuts that will add depth and flavor to your chocolate cake. Enjoy!",
