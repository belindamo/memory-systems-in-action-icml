You'll learn how to:\n\n* Import and clean datasets\n* Perform data filtering, grouping, and merging\n* Handle missing data and perform data transformation\n* Work with time series data and perform data reshaping\n\n**NumPy** is the library for numerical computing in Python. You'll learn how to:\n\n* Work with arrays and matrices\n* Perform element-wise operations and broadcasting\n* Use indexing and slicing to manipulate arrays\n* Perform linear algebra operations and statistical analysis\n\nOnce you have a solid grasp of Pandas and NumPy, you can move on to **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization. You'll learn how to:\n\n* Create various types of plots (e.g., line plots, scatter plots, bar charts)\n* Customize plot appearance and style\n* Visualize data distributions and relationships\n* Create interactive plots and dashboards\n\nFinally, with a strong foundation in Pandas, NumPy, and data visualization, you can dive into **Scikit-learn** for machine learning and data modeling. You'll learn how to:\n\n* Perform supervised and unsupervised learning\n* Use regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms\n* Tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model performance\n* Work with text and image data\n\nBy following this learning path, you'll be well-equipped to perform advanced data analysis and machine learning tasks in Python.\n\nRemember to practice with real-world datasets and projects to reinforce your learning. Good luck, and have fun exploring the world of Python data analysis!",
