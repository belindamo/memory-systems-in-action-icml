  "content": "I apologize for the confusion, the words and meanings I provided were just examples of how you can create new words from phonemes, and it is not actually a language. The meaning and the words are not based on any linguistic or cultural context. The main idea is to show you the steps you need to take in order to create new words from phonemes.\n\nOnce you have established the phonology of your language, you will have to decide on the meanings of the words, and how they are used in different context. The meaning of the words should be based on your goals and purpose of the language, and it should be easy to understand and remember by the speakers.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that when creating a new language, you should also create a grammar system that defines the way words are combined to form phrases, sentences and larger units of meaning, as well as a lexicon that defines the meanings of words and how they are used in context.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.",
