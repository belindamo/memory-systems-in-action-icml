  "content": "Wow, it's really concerning to hear about the negative impact that the education system in Japan can have on students' mental health. It seems like there is so much pressure on them to perform well academically, but that can't be good for their overall well-being in the long run. I'm glad to see that there are initiatives being taken to change the system, but I hope they are implemented soon enough to make a real difference for students.",
