  "content": "Pecans are a fantastic choice! They can definitely work well in this recipe, but they will change the flavor profile slightly. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Pecans vs. Walnuts:**\n\n* **Flavor:** Pecans have a richer, more buttery, and slightly sweeter flavor compared to walnuts. They can add a deeper, nuttier flavor to the cake.\n* **Texture:** Pecans are generally softer and more prone to breaking down than walnuts. This can result in a slightly denser cake with a more even distribution of nuts.\n* **Pairing with chocolate:** Pecans and chocolate are a classic combination, and the nutty flavor of pecans can complement the richness of the chocolate nicely.\n\nTo make the recipe work with pecans, you can follow the same toasting instructions as for walnuts. However, keep in mind that pecans might toast more quickly due to their higher fat content, so keep an eye on them closely.\n\n**Tips for using pecans:**\n\n* **Use a slightly smaller amount:** Pecans are generally more dense than walnuts, so you might want to use a slightly smaller amount (about 3/4 cup) to avoid overpowering the cake.\n* **Chop them coarsely:** Pecans can be quite large, so make sure to chop them coarsely to ensure they're evenly distributed throughout the batter.\n* **Consider the type of pecans:** If you're using a particularly strong or flavorful type of pecan, like a Texas pecan, you might want to start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use pecans or walnuts comes down to personal preference. If you want a slightly sweeter, nuttier flavor, pecans might be a great choice. If you prefer a more traditional, robust walnut flavor, stick with the original recipe.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more substitution suggestions!",
