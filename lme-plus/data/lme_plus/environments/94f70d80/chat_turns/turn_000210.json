  "content": "Tense is used to indicate the time when an action occurred or occurs. In English, we use different verb forms to indicate past, present, and future tense. For example, in the sentence \"I am eating breakfast\", the verb \"eat\" is in the present tense, while in the sentence \"I ate breakfast\" the verb \"ate\" is in the past tense.\n\nAspect is used to indicate the duration or completion of an action. In English, we use different verb forms to indicate whether an action is ongoing or completed. For example, in the sentence \"I am running\" the verb \"run\" is in the present continuous aspect, indicating that the action is ongoing. In the sentence \"I ran\" the verb \"ran\" is in the simple past aspect indicating that the action is completed.\n\nMood is used to indicate the attitude of the speaker towards the action or state described by the verb. In English, we use different verb forms to indicate the indicative, imperative, subjunctive and conditional moods. For example, in the sentence \"I suggest that he study more\" the verb \"study\" is in the subjunctive mood, expressing a suggestion or a possibility.\n\nVoice is used to indicate the relation of the action described by the verb to the subject. In English, we use different verb forms to indicate the active or passive voice. For example, in the sentence \"The dog chased the cat\" the verb \"chased\" is in the active voice, indicating that the subject \"dog\" is performing the action. In the sentence \"The cat was chased by the dog\" the verb \"chased\" is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject \"cat\" is the object of the action.\n\nSubject-verb agreement is when the subject and the verb in a sentence agree in number, meaning that a singular subject takes a singular verb and a plural subject takes a plural verb. For example, \"The dog barks\" the subject \"dog\" and the verb \"barks\" agree in number. Possessive adjectives are used to indicate possession, for example, \"My dog\" the possessive adjective \"my\" indicates that the dog belongs to the speaker. Comparison are used to indicate a relationship of degree between two or more entities, for example, \"this book is bigger than that book\" the comparison \"bigger\" indicates a relationship of degree between the two books.",
