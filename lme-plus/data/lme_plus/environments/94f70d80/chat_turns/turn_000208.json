  "content": "Yes, grammar is used to communicate time, as well as other aspects of meaning such as tense, aspect, mood, and voice. Additionally, grammar is used to indicate the relationships between words in a sentence, such as subject and verb agreement, and to indicate word relationships such as possession and comparison. For example, English uses the -s ending to indicate that a noun is plural and the -ed ending to indicate the past tense of a verb. In English, grammar also includes the use of auxiliary verbs to form questions and negations, and to indicate the tense and aspect of a verb. So, grammar encompasses a wide range of rules that dictate how words are used to convey meaning.",
