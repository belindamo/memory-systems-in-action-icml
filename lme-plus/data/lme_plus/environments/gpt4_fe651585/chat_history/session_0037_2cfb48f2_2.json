What tasks and appointments do you need to schedule for the week? (e.g., work meetings, personal appointments, errands, study sessions, exercise routines, etc.)\n2. What time of day do you prefer to tackle these tasks and appointments? (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening)\n3. Are there any specific days or time blocks you want to allocate for certain tasks or activities (e.g., dedicated time for work, study, or personal activities)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a rough outline of your week, including reminders for tasks and appointments, while also taking into account your desired bedtime routine.\n\nRemember, I'll assume your bedtime goal is between 10:30-11 pm every night, so I'll make sure to schedule reminders accordingly to help you wind down and prepare for a good night's sleep."
