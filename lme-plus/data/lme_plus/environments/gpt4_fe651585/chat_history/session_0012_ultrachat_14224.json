For example, pairing Georgia with Open Sans or Times New Roman with Arial. 2. Sans-Serif and Script: pairing a sans-serif font with a script font can create a contrast between modern and classic styles. For example, pairing Montserrat with Pacifico or Futura with Playlist Script. 3. Sans-Serif and Display: pairing a sans-serif font with a display font can create a bold, attention-grabbing look. For example, pairing Roboto with Bungee or Lato with Raleway Dots. 4. Serif and Display: pairing a serif font with a display font can create a vintage, elegant look. For example, pairing Playfair Display with Abril Fatface or Baskerville with Bodoni. Remember to experiment with different combinations to find what works best for your website and brand. It's also important to consider legibility and readability when pairing fonts."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Choosing the right font weight and size for headings and body text is an important part of creating a balanced and visually appealing design. Here are some tips:\n\n1. For headings, use a font weight that is bold enough to stand out but not too heavy that it overwhelms the page. A font weight between 500 and 700 is a good range to start with. 2. For body text, use a font weight that is not too light or too bold. A font weight between 300 and 500 is a good range for readability. 3. Font size varies based on the font you choose, but for headings, a font size between 24pt and 48pt is a good range. For body text, a font size between 12pt and 16pt is a good range for readability. 4. It's also important to consider the spacing between the lines, or the line height. A good line height is generally between 120% to 150% of the font size. 5. Consider the visual hierarchy of your content and use a larger font size for more important headings and a smaller font size for subheadings and body text. Remember, these are general guidelines and you should always test your font choices and sizes on different screens and devices to ensure legibility and readability."
