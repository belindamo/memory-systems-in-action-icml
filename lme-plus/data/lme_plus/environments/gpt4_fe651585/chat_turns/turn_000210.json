  "content": "In Bitcoin Script, an \"opcode\" is a single instruction that specifies an operation to be performed within a script. For example, there are opcodes for executing basic mathematical operations, for checking the values of certain properties of transactions (such as the number of signatures required), and for managing the flow of execution within a script.\n\n\"OP\\_RETURN\" is a specific opcode in Bitcoin Script that allows a script to include data in the blockchain as an \"output\" of a transaction. This output can store up to 80 bytes of data and is typically used to embed small amounts of information in the blockchain, such as the hash of a file or a message.\n\nIn general, Bitcoin Script is a stack-based, Forth-like programming language that is used to specify the conditions under which a transaction can be spent. The script includes a series of opcodes that define how the transaction inputs (the \"spent\" outputs) must match up with the desired outputs. If the script evaluates to \"true\", the transaction is considered valid and can be added to the blockchain.",
