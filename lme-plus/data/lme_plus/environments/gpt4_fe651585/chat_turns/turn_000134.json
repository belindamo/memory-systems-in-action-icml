Cover the mixture and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.\n\nTo shape the cevapi, wet your hands with water and take small handfuls of the meat mixture. Shape into long, thin cylinders, about the thickness of your finger.\n\nHeat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the cevapi and cook for about 5 minutes on each side, or until they are nicely browned and cooked through.\n\nServe the cevapi hot with a side of onions, sour cream, and/or ajvar (a roasted red pepper sauce). Enjoy!",
