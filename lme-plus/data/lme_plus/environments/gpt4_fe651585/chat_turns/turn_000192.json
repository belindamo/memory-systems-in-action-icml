  "content": "While freeze-dried food is a staple of the International Space Station diet, astronauts do have access to a range of different types of food, including fresh fruits and vegetables, seafood, and even specially prepared meals like shrimp cocktail and lasagna. Astronauts take turns preparing meals for the crew, and they can add spices and condiments to their food to give it more flavor.\n\nHowever, fresh food is not always available due to logistics and storage constraints, so many meals are prepared using pre-packaged, dehydrated, or irradiated ingredients. These meals are specially prepared to meet the nutritional needs of the crew and are designed to be easy to consume in the weightless environment of the space station.\n\nThat being said, some astronauts do report missing the taste and textures of certain types of food from Earth, and NASA is constantly working to improve the quality and variety of food available for astronauts on long-duration missions.",
