Employee engagement: Measured through a survey or regular check-ins, this metric assesses how connected and committed team members feel to the company, their work, and their colleagues. Jared's comment about feeling disconnected from the team may indicate a need to improve employee engagement.\n2. Collaboration and communication: Measured through regular feedback, surveys, or observation, this metric assesses how well team members work together and communicate with each other. Lisa's comment about a lack of feedback and David's positive comments about teamwork and collaboration may provide insights into how well the team is collaborating and communicating with each other.\n3. Burnout and workload: Measured through self-report, team check-ins, or observation, this metric assesses how well team members are managing their workload and whether they are at risk of burnout. Jared's comment about feeling burnt out and Lisa's struggles with workload balance may indicate a need to address this metric.\n\nBased on these metrics, the team may need to work on improving employee engagement, communication and collaboration, and workload management to support a more positive team spirit.",
