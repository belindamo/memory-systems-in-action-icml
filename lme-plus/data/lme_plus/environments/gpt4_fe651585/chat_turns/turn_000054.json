  "content": "I am not familiar with the specific song structure of Sia's cover of \"California Dreamin',\" as my knowledge cutoff is 2021 and the song may not have been released at the time. However, I can tell you that most songs have a general structure of intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro. The intro usually serves as an introduction to the song, the verse typically introduces the lyrics and melody, the pre-chorus is a transition between the verse and the chorus, the chorus is typically the most memorable and repetitive section, the bridge is a contrasting section that serves as a transition between the chorus and the outro, and the outro concludes the song.\nIt's also possible that Sia's version of the song could differ from the original song structure and could also have different sections such as breakdowns, middle eights, modulations etc.",
