There have been several Resident Evil games released in recent years, and I want to make sure I provide you with the correct information.\n\nCould you please tell me more about the game you pre-ordered? Here are some questions to help me narrow down the information:\n\n1. Is it a mainline Resident Evil game (e.g., Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil 8) or a spin-off (e.g., Resident Evil Revelations, Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City)?\n2. Is it a new release or a remastered/re-released game?\n3. Do you remember any specific details about the game's story, gameplay, or features that you're excited about?\n4. What platform did you pre-order the game for (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch)?\n\nOnce I have more information, I'll do my best to provide you with the latest news and updates about your pre-ordered Resident Evil game!",
