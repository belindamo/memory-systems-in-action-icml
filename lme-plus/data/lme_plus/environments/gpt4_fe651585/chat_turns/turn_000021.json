  "content": "That sounds like an awesome day on the water! Catching a big walleye and three smallmouth bass, including two keepers, is a great haul. The curly tail jig is a classic walleye lure, and it's great that it worked well for you in that spot.\n\nFishing near a drop-off can be a great strategy for walleye, as they often congregate in areas with structural changes like that. And it's awesome that the St. Croix rod was able to handle the fight of that big walleye. It's always satisfying to catch a fish that puts up a good battle!\n\nSmallmouth bass are a lot of fun to catch too, and it's great that you were able to catch a few of them. Did you find that they were hitting the same jig as the walleye, or did you switch to a different lure or presentation for the bass?\n\nAlso, what did Alex and Ryan think of the fishing trip? Were they impressed with your fishing skills, or did they give you a hard time about anything?",
