  "content": "Fractals are mathematical patterns that can be found in many natural phenomena, such as the shapes of coastlines and trees. In music, fractals can be used to generate new and unique musical patterns, such as melodies and rhythms. One way to use fractals in generative music is to use fractal algorithms to create patterns that can be used as the basis for a composition. These algorithms can be used to create repeating patterns that are similar but not identical, resulting in a composition that is constantly evolving. Another way to use fractals in generative music is to use fractal shapes and patterns to create new sounds and textures. This can be done by using fractal algorithms to manipulate the parameters of a synthesizer, or by using fractal patterns as the basis for a generative visual display that is used to control the parameters of a synthesizer.",
