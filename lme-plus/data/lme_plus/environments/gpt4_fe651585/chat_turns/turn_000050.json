  "content": "To create songs like Sia's cover of \"California Dreamin'\" which is a cross between adult contemporary and orchestral pop, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Start with a strong melody and lyrics: The melody is the foundation of any song and is the driving force behind the emotional impact of the song. A strong melody will help convey the emotion and meaning of the song to the listener.\n2. Use a variety of instruments: Use a combination of live instruments like piano, guitar, and drums with orchestral instruments like strings, horns, and woodwinds. Experiment with different combinations of instruments to find the perfect balance.\n3. Add electronic elements: Use electronic elements such as synthesizers, samplers, and processors to add depth and texture to the song.\n4. Pay attention to production details: Pay attention to the details of the production, such as panning, EQ, compression, and reverb, to create a cohesive and polished sound.\n5. Experiment with different chord progressions: Experiment with different chord progressions to add tension and release to the song.\n6. Focus on the vocals: The vocals are a crucial part of the song and should be treated as such. Pay attention to the details of the vocal production, such as EQ, compression, and reverb, to create a polished and emotive vocal sound.\n7. Get inspired by other songs, artists and genres: Listen to other songs and artists within the adult contemporary and orchestral pop genres, or other genres that you find inspiring and take note of what you like and what could be useful for your own productions.\n\nRemember, creating music is an iterative process and it takes time and practice to develop your own sound and style. Be patient with yourself and don't be afraid to experiment and try new things.",
