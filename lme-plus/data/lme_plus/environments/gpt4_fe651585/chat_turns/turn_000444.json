  "content": "Jon continues to talk excitedly, telling Damian about the songs they sang in church and how moved he was by the experience. He asks Damian if he's ever felt that way before, and if he ever thinks about God or faith.\n\nDamian is taken aback by Jon's enthusiasm, but tries to keep his composure. \"I don't really think about that kind of thing,\" he says coolly.\n\nBut Jon presses on, talking about the love and acceptance he's found in his faith community, and how he hopes his parents will come to know that too. \"I just feel like there's something bigger than us out there, you know? And I want to be a part of it.\"\n\nDamian doesn't know how to respond, feeling a strange mix of curiosity, annoyance, and maybe even a little envy. He had always been taught to value self-reliance and discipline, not to depend on some higher power for guidance and strength.\n\nBut hearing the earnestness in Jon's voice, he can't help but wonder if there might be something to it after all. Maybe he's been missing out on something important. He decides to keep an open mind and explore this more.\n\nBefore he can say anything, there's a knock on the door and one of the other Titans calls for Damian to join them in the training room. \"Gotta go, Jon,\" he says, trying to hide his disappointment. \"Take care of yourself, okay?\"\n\nJon says goodbye and hangs up, feeling a little deflated but still grateful for the chance to share his thoughts with his friend. As the call ends, he wonders what Damian is really thinking, and whether he might one day come to share Jon's faith.",
