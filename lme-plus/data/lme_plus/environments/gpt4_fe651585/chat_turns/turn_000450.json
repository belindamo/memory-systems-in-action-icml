  "content": "File Sync Service Design\n\nCore Requirements:\n\n* Sync all the files across all the devices of the user\n* A file could be at max 4GB big\n* The upload and downloads should be efficient and resumable\n* User's bandwidth is critical, so be efficient.\n\nHigh-Level Requirements:\n\n* High availability of the system\n* Data durability\n* Scalability\n* Cost-effectiveness\n* Interoperability with other services\n\nMicro Requirements\n\n* Data consistency\n* Deadlock-free system\n* Throughput not affected by locking\n\nDesign Decisions:\n\n* The system will use a client-server architecture, with the server storing all the files and the clients synchronizing their local files with the server.\n* The server will be implemented using a distributed file system, such as HDFS, to ensure high availability and scalability.\n* The clients will use a sync algorithm, such as rsync, to efficiently synchronize their files with the server. The sync algorithm will be able to handle large files (up to 4GB) and will support resumable transfers in case of network interruptions.\n* The clients will also be able to cache frequently accessed files locally to reduce the load on the server and improve the user's bandwidth utilization.\n* To ensure data durability, the server will store multiple copies of each file in different locations using a replication factor. The replication factor can be adjusted based on the desired level of durability and the cost of storage.\n* To ensure data consistency, the system will use a distributed lock manager, such as Zookeeper, to coordinate updates to the files. The lock manager will prevent concurrent updates to the same file and ensure that all updates are applied in the correct order.\n* To ensure the system is deadlock-free, the lock manager will use a hierarchical locking scheme, where locks are acquired in a predetermined order to avoid circular dependencies.\n* The system will use a load balancer, such as HAProxy, to distribute the load across multiple servers and improve the throughput of the system. The load balancer will also ensure high availability by automatically failing over to a standby server in case of a failure.\n* The system will use a monitoring tool, such as Prometheus, to track the performance and health of the server and clients. The monitoring tool will provide alerts in case of any issues and will help with capacity planning.\n* The system will be interoperable with other services through a RESTful API, which will allow users to access and manage their files through third-party applications.\n\nComponents:\n\n* Server: A distributed file system for storing and managing the files.\n* Client: A sync algorithm for synchronizing the local files with the server.\n* Distributed lock manager: A system for coordinating updates to the files and preventing concurrent updates.\n* Load balancer: A system for distributing the load across multiple servers and improving the throughput of the system.\n* Monitoring tool: A system for tracking the performance and health of the server and clients.\n* RESTful API: An interface for interacting with the system through third-party applications.\n\nServices:\n\n* File storage: A service for storing and managing the files on the server.\n* File synchronization: A service for synchronizing the files between the server and the clients.\n* File locking: A service for coordinating updates to the files and preventing concurrent updates.\n* Load balancing: A service for distributing the load across multiple servers and improving the throughput of the system.\n* Monitoring: A service for tracking the performance and health of the server and clients.\n\nCommunications:\n\n* The clients will communicate with the server through the sync algorithm, using HTTP or a similar protocol.",
