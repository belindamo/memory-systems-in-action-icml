  "content": "Certainly, here's an example:\n\nIn the classic novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee, the story's structure contributes to its overall message of racial injustice and the power of empathy. The novel is divided into two distinct parts - the first half focuses on Scout's (the protagonist) childhood experiences and the second half on the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man, who was falsely accused of raping a white woman.\n\nThrough the first half of the story, readers are introduced to the town of Maycomb and its inhabitants, including the town's racial prejudices and the deep-seated racism present in the community. This sets the stage for the second half, where Scout confronts the harsh reality of racial injustice in the trial of Tom Robinson. Throughout the trial, readers witness the prejudiced legal system and the ingrained beliefs of Maycomb's residents, which ultimately lead to an unjust verdict.\n\nThe structure of \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" with its clear division into two parts, enhances the message of the novel by giving readers a sense of foreboding for what is to come in the second half. It also allows readers to witness the growth of Scout's character and empathy, as she learns to understand the unfairness of the situation and the necessity of standing up for what is right. Overall, the structure of the novel contributes significantly to its message by providing context and allowing readers to see the full extent of the racial injustice present in Maycomb.",
