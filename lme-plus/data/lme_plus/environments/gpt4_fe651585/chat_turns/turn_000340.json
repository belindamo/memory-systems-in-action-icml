  "content": "Subcategorization is a linguistic term that refers to the way in which verbs or other types of words require specific types of complements or arguments to form a grammatical sentence.\n\nFor example, the verb \"eat\" requires an object, such as \"I eat an apple.\" The verb \"give\" requires both a direct object and an indirect object, as in \"She gave me a present.\" In this case, \"me\" is the indirect object and \"a present\" is the direct object.\n\nThe specific complements or arguments required by a verb or other type of word are known as its subcategorization frame. This frame specifies the syntactic properties of the complements that a particular word can take, such as whether they are required or optional, what types of phrases they can be, and where they can appear in relation to the verb or other head word.\n\nUnderstanding the subcategorization properties of words is important for building grammatical sentences in a given language. It can also be useful in natural language processing applications such as parsing and language generation.",
