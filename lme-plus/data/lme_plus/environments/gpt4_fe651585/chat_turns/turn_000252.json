I'm here to provide guidance and feedback through text-based conversations.\n\nIf you'd like, you can share the content of your pitch deck with me by copying and pasting the text into this chat window or summarizing each slide in a few sentences. This will allow me to review the content and provide feedback on clarity, conciseness, and relevance.\n\nAlternatively, you can ask me specific questions about your pitch deck, and I'll do my best to provide guidance and suggestions. For example, you could ask:\n\n* Is my problem statement clear and compelling?\n* How can I improve the design of my slides?\n* What are some common mistakes to avoid in a pitch deck?\n\nLet me know how I can assist you, and I'll do my best to help!",
