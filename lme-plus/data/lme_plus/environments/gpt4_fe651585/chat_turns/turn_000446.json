  "content": "Damian heads to the training room with the other Titans, but he has to sit out because of his broken nose. As the others begin to train, he watches them, feeling a mix of frustration and envy. He had always been one of the most skilled and capable fighters among the team, but now he was stuck on the sidelines, unable to fully participate.\n\nAs he watches the others spar, Damian begins to think about Jon's phone call. He had been surprised when Jon had called him, and even more surprised by the depth of his questions and his genuine interest in faith. Damian had never been one for religion, seeing it as something weak and superstitious. But as he watches his teammates train, he begins to wonder if there might be something more to it.\n\nDespite his reservations, Damian finds himself drawn to Jon's sincerity and his unwavering belief. He starts to think about the conversations they had had in the past, about how Jon had never given up on him even when he had pushed him away. Maybe there was something to this faith thing after all, he thinks to himself.\n\nLost in thought, Damian doesn't even notice when the others finish their training and start to leave the room. It's not until Beast Boy nudges him on the shoulder that he snaps out of it.\n\n\"You alright, man?\" Beast Boy asks, looking at him with concern.\n\nDamian nods, but he can feel the weight of his doubts and uncertainties weighing heavily on him. He knows he can't ignore them forever, but he's not sure he's ready to face them either.",
