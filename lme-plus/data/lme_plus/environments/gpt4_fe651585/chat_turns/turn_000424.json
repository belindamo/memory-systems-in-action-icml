Anyway, back to Medell\u00edn... I'm concerned about the safety aspect, but it sounds like the city has made a lot of progress. Can you recommend some good Airbnb options in El Poblado or La Llanura? I'd like to stay in a safe and convenient area with access to good restaurants and transportation.",
