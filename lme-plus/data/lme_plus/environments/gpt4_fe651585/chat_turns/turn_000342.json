  "content": "In the third paragraph, I mean that a subcategorization frame is a set of rules that specify the syntactic properties of the complements that a particular word can take. A complement is a word or a phrase that completes the meaning of a verb or other type of word in a sentence.\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"I ate an apple\", the verb \"ate\" requires a direct object complement \"an apple\" to complete the meaning of the verb.\n\nThe subcategorization frame of a word specifies the specific complements or arguments that are required or optional for that word, the type of phrases they can be (e.g. noun phrases, prepositional phrases, etc.), and where they can appear in relation to the verb or other head word.\n\nFor instance, the verb \"give\" requires two complements: a direct object complement that specifies the item being given, and an indirect object complement that specifies the recipient of the item. The direct object complement must come before the indirect object complement, as in \"She gave the book to me\" rather than \"She gave me the book\".\n\nUnderstanding the subcategorization frames of words is important for constructing grammatical sentences in a language, and for natural language processing applications such as parsing and language generation.",
