Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Search for hiking groups**: On the Meetup website or mobile app, search for hiking groups in your area.\n2. **Filter by activity level**: On the search results page, click on the \"Filter\" button (looks like a funnel) and select \"Activity Level\" from the dropdown menu. You can choose from the following options:\n\t* Casual\n\t* Moderate\n\t* Active\n\t* Very Active\n\t* Extremely Active\n3. **Filter by difficulty**: Some groups may also specify the difficulty level of their hikes. You can filter by difficulty by using the \"More Filters\" option and selecting \"Difficulty\" from the dropdown menu. The difficulty levels may vary, but common options include:\n\t* Easy\n\t* Moderate\n\t* Challenging\n\t* Strenuous\n4. **Check the group description and events**: Once you've filtered the groups, read the group description and event details to get a better understanding of the group's focus, skill level, and type of hikes they organize.\n\nKeep in mind that some groups might not specify an activity level or difficulty, so it's essential to read the group description and event details carefully to ensure you're comfortable with the hike.\n\nMeetup also allows you to join multiple groups, so you can experiment with different groups and find the ones that best fit your hiking style and preferences.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your safety and comfort level when joining a group hike. If you're unsure about a particular hike or group, don't hesitate to reach out to the organizer or ask questions before attending an event.",
