  "content": "A good song structure template for a song that combines orchestral pop and adult contemporary elements with an EDM context in Reason could include an intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro. The intro could feature a simple melody played by an orchestral instrument or synth, building anticipation for the main elements of the song. The verse could feature a more complex melody, with a focus on the vocals and a simple beat or rhythm. The pre-chorus could introduce the main chord progression and build momentum towards the chorus. The chorus could feature a more energetic beat and a catchy, memorable melody. The bridge could be a contrasting section, featuring a different chord progression or melody, and could serve as a transition to the outro. The outro could bring the song to a close with a final restatement of the main melody.",
