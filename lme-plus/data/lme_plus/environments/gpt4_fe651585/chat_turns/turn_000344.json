  "content": "In the context of subcategorization, intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive are types of verbs that have different subcategorization frames.\n\n* Intransitive verbs: These are verbs that do not take a direct object complement. They only require a subject argument to form a grammatical sentence. For example, the verb \"run\" is an intransitive verb. The sentence \"He runs\" is grammatical because it only requires a subject argument.\n* Transitive verbs: These are verbs that require a direct object complement to complete their meaning. The direct object complement specifies the item that is affected by the action of the verb. For example, the verb \"eat\" is a transitive verb. The sentence \"I ate an apple\" is grammatical because it requires a subject argument and a direct object complement.\n* Ditransitive verbs: These are verbs that require both a direct object complement and an indirect object complement to complete their meaning. The direct object complement specifies the item that is affected by the action of the verb, while the indirect object complement specifies the recipient of the item. For example, the verb \"give\" is a ditransitive verb. The sentence \"She gave me a book\" is grammatical because it requires a subject argument, a direct object complement, and an indirect object complement.\n\nUnderstanding the subcategorization frames of verbs is important for constructing grammatical sentences in a language and for natural language processing applications such as parsing and language generation.",
