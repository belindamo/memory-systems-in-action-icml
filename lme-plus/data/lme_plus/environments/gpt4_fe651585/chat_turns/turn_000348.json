The game features a mix of first-person combat, stealth, and evasion mechanics, allowing players to approach situations in different ways.\n3. **New Mechanics:** One of the most significant changes is the introduction of the \"Block\" mechanic, which allows Ethan to momentarily block enemy attacks, creating opportunities for counterattacks or evasion. Additionally, the game features a \"Guard\" system, which enables Ethan to use environmental objects to defend himself.\n4. **Village and Atmosphere:** The game's setting, the village, is a character in its own right. The environment is richly detailed, with a focus on realism and immersion.
