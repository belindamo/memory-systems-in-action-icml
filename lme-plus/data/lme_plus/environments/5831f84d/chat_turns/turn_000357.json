  "content": "The tempo, or beats per minute (BPM), of a song can vary depending on the style and mood of the music. For a song in the style of Avicii, I would suggest a tempo of around 128 BPM. This is a medium-fast tempo that would provide a good energy and flow for the song. You can adjust the tempo to your liking, but 128 BPM would be a good starting point.",
