You can also check the reviews and ratings again to see if other customers have had similar experiences with the products.\n\nI'm glad I could provide some helpful tips, even if they weren't specifically tailored to your dog, Max. If you have any more questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!\n\n(And don't forget to take care of those cat food and litter needs for Luna!)",
