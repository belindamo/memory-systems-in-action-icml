The Natural History Museum is an amazing place to spark a child's curiosity and fascination with dinosaurs! \n\nFor a kid-friendly dinosaur-themed experience, I highly recommend the following exhibits and tours at the Natural History Museum:\n\n1. **Dinosaur Galleries**: This is a must-visit exhibit for any dinosaur enthusiast! The museum has an impressive collection of dinosaur fossils, including a giant Diplodocus skeleton, a fierce T. rex skull, and a Triceratops fossil. The exhibit is designed to be interactive, with hands-on activities and games to keep kids engaged.\n2. **The Dino Dig**: This interactive exhibit lets kids become paleontologists and excavate fossils in a simulated dig site. They'll learn about the process of fossilization and get to take home a plaster fossil cast as a souvenir!\n3. **Dino-Mite Tour**: This guided tour is specifically designed for kids aged 5-12 and takes them on an adventure through the dinosaur galleries. The tour is led by a knowledgeable guide who'll share fun facts and stories about the dinosaurs on display.\n4. **Investigate Centre**: This hands-on area allows kids to get up close and personal with real fossils and artifacts, using magnifying glasses and other tools to examine them. They can even participate in activities like fossil preparation and identification.\n\nAs for the Rosetta Stone, that's a fascinating topic! The British Museum, not the Natural History Museum, is home to the Rosetta Stone. It's an incredible artifact that has indeed shed a lot of light on ancient Egyptian history and language.\n\nBefore your visit, you might want to prepare your niece by watching some dinosaur documentaries or reading books about dinosaurs together. This will help her get even more excited about the exhibits and ask more informed questions during the tour.\n\nRemember to check the Natural History Museum's website for any special events, closures, or ticket requirements before planning your visit. Have a roar-some time with your niece!",
