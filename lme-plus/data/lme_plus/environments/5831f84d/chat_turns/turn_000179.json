That's awesome!\n\nAs someone who's not super experienced in competitive games, you might find that these games have a bit of a learning curve. However, both Overwatch and Apex Legends are designed to be accessible to new players, and they offer resources to help you get started.\n\nHere's what you can expect from each game:\n\n**Overwatch:**\n\n* Overwatch has a strong focus on teamplay and coordination, which means you'll need to communicate with your teammates and work together to achieve objectives.\n* The game has a diverse cast of heroes, each with unique abilities and playstyles. This can be overwhelming at first, but Blizzard provides a lot of resources to help you learn about each hero.\n* Overwatch has a \"Play vs. AI\" mode, which allows you to play against AI opponents and practice your skills in a more relaxed environment.\n* The game's community is generally friendly and welcoming, with many players happy to offer advice and guidance to new players.\n\n**Apex Legends:**\n\n* Apex Legends is a battle royale game, which means you'll be dropped into a large map with up to 59 other players, and you'll need to scavenge for weapons and supplies while fighting to be the last team standing.\n* The game has a more fast-paced and action-oriented gameplay style compared to Overwatch, which can be overwhelming at first.\n* Apex Legends has a \"Training\" mode, which allows you to practice your movement and combat skills in a more controlled environment.\n* The game's community is also generally friendly and welcoming, with many players happy to offer advice and guidance to new players.\n\nTo get started with these games, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Start with the tutorials and guides**: Both games offer extensive tutorials and guides that will teach you the basics of the game, its mechanics, and its heroes/legends.\n2. **Play with friends or in a team**: Playing with friends or in a team can make the experience more enjoyable and help you learn from each other.\n3. **Focus on one or two heroes/legends at a time**: Don't try to learn every hero or legend at once. Focus on a few and master their abilities before moving on to others.\n4. **Communicate with your team**: Communication is key in team-based games. Make sure to coordinate with your team, share strategies, and provide feedback to each other.\n5. **Don't be afraid to ask for help**: If you're struggling or have questions, don't hesitate to ask your teammates or other players for advice.\n\nOverall, both Overwatch and Apex Legends can be a great fit for someone who's new to competitive games. They offer a lot of resources to help you get started, and their communities are generally welcoming and supportive.\n\nSo, which one are you more interested in trying out first?",
