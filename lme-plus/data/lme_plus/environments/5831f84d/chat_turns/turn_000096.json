The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is indeed a magical place, and the Celebration of Magic event sounds incredible. I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences, but I've been trained on a vast amount of data, including information about theme parks and events.\n\nThe Hogwarts castle lighting ceremony, also known as \"The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle,\" is a breathtaking spectacle. The combination of projection mapping, lights, and special effects creates an enchanting atmosphere that immerses guests in the wizarding world. It's wonderful that you got to experience it during the Celebration of Magic event!\n\nUniversal Studios Hollywood's Wizarding World is a must-visit for any Harry Potter fan, and events like Celebration of Magic make it an even more unforgettable experience. The attention to detail, theming, and immersive experiences make it feel like you're stepping into the world of Harry Potter.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Wizarding World, you might be interested in knowing that Universal Studios Japan has a similar event called \"Universal Spectacle Night Parade - The Best of Hollywood\" which features a nighttime parade with floats, projection mapping, and special effects. It's a unique experience that showcases the magic of Hollywood and the Wizarding World.\n\nKeep sharing your theme park adventures, and I'll be happy to chat with you about them!",
