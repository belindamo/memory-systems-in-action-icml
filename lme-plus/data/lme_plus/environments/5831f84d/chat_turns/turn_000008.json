I'll set up a reward for myself when I complete a certain number of days or tasks successfully following the one-touch rule. Maybe I'll treat myself to a favorite meal or activity when I reach a milestone. I also like the idea of creating a \"Someday\" folder - it'll help me keep track of things that don't require immediate attention but might be useful in the future. Thanks for the tips!",
