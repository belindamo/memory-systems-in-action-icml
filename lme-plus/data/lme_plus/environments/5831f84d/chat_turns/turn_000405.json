Organizing and tracking your coupons, rewards programs, and sales can be a bit overwhelming, but there are several methods to make it more efficient. I've got some tips to share with you:\n\n**1. Spreadsheets:** You're already using a spreadsheet, which is an excellent way to track your coupons and savings. You can create separate sheets for:\n\t* Coupons: List the coupon details, expiration dates, and the items they can be used on.\n\t* Rewards Programs: Track your points, rewards, and expiration dates for each program.\n\t* Sales: Record the sales cycles, prices, and dates for your frequently purchased items.\n**2. Coupon Binders:** A physical binder can be a great way to organize your paper coupons. Use dividers to separate categories (e.g., groceries, household, personal care) and store your coupons in protective sheets.\n**3. Coupon Apps:** Consider using apps like:\n\t* RetailMeNot: A comprehensive coupon app with digital coupons, promo codes, and cash back offers.\n\t* Fetch Rewards: A receipt-scanning app that offers points for purchasing certain items.\n\t* Ibotta: A cash back app with offers on various items, including groceries and household essentials.\n**4. Digital Note-Taking:** Apps like Evernote, OneNote, or Simplenote can be used to store notes about sales, coupons, and rewards programs. You can access these notes across multiple devices and add tags or categories for easy searching.\n**5. Calendar Reminders:** Set reminders for coupon expiration dates, sales cycles, and rewards program deadlines using your phone's calendar or a digital calendar like Google Calendar.\n**6. Coupon Clipping Services:** If you don't have time to clip coupons, consider using a coupon clipping service like Coupons.com or CouponDede. They'll send you clipped coupons for a small fee.\n**7. Store Apps:** Many stores, including ShopRite, have their own apps that offer digital coupons, sales, and rewards programs. Make sure to download and use these apps to maximize your savings.\n**8. Meal Planning:** Plan your meals around sales and coupons to maximize your savings. You can use apps like Mealime or Yummly to help with meal planning.\n**9. Envelope System:** Divide your coupons and receipts into separate envelopes for each store or category. This can help you quickly find the coupons you need and keep your receipts organized.\n**10. Review and Purge:** Regularly review your coupons, rewards programs, and sales to ensure you're not missing out on opportunities. Purge expired coupons and update your spreadsheets or apps to reflect changes.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a method that works for you and stick to it. You can always experiment with different methods until you find one that suits your style.",
