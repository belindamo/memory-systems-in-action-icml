The main difference is the layering and materials used.\n* Pros:\n\t+ Soft and comfortable, especially for side sleepers.\n\t+ Good pressure relief and support for back sleepers.\n\t+ Affordable prices, with the lowest model starting at around $395.\n\t+ 100-night sleep trial and 10-year warranty.\n* Cons:\n\t+ Some users find it too soft or sinky.\n\t+ May not be suitable for heavier individuals or stomach sleepers.\n\t+ Limited edge support.\n\n**Purple:**\n\n* Known for: Unique Smart Comfort Grid technology, which provides excellent support and pressure relief.\n* Mattress types: Purple offers two models: the Original Purple and the Purple Hybrid. The main difference is the addition of coils in the Hybrid model.\n* Pros:\n\t+ Excellent pressure relief and support, especially for back and side sleepers.\n\t+ Unique grid design allows for good airflow and breathability.\n\t+ Suitable for heavier individuals and stomach sleepers.\n\t+ 100-night sleep trial and 10-year warranty.\n* Cons:\n\t+ Higher price point, with the lowest model starting at around $649.\n\t+ Some users find the grid design too firm or bouncy.\n\t+ May not be suitable for those who prefer a softer mattress.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n* Both brands offer high-quality mattresses with good pressure relief and support.\n* Casper is generally softer and more affordable, while Purple is firmer and more expensive.\n* If you're a side sleeper or prefer a softer mattress, Casper might be the better choice.\n* If you're a back or stomach sleeper, or prefer a more supportive mattress, Purple might be the better choice.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Read reviews from multiple sources to get a well-rounded understanding of each brand.\n* Consider your sleeping position, weight, and personal preferences when making a decision.\n* Take advantage of the sleep trials to test the mattress in the comfort of your own home.\n* Look for promotions and discounts, as both brands often offer them.\n\nUltimately, the decision comes down to your individual needs and preferences. I recommend reading more reviews, watching videos, and considering factors like warranty, return policy, and customer service before making a final decision.",
