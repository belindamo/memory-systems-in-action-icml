Remove the bacon from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate. Leave the drippings in the skillet.\n3. **Soften the onion:** Add the chopped onion to the same skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.\n4. **Add the beans and spices:** Add the soaked and drained navy beans, ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, ground mustard, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine.\n5. **Add the bacon and bourbon (if using):** Add the cooked bacon and bourbon (if using) to the skillet. Stir to combine.\n6. **Transfer to a baking dish:** Transfer the bean mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish.\n7. **Bake low and slow:** Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 6 hours. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beans are tender and the liquid has thickened.\n8. **Let it rest:** Remove the dish from the oven and let it rest for at least 30 minutes before serving.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* To add more smokiness, you can add 1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to the bean mixture.\n* If you prefer a sweeter bean, reduce the amount of brown sugar or omit it altogether.\n* To make this recipe in a slow cooker, cook on low for 8-10 hours.\n* You can also add other ingredients like diced bell peppers, chopped jalape\u00f1os, or sliced hot dogs to the bean mixture for added flavor and texture.\n\nThese Smoky Baked Beans are perfect for your summer cookout, and they're sure to be a hit with your guests!",
