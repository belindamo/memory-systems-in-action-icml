  "content": "A round mirror with a thin frame can be a great addition to your room, and placing it above your desk can create a nice focal point.\n\nSince you've recently rearranged your room, it's a good idea to consider the new layout and how the mirror will interact with the surrounding space. Here are a few things to think about:\n\n**Desk placement:** Now that your desk is in a new position, consider how the mirror will relate to the desk's height and width. If the desk is relatively low, a larger mirror might overwhelm the space. If the desk is higher, a smaller mirror might get lost.\n\n**Viewing angle:** Think about the angle at which you'll be viewing the mirror while sitting at your desk. You might want to place the mirror high enough that you can see yourself from the chest up, but not so high that it's uncomfortable to look at.\n\n**Balance and harmony:** Consider the visual balance of the room and how the mirror will interact with other elements, such as windows, artwork, or furniture. You might want to create a sense of harmony by placing the mirror above the desk, but also balancing it with other elements in the room.\n\nHere are some possible ways to place a round mirror above your desk:\n\n1. **Centered:** Place the mirror directly above the center of your desk, creating a sense of symmetry and balance.\n2. **Offset:** Position the mirror slightly off-center, creating a more dynamic and interesting composition.\n3. **Above a corner:** If your desk is in a corner, consider placing the mirror above the corner of the desk, creating a sense of depth and visual interest.\n\nRemember to take measurements and use a level to ensure the mirror is straight and level. You might also want to use a removable adhesive or command strip to hang the mirror, in case you want to adjust its position later.\n\nHow do you think you'll place the mirror above your desk?",
