  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! I'm happy to help with cat-related topics, but I don't have information about Max, your dog, or dog-related products. I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, and I don't retain information about individual pets or their owners.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general tips for finding durable chew toys for dogs:\n\n1. **Consult with your veterinarian**: Your vet can recommend suitable chew toys based on Max's breed, age, and individual needs.\n2. **Look for durable materials**: Toys made from sturdy materials like rubber, nylon, or hard plastic tend to be more resistant to chewing.\n3. **Choose toys with no small parts**: Ensure the toys don't have small parts that can be easily detached and swallowed.\n4. **Read reviews and ratings**: Check online reviews from other dog owners to see how well a particular toy has held up to their dog's chewing.\n5. **Rotate toys regularly**: Rotate Max's toys regularly to keep him engaged and prevent boredom, which can lead to destructive chewing.\n\nYou can also consider consulting with a pet supply store employee or a dog trainer for personalized recommendations on durable chew toys for Max.\n\nRemember, it's essential to supervise your dog during playtime and ensure their safety while using any new toys.",
