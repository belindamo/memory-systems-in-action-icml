I'll also use small pedestals to create different levels on the table and make the arrangement more visually appealing. For the centerpiece, I'll use a beautiful ceramic vase with some Japanese-inspired decorations. Do you have any suggestions on how to label or sign the different dishes, so my guests know what they're eating?",
