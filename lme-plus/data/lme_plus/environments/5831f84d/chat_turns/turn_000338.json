  "content": "Junmai sake is a classic pairing for yakitori. Serving sake correctly can elevate the overall experience, so I'm happy to provide some guidance on temperature, glassware, and other tips:\n\n**Temperature:**\n\n* Traditional serving temperature for Junmai sake is between 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0C) and 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C). This allows the sake's flavors and aromas to unfold without becoming too hot or too cold.\n* If you prefer a slightly chilled sake, you can store it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving. This will bring the temperature down to around 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) to 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0C).\n* Avoid serving sake too cold, as it can numb the palate and mask the flavors.\n\n**Glassware:**\n\n* Traditional Japanese sake cups, called ochoko or sakazuki, are small, delicate, and usually made of ceramic or wood. These cups are designed to enhance the aromas and flavors of the sake.\n* If you don't have traditional sake cups, a small, narrow wine glass or a champagne flute can work well. Avoid using wide, shallow glasses, as they can dissipate the aromas too quickly.\n* Consider using a glass with a slightly narrowed opening, as this will help concentrate the aromas and direct them towards your nose.\n\n**Serving Tips:**\n\n* Pour the sake gently, as you would pour a fine wine, to avoid creating foam or disturbing the sediment at the bottom of the bottle.\n* Hold the sake cup or glass with both hands, as is traditionally done in Japan, to show respect and appreciation for the beverage.\n* Take a small sip, and then swirl the sake in your cup to release the aromas. This is called \" kanpai\" in Japanese.\n* When serving multiple people, it's customary for the host to pour the sake for their guests, and then the guests will pour for the host as a sign of appreciation.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Store your sake in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavor and aroma. Avoid direct sunlight, heat, or strong odors.\n* Once opened, sake is best consumed within a few days to a week. You can store it in the refrigerator to slow down oxidation.\n* Consider serving the sake in a carafe or decanter, especially if you're serving a larger group. This allows the sake to breathe and can enhance the overall aroma and flavor.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to showcase the Junmai sake beautifully and create a memorable experience for your dinner party guests. Kanpai!",
