As a beginner, it's essential to understand that these games have a steep learning curve, but with practice and patience, you can improve and have a great time playing with your brother.\n\nHere's a brief rundown of what you can expect from each game:\n\n**Overwatch:**\n\n* Overwatch has a diverse cast of heroes, each with unique abilities, playstyles, and roles (tank, damage, support).\n* The game has a strong focus on team composition, strategy, and coordination.\n* It's essential to learn the basics of each hero, their strengths, weaknesses, and counters.\n* The game has a ranking system, and as you climb the ranks, you'll face more skilled opponents.\n* Overwatch has a friendly community, and Blizzard provides resources like tutorials, guides, and practice modes to help new players learn.\n\n**Apex Legends:**\n\n* Apex Legends is a battle royale game where you drop onto a map with up to 59 other players, scavenging for weapons and supplies while fighting to be the last team standing.\n* The game has a strong focus on movement, positioning, and strategy, as well as communication with your team.\n* Apex Legends has a unique respawn system, where eliminated players can be revived by their teammates.\n* The game has a more relaxed atmosphere compared to Overwatch, with a focus on fast-paced action and quick decision-making.\n* Respawn Entertainment provides tutorials and guides to help new players learn the game's mechanics and strategies.\n\nTo get started with these games, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Start with the tutorials and guides**: Both games offer extensive tutorials and guides that will teach you the basics of each hero or game mode.\n2. **Play against AI or in custom games**: Play against AI opponents or in custom games with your brother to get a feel for the game's mechanics and practice your skills without the pressure of ranked matches.\n3. **Focus on one or two heroes/legends at a time**: Don't try to learn every hero or legend at once. Focus on a few and master their abilities before moving on to others.\n4. **Communicate with your brother**: Communication is key in competitive games. Make sure to coordinate with your brother, share strategies, and provide feedback to each other.\n5. **Be patient and don't get discouraged**: You'll likely face losses and frustrations, especially in the beginning. Don't get discouraged, and remember that practice is key to improving.\n6. **Watch pro players and streams**: Watching professional players and streams can help you learn new strategies, techniques, and mechanics.\n\nBy following these tips, you and your brother can have a blast playing competitive games like Overwatch and Apex Legends.
