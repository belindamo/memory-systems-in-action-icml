Since sales and promotions can vary by location and week, I'll provide you with some general tips and resources to help you find the best deals.\n\n**Check the ShopRite Weekly Ad**: The first step is to check the ShopRite weekly ad for your local store. You can do this on their website or through their mobile app. Look for the \"Diapers\" and \"Baby Formula\" sections to see if they have any sales or promotions listed.\n\n**Digital Coupons**: Make sure to check the ShopRite digital coupon section on their website or app. They often offer digital coupons that you can load onto your rewards card, which can be used in addition to sales and promotions.

Look for opportunities to combine these deals to get the best price possible.\n\n**Manufacturer's Coupons**: Check the websites of diaper and formula manufacturers, such as Pampers, Huggies, Enfamil, and Similac, for printable coupons or digital coupons that you can use in addition to ShopRite's sales and digital coupons.\n\n**ShopRite Rewards**: As a rewards member, you'll earn points on your purchases, which can be redeemed for discounts on future shopping trips.
