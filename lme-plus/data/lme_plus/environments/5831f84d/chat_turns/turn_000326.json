Adding more artwork can definitely make the room feel more personalized and visually interesting. Since you already have a triangular formation above your bed, you can create a cohesive look by using a similar style or theme for the new artwork.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when creating a gallery wall around the mirror:\n\n1. **Unify with a theme:** Choose artwork that shares a common theme, color palette, or style to create a sense of cohesion. This will help tie the pieces together and create a visually appealing arrangement.\n2. **Mix and match frames:** Combine frames of different shapes, sizes, and materials to add visual interest. You can use a mix of white, black, or wooden frames to create a unique look.\n3. **Balance large and small pieces:** Pair larger pieces with smaller ones to create a sense of balance. This will prevent the wall from feeling overwhelming or too cluttered.\n4. **Leave breathing room:** Don't overcrowd the wall. Leave some space between the pieces to create a sense of breathing room and visual flow.\n5. **Play with shapes:** Combine rectangular, square, and circular shapes to add visual interest. You can also use abstract shapes or unconventional frames to add a touch of whimsy.\n6. **Consider the mirror's size:** Make sure the artwork doesn't overwhelm the mirror. You want the mirror to remain a focal point, so balance the size and number of pieces accordingly.\n7. **Experiment and have fun:** Don't be afraid to move pieces around, try different arrangements, and experiment with different layouts until you find one that feels right to you.\n\nSome popular gallery wall layouts include:\n\n1. **Symmetrical:** Create a symmetrical arrangement around the mirror, with identical pieces on either side.\n2. **Asymmetrical:** Create a more relaxed, asymmetrical arrangement, with pieces placed in a way that feels organic and natural.\n3. **Grid-based:** Use a grid as a guide to create a more structured arrangement, with pieces aligned along imaginary lines.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful gallery wall is to have fun and be creative!",
