This will ensure that when the user scrolls through the video feed, each video will snap into place, occupying the entire viewport.\n\nFirst, in `Home.svelte`, update the `ul` element to use a CSS class named `video-feed`:\n```html\n<ul id=\"video-list\" class=\"video-feed\">\n  {#each videos as video}\n    <li>\n      <VideoPlayer src=\"{video.url}\" videoId=\"{video.id}\" />\n    </li>\n  {/each}\n</ul>\n```\nNext, add the following CSS styles to `Home.svelte`:\n```css\n.video-feed {\n  list-style-type: none;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100vh;\n  overflow-y: scroll;\n  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\n\n.video-feed li {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  min-height: 100vh;\n  scroll-snap-align: start;\n  scroll-snap-stop: always;\n}\n```\nThese styles achieve the following:\n\n1. `.video-feed`: Defines the video feed as a scroll container with a mandatory snap type along the y-axis. This ensures that the scrolling will snap to specific points along the y-axis (defined by the `scroll-snap-align` property of the child elements). The `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` line provides smooth scrolling for iOS devices.\n2. `.video-feed li`: Defines each list item (video) as a snap point using the `scroll-snap-align: start;` property. The `scroll-snap-stop: always;` property ensures the scrolling will always stop at the snap point, even when the user scrolls quickly.\n\nNow, your infinite scroll video feed in `Home.svelte` will have a snap-to experience, with each video snapping into place and occupying the entire viewport as the user scrolls through the feed.",
