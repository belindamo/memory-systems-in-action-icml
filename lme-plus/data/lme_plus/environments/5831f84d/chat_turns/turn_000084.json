  "content": "The Dino Dig exhibit and the Dino-Mite Tour are two separate activities, and you'll need to book them separately. Here's what you can do:\n\n1. **Book the Dino Dig exhibit**: You can book a timed-entry ticket for the Dino Dig exhibit on the Natural History Museum's website. This will ensure that you have a spot at the exhibit during your preferred time slot.\n2. **Book the Dino-Mite Tour**: To book the Dino-Mite Tour, you'll need to visit the Natural History Museum's website and search for \"Guided Tours\" or \"Dino-Mite Tour\" specifically. You can then select a date and time for the tour that fits your schedule.\n\n**Important:** Make sure to schedule the Dino Dig exhibit and the Dino-Mite Tour at different times, as they are separate activities that cannot be done simultaneously. You can plan to do the Dino Dig exhibit before or after the guided tour, depending on your preference.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Book both activities well in advance, especially during peak seasons or school holidays, as they tend to fill up quickly.\n* Consider booking the Dino-Mite Tour during a less busy time of day, such as early morning or late afternoon, to avoid crowds.\n* Plan for some extra time between activities to grab a snack, take a break, or explore other exhibits in the museum.\n\nBy booking both activities separately, you can create a fun-filled dinosaur-themed day at the Natural History Museum that your niece will never forget!",
