Be flexible with your travel dates, and consider flying into Rome and out of Split to avoid backtracking.

You can also consider purchasing a guided tour package that includes multiple attractions at a discounted rate.\n6. **Budget-friendly tips for Santorini:**\n\t* Visit Oia during the day to avoid the crowds and high prices of sunset.\n\t* Take a bus or walk to the nearby village of Imerovigli for stunning views without the high prices of Oia.\n\t* Enjoy a traditional Greek lunch at a local taverna instead of a fancy restaurant.\n7. **Budget-friendly tips for Split:**\n\t* Explore the Diocletian's Palace and surrounding historic center on your own instead of taking a guided tour.\n\t* Visit the Mestrovic Gallery, which offers free admission on Sundays.\n\t* Take a stroll along the Riva waterfront and enjoy the lively atmosphere without spending a fortune.\n\nBy following these tips, you can make this itinerary more affordable for your family while still enjoying an unforgettable trip.\n\nAs you mentioned, it's great that you're planning a family trip, and I'm sure you'll create many wonderful memories together.
