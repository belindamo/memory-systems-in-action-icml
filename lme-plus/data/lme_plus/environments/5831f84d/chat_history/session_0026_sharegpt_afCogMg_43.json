      "content": "The H-2A and H-2B petitions are used for temporary or seasonal work, such as agricultural work or non-agricultural labor. The form I-129 is used for both H-2A and H-2B petitions. The employer must provide a temporary labor certification from the Department of Labor or Guam Department of Labor, if required. The number of workers requested in the petition must not exceed the number of workers approved by the Department of Labor. When naming beneficiaries, the employer may request unnamed workers, some named and some unnamed workers, as long as the same action is being requested for each worker. However, workers must be named if they are currently in the United States, are nationals of countries that are not on the eligible countries list, or must meet minimum job requirements described on the temporary labor certification. Additionally, prohibited fees, such as job placement fees, may not be collected from the beneficiaries and if they are, the petition may be denied or revoked. The employer must also provide evidence that the beneficiaries have not paid, and will not pay, prohibited fees to the best of their knowledge. Interrupted stays are also specified in the form where the employer must provide evidence of the beneficiary's continuous physical presence in the U.S. and outside the U.S. during the interrupted stay."
