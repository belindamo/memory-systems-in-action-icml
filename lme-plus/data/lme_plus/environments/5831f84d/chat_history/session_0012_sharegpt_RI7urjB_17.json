      "content": "The early morning sun shone through the stained glass windows of the King's chamber, casting colorful patterns on the stone floor. Kael stood at the bedside of his liege, King Eadric, and watched as the monarch's chest rose and fell in shallow breaths. The Cureweaver's brow furrowed in concern as he examined the King's pale face, searching for any signs of improvement. But there were none. It had been hours since the King had fallen into a deep slumber, and no amount of Kael's healing magic could awaken him. Something was very wrong, and Kael feared that time was running out."
