    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Ultimately, it depends on your own personal style and how comfortable you are with experimenting with bold hair color trends. If you're feeling adventurous, you can opt for something bold like vivid or pastel tones, ombre or balayage, or even a unique pattern like dip-dye or color blocking. However, if you prefer a more subtle change, you can try highlights, lowlights or babylights that add dimension to your hair without drastically changing your overall look. It's important to remember that whatever you choose, it should make you feel confident and happy!"
