Please feel free to share as much or as little as you're comfortable with. Here are some questions to consider:\n\n1. What is the time period you'd like to focus on (e.g., past year, 5 years, 10 years)?\n2. What significant health events or conditions have you experienced during this time (e.g., surgeries, illnesses, injuries, chronic conditions)?\n3. Have you had any hospitalizations or emergency room visits? If so, when and why?\n4. Have you seen any specialists or primary care physicians regularly? If so, who and when?\n5. Have you taken any medications or supplements regularly? If so, what and for how long?\n6. Have you had any notable test results or diagnoses (e.g., lab results, imaging studies, biopsies)?\n7. Have you experienced any changes in your symptoms or health status over time?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a timeline of your recent health events. You can also feel free to add any additional details or context that you think might be helpful.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a clear and concise timeline that will help you keep track of your medical history and communicate effectively with your healthcare providers."

Even if you're not sure of the exact dates, a rough estimate (e.g., \"around 4 weeks ago\" or \"about 3.5 weeks ago\") can be helpful.\n\nAlso, do you remember when your mom's hip replacement surgery was, and when you started helping with her recovery?"

Was it a sudden onset, or did the symptoms develop over time?\n3.
