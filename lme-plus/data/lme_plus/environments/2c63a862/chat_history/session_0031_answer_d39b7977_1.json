    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "With a budget of $350,000, you'll have a good range of options in the neighborhoods I mentioned earlier. Here's a breakdown of what you might expect to find in each area:\n\n1. **Tustin**: You can find older homes (1970s-1990s) in Tustin's established neighborhoods, such as Tustin Heights or Red Hill, within the $350,000 budget. These homes might need some updating, but they often have larger lots and are in good school districts. You might also find newer townhomes or condos in the $250,000-$350,000 range.\n2. **Lake Forest**: In Lake Forest, you can find newer homes (2000s-2010s) in neighborhoods like Foothill Ranch or Portola Hills within your budget. These homes might be smaller, around 1,500-2,500 sqft, but they're often in good condition and have modern amenities. You might also find older homes (1970s-1980s) that need some updating, but have more space and larger lots.\n3. **Mission Viejo**: Mission Viejo has a range of options within the $350,000 budget. You can find older homes (1970s-1980s) in neighborhoods like Lake Mission Viejo or Olympiad that need some updating, but have larger lots and are in good school districts. You might also find newer homes (1990s-2000s) in neighborhoods like Canyon Crest or Casta del Sol that are in good condition and have modern amenities.\n4. **Rancho Santa Margarita**: In Rancho Santa Margarita, you can find newer homes (2000s-2010s) in neighborhoods like Dove Canyon or Robinson Ranch within your budget. These homes might be smaller, around 1,500-2,500 sqft, but they're often in good condition and have modern amenities. You might also find older homes (1990s) that need some updating, but have more space and larger lots.\n5. **Ladera Ranch**: Ladera Ranch is a bit more challenging in the $350,000 budget, as it's an upscale community with newer homes. However, you might find some older homes (1990s-2000s) in certain neighborhoods like Oak Knoll or Covenant Hills that fit within your budget. These homes might need some updating, but they're in a desirable area with good schools.\n\nKeep in mind that home prices can vary depending on factors like the home's condition, size, age, and location within the neighborhood. I recommend working closely with Rachel to find homes that fit your specific needs and budget. She can provide more detailed information on the current market and help you find the perfect home.\n\nRemember to also consider factors like property taxes, HOA fees, and commute time when evaluating different neighborhoods and homes. Good luck with your home search!",

      "content": "The types of properties available in each neighborhood can vary, but here's a general breakdown:\n\n1. **Tustin**: Tustin has a mix of older and newer homes. You'll find many resale homes from the 1970s to 1990s, including single-family homes, townhomes, and condos. There are some newer developments, but they're less common. You might find some newer construction in smaller pockets, like infill projects or boutique developments, but they're not as prevalent as in other areas.\n2. **Lake Forest**: Lake Forest has a range of properties, including older homes from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as newer construction from the 2000s and 2010s. You'll find single-family homes, townhomes, and condos, including some newer developments in areas like Foothill Ranch and Portola Hills.

Tustin and Mission Viejo have fewer new construction projects, but you might still find some smaller, boutique developments or infill projects.\n\nKeep in mind that the availability of new construction can change over time, and it's always a good idea to check with Rachel or other local real estate agents for the most up-to-date information on current and upcoming developments.\n\nIt's also worth considering the pros and cons of new construction versus resale homes. New construction often comes with modern amenities and energy-efficient features, but may have higher prices and potential construction delays. Resale homes can offer more character and established neighborhoods, but may require more maintenance and updating.",
