      "content": "Certainly! Here is the Wolfram Language code (used in Mathematica) that I used to generate the table of planet densities along with images of each planet:\n```wolfram\nplanetData = EntityValue[EntityClass[\"Planet\", All], {\"Name\", \"Density\", \"Image\"}];\nplanetTable = TableForm[planetData, TableHeadings -> {None, {\"Planet\", \"Density (kg/m^3)\", \"Image\"}}];\nplanetTable\n```\nThis code retrieves data for all planets in our solar system using the `EntityValue` function with the `EntityClass` of \"Planet\". It then extracts the \"Name\", \"Density\", and \"Image\" properties for each planet. The data is then formatted into a table using the `TableForm` function, with headings for \"Planet\", \"Density (kg/m^3)\", and \"Image\". The resulting table is stored in the variable `planetTable` and is displayed as the output."
