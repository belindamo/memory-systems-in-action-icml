Tustin and Mission Viejo have fewer new construction projects, but you might still find some smaller, boutique developments or infill projects.\n\nKeep in mind that the availability of new construction can change over time, and it's always a good idea to check with Rachel or other local real estate agents for the most up-to-date information on current and upcoming developments.\n\nIt's also worth considering the pros and cons of new construction versus resale homes. New construction often comes with modern amenities and energy-efficient features, but may have higher prices and potential construction delays. Resale homes can offer more character and established neighborhoods, but may require more maintenance and updating.",
