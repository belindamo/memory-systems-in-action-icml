By providing a diverse range of characters and storylines, the film is able to showcase the different ways in which people can seek redemption and find meaning in their lives. \n\nFurthermore, each character brings their own unique experiences and perspectives, providing a more comprehensive view of the theme of second chances. By following multiple characters' stories, the film shows that everyone has their own journey and struggles towards redemption, and that it can take different forms.\n\nIf the film had focused solely on one character, it may have been able to explore that character's journey in greater detail, but it could have also limited the scope of the film in terms of exploring different perspectives and experiences. The film's impact comes from its ability to interweave multiple narratives and characters, creating a layered and nuanced exploration of the theme of second chances.",
