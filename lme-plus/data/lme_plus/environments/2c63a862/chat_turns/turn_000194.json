I'm sure that was an amazing experience, and it's great that you're considering adding her music to your playlist.\n\nIn that case, Tove Lo's music might actually be a great fit for your playlist, especially since you've seen her live and enjoyed her performance. Her music often has a dark, edgy vibe that could complement Billie Eilish's sound nicely. You could consider adding some of her tracks like **Habits (Stay High)** or **Cool Girl** to your playlist.\n\nThese songs have a more indie-pop oriented sound that might blend well with the rest of your playlist. Plus, it'll be a great way to relive the memories of the music festival with Rachel!",
