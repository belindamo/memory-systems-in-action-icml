I'm glad you like the layout, though.\n\nCalculating the total amount spent in a specific month or year using formulas is a great way to get insights from your data. Here are some examples of formulas you can use:\n\n**Total Amount Spent in a Specific Month:**\n\n=SUMIFS(Amount, Month, \"March\")\n\n* This formula assumes your Amount column is in column E and your Month column is in column G.\n* The SUMIFS function adds up all the values in the Amount column (E) where the value in the Month column (G) is \"March\".\n\n**Total Amount Spent in a Specific Year:**\n\n=SUMIFS(Amount, Year, 2023)\n\n* This formula assumes your Amount column is in column E and your Year column is in column H.\n* The SUMIFS function adds up all the values in the Amount column (E) where the value in the Year column (H) is 2023.\n\n**Total Amount Spent in a Specific Store:**\n\n=SUMIFS(Amount, Store, \"ASOS\")\n\n* This formula assumes your Amount column is in column E and your Store column is in column B.\n* The SUMIFS function adds up all the values in the Amount column (E) where the value in the Store column (B) is \"ASOS\".\n\nYou can also use these formulas to calculate the total amount spent in a specific category, weekday, or any other column you've created.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to adjust the column letters and formulas to match your actual spreadsheet layout.\n* Use the AutoSum feature to quickly enter the SUMIFS formula: select the cell where you want to display the total, go to the formula bar, type \"=SUMIFS(\", select the Amount column, type a comma, select the column you want to filter by (e.g., Month, Year, Store), type a comma, and then type the specific value you want to filter by (e.g., \"March\", 2023, \"ASOS\"). Press Enter to calculate the total.\n* You can also use pivot tables to summarize your data and create custom reports. If you're not familiar with pivot tables, I can provide more information on how to use them.",
