Here are some fantastic options:\n\n1. **Kong Classic Dog Toy**: A classic choice for active dogs, Kongs are made from ultra-durable rubber and can withstand aggressive chewing. You can fill the hollow center with treats, peanut butter, or even canned dog food to keep Max engaged.\n2. **GoughNuts Black**: GoughNuts are designed for aggressive chewers and are made from a proprietary rubber compound that's virtually indestructible. They come in various shapes and sizes, and the Black series is perfect for active dogs like Max.\n3. **Nylabone DuraChew Textured Ring**: Nylabone's DuraChew toys are designed for powerful chewers and are made from a tough, flexible material. The textured ring shape provides a fun challenge for Max to gnaw on.\n4. **West Paw Design Tux Interactive Dog Toy**: West Paw toys are known for their durability and innovative designs. The Tux Interactive Dog Toy is a puzzle toy that challenges Max to figure out how to get the treats out, keeping him engaged and stimulated.\n5. **Outward Hound Brick Puzzle**: Another puzzle toy, the Outward Hound Brick Puzzle provides a fun and challenging way for Max to get his treats.

You can also try stuffing treats or kibble inside the toys to make them more appealing and challenging.\n\nWhich of these toys do you think Max would love the most?",
