Here are some tips to help you set up an escape-proof fence for your lamb:\n\n**Fencing Type:**\n\n1. **High-Tensile Wire**: Consider using high-tensile wire fencing, which is durable and can withstand Luna's energy. The wire should be at least 12.5 gauge and 48 inches tall.\n2. **Electric Fencing**: Electric fencing can be an effective deterrent for lambs. You can use a single-strand electric fence or a multi-strand fence with a energizer and insulators.\n3. **Mesh Fencing**: Mesh fencing with openings no larger than 2 inches can prevent Luna from getting her head or legs stuck.\n\n**Fencing Installation:**\n\n1. **Bury the Fence**: Bury the fence 12-18 inches underground to prevent Luna from digging underneath.\n2. **Secure Posts**: Use sturdy posts, such as wood or metal, and secure them deeply into the ground to prevent them from toppling over.\n3. **Tighten the Fence**: Ensure the fence is tightly secured to the posts to prevent sagging or gaps.\n\n**Fence Height:**\n\n1. **Minimum Height**: The fence should be at least 48 inches tall to prevent Luna from jumping over.\n2. **Consider Breed**: If Luna is a smaller breed, you may need to adjust the fence height accordingly.\n\n**Gates and Openings:**\n\n1. **Secure Gates**: Ensure gates are securely attached to the fence and can be locked to prevent Luna from pushing them open.\n2. **Gate Size**: Make sure gates are wide enough for you to enter and exit comfortably, but not so wide that Luna can escape.\n3. **No Gaps**: Ensure there are no gaps or openings in the fence or gates that Luna can squeeze through.\n\n**Regular Inspections:**\n\n1. **Regularly Inspect**: Regularly inspect the fence for signs of damage, wear, or sagging.\n2. **Repair Promptly**: Repair any damage or weaknesses promptly to prevent Luna from exploiting them.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Supervise**: Supervise Luna when she's in the fenced area to ensure she's not trying to escape or getting into trouble.\n2. **Provide Enrichment**: Provide Luna with plenty of enrichment activities, such as toys and scratching posts, to reduce boredom and prevent escape attempts.\n3. **Train Luna**: Train Luna to respect the fence and gates by using positive reinforcement techniques.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create an escape-proof fence for Luna and ensure her safety in your backyard.",
