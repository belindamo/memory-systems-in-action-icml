  "content": "I plan to incorporate these stretches into my routine by doing them after my runs, on my rest days, or as a cool-down after my strength training sessions. I'll start with 2-3 times a week and see how my body adapts. I'll also focus on stretching my lower body, especially my calves, hamstrings, and quads, since they tend to be the most prone to tightness and soreness after running. Additionally, I'll make sure to hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds and breathe deeply and naturally to get the most out of the stretches.",
