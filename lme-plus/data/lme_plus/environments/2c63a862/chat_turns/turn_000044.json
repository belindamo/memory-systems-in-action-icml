  "content": "SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy is crucial for Edmonton, Canada, as the city seeks to diversify its energy sources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies. By prioritizing clean energy initiatives, Edmonton can contribute to a more sustainable energy future and support the global transition toward low-carbon energy systems.\n\nEdmonton's Community Energy Transition Strategy outlines the city's vision for a low-carbon, climate-resilient future and highlights the importance of diversifying energy sources and increasing the share of renewable energy in the city's energy mix [1]. The strategy includes targets to reduce GHG emissions by 35% by 2035 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nSolar energy is a significant focus for Edmonton, as the city has considerable solar potential due to its high solar irradiance levels and long daylight hours during the summer months [2]. The city has initiated several solar energy projects, including installing solar panels on municipal buildings and infrastructure, such as the Edmonton Valley Zoo, recreation centers, and LRT maintenance facilities [3]. Additionally, the city provides incentives for residents and businesses to install solar photovoltaic systems through its Change Homes for Climate Solar Program [4].\n\nEdmonton is also exploring other renewable energy sources, such as wind power and biomass energy. The city has partnered with EPCOR, a local utility company, to develop a biomass energy project at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre, which uses landfill gas to generate electricity and reduce GHG emissions [5].\n\nFurthermore, Edmonton's energy strategy emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency and conservation in achieving SDG 7. The city has implemented various programs to improve energy efficiency in buildings, such as the Building Energy Benchmarking Program, which encourages commercial and institutional buildings to track and reduce their energy consumption [6].\n\nIn conclusion, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy is an essential goal for Edmonton as it strives to diversify its energy sources and reduce its environmental impact. By prioritizing renewable energy initiatives, investing in energy efficiency, and promoting the adoption of clean energy technologies, Edmonton can contribute to a more sustainable energy future for its residents and support the global shift toward low-carbon energy systems.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] City of Edmonton.
