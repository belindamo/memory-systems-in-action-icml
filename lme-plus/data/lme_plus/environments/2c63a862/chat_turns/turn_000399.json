  "content": "I've already got pre-approved for a mortgage, actually, on February 10th. The amount was $350,000, which is slightly higher than I expected. I've been working with an agent, Rachel, who's been helping me find homes that fit my criteria. The house I saw on March 1st really checks all the boxes, so I'm hoping to make a strong offer. What do you think about including an inspection contingency in my offer?",
