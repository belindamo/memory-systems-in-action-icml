  "content": "With a budget of $350,000, you'll have a good range of options in the neighborhoods I mentioned earlier. Here's a breakdown of what you might expect to find in each area:\n\n1. **Tustin**: You can find older homes (1970s-1990s) in Tustin's established neighborhoods, such as Tustin Heights or Red Hill, within the $350,000 budget. These homes might need some updating, but they often have larger lots and are in good school districts. You might also find newer townhomes or condos in the $250,000-$350,000 range.\n2. **Lake Forest**: In Lake Forest, you can find newer homes (2000s-2010s) in neighborhoods like Foothill Ranch or Portola Hills within your budget. These homes might be smaller, around 1,500-2,500 sqft, but they're often in good condition and have modern amenities. You might also find older homes (1970s-1980s) that need some updating, but have more space and larger lots.\n3. **Mission Viejo**: Mission Viejo has a range of options within the $350,000 budget. You can find older homes (1970s-1980s) in neighborhoods like Lake Mission Viejo or Olympiad that need some updating, but have larger lots and are in good school districts. You might also find newer homes (1990s-2000s) in neighborhoods like Canyon Crest or Casta del Sol that are in good condition and have modern amenities.\n4. **Rancho Santa Margarita**: In Rancho Santa Margarita, you can find newer homes (2000s-2010s) in neighborhoods like Dove Canyon or Robinson Ranch within your budget. These homes might be smaller, around 1,500-2,500 sqft, but they're often in good condition and have modern amenities. You might also find older homes (1990s) that need some updating, but have more space and larger lots.\n5. **Ladera Ranch**: Ladera Ranch is a bit more challenging in the $350,000 budget, as it's an upscale community with newer homes. However, you might find some older homes (1990s-2000s) in certain neighborhoods like Oak Knoll or Covenant Hills that fit within your budget. These homes might need some updating, but they're in a desirable area with good schools.\n\nKeep in mind that home prices can vary depending on factors like the home's condition, size, age, and location within the neighborhood. I recommend working closely with Rachel to find homes that fit your specific needs and budget. She can provide more detailed information on the current market and help you find the perfect home.\n\nRemember to also consider factors like property taxes, HOA fees, and commute time when evaluating different neighborhoods and homes. Good luck with your home search!",
