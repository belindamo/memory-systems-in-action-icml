Those actions are related to your laptop's internal performance and battery life, rather than its internet connectivity.\n\nBattery calibration is a process that helps your laptop's battery maintain its accuracy in reporting its charge level. This can help with battery life and overall system performance, but it doesn't affect your internet connection.\n\nStorage cleanup, on the other hand, is a process of removing unnecessary files, temp data, and other clutter from your laptop's storage drive. This can free up disk space, improve system performance, and even help with boot times, but it doesn't have a direct impact on your internet speeds.\n\nInternet speeds are primarily dependent on your internet plan, modem, router, and the quality of your internet service provider's (ISP) infrastructure. Issues with your laptop's hardware or software can affect your overall online experience, but they wouldn't typically cause slow internet speeds.\n\nThat being said, if your laptop is experiencing slow performance or high CPU usage, it could potentially cause issues with your internet browsing experience. For example, if your laptop is struggling to render web pages quickly, it might feel like your internet is slow. However, this would be a separate issue from your internet speeds themselves.\n\nTo confirm, I'd recommend running speed tests on multiple devices connected to your network to see if the slow speeds are consistent across devices. If you're experiencing slow speeds on multiple devices, it's more likely related to your internet plan, modem, or router. If the issue is specific to your laptop, it might be worth exploring other troubleshooting steps to optimize its performance.\n\nKeep me posted on what you discover about your modem's compatibility and any further troubleshooting steps you take!",
