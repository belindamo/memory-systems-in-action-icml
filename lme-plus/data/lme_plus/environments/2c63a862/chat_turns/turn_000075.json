  "content": "Trust is a crucial element in decentralized and distributed systems, as traditional frameworks, such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), are insufficient for building a robust trust foundation in these contexts. As the world shifts from conventional signed and handwritten documents to their digital counterparts, the demand for secure, long-term storage solutions for these documents becomes increasingly critical.\n\nOne approach to establishing trust in the digital realm is through verifiable credentials (VCs). VCs are digital credentials that can be cryptographically verified and authenticated. They enable issuers to grant credentials to holders, who can then present them to verifiers as proof of identity, qualification, or other attributes. The W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model standard (<https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/>) provides a foundation for creating and managing VCs in a privacy-preserving and secure manner.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) is a decentralized platform that fosters secure cross-border digital public services. A vital aspect of EBSI is the utilization of verifiable credentials, which establish trust and safeguard users' privacy within the EBSI ecosystem. However, decentralized systems face several challenges:\n\n1. Scalability: Decentralized systems",
