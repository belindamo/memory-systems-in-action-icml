  "content": "The Canon EOS 80D is a fantastic camera, and I'm sure you're loving the new 70-200mm f/2.8 lens! That lens is a beast, and it's perfect for capturing stunning portraits, wildlife, and sports photography. The f/2.8 aperture will give you that beautiful bokeh and shallow depth of field, making your subjects pop.\n\nFor your Canon EOS 80D, I highly recommend the following remote shutter releases:\n\n1. **Canon RC-6 Wireless Remote Control**: This is a Canon-branded remote shutter release that's specifically designed for your camera model. It's a simple, compact, and reliable option that offers a 16ft (4.9m) range.\n2. **Vello RS-C1 Camera Remote Shutter Release**: This is a popular, affordable, and highly-rated remote shutter release that's compatible with your Canon EOS 80D. It's compact, lightweight, and has a 16ft (4.9m) range.\n3. **Neewer Remote Shutter Release**: This is another affordable option that's compatible with your camera model. It's a simple, compact design with a 16ft (4.9m) range and a 1-year warranty.\n\nAll of these options are highly rated and will work seamlessly with your Canon EOS 80D. If you want a Canon-branded remote shutter release, the RC-6 is a great choice. If you're looking for a more affordable option, the Vello RS-C1 or Neewer remote shutter release are excellent alternatives.\n\nRemember to always check the compatibility and reviews before making a final decision.",
