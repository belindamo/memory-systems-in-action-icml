  "content": "Categorizing your purchases is a great way to understand where your money is going and identify areas for improvement. Here's an example of how you can categorize your purchases into groups like clothing, electronics, books, etc.:\n\n**Category List:**\n\nCreate a list of categories that make sense for your spending habits. Here's a starting point:\n\n* Clothing\n* Electronics\n* Books\n* Home Goods\n* Beauty & Personal Care\n* Health & Wellness\n* Entertainment (e.g., movies, games, concerts)\n* Travel\n* Food & Dining\n* Miscellaneous\n\n**Categorizing Your Purchases:**\n\nFor each purchase, assign a category from your list. You can add a new column to your spreadsheet for the category, or use a dropdown list to ensure consistency.\n\n**Example Data:**\n\n| Date | Store | Category | Item Description | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3/10/2023 | ASOS | Clothing | Women's T-Shirt | $25.00 |\n| 3/12/2023 | Amazon | Electronics | Wireless Earbuds | $50.00 |\n| 3/17/2023 | ASOS | Clothing | Men's Jeans | $40.00 |\n| 3/20/2023 | Barnes & Noble | Books | Novel | $15.00 |\n| 3/24/2023 | ASOS | Clothing | Women's Boots | $60.00 |\n| 3/28/2023 | Best Buy | Electronics | TV | $500.00 |\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be specific with your categories, but not too specific. You want to strike a balance between having enough detail and not overwhelming yourself with too many categories.\n* Consider creating subcategories if you need more granularity. For example, under Clothing, you could have subcategories like Tops, Bottoms, Dresses, etc.\n* You can also use numbers or codes to represent each category, which can make it easier to analyze and filter your data.\n* Review your categories regularly and adjust as needed. Your spending habits may change over time, and your categories should reflect those changes.\n\nNow that you have your categories set up, you can use formulas to calculate the total amount spent in each category, like this:\n\n=SUMIFS(Amount, Category, \"Clothing\")\n\nThis formula adds up all the values in the Amount column where the value in the Category column is \"Clothing\".\n\nRemember, the key is to make your categorization system work for you and your spending habits. Experiment with different categories and subcategories until you find a system that helps you understand your spending and make informed decisions.",
