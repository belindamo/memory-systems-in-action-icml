Here's the revised version:\n\n**4 months ago:**\n\n* Gallbladder removal surgery\n\n**2 months ago:**\n\n* Mom's hip replacement surgery\n\t+ Started assisting with her recovery\n\n**6 weeks ago (Tuesday and Wednesday):**\n\n* Developed a cold\n\t+ Symptoms: Fever (102\u00b0F), [add any other symptoms you experienced, e.g., cough, sore throat, body aches, etc.]\n\n**3 weeks ago:**\n\n* Recovered from cold\n* Started experiencing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in left arm\n\t+ Symptoms: Numbness, tingling\n\n**Week 4:**\n\n* Follow-up appointment with surgeon for gallbladder removal surgery (approximate date: _____________)\n\t+ Discussion/results: _____________________________________ (e.g., healing progress, any complications, etc.)\n\n**Ongoing:**\n\n* Continued to assist with mom's hip replacement recovery\n\nIt looks like we're getting close to finalizing the timeline! Can you try to estimate the date of your follow-up appointment with your surgeon for the gallbladder removal surgery? Even a rough estimate (e.g., \"around 2-3 weeks ago\") would be helpful.\n\nAlso, I want to remind you that this timeline is for your reference, and you can always add or modify it as needed. It's a great tool to help you keep track of your health events and communicate with your healthcare providers.",
