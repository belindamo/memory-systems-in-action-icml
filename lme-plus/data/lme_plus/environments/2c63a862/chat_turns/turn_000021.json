  "content": "A Magnolia scale infestation can last indefinitely if left untreated, and it can cause significant damage to the tree over time. Magnolia scales feed on the sap of the tree, which can weaken the tree and stunt its growth. In severe cases, the leaves may turn yellow and drop prematurely, and the branches may die back. If left untreated, a Magnolia scale infestation can ultimately kill the tree, especially if it is already stressed due to other factors such as drought, heat stress or poor nutrition.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that a Magnolia scale infestation is easier to control if it is caught early on, before the insects have had time to reproduce and spread. Regularly inspecting your Magnolia tree for signs of infestation, and taking appropriate measures such as pruning and applying insecticides or horticultural oils, can help to control the infestation and prevent significant damage to the tree.",
