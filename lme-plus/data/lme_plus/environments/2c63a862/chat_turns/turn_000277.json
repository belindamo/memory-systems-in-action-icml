  "content": "Sure, here are some great healthy snack options you can keep on-hand:\n\n1. Fresh fruit: A piece of fruit is a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth and get some vitamins and fiber. Try having apples, bananas, oranges, and berries on hand. 2. Nuts and seeds: Nuts and seeds are a great source of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. Try almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds. 3. Vegetables and dip: Hummus, guacamole, and tzatziki are all great dip options to pair with carrots, celery, cucumber slices, and cherry tomatoes. 4. Greek yogurt: Greek yogurt is high in protein and makes a great snack on its own or paired with fresh fruit. 5. Popcorn: Popcorn is a great whole grain snack that is high in fiber. Just make sure to choose air-popped and skip the butter and salt. 6. Homemade energy balls: Mix together oats, nut butter, honey, and some add-ins like chocolate chips or dried fruit to make energy balls for a quick and easy snack. Remember, portion control is still key when it comes to snacking. It\u2019s also important to choose snacks that will help keep you full and satisfied until your next meal.",
