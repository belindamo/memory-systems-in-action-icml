Regularly inspect your magnolia tree for scale insects or sticky sap on leaves and branches.\n\n2. Prune and dispose of infested branches or twigs to prevent the spread of the infestation.\n\n3. Use a horticultural oil or soap to suffocate the insect and prevent it from reproducing.\n\n4. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs or lacewings to help control the population of scale insects.\n\n5. Provide proper and balanced nutrition to maintain tree health and resistance to pests.\n\n6. Avoid over-fertilizing, which can create favorable conditions for scale insects.\n\n7. Water trees deeply and infrequently to prevent water stress and maintain optimal health.\n\n8. Apply insecticides as a last resort and follow label instructions carefully to avoid adverse effects on beneficial insects and the environment.",
