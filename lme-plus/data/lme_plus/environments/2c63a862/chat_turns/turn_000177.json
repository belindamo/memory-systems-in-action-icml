  "content": "Potato salad is a classic BBQ side dish that's easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. I'd be happy to help you with a simple recipe that's similar to your aunt's famous one.\n\nHere's a classic potato salad recipe that's a great starting point:\n\n**Classic Potato Salad Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 4 large potatoes, peeled and diced\n* 1/2 cup of mayonnaise\n* 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard\n* 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh dill\n* 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh chives\n* 1 tablespoon of white vinegar\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* 2 tablespoons of chopped red onion (optional)\n* 2 hard-boiled eggs, diced (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Place the diced potatoes in a large pot and add enough cold water to cover them. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.\n2. Drain the potatoes and let them cool to room temperature.\n3. In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper until smooth.\n4. Add the chopped dill, chives, and vinegar to the bowl and stir to combine.\n5. Once the potatoes have cooled, add them to the bowl and stir until they're well coated with the dressing.\n6. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the salad needs a bit more tanginess, add a splash more vinegar. If it needs more creaminess, add a bit more mayonnaise.\n7. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the salad for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.\n8. Just before serving, garnish with chopped red onion and diced hard-boiled eggs, if using.\n\n**Tips to make it like your aunt's famous potato salad:**\n\n* Use high-quality mayonnaise, like Duke's or Hellmann's, for a richer flavor.\n* Don't over-mix the potatoes with the dressing, or they'll become too mushy. Fold them in gently until they're well coated.\n* Add a splash of pickle juice (about 1-2 tablespoons) to the dressing for an extra burst of flavor.\n* Use fresh herbs, like parsley or dill, for a brighter flavor.\n* If your aunt's potato salad has a slightly yellow color, it might be because she adds a bit of yellow mustard to the dressing. Try adding 1-2 teaspoons of yellow mustard to the bowl and see if that's the secret ingredient!\n\nI hope this recipe helps you create a potato salad that's similar to your aunt's famous one! Enjoy",
