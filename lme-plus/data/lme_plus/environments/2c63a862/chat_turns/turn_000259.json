I'd be happy to help you set up a system to categorize your purchases by store and date.\n\nHere's a simple system you can follow:\n\n**Step 1: Choose a tracking method**\n\nYou can use a spreadsheet, a budgeting app, or even a physical notebook to track your online purchases. Some popular options include:\n\n* Spreadsheets: Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or LibreOffice Calc\n* Budgeting apps: Mint, Personal Capital, YNAB (You Need a Budget), or Spendee\n* Physical notebook: A dedicated notebook or a bullet journal\n\n**Step 2: Set up your categories**\n\nCreate columns or categories to track the following information:\n\n* **Date**: The date you made the purchase\n* **Store**: The online store where you made the purchase (e.g., ASOS, Amazon, etc.)\n* **Category**: The type of item you purchased (e.g., clothing, electronics, books, etc.)\n* **Amount**: The total amount spent on the purchase\n* **Notes**: Any additional notes or comments about the purchase (optional)\n\n**Step 3: Track your purchases**\n\nStart tracking your online purchases by filling in the relevant information for each transaction. Be consistent in how you categorize your purchases, and try to update your tracker regularly.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze and review**\n\nRegularly review your tracker to identify patterns and trends in your spending. You can use this information to:\n\n* Identify areas where you can cut back\n* Set budgets for specific categories or stores\n* Plan your purchases in advance\n* Avoid impulse buys\n\nBased on your observation about making a lot of purchases on weekends, you might want to consider setting a rule for yourself to avoid online shopping on weekends or setting a budget for weekend purchases.\n\nAs for your ASOS purchases in March, you can use this information to set a budget for clothing purchases or identify alternative stores to shop from.\n\nRemember, the key to making this system work is to be consistent and honest with your tracking. Good luck, and happy tracking!",
