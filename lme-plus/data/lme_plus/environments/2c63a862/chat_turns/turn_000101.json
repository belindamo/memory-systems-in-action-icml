Here's the revised version:\n\n**4 months ago:**\n\n* Gallbladder removal surgery\n\n**2 months ago:**\n\n* Mom's hip replacement surgery\n\t+ Started assisting with her recovery\n\n**6 weeks ago (Tuesday and Wednesday):**\n\n* Developed a cold\n\t+ Symptoms: Fever (102\u00b0F), [add any other symptoms you experienced, e.g., cough, sore throat, body aches, etc.]\n\n**Weeks 3-4:**\n\n* Experienced symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (approximate dates: _____________)\n\t+ Symptoms: _____________________________________ (e.g., numbness, tingling, pain in hands/wrists, etc.)\n\n**Week 4:**\n\n* Follow-up appointment with surgeon for gallbladder removal surgery (approximate date: _____________)\n\t+ Discussion/results: _____________________________________ (e.g., healing progress, any complications, etc.)\n\n**Ongoing:**\n\n* Continued to assist with mom's hip replacement recovery\n\nNow that we have the timeline updated, I'd like to ask a few more questions to finalize the details:\n\n1. Can you estimate the dates when you started experiencing carpal tunnel symptoms? Was it a sudden onset, or did the symptoms develop over time?\n2. Do you remember the exact date of your follow-up appointment with your surgeon for the gallbladder removal surgery? If not, is it possible to narrow it down to a specific week or range of dates?\n\nOnce we have this information, we can finalize the timeline and make it a useful reference for you!",
