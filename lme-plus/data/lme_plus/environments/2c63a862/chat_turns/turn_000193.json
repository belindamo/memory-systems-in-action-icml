  "content": "Tove Lo's music might not be the best fit for your playlist. While she's an amazing artist, her sound is more focused on pop and electronic dance music, which might not blend as seamlessly with the indie-rock and alternative vibes you're aiming for.\n\nTove Lo's music often explores themes of love, relationships, and empowerment, which could still resonate with fans of Billie Eilish and The 1975. However, her sound is often more polished and radio-friendly, which might not fit as well with the more introspective and indie-oriented tracks you're considering.\n\nIf you're looking for more indie-rock tracks to add to your playlist, you might consider artists like:\n\n* **Arctic Monkeys**: Their music often has a witty, observational style that might appeal to fans of The 1975.\n* **The Neighbourhood**: This band's dark, atmospheric sound could complement Billie Eilish's edgier tracks.\n* **Haim**: This indie-rock trio has a laid-back, California-inspired sound that could add some warmth and depth to your playlist.\n* **Florence + The Machine**: Florence Welch's powerful vocals and sweeping soundscapes could bring a sense of drama and intensity to your playlist.\n\nThese artists might help you create a more cohesive indie-rock oriented playlist that still explores a range of moods and emotions. Of course, ultimately, it's up to your personal taste and the vibe you're aiming for!\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any other indie-rock artists or bands you're considering adding to your playlist?",
