  "content": "Excellent choices! Adding \"Groceries\" and \"Skincare\" to your categories will help you track your spending in those areas and identify opportunities to optimize your budget.\n\nRemember, the more specific your categories are, the more insights you'll gain into your spending habits. But don't overdo it \u2013 you want to strike a balance between having enough detail and not overwhelming yourself with too many categories.\n\nUsing the SUMIFS formula will make it easy to calculate the total amount spent in each category. You can also use this formula to create a \"Category Summary\" table or chart to visualize your spending by category. This will give you a quick glance at where your money is going and help you identify areas for improvement.\n\nSome other ideas to consider:\n\n* Create a \"Budget\" column to set target amounts for each category. This will help you track your spending against your goals and make adjustments as needed.\n* Use conditional formatting to highlight categories where you're overspending or underspending.\n* Consider creating a \"Tags\" column to add additional context to your purchases. For example, you could add tags like \"Essential\", \"Wants\", or \"Gift\" to help you understand the motivation behind your purchases.\n\nRemember, the key is to make your tracking system work for you and your financial goals. Experiment with different categories, formulas, and visualizations until you find a system that helps you feel more in control of your finances.",
