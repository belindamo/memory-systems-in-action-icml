It's also adjustable and has a quick-release buckle for easy on and off. Puppia is a well-known brand for comfortable dog collars.\n3. **Cozy Collar Fleece Lined Dog Collar**: This collar features a super-soft fleece lining and a sturdy nylon outer layer.

(Typically, 1-1.5 inches wide is a good range for medium-sized dogs.)\n* Additional features: Do you want a collar with reflective strips, a name tag, or a specific type of buckle?\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more recommendations!",
