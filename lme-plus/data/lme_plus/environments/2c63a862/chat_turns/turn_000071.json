  "content": "Trust is a crucial element in decentralized and distributed systems, as traditional frameworks, such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), are insufficient for building a robust trust foundation in these contexts. As the world shifts from conventional signed and handwritten documents to their digital counterparts, the demand for secure, long-term storage solutions for these documents becomes increasingly critical.\n\nThe European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) is a decentralized platform that fosters secure cross-border digital public services. A vital aspect of EBSI is the utilization of verifiable credentials, as outlined by the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model standard (<https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/>). These verifiable credentials are essential in establishing trust and safeguarding users' privacy within the EBSI ecosystem.\n\nThis paper introduces a decentralized application that addresses the challenge of long-term storage for EBSI-issued verifiable credentials. The proposed solution adheres to the TR-ESOR recommendations (<https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/TR03125/BSI_TR_03125_V1_2_1.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2>), a middleware put forth by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) for the secure archiving of digital documents.\n\nThe integration of the TR-ESOR middleware with various storage systems, including cloud, local, and decentralized databases, allows the decentralized application to offer a versatile and adaptable long-term storage solution for EBSI-issued verifiable credentials. This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the EBSI framework, the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model, and the TR-ESOR recommendations, while also addressing the challenges associated with preserving verifiable credentials.\n\nIn alignment with ACM and IEEE guidelines for influential computer science research papers, this paper employs state-of-the-art scientific research methodologies to advance digital credential management and strengthen trust in decentralized systems.",
