Here's an example of how you can set up a budget for each category and track your progress:\n\n**Budget Setup:**\n\nCreate a new table or sheet in your spreadsheet to set up your budget for each category. Here's an example:\n\n| Category | Budget Amount | Actual Spend | Variance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clothing | $100 | $0 | $0 |\n| Electronics | $200 | $0 | $0 |\n| Groceries | $500 | $0 | $0 |\n| Skincare | $50 | $0 | $0 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Budget Amount**: Enter the target budget amount for each category. This is the amount you want to spend in each category for the month.\n2. **Actual Spend**: As you make purchases, update the Actual Spend column with the total amount spent in each category.\n3. **Variance**: Calculate the variance between the Budget Amount and Actual Spend using the formula: `=Actual Spend - Budget Amount`. This will show you how much you're under or over budget for each category.\n\n**Tracking Progress:**\n\nThroughout the month, update the Actual Spend column as you make purchases. This will help you track your progress and stay within your budget.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you've spent $30 on clothing, $150 on electronics, and $300 on groceries so far this month. Your budget table would look like this:\n\n| Category | Budget Amount | Actual Spend | Variance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clothing | $100 | $30 | -$70 |\n| Electronics | $200 | $150 | -$50 |\n| Groceries | $500 | $300 | $200 |\n| Skincare | $50 | $0 | $50 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nIn this example, you're under budget for Clothing and Electronics, but over budget for Groceries. You can adjust your spending habits accordingly to stay within your budget.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Review your budget regularly to ensure you're on track to meet your financial goals.\n* Adjust your budget amounts as needed based on changes in your income or expenses.\n* Consider setting up alerts or reminders to notify you when you're approaching your budget limits.\n* Use this budget tracking system to identify areas where you can cut back and optimize your spending.\n\nBy setting up a budget for each category and tracking your progress, you'll be able to make more informed financial decisions and stay on top of your expenses.",
