  "content": "Ants can be attracted to the honeydew excreted by the Magnolia scale insects, but they do not help in controlling the infestation. In fact, ants can actually protect the scale insects by defending them against their natural predators, such as ladybugs or lacewings. Ants may also transport the scale insects to other parts of the tree or to neighboring trees, spreading the infestation. Therefore, if you notice ants on your Magnolia tree, it is important to take measures to control them, such as using sticky barriers or baits designed to trap or kill them, in order to prevent them from spreading the infestation further.",
