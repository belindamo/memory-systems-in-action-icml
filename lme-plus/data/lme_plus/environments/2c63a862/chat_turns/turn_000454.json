Here's why:\n\n* It's a great conversation starter and can help break the ice.\n* It shows you're thinking about your friends and willing to share personal updates.\n* It can help you reconnect on a personal level before diving into professional topics.\n\nHowever, keep in mind:\n\n* You don't want to overwhelm them with too much information or make them feel like they need to respond with a lengthy message.\n* You want to leave room for them to share their own updates and reconnect with you.\n\n**Tips for your initial message:**\n\n* Keep it brief and friendly.\n* Mention your niece's graduation ceremony as a way to break the ice and share a personal update.\n* Express your excitement to reconnect and catch up.\n* End with an open-ended question or a call to action, like \"How have you been?\" or \"Let's catch up soon!\"\n\nHere's an example message:\n\n\"Hey [Friend's Name], hope you're doing well! I was just thinking about old times and wanted to reach out. I recently attended my niece's graduation ceremony and it got me thinking about our college days. How have you been? What's new and exciting in your life? Let's catch up soon!\"\n\nRemember to keep it light, friendly, and concise. You can always follow up with more detailed messages or conversations later. Good luck, and I hope you're able to reconnect with your friends!",
