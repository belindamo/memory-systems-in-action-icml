  "content": "Yes, Magnolia scale infestation can spread to other trees in your yard or nearby areas. The scale insects can excrete honeydew, which can attract ants that help to spread the infestation to other trees. Additionally, the crawlers of the scale insects can be carried by wind or other insects, such as bees or butterflies, to other trees in your vicinity. It is important to examine all the trees in your yard, especially if you have a magnolia tree that is already infested, and take measures to prevent the spread of the infestation to other trees.",
