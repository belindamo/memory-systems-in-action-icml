  "content": "A set of silicone baking mats in different sizes is a fantastic gift for your sister.\n\nA pastry brush is an excellent addition to consider! A good pastry brush is an essential tool for any baker, and it's often overlooked. A pastry brush is perfect for:\n\n1. **Egg washes**: A pastry brush helps to evenly apply egg washes to pastries, breads, and danishes, giving them a beautiful golden glaze.\n2. **Spreading butter**: A pastry brush is ideal for spreading butter evenly on dough, ensuring a flaky and tender crust.\n3. **Melting chocolate**: A pastry brush can be used to spread melted chocolate evenly, creating a smooth and professional-looking finish.\n4. **Applying toppings**: A pastry brush can be used to apply toppings like nuts, seeds, or spices to baked goods.\n\nWhen choosing a pastry brush, consider the following:\n\n1. **Natural bristles**: Natural bristles (like boar or horsehair) are ideal for pastry brushes, as they hold their shape well and won't melt with heat.\n2. **Size**: A medium-sized pastry brush (around 1-2 inches wide) is a good all-purpose size for most baking tasks.\n3. **Handle material**: Look for a handle made from a comfortable, non-slip material like silicone or wood.\n\nAdding a pastry brush to the gift set will make it an even more thoughtful and practical present for your sister. It's a tool she'll use frequently and appreciate for years to come.\n\nWith the cookbook, silicone baking mats, and pastry brush, you've got a wonderful gift set that will enhance your sister's baking experience and inspire her to try new recipes!",
