In recent years, there has been increasing public scrutiny over the cost and environmental impact of hosting the Olympics, leading some cities to withdraw their bids or to vote against hosting the games.\n\nSome examples of cities that have declined to host the Olympic Games in recent years include:\n\n1. Boston, United States - In 2015, Boston withdrew its bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics after residents expressed concern over the potential cost and disruption of the event.\n\n2. Hamburg, Germany - Hamburg voted against hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics in a public referendum in 2015, citing concerns over the cost and the potential displacement of local residents.\n\n3. Budapest, Hungary - In 2017, Budapest withdrew its bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics after a public petition called for a referendum on the issue. The bid was mired in controversy over the high cost of the event and concerns over corruption.\n\nOverall, while hosting the Olympic Games can bring many benefits, it is important for cities to carefully consider the costs and potential negative impacts of hosting such a large and complex event.",
