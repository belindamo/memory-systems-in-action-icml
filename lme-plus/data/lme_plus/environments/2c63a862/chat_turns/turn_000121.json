  "content": "Resetting your router to its factory settings and reconfiguring the network can sometimes resolve connectivity issues, but it's good that you're investigating further.\n\nTo check if your modem is compatible with your upgraded internet plan, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check your modem's documentation**: Look for the user manual, packaging, or manufacturer's website to see if it mentions the maximum supported internet speeds.\n2. **Check your ISP's website**: Visit your ISP's website and search for information on compatible modems for your specific internet plan. They might have a list of recommended or approved modems.\n3. **Check your modem's specs**: Look for the modem's specifications, usually found on the underside or back of the device. Check the model number and search online for its technical specifications. You can also check the modem's chipset and firmware version.\n4. **Check for DOCSIS version**: If you have a cable modem, check if it supports the latest DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) version. DOCSIS 3.1 is the current standard, and it supports speeds up to 1.9 Gbps. If your modem only supports DOCSIS 3.0, it might not be able to handle the upgraded speeds.\n5. **Contact your ISP's customer support**: Reach out to your ISP's customer support and ask if your modem is compatible with your upgraded internet plan. They can check your account and provide guidance on whether you need a modem upgrade.\n\nSome common modem models and their maximum supported speeds are:\n\n* Arris Surfboard SB6141: 300 Mbps\n* Arris Surfboard SB6121: 150 Mbps\n* Netgear CM500: 300 Mbps\n* Netgear CM600: 600 Mbps\n* Motorola MB7420: 686 Mbps\n\nKeep in mind that even if your modem is compatible, other factors like network congestion, router capabilities, and distance from the router can still impact your internet speeds.\n\nTo further troubleshoot, you can try:\n\n* **Speed testing**: Run speed tests using online tools like Speedtest.net or Fast.com to see if your speeds are close to your advertised plan. Run tests during different times of the day to see if there are any patterns.\n* **Router placement**: Experiment with moving your router to a central location in your home to improve signal strength and reduce interference.\n* **Device isolation**: Try connecting a single device directly to the modem using an Ethernet cable to see if the slow speeds persist. This can help isolate if the issue is specific to your router or the device itself.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
