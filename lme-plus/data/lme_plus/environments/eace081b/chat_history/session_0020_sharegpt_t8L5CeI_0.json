      "content": "hello my friend, I am a software engineer working as a consultant for a construction company. I need to write up a proposal for work that has been discussed between me and the IT manager. He can then get approval for this work from upper management. I will be supplying you with a bunch of information about the problem, solution, and time estimations which I will ask to be written into a doc later in this convo. Sound good?"

      "content": "Hello! That sounds like a great plan. I'm here to help you with your proposal. Please provide me with the information you've discussed with the IT manager, and I will do my best to help you organize and present it in a clear and professional manner. Let me know when you're ready to proceed."

      "content": "Ok here are some facts about the client which will be relevant later as we discuss logistics further:\n- The companies name is Clark/ Sullivan Construction (I may refer to them as C/S when talking to you to shorten their name) - They are a general contractor operating with offices in Roseville, CA and Sparks, NV\n- The company is 100-200 employees\n- They are a company who manages multiple projects with different deadlines, budgets, owners, and needs. Any time that can be saved will compound to faster project delivery and better quality assurance. \n- C/S has to manage many sub-contractors that are not full time employees. This leaves many liabilities that must be accounted for through strong processes. Safety, Credential management and Auditing, Quality are all things that fall into full time salaried C/S employees to manage. \n\nThats some basic info about the company, I will keep giving more info about the project soon. But first is there anything else you want to know about C/S?\n-"

      "content": "Thank you for providing that information about Clark/Sullivan Construction. It gives me a better understanding of the company's operations and priorities.\n\nBased on what you've provided, it sounds like the company is focused on delivering projects efficiently and effectively, while also managing a large number of subcontractors. They also place a high priority on safety, credential management, and quality assurance.\n\nAt this point, I don't think I need any additional information about the company. However, if there are any other details you think are relevant to the proposal, please feel free to share them with me. Let me know when you're ready to proceed with discussing the specific project you're proposing."

      "role": "user",
      "content": "C/S hires many subcontractors for their projects. This is a time consuming process that must be audited by workers in the field. Typically this falls into the hands of the project sub contractor. The current workflow is done via PDFs and scanning. The new hires fill information out, someone scans it through a computer and emails the appropriate party who inputs the data into accounting, HR etc.\n\nThe IT manager and I were discussing replacing this workflow utilizing their existing docusign subscription as well as box (cloud file service) as a file backup. I would setup the workflow and add a custom webhook or integration which copies all the files over to box and sends out the appropriate email. The idea is that this will save time because:\n\n- Supers will not have to hand-hold or help subs fill out the new hire packet\n- They can give subs a URL and docusigns intuitive interface can guide them through everything they need\n- There are different protocols for NV, and CA as well as different liability and insurance forms that need to be filled out per state. In addition some change every year. Docusign would allow for a source of truth for admins in C/S to manage the logistics of this workflow and ensure everyone is following protocol company wide.\n- This is more secure, these new hire packets often contain social security cars, licenses and other government forms. Using docusign offloads security to them\n- This is cheaper to develop and maintain as we are not re-inventing the wheel and are actually utilizing a subscription C/S already pays for (some of managements concern is this project will go to long and not solve enough problems. - No matter what this data will still need to be re-keyed into accounting by an office worker. This process would allow that office worker to have consistent documents and structures that should make him or her more efficient and less error prone with less back and forth between the field)"

      "content": "It sounds like you and the IT manager have identified a specific pain point in the company's current workflow for hiring subcontractors, and have proposed a solution that utilizes the company's existing subscription to DocuSign and Box to streamline and automate the process.\n\nThe proposed solution would have several benefits, including:\n\n* Supers would not have to spend time helping subs fill out the new hire packet\n* Subs would be able to fill out the packet quickly and easily using DocuSign's intuitive interface\n* DocuSign would provide a source of truth for admins to manage the logistics of the workflow and ensure that everyone is following protocol company-wide.\n* The proposed solution is more secure, as it would protect sensitive information like social security numbers, licenses, and other government forms.\n* The solution is cheaper to develop and maintain, as it utilizes a subscription the company already pays for.\n\nOne thing you can mention in the proposal is the potential time and cost savings. You can also mention that this solution can also improve the accuracy of data entry as the office worker will have consistent documents and structures to work with and less errors.\n\nIt would be good to mention that this process will not eliminate the need for data entry but will significantly reduce the time and effort needed for data entry and will make it more efficient. Also, it is a good idea to mention that this process will also improve compliance and security by ensuring that all forms are completed correctly and in a timely manner.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else you want me to add in the proposal."

      "content": "The notes provided by the IT manager give some additional details about the new hire packets currently being used by Clark/Sullivan Construction, and the process for updating and maintaining them.\n\nIt appears that there are different new hire packets for California and Nevada, which are stored in a Box folder, and that there are some differences in the required documents for office and field hires. The IT manager also notes that different people are responsible for updating various forms within the packets, such as Sheri Angel, who updates the CA new hire packet and \"babysits\" superintendents who hire field employees to help them with the process, and Kevin Stroupe, who updates the insurance and contribution forms yearly.\n\nThe IT manager also notes that many pages in the packets are currently scanned (raster) versions of digital content, which could be replaced with digital (vector) versions for better quality and ease of use. The manager also mentions that the safety forms are updated by the internal C/S safety team.\n\nYou can mention in the proposal that, by using DocuSign, you will be able to create a centralized location for all the new hire packets and make sure that the packets are up to date and compliant with the state laws. This will also help C/S to ensure that all the subcontractors are following the company's protocols and procedures. DocuSign can also help the company to ensure that all the required forms are completed correctly and in a timely manner.\n\nYou can also mention that by integrating DocuSign with Box, you can make sure that all the new hire packets are stored in one central location and are easily accessible for the field and office workers. This will help to improve the data entry process and will make it more efficient.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else you want me to add in the proposal."
