  "content": "In more advanced systems, noise and texture can also be used to create a sense of realism and immersion. For example, in a virtual reality environment, the designer might use a variety of textures and sensory elements, such as haptic feedback and 3D audio, to create a more realistic and immersive experience for the user. This could include the use of rough, bumpy surfaces to simulate the feel of rock or wood, or the use of ambient sounds and music to create a sense of place and atmosphere. By incorporating these elements into the design, the designer can create a virtual environment that feels more real and engaging to the user, and can help to enhance the emotional impact of the experience.",
