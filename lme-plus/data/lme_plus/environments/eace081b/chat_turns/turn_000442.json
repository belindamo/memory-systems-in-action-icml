  "content": "Chicago is a fantastic city! I'd be happy to help you with some restaurant recommendations near the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower).\n\nSince you stayed at the Marriott downtown, you're probably familiar with the area. The Willis Tower is located in the Loop, so I'll suggest some restaurants within walking distance or a short drive. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **The Berghoff**: A Chicago institution since 1887, this German-American restaurant is just a block away from the Willis Tower. Try their famous root beer and sandwiches.\n2. **Potbelly Sandwich Shop**: A Chicago-born chain with a location right across from the Willis Tower. Their toasty sandwiches and soups are perfect for a quick bite.\n3. **The Gage**: This contemporary American bistro is about a 5-minute walk from the Willis Tower. Enjoy their seasonal menu and great views of Millennium Park.\n4. **Blackbird**: If you're looking for a more upscale experience, Blackbird is a modern American restaurant with a focus on seasonal, Midwestern ingredients. It's about a 10-minute walk from the Willis Tower.\n5. **Giordano's**: You can't go to Chicago without trying deep-dish pizza! Giordano's is a classic spot with a location near the Willis Tower. Be prepared for a wait, but it's worth it.\n6. **The Polo Cafe**: This casual American bistro is located in the Willis Tower itself, making it a convenient option if you're short on time.\n\nIf you're willing to venture a bit further, some other great options in the Loop include:\n\n* **The Dearborn**: A modern American tavern with a focus on local ingredients and craft cocktails.\n* **Ceres' Table**: A farm-to-table restaurant with a focus on seasonal, organic ingredients.\n* ** Lou Mitchell's**: A classic diner with a retro vibe and delicious breakfast options.\n\nHope this helps, and I'm glad you enjoyed your previous stay at the Marriott downtown!",
