And you're absolutely right, looking at yourself as a source of material can be incredibly rich and relatable.\n\nBy observing yourself and your own quirks, you can create humor that's authentic and unique to your perspective. It's also a great way to poke fun at yourself and show the audience that you're willing to laugh at yourself, which can be very endearing.\n\nRemember, the key to observational humor is to be specific and detailed in your observations. Instead of just saying \"people are weird,\" try to pinpoint specific behaviors or habits that you've noticed and exaggerate them for comedic effect.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to push yourself to be more observant and curious. Ask yourself questions like \"What's the deal with [insert weird habit or behavior here]?\" or \"Why do people do [insert strange thing]?\" This can help you develop a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and create more nuanced and interesting humor.\n\nKeep up the good work, and don't be afraid to experiment and try out new material. Remember, the more you write and perform, the more you'll develop your own unique voice and style. Good luck!",
