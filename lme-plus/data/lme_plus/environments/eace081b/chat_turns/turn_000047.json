For the guest list, I think we should start with our closest family members, like our brother and his new wife, and then add some close friends of my parents. We should probably limit the guest list to around 30-40 people to keep it intimate and manageable. As for the budget, I was thinking we could allocate around $2,000 to $3,000 for the whole party. That should cover the venue, food, decorations, and entertainment. Do you think that's a realistic budget for a medium-sized party like this?",
