Now, let's get your grill set up for low and slow cooking!\n\n**Low and Slow Cooking Setup:**\n\n**Gas Grill:**\n\n1. **Indirect Heat:** Place the ribs on the indirect heat side of the grill, away from the burners. This will help maintain a consistent temperature and prevent flare-ups.\n2. **Temperature Control:** Set the grill to 225\u00b0F - 250\u00b0F (110\u00b0C - 120\u00b0C). You may need to adjust the burners to achieve this temperature.\n3. **Wood Chips:** Place the hickory wood chips in a smoker box or directly on the grill grates, away from the ribs. You can also use a foil packet with holes punched in it to contain the wood chips.\n4. **Close the Lid:** Close the grill lid to trap the heat and smoke. This will help cook the ribs low and slow.\n\n**Charcoal Grill:**\n\n1. **Charcoal Configuration:** Set up your charcoal grill with a two-zone fire. Place the charcoal on one side of the grill, leaving the other side empty. This will create a hot zone and a cool zone.\n2. **Ribs Placement:** Place the ribs on the cool zone, away from the direct heat of the charcoal.\n3. **Temperature Control:** Adjust the airflow to maintain a temperature of 225\u00b0F - 250\u00b0F (110\u00b0C - 120\u00b0C). You can do this by adjusting the vents on the grill.\n4. **Wood Chips:** Place the hickory wood chips directly on the charcoal or in a smoker box.\n5. **Close the Lid:** Close the grill lid to trap the heat and smoke.\n\n**Common Tips:**\n\n1. **Monitor Temperature:** Use a thermometer to monitor the grill temperature. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain the desired temperature.\n2. **Add Wood Chips:** Add more wood chips as needed to maintain a consistent smoke flavor.\n3. **Resting Time:** After cooking, let the ribs rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This will help the meat redistribute the juices and make it more tender.\n4. **Keep it Low and Slow:** Resist the temptation to increase the heat or open the lid too often. Low and slow cooking is all about patience and letting the meat cook slowly.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating delicious, fall-off-the-bone tender ribs with a rich, smoky flavor from the hickory wood chips. Happy grilling!",
