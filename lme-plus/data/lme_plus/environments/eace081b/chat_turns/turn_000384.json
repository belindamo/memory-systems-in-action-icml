I'd be happy to guide you through the process.\n\n**Gas Grill Indirect Heat Setup:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Your Burners**\n\n* Take a look at your gas grill and identify the number of burners you have. Most gas grills have 2-5 burners.\n* Note the location of the burners and the grill grates.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Indirect Heat Zone**\n\n* Decide which side of the grill you want to use for indirect heat. Typically, it's best to use the side with the most even heat distribution.\n* This will be the side where you'll place the ribs, away from the direct heat of the burners.\n\n**Step 3: Turn Off the Burners**\n\n* Turn off all the burners, except for one or two burners on the opposite side of the grill from the indirect heat zone.\n* If you have multiple burners, you can turn off the middle burners and leave the outer burners on.\n\n**Step 4: Adjust the Burner Heat**\n\n* Turn the remaining burners to a low heat setting (usually around 2-3 on a 1-10 scale).\n* This will provide a gentle, indirect heat that will cook the ribs slowly.\n\n**Step 5: Add Heat Deflectors (Optional)**\n\n* If your grill has heat deflectors or heat shields, place them over the burners to help distribute the heat evenly.\n* You can also use foil or a grill mat to create a heat deflector if your grill doesn't have one.\n\n**Step 6: Place the Ribs**\n\n* Place the ribs on the indirect heat zone, away from the direct heat of the burners.\n* Close the grill lid to trap the heat and smoke.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a thermometer to monitor the grill temperature and adjust the burner heat as needed.\n* You can adjust the number of burners and heat deflectors based on your grill's design and the size of your ribs.\n* Experiment with different indirect heat setups to find the one that works best for you.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to set up your gas grill for indirect heat and achieve a low and slow cooking environment for your ribs. Happy grilling!",
