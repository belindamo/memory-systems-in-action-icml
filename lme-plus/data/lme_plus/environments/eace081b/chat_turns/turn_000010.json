Speaking of collections, I was thinking about my new Iron Man Funko Pop from the Marvel collection that I got at the comic-con event last weekend, and I realized I need to find a way to display it nicely on my office desk. Do you have any suggestions for display stands or risers that would work well for Funko Pops?",
