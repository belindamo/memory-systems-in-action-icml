  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks. I was worried about how to start planning this party, especially since my sister and I didn't exactly see eye to eye on how big it should be. We had a big argument about it three weeks ago - she wanted to invite all our relatives and friends, but I thought it would be too expensive and stressful, and suggested a small family dinner instead. We eventually compromised on a medium-sized party, but I'm still not sure how to make it work. Can you give me some ideas on how to create a guest list and decide on a budget?",
