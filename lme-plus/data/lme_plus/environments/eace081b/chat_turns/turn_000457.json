  "content": "Alex Stevens is a comedian I've been following on Netflix - he's hilarious! I actually got to see him perform live at the Laugh Out Loud club on Friday, and it was amazing. I've been going to stand-up comedy shows a lot lately, actually - I try to catch at least two shows a week. It's really inspiring to see comedians perform live and get a feel for what works and what doesn't. Anyway, thanks for the tips on structuring a comedy set - I'll definitely check out those resources you mentioned. Do you have any recommendations for comedy writing apps or software that can help me organize my jokes and sets?",
