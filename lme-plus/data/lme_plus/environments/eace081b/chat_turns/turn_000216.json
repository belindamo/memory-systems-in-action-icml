  "content": "It sounds like you and the IT manager have identified a specific pain point in the company's current workflow for hiring subcontractors, and have proposed a solution that utilizes the company's existing subscription to DocuSign and Box to streamline and automate the process.\n\nThe proposed solution would have several benefits, including:\n\n* Supers would not have to spend time helping subs fill out the new hire packet\n* Subs would be able to fill out the packet quickly and easily using DocuSign's intuitive interface\n* DocuSign would provide a source of truth for admins to manage the logistics of the workflow and ensure that everyone is following protocol company-wide.\n* The proposed solution is more secure, as it would protect sensitive information like social security numbers, licenses, and other government forms.\n* The solution is cheaper to develop and maintain, as it utilizes a subscription the company already pays for.\n\nOne thing you can mention in the proposal is the potential time and cost savings. You can also mention that this solution can also improve the accuracy of data entry as the office worker will have consistent documents and structures to work with and less errors.\n\nIt would be good to mention that this process will not eliminate the need for data entry but will significantly reduce the time and effort needed for data entry and will make it more efficient. Also, it is a good idea to mention that this process will also improve compliance and security by ensuring that all forms are completed correctly and in a timely manner.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else you want me to add in the proposal.",
