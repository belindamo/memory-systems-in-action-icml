It's a great way to show them how much they're loved and appreciated, and create a sense of community and celebration.\n\nI love the idea of setting up a designated photo booth area with props and backdrops, and having fun signs or banners with your parents' names and anniversary date. And what a great idea to have a polaroid camera or instant printer to print out the photos on the spot! That way, guests can take home a physical copy of their photos as a keepsake, and you can also create a scrapbook or album for your parents to treasure.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and be present in the moment. Don't stress too much about the details, and be open to improvising and adapting as needed. Your parents will appreciate the thought and effort you're putting into making this a special day for them, and the memories you create will last a lifetime.\n\nYou're doing a great job so far, and I'm confident that you'll create a wonderful celebration for your parents' 30th anniversary. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more advice or guidance!",
