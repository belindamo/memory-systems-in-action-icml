  "content": "That sounds like a great plan! Hosting the party at our family home will definitely make it more personal and intimate. I was thinking of setting up a few tables and chairs in the backyard, and we can also use the patio area for the buffet and bar. We can decorate the house and backyard with balloons, flowers, and candles to create a warm and cozy atmosphere. I'll make sure to enlist some help from family members and friends to assist with setup and cleanup. What do you think about having a slideshow or a photo booth to commemorate the occasion?",
