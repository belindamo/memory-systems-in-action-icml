Here are some ideas to help you with that:\n\n**Creating a Guest List:**\n\n1. **Start with the must-haves:** Begin with your parents' closest family members, such as siblings, children, and grandchildren.\n2. **Add close friends:** Include friends who are close to your parents, such as long-time neighbors, colleagues, or social friends.\n3. **Consider relatives:** Decide which relatives to invite, such as aunts, uncles, cousins, or nieces and nephews.\n4. **Limit the guest list:** Set a realistic number of guests based on your budget, venue, and preferences. Aim for a mix of family and friends to keep the party engaging.\n5. **Be mindful of plus-ones:** Establish a policy on plus-ones, such as spouses, partners, or children, to avoid unexpected guests.\n6. **Create a B-list:** If you're worried about exceeding your guest limit, create a B-list of guests to invite if some of the A-list guests decline.\n\n**Tips for Compromising with Your Sister:**\n\n1. **Discuss and prioritize:** Talk to your sister about your priorities and concerns. Identify which guests are must-haves for each of you.\n2. **Set a guest list cap:** Agree on a maximum number of guests to ensure you're both comfortable with the size of the party.\n3. **Alternate invites:** If you can't agree on every guest, consider alternating invites. For example, you invite your friends, and your sister invites her friends.\n\n**Setting a Budget:**\n\n1. **Determine the overall budget:** Decide how much you're willing to spend on the party, considering venue, food, decorations, entertainment, and other expenses.\n2. **Allocate funds:** Break down the budget into categories (e.g., venue, food, decorations) to ensure you're staying within your means.\n3. **Prioritize:** Identify areas where you can cut costs without compromising the party's quality. For example, opt for a morning or brunch party instead of an evening event to save on food and beverage costs.\n4. **Consider DIY elements:** Take on DIY projects, such as decorations or desserts, to reduce expenses.\n5. **Get quotes and compare:** Research vendors and compare prices to find the best deals for your budget.\n\n**Budgeting Tips for a Medium-Sized Party:**\n\n1. **Venue:** Consider a private room at a restaurant, community center, or event space to save on decoration and equipment costs.\n2. **Food and Beverages:** Opt for a buffet or appetizers instead of a full-course meal. You can also have a potluck where guests bring a dish to share.\n3. **Decorations:** Focus on simple, yet elegant decorations that won't break the bank. Use candles, flowers, and balloons to create a warm atmosphere.\n4. **Entertainment:** Create a playlist or hire a local musician instead of a full band.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a guest list and set a budget that works for both you and your sister. Remember to communicate regularly and be flexible to ensure a successful and enjoyable party for your parents' special day!",
