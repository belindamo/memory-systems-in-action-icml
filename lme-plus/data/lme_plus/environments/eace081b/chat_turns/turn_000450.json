However, I need to clarify a few things to ensure you have a smooth experience:\n\n**Skydeck Chicago daytime visit:**\n\n* You can definitely visit the Skydeck Chicago during the day using your Chicago CityPASS. The Skydeck is open from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM, with last entry at 9:00 PM.\n* Take in the stunning views of the city from the 103rd floor, and don't forget to step out onto the Ledge, a thrilling glass balcony that extends 4.3 feet outside the building!\n\n**Returning to the Willis Tower at night:**\n\n* While you can't reuse your Chicago CityPASS for a second visit to the Skydeck Chicago, you can purchase a separate ticket for a nighttime visit.\n* The Skydeck Chicago offers a \"Sun & Stars\" ticket option, which allows you to visit during the day and return for a nighttime visit on the same day. This ticket is available on their website or at the Skydeck box office.\n* If you don't want to purchase the \"Sun & Stars\" ticket, you can buy a separate nighttime ticket for the Skydeck Chicago. Keep in mind that this will be a new, separate admission.\n\n**Tips for your nighttime visit:**\n\n* Be prepared for potential long lines, especially on weekends or during peak season.\n* Dress warmly, as it can get chilly at night, even in the summer.\n* The Skydeck Chicago often has special events or light displays at night, so check their website for any specific attractions or closures.\n\nBy visiting the Skydeck Chicago during the day and returning at night, you'll get to experience the city from a unique perspective. Enjoy your time in Chicago, and I hope you take some amazing photos of the city lights!",
