  "content": "Yes, gluten-free flour can be used as a substitute for wheat flour when making noodles. However, it may require some adjustments to the recipe, such as adding xanthan gum or other binding agents to help the dough hold its shape. Gluten-free flours also tend to absorb more liquid than wheat flour, so additional water may be needed. It may also affect the texture and flavor of the noodles slightly. It is best to follow a gluten-free noodle recipe specifically formulated for gluten-free flour for the best results.",
