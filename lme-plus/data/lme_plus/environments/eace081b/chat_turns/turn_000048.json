Here are some thoughts to consider:\n\n**Guest List:**\n\n* 30-40 guests is a great size for an intimate and manageable party. You'll be able to have meaningful interactions with each guest, and it's small enough to maintain a cozy atmosphere.\n* Make sure to include your parents' closest friends and family members, as you mentioned. You may also consider inviting a few neighbors or acquaintances who have played a significant role in their lives.\n* Don't forget to finalize the guest list with your sister and parents to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\n**Budget:**\n\n* $2,000 to $3,000 is a reasonable budget for a medium-sized party, but it will depend on your specific choices for venue, food, decorations, and entertainment.\n* Here's a rough breakdown of how you could allocate the budget:\n\t+ Venue: $500-$1,000 (depending on the location, size, and amenities)\n\t+ Food and Beverages: $800-$1,200 (for 30-40 guests, you might consider a catering service or a private room at a restaurant)\n\t+ Decorations: $200-$500 (keep it simple with balloons, flowers, and candles, or get creative with DIY projects)\n\t+ Entertainment: $200-$500 (a local musician, a playlist, or a photo booth could be great options)\n\t+ Miscellaneous: $200-$500 (gifts, party favors, and other incidentals)\n* Be prepared to make some compromises or adjustments as you finalize the details. You might need to prioritize certain aspects of the party over others to stay within your budget.\n\nTo make the most of your budget, consider the following tips:\n\n* Choose a venue that offers an all-inclusive package (e.g., food, drinks, and decorations) to simplify planning and reduce costs.\n* Opt for a brunch or morning party instead of an evening event to save on food and beverage costs.\n* Keep decorations simple and DIY-friendly to save on costs.\n* Consider hiring a student musician or a local artist for entertainment instead of a full band.\n\nOverall, your plan seems like a great starting point. By being mindful of your budget and guest list, you'll be able to create a memorable and enjoyable celebration for your parents' 30th wedding anniversary!",
