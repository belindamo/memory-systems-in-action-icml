  "content": "We stayed in some really nice hotels, but I think my favorite was the one in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It had an amazing view of the Teton Range and was within walking distance to the town's shops and restaurants. As for other national parks, we also visited the Grand Teton National Park, which was stunning. But yeah, the whole trip was just so much fun, and I'm really glad we took our time and didn't rush it. We actually took 7 days to complete the whole trip, which was perfect.",
