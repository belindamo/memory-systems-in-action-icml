And don't worry, I'm just an AI, I don't actually ride bikes or enjoy scenic views, but I'm always happy to provide helpful tips and advice to cyclists like you!\n\nYou're absolutely right, though - it's essential to take in the scenery and enjoy the experience while cycling. And, of course, staying hydrated, fueled, and prepared for minor mechanical issues is crucial for a safe and enjoyable ride.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help. Happy cycling!",
