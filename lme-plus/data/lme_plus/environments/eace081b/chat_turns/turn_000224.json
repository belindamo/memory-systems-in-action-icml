Stephen Sondheim is a legend in the world of musical theater, and studying his work is a great way to deepen your understanding of the art form.\n\nAs for connections between The Lehman Trilogy and Sondheim's work, there aren't any direct links, but I can suggest some interesting parallels:\n\n1. **Epic storytelling**: Like The Lehman Trilogy, many of Sondheim's musicals feature complex, layered storytelling, such as Sweeney Todd, Follies, or Pacific Overtures. If you appreciate the sweeping narrative of The Lehman Trilogy, you might enjoy Sondheim's more epic works.\n2. **Exploration of human nature**: Sondheim's musicals often probe the human condition, examining the complexities and flaws of his characters. The Lehman Trilogy also delves into the intricacies of human relationships, power dynamics, and the consequences of choices.\n3. **Innovative storytelling techniques**: Both The Lehman Trilogy and Sondheim's musicals often employ unconventional narrative structures, non-linear storytelling, and innovative uses of music and staging to convey their themes.\n\nBased on your interest in Sondheim and The Lehman Trilogy, here are some other musicals and plays you might enjoy:\n\n1. **Angels in America** (play): This two-part play by Tony Kushner explores the AIDS epidemic, identity, and American history, featuring a large cast of characters and a sweeping narrative.\n2. **The Ferryman** (play): I mentioned this earlier, but it's worth repeating. This play by Jez Butterworth shares some similarities with The Lehman Trilogy in its exploration of family dynamics, power, and the cyclical nature of history.\n3. **Passion** (musical): Another Sondheim classic, Passion is a dark, psychological exploration of obsession, love, and the human condition, featuring a complex, non-linear narrative.\n4. **The Inheritance** (play): This two-part play by Matthew Lopez is a modern retelling of E.M. Forster's Howards End, exploring themes of identity, family, and community in contemporary New York City.\n5. **Company** (musical): While not as epic in scope as The Lehman Trilogy, Company is a Sondheim classic that examines the complexities of relationships, identity, and the human condition, featuring a innovative, non-linear structure.\n\nThese recommendations should provide a great starting point for further exploration. Enjoy your continued journey into the world of musical theater and playwriting!",
