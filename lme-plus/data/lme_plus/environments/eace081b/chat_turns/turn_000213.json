  "content": "Ok here are some facts about the client which will be relevant later as we discuss logistics further:\n- The companies name is Clark/ Sullivan Construction (I may refer to them as C/S when talking to you to shorten their name) - They are a general contractor operating with offices in Roseville, CA and Sparks, NV\n- The company is 100-200 employees\n- They are a company who manages multiple projects with different deadlines, budgets, owners, and needs. Any time that can be saved will compound to faster project delivery and better quality assurance. \n- C/S has to manage many sub-contractors that are not full time employees. This leaves many liabilities that must be accounted for through strong processes. Safety, Credential management and Auditing, Quality are all things that fall into full time salaried C/S employees to manage. \n\nThats some basic info about the company, I will keep giving more info about the project soon. But first is there anything else you want to know about C/S?\n-",
