  "content": "The notes provided by the IT manager give some additional details about the new hire packets currently being used by Clark/Sullivan Construction, and the process for updating and maintaining them.\n\nIt appears that there are different new hire packets for California and Nevada, which are stored in a Box folder, and that there are some differences in the required documents for office and field hires. The IT manager also notes that different people are responsible for updating various forms within the packets, such as Sheri Angel, who updates the CA new hire packet and \"babysits\" superintendents who hire field employees to help them with the process, and Kevin Stroupe, who updates the insurance and contribution forms yearly.\n\nThe IT manager also notes that many pages in the packets are currently scanned (raster) versions of digital content, which could be replaced with digital (vector) versions for better quality and ease of use. The manager also mentions that the safety forms are updated by the internal C/S safety team.\n\nYou can mention in the proposal that, by using DocuSign, you will be able to create a centralized location for all the new hire packets and make sure that the packets are up to date and compliant with the state laws. This will also help C/S to ensure that all the subcontractors are following the company's protocols and procedures. DocuSign can also help the company to ensure that all the required forms are completed correctly and in a timely manner.\n\nYou can also mention that by integrating DocuSign with Box, you can make sure that all the new hire packets are stored in one central location and are easily accessible for the field and office workers. This will help to improve the data entry process and will make it more efficient.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else you want me to add in the proposal.",
