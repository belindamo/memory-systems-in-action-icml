These protests started in early 2021 and have resulted in clashes with police and arrests of protesters.\n\nIn addition, some opposition parties have criticized the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and its response to recent security incidents, such as terrorist attacks in the capital city of Tunis. \n\nThere have also been reports of tensions between the various political parties in the governing coalition, with some accusing others of being too dominant and ignoring minority voices.",
