Considering her stage 4 cancer diagnosis, it's essential to be mindful of her energy levels and comfort during video calls. Here are some tips to make the most of your video calls:\n\n1. **Keep it short and sweet**: Initially, keep the video calls short, around 15-20 minutes, to avoid exhausting your aunt. As she becomes more comfortable, you can gradually increase the duration.\n2. **Schedule around her energy levels**: Coordinate video calls when your aunt is likely to have the most energy, such as after a rest or during a period of relatively good health.\n3. **Prioritize comfort**: Encourage your aunt to prioritize her comfort during video calls. Suggest she wear comfortable clothing, use pillows or blankets for support, and have any necessary medications or water nearby.\n4. **Minimize distractions**: Ask your aunt to find a quiet, comfortable space for video calls, free from distractions like TVs, radios, or background noise.\n5. **Focus on conversation, not appearance**: Remind your aunt that it's okay to not worry about her appearance during video calls. Focus on the conversation and connection, rather than how she looks.\n6. **Use a comfortable camera angle**: Suggest your aunt experiment with different camera angles to find one that's comfortable for her. This might mean propping up her tablet or using a stand to reduce strain on her neck or shoulders.\n7. **Take breaks**: If your aunt needs to take a break during the call, don't hesitate to do so. Encourage her to take a few deep breaths, stretch, or step away for a moment to recharge.\n8. **Encourage self-care**: Use video calls as an opportunity to check in on your aunt's well-being and encourage her to prioritize self-care. Ask about her symptoms, offer support, and remind her to take care of herself.\n9. **Create a comforting atmosphere**: Suggest your aunt create a comforting atmosphere during video calls, such as lighting candles, playing soothing music, or having a favorite blanket nearby.\n10. **Celebrate small moments**: Celebrate small moments of joy, laughter, or connection during video calls. These can help brighten your aunt's day and create positive memories.\n\nBy being mindful of your aunt's needs and limitations, you can create a comfortable and enjoyable video calling experience that brings you closer together.\n\nDo you have any other questions about making the most of your video calls with your aunt?",
