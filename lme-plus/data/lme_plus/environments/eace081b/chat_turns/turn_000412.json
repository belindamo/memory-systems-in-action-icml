Here are some suggestions to help you prioritize your time and make the most of your visits with your aunt:\n\n1. **Re-evaluate your commitments**: Take a closer look at your schedule and commitments. Are there any non-essential tasks or activities that you can delegate, postpone, or eliminate? Be honest with yourself \u2013 what can you realistically manage?\n2. **Create a priority list**: Make a list of your top priorities, with your aunt's well-being and time with her at the top. This will help you visualize your priorities and make decisions based on what's truly important to you.\n3. **Schedule dedicated time with your aunt**: Treat visits with your aunt as non-negotiable appointments. Set a specific day and time each week or month that works for both of you, and commit to it.\n4. **Batch similar tasks together**: Group similar tasks or errands together to free up larger blocks of time. For example, if you need to run errands, do them all in one day instead of spreading them out over several days.\n5. **Learn to say \"no\"**: Be mindful of taking on new commitments that might interfere with your time with your aunt. It's okay to say \"no\" to social invitations, volunteer opportunities, or other activities that might not align with your priorities.\n6. **Make the most of your visits**: When you do visit your aunt, make the most of your time together. Put away your phone, turn off the TV, and focus on quality time with her. Engage in activities she enjoys, have conversations, and create meaningful memories.\n7. **Consider delegating tasks or asking for help**: If you have other family members or friends who can help with errands, household chores, or other tasks, don't hesitate to ask. This can free up time for you to spend with your aunt.\n8. **Take advantage of technology**: Use video calls, messaging apps, or social media to stay in touch with your aunt when you can't visit in person. This can help you stay connected and show her you're thinking of her, even when you can't be there physically.\n9. **Prioritize your own self-care**: Don't forget to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Make time for activities that bring you joy, help you relax, and recharge your energy. This will enable you to be more present and supportive when you are with your aunt.\n10. **Forgive yourself**: Remember that you're doing the best you can with the resources you have. Don't beat yourself up over missed visits or perceived shortcomings. Instead, focus on the positive time you do spend with your aunt and the memories you're creating.\n\nRemember, every moment you spend with your aunt is precious, and she likely values the time you do have together. By prioritizing your time and focusing on what's truly important, you can make the most of your visits and create lasting memories.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these strategies? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or is there something else you'd like to talk about?",
