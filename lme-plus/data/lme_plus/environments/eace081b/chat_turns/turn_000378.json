Choose the right ribs:** Opt for pork ribs, specifically St. Louis-style pork spare ribs or baby back ribs. These have more marbling, which makes them tender and juicy.\n\n**2. Prep the ribs:**\n\n* Remove the membrane (pleura) from the back of the ribs to help the rub penetrate and promote tenderization.\n* Trim excess fat and any cartilage from the ribs.\n* Cut the ribs into a St. Louis-style cut, if needed.\n\n**3. Dry brine (optional but recommended):**\n\n* Mix 1/4 cup kosher salt, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon black pepper.\n* Rub the mixture all over the ribs, making sure to coat them evenly.\n* Let the ribs sit in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours or overnight to allow the dry brine to work its magic.\n\n**4. Create a flavorful rub:**\n\n* Mix a dry rub with a balance of sweet, smoky, and savory flavors. You can use a store-bought rub or create your own.\n* Apply the rub evenly to both sides of the ribs, making sure to coat them thoroughly.\n\n**5. Low and slow cooking:**\n\n* Set up your grill or smoker for low and slow cooking (225\u00b0F - 250\u00b0F).\n* Place the ribs in the grill or smoker, bone side down.\n* Cook the ribs for 4-5 hours, or until they reach an internal temperature of 160\u00b0F - 170\u00b0F.\n\n**6. Wrap and rest:**\n\n* After 4 hours, wrap the ribs in foil and return them to the grill or smoker for another 1-2 hours.\n* This step is called the \"Texas Crutch\" and helps to tenderize the ribs further.\n* Remove the ribs from the foil and let them rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.\n\n**7. Glaze and finish:**\n\n* During the last 10-15 minutes of cooking, brush the ribs with your favorite BBQ sauce.\n* If desired, add a sweet and sticky glaze, like a mixture of honey, brown sugar, and BBQ sauce.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a water pan in your grill or smoker to add moisture and help keep the ribs tender.\n* Add wood chips or chunks to your grill or smoker for added smokiness.\n* Experiment with different types of wood, like hickory, apple, or cherry, to impart unique flavors.\n* Try a Korean-style BBQ sauce with a sweet and spicy flavor profile.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you'll be well on your way to creating fall-off-the-bone tender BBQ ribs that will impress your family and friends. Happy grilling!",
