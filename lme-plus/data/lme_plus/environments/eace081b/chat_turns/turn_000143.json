  "content": "Answer: d. Increasing restrictions on tobacco sales so that cigarettes are modestly harder to obtain.\n\nExplanation: This option is the most likely to have the greatest effect on the health of a population because it addresses a major contributor to chronic disease and mortality, which is tobacco use. By making cigarettes harder to obtain, there is a potential to reduce the number of people who take up smoking and the number of smokers who continue to smoke. This can lead to a reduction in tobacco-related health issues such as lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.\n\nOption a is not correct because it only addresses a specific group of patients with high blood pressure, and not the entire population. Option b is not incorrect, but its effect on health is likely to be smaller compared to the other options. Option c is not incorrect, but it only addresses a specific genetic condition and does not have a widespread impact on the population.\n\nLevel of Bloom's Taxonomy: Evaluation",
