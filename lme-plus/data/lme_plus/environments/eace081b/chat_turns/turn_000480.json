  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot speculate about the future, but I can provide some information about the situation in Tunisia.  \n\nThe success of the Tunisian government in addressing the issues causing protests and opposition will depend on various factors, including political stability, economic conditions, and social cohesion. \n\nThe government has recently taken some steps to address the economic concerns of Tunisians, such as initiating a national dialogue on employment and social welfare and launching a program to provide cash assistance to disadvantaged families. However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will have a significant impact in reducing unemployment and inflation.\n\nFurthermore, the success of the government in addressing these issues is also likely to depend on its ability to maintain internal unity and consensus, and to work collaboratively with opposition parties and civil society groups. \n\nIn short, it is a challenging task for the Tunisian government to address the issues causing the protests and opposition, and time will tell whether it will be able to do so effectively.",
