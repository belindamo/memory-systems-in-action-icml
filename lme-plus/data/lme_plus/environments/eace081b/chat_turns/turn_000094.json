Bills of Exchange: Bills of Exchange were financial instruments that allowed merchants to transfer funds without the need for physical currency. These documents were essentially promises to pay a certain amount of money at a later date, and they allowed merchants to settle debts and make payments across long distances.\n2. Banking Houses: Banking houses were institutions that specialized in managing money and facilitating financial transactions. They provided services such as currency exchange, loan financing, and storage of valuable items. These institutions allowed merchants to conduct business more efficiently and securely, which helped to foster trade and economic growth.\n3. Use of paper money: The use of paper money also became more widespread during this period. China, in particular, had a well-developed system of paper money, which was used as a medium of exchange in many parts of the country. This allowed merchants to conduct transactions without the need for physical currency, which made trade more efficient and convenient.\n\nOverall, these commercial technologies helped to facilitate trade and economic development along the Silk Road.
