Congratulations on taking the initiative to upgrade your camping gear, and I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations.\n\nSince you've just returned from a solo trip to Yosemite, you likely have a good idea of what worked and what didn't for you. What specific areas of your gear are you looking to upgrade? Are you looking for:\n\n1. A new tent that's more spacious or waterproof?\n2. A better sleeping bag or pad for a more comfortable night's sleep?\n3. A more efficient camping stove or cooking gear?\n4. Improved lighting or headlamp options?\n5. A more comfortable backpack or storage solutions?\n6. Water treatment or filtration systems?\n7. Something else entirely?\n\nSharing your priorities will help me provide more targeted recommendations.\n\nAlso, feel free to share more about your Big Sur and Monterey trip!
