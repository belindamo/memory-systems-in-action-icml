Here is a revised version of the article written with a more sophisticated and nuanced style and including some more unusual words:\n\n---\n\nAs we all know, maintaining strong bones is an integral component of overall health and wellbeing. Two crucial nutrients play a pivotal role in this process: vitamin D and calcium. Our bodies require vitamin D to facilitate the absorption of calcium, which is essential for the growth and development of bones. Calcium, on the other hand, imparts structural integrity to our teeth and bones.\n\nIt is vital to ensure adequate intake of these nutrients at every stage of life. In fact, consuming sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium can help prevent the onset of osteoporosis and mitigate the risk of bone fractures as we age. But how much of these nutrients do we need to consume on a daily basis? The recommended intake varies according to age. If you are under 50, aim for 1,000 mg of calcium and 200 IU of vitamin D. If you are over 50, you should aim for 1,200 mg of calcium and 400-600 IU of vitamin D.\n\nSo, where can we find these nutrients? Here are some examples of alimentary sources that are rich in calcium and vitamin D:\n\n* Calcium: milk, cheese, yogurt, broccoli, kale, almonds\n* Vitamin D: fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel), egg yolks, mushrooms, fortified foods (such as cereal and orange juice)\n\nEnsure that you incorporate these foods into your diet to keep your bones strong and healthy!",
