Here are some tips on what to eat and drink before a longer run to help prevent cramping and maintain energy levels:\n\n**Pre-Run Nutrition:**\n\n1. **Carbohydrates**: Focus on complex carbs like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which provide sustained energy. Good options include oatmeal, whole-grain toast, bananas, and berries.\n2. **Protein**: Include a small amount of protein to help with muscle function and recovery. Good sources include nuts, seeds, eggs, and Greek yogurt.\n3. **Hydrating foods**: Incorporate hydrating foods like watermelon, cucumbers, and celery to help with fluid intake.\n4. **Avoid heavy meals**: Eat a light, balanced meal 1-3 hours before your run to prevent digestive discomfort.\n5. **Caffeine**: Limit or avoid caffeine, as it can cause dehydration and jitters.\n\n**Pre-Run Hydration:**\n\n1. **Water**: Drink 16-20 ounces of water 1-2 hours before your run to top off your hydration levels.\n2. **Electrolyte-rich drinks**: Consider a sports drink or coconut water to replenish electrolytes, especially if you're running in hot or humid conditions.\n3. **Avoid overhydration**: Don't overdo it on the fluids, as this can lead to bloating and discomfort during your run.\n\n**During the Run:**\n\n1. **Water**: Aim to drink 4-6 ounces of water every 20-30 minutes to stay hydrated.\n2. **Electrolyte-rich drinks**: Consider taking electrolyte-rich drinks or tablets every 30-60 minutes to replenish lost electrolytes.\n3. **Gels or chews**: If you're running for over an hour, consider taking energy gels or chews to provide a quick energy boost.\n\n**Post-Run Recovery:**\n\n1. **Replenish electrolytes**: Drink an electrolyte-rich drink or take an electrolyte supplement to replenish lost electrolytes.\n2. **Refuel with carbohydrates**: Consume a mix of carbohydrates and protein within 30-60 minutes after your run to help with recovery.\n3. **Hydrate**: Drink water or a hydrating drink to replenish lost fluids.\n\nSome examples of pre-run snacks that work well include:\n\n* Banana with peanut butter\n* Oatmeal with fruit and nuts\n* Energy bar with electrolytes\n* Yogurt with honey and granola\n* Avocado toast with eggs\n\nRemember, everyone's nutritional needs are different, so experiment with different foods and drinks to find what works best for you.
