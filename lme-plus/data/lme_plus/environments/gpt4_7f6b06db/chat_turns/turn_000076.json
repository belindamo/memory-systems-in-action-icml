If you have time, you could even stop by both cities, as they're relatively close to each other.\n\nHere's a possible itinerary:\n\n* Day 1-3: Himeji (explore the castle, park, and city)\n* Day 4: Kobe (visit the harbor, try Kobe beef, and enjoy the waterfront)\n* Day 5: Osaka (explore Dotonbori, Osaka Castle, and try some street food)\n* Day 6: Return to Tokyo\n\nOf course, you can adjust the itinerary to fit your interests and schedule. Keep in mind that Golden Week is a busy time, so it's essential to book your train tickets and accommodations in advance to avoid sold-out situations.\n\nAs an English teacher in Roppongi, you might appreciate the contrast between the smaller towns and the bustling cities.
