But I can certainly help you remember what you need to do.\n\nHere's a summary of what you need to do:\n\n* Order more of Luna's favorite grain-free wet food in blue packets (you have about a week's supply left)\n* Wash Max's favorite squeaky toys with stuffing inside this weekend\n\nYou can set a reminder for yourself by using a digital calendar, reminder app, or even a sticky note on your fridge. Just make sure to set a specific date and time to order the food and wash the toys, so you don't forget!\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",
