This will display a list of all the drives on the machine, including the non-standard drive. Once you have located the non-standard drive, you can navigate to it and search for the flag. If you know the name of the file or directory that the flag is in, you can use the \"dir\" command to search for it. If you are not sure where the flag is located, you can use the \"dir /s\" command to search the entire drive for the flag.",
