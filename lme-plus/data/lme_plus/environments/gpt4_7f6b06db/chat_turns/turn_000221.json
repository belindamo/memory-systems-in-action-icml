  "content": "Thank you! I'm really excited to have such a great group of friends coming over. And I completely agree with you about the playlist. I'll make sure to keep the volume at a reasonable level so it doesn't overpower the games and conversations. That's a great idea to ask my friends for music suggestions, too! I'll send out a group chat to get their input.\n\nAnd yes, I've definitely thought about having snacks and finger foods available. I think it'll add to the overall atmosphere and make the game night feel more like a social gathering. I'm planning to have a mix of sweet and savory snacks, like chips and dips, popcorn, cookies, and fruit. I might also consider having some finger foods like mini quiches, deviled eggs, or meatballs.\n\nI want to make sure there's something for everyone, so I'll probably ask my friends about any dietary restrictions or preferences beforehand. And of course, I'll have plenty of drinks available, including water, soda, and juice.\n\nThanks for the advice and suggestions! I'm really looking forward to hosting a fun and memorable game night with my friends.",
