Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Peak Season (May 1 to October 31):**\n\n* A wilderness permit is required for overnight camping in the John Muir Wilderness.\n* You can obtain a permit at a quota station or a visitor center.\n* There are quotas in place for certain zones, so it's essential to plan ahead and reserve your permit in advance.\n* You can reserve a permit online through the Recreation.gov website or by calling (760) 873-2483.\n\n**Off-Peak Season (November 1 to April 30):**\n\n* A self-issued permit is available at the trailhead or visitor center.\n* No quota system is in place during the off-peak season, but you still need to fill out a permit and deposit it in the box at the trailhead.\n\n**Other Requirements:**\n\n* A California Campfire Permit is required for campfires, even if you have a wilderness permit.\n* If you plan to camp in the Ansel Adams Wilderness, which is adjacent to the John Muir Wilderness, you'll need a separate permit.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Check the Inyo National Forest website or visitor centers for up-to-date information on permit availability, quotas, and restrictions.\n* Make sure to read and understand the rules and regulations for the John Muir Wilderness before your trip.\n* Be prepared to provide information about your itinerary, including your campsite locations and dates, when obtaining your permit.\n\nRemember to plan ahead, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns about the permit process.
