Go to [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps) and sign in with your Google account.\n2. Click \"Create A New Map.\"\n3.

Click on the location marker, and then click the edit (pencil) icon to change the title to \"Day # [Activity Name].\"\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all the locations in your itinerary.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a custom Google Map with all the places marked with day numbers, making it easy to navigate and plan your trip.
