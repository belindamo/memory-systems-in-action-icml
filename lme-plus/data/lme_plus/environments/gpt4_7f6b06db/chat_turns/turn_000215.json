Catching up with old friends is always a great feeling.\n\nNow, about your game night planning, that's a fantastic idea to have a mix of competitive and cooperative games! Catering to different personalities and play styles can ensure that everyone has a blast. Here's why:\n\n**Competitive Games:**\n\n* Appeal to players who enjoy rivalry and competition\n* Encourage strategic thinking and planning\n* Can be more engaging for players who thrive on winning or beating others\n\n**Cooperative Games:**\n\n* Foster teamwork and collaboration\n* Encourage communication, problem-solving, and mutual support\n* Can be more appealing to players who prefer working together towards a common goal\n\nHaving a mix of both types of games can:\n\n* Accommodate different personality types and play styles\n* Offer a change of pace and variety throughout the game night\n* Encourage players to try new types of games and step out of their comfort zones\n\nSome popular competitive games include:\n\n* Ticket to Ride\n* Settlers of Catan\n* Carcassonne\n* Azul\n* Codenames\n\nSome popular cooperative games include:\n\n* Forbidden Island/Forbidden Desert\n* Pandemic\n* Ghost Stories\n* Mysterium\n* Hanabi\n\nYou can also consider games that offer both competitive and cooperative elements, such as:\n\n* Codenames: Pictures (has both competitive and cooperative modes)\n* Mysterium: Hidden Signs (has a competitive variant)\n* 7 Wonders: Duel (has a competitive mode, but can be played cooperatively with a variant)\n\nRemember to choose games that fit your group's interests and preferences, and make sure to explain the rules and objectives clearly before starting each game. This will ensure that everyone has a great time, regardless of their play style.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for your game night!",
