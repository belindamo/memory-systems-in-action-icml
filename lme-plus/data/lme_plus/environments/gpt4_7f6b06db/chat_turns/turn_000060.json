Social media: Discovery can use social media like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat to promote its content and engage with a younger audience. For example, creating short-form videos that highlight exciting moments from their shows could appeal to younger viewers.\n\n2. Youth-oriented content: Discovery could also create a lineup of youth-oriented programming, including documentaries, reality shows, and scripted series that appeal to the interests of younger audiences. Such content could focus on topics like science, technology, and the environment that resonate with younger generations.\n\n3. Collaborations with influencers and celebrities: Discovery can collaborate with influencers and celebrities who have a large following among younger audiences to promote and co-create new content. This strategy could generate a buzz and increase the visibility of their content among Gen Z and millennials.\n\n4. Hybrid formats: To engage younger viewers who have shorter attention spans, Discovery could create hybrid formats that mix traditional programming with interactive elements. For instance, they could create shows that allow viewers to interact with characters or participate in challenges related to the show's content.",
