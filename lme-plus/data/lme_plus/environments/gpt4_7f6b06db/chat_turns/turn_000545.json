The \"/f\" flag is used to forcefully terminate the process.\n\nTo verify that the malware has been terminated, you can use the tasklist command in command prompt to check if the process is still running. The syntax for the command is: tasklist /fi \"imagename eq [process name]\".\n\nOnce you have verified that the malware has been terminated, you can run the halting.exe binary on the Administrator's Desktop to get the flag. The contents of the flag will depend on the specific scenario and instructions provided.",
