However, it is important to note that investigations and legal action have taken place regarding some of these controversies. For example, Navin Ramgoolam was arrested and charged in 2015 in connection with the alleged misappropriation of funds, and the investigation into the Bramer banking group led to several arrests and court cases. The controversy surrounding the Bagatelle dam extension also prompted protests and legal action by the affected residents and environmental groups. It's unclear, though, what the current status is of these cases and controversies, and whether any ongoing investigations or legal actions are being taken.",
