I'd be happy to offer some advice on how to prepare the soil and select plants that will thrive in a rural area near a lake.\n\n**Preparing the Soil:**\n\n1. **Test the soil**: Before starting your garden, it's essential to test the soil to determine its pH level, nutrient content, and structure. You can purchase a soil testing kit or send a sample to a lab for analysis.\n2. **Remove debris and rocks**: Clear the area of any debris, rocks, and weeds that can interfere with plant growth.\n3. **Add organic matter**: Mix in 2-4 inches of organic matter like compost, well-rotted manure, or peat moss to improve soil structure and fertility.\n4. **Check for compaction**: If the soil is compacted, loosen it to a depth of 8-10 inches to allow for good drainage and root growth.\n5. **Level the soil**: Ensure the soil is level and even to prevent waterlogging and erosion.\n\n**Choosing the Right Plants:**\n\n1. **Consider the climate**: Since you're near a lake, you'll want to choose plants that are tolerant of moisture and humidity. Look for plants that thrive in USDA Hardiness Zone 4 or 5, depending on your location.\n2. **Select native plants**: Native plants are adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, making them a great choice. They'll also attract local pollinators and wildlife.\n3. **Choose plants that like wet feet**: Plants like bog cotton, water lilies, and cattails thrive in wet conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding.\n4. **Incorporate companion planting**: Pair plants that benefit from each other's growth, like the \"Three Sisters\" method (corn, beans, and squash).\n5. **Consider wind and sun exposure**: Since you're near a lake, you may experience strong winds. Choose plants that can tolerate wind, and consider providing windbreaks like shrubs or trees.\n\n**Some Recommended Plants for a Rural Lake Area:**\n\n1. **Vegetables:**\n\t* Root vegetables like carrots, beets, and potatoes\n\t* Leafy greens like kale, spinach, and lettuce\n\t* Brassicas like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage\n2. **Fruits:**\n\t* Strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries (which love the moist soil)\n\t* Apple and cherry trees (which can tolerate wet soil)\n3. **Flowers:**\n\t* Native wildflowers like black-eyed susans, coneflowers, and cosmos\n\t* Perennials like bee balm, lavender, and catmint\n4. **Herbs:**\n\t* Mint, chamomile, and lemon balm (which love moist soil)\n\t* Thyme, oregano, and rosemary (which can tolerate dry spells)\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Start small**: Begin with a small garden and gradually expand as you gain experience and learn what works best for your soil and climate.\n2. **Keep a garden journal**: Record your planting dates, weather patterns, and harvests to refine your gardening strategy over time.\n3. **Be prepared for wildlife**: Since you're near a lake, you may attract wildlife like deer, rabbits, or birds. Consider using fencing, repellents, or other deterrents to protect your garden.\n\nBy following these tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving garden at your new property. Happy gardening!",
