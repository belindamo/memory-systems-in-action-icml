  "content": "When Eve calls Lucifer \"Samael,\" Lucifer's heart skips a beat. This reaction occurs because Samael is an old name that has not been used to address them in a very long time. The name brings back memories of a different life, a different purpose, and a different identity.\n\nHearing the name \"Samael\" evokes a sense of nostalgia and reminds Lucifer of their past before their fall from grace. The name carries the weight of their previous existence as an angel, which contrasts with their current identity as the fallen angel, Lucifer. The emotional impact of being called \"Samael\" further underscores the significance of this meeting with Eve and the opportunity for redemption and closure it presents.",
