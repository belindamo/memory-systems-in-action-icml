Seeing signs of bears in the wild can be a thrilling experience, but it's also a great reminder to be mindful of our presence in their territory.\n\nIt's great that you're taking bear safety seriously, especially since you'll be venturing into the Eastern Sierra, which is known bear country. Being cautious and prepared is key to a safe and enjoyable outdoor experience.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what kind of signs of bears did you see on your road trip to Big Sur and Monterey? Were they tracks, scat, or something else?\n\nAnd how was your road trip, by the way? Big Sur and Monterey are both stunning destinations. Did you have a favorite stop or experience along the way?",
