Schedule it in: One of the easiest ways to maintain a regular yoga routine is to schedule it in like any other appointment or commitment. Choose a specific time each day or week when you will practice yoga, and stick to that schedule as much as possible. 2. Keep it short and sweet: You don't need to practice yoga for hours on end to reap the benefits. Even 10-15 minutes of yoga each day can help to reduce stress and anxiety. Look for short classes or videos that you can easily fit into your daily schedule. 3. Create a dedicated space: Having a dedicated space for yoga can make it easier to practice regularly. Set up a yoga mat, blocks and any other props you might need in a quiet area of your home, and make it a welcoming and calming space that invites you to practice. 4. Combine it with other activities: If finding time for yoga seems difficult, try combining it with other activities you already do throughout the day. For example, you could do a few poses while waiting for your coffee to brew, or during a commercial break while watching TV. 5. Be flexible: Life happens, and there may be times when it's simply not possible to practice yoga as often as you'd like. Don't beat yourself up about it - instead, be flexible and adjust your routine as needed to fit your schedule. The key is to maintain a consistent practice as much as possible, even if it's just a few minutes each day.",
