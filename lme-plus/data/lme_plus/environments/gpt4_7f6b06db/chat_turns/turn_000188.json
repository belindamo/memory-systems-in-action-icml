Help me to see the beauty in each moment and to be grateful for all that I have.\" 2. \"May I have the courage to face whatever challenges come my way today, and the strength to overcome them.\" 3. \"Guide me on my path today, and help me to make choices that align with my soul's purpose.\" 4. \"May I be a vessel of love and light in the world today. Help me to show kindness and compassion to all those I meet.\" 5. \"Thank you for this new day, and for all the blessings in my life. Help me to see the divine in all beings and to serve with humility and grace.\" Remember that prayer is a personal practice, so feel free to adapt these or create your own prayers that resonate with you.
