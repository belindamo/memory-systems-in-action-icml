Here is a revised version of the article that has been rewritten to improve readability and reflect a more natural writing style:\n\n---\n\nMaintaining strong bones is crucial for our overall health, and two essential nutrients play a vital role in this process: vitamin D and calcium. Our bodies need vitamin D to absorb calcium, which is necessary for bone growth and development. Calcium, on the other hand, gives our teeth and bones their structure.\n\nThese nutrients are important at every stage of life. In fact, getting enough vitamin D and calcium can help prevent osteoporosis and reduce the risk of bone fractures as we age. But how much do we need? The daily recommended intake varies by age. If you are under 50, aim for 1,000 mg of calcium and 200 IUs of vitamin D. If you are over 50, you should aim for 1,200 mg of calcium and 400-600 IUs of vitamin D.\n\nSo, where can we find these nutrients? Here are some examples of foods that are rich in calcium and vitamin D:\n\n* Calcium: milk, cheese, yogurt, broccoli, kale, almonds\n* Vitamin D: fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel), egg yolks, mushrooms, fortified foods (such as cereal and orange juice)\n\nMake sure to include these foods in your diet to keep your bones strong and healthy!",
