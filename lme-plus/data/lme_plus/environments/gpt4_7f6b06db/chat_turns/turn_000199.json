Here is a revised version of the article that has been rewritten to improve readability:\n\n---\n\nMaintaining strong bones is important for our overall health, and two essential nutrients play a key role in this process: vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D helps our bodies absorb calcium, which is necessary for bone growth and development. Calcium, on the other hand, gives our teeth and bones their structure.\n\nBoth of these nutrients are important at any age. In fact, getting enough vitamin D and calcium can help prevent osteoporosis and reduce the risk of bone fractures as we age. But how much do we need? The daily recommended intake varies by age. If you are under 50, aim for 1,000 mg of calcium and 200 IUs of vitamin D. If you are over 50, you should aim for 1,200 mg of calcium and 400-600 IUs of vitamin D.\n\nSo, where can we find these nutrients? Here are some examples of foods that are rich in calcium and vitamin D:\n\n* Calcium: milk, cheese, yogurt, broccoli, kale, almonds\n* Vitamin D: fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel), egg yolks, mushrooms, fortified foods (such as cereal and orange juice)\n\nIncorporate these foods into your diet to keep your bones strong and healthy!",
