  "content": "I'm looking forward to the draft and the upcoming season. I've been following the NFL draft and offseason developments, and I think I have a good sense of the top players and sleepers. I'm planning to target a top running back or wide receiver in the first round, and then focus on building a strong core of players in the early rounds. Do you have any advice on how to manage my team during the season, such as when to start or sit players, and how to make waivers and trades?",
