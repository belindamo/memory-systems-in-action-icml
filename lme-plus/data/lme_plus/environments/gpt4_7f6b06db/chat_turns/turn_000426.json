  "content": "We saw some bear tracks near Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, and it was a bit surprising because we didn't expect to see them that close to the coast. We also saw some signs of bears digging near the trailheads, but we didn't actually see any bears. \n\nOur road trip was amazing, though! We loved the scenic drives along Highway 1, and the views of the coastline were just stunning. We also spent some time in Monterey, visiting Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which were both really interesting. And our Airbnb in Pacific Grove was super cute and cozy.",
