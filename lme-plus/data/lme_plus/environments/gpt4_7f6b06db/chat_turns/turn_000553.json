  "content": "That's a great goal! Collecting coins from around the world can be a fascinating and rewarding hobby.\n\nAs of 2023, the United Nations recognizes 196 countries. This number includes 193 Member States, 2 Observer States (the Holy See and Palestine), and 1 non-member state (Taiwan, which is officially known as the Republic of China).\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the number of countries can vary depending on how one defines a \"country.\" Some sources may group certain territories or dependencies as separate countries, while others may not. For example, some collectors might consider Taiwan to be a separate country, while others might consider it to be a part of China.\n\nRegardless, collecting one coin from every UN-recognized country is an impressive goal! You'll have a diverse and interesting collection that showcases the unique designs, languages, and cultural heritage of countries from around the world.\n\nThe 1955 British farthing is a great addition to your collection. The farthing was a denomination of British currency that was minted from 1714 to 1956, and it features a iconic design with a wren on the reverse side.\n\nAs you continue to collect coins from around the world, you might consider learning more about the history, culture, and economy of each country. This can add a deeper layer of appreciation and understanding to your collection, and make it even more enjoyable to share with others.\n\nDo you have a favorite coin or country that you're particularly interested in, or a strategy for tracking down coins from countries that are harder to find?",
