Here are some tips to help you clean them safely:\n\n**Hand washing is recommended:**\n\n1. Check the toy's label: If the toy has a care label, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Some toys might be machine washable, but it's still safer to hand wash to avoid damaging the squeakers or stuffing.\n2. Use mild soap and lukewarm water: Gently wash the toys with a mild soap or detergent specifically designed for washing toys. Avoid using harsh chemicals or hot water, which can damage the materials or cause the squeakers to malfunction.\n3. Gently squeeze and massage: Use your hands to gently squeeze and massage the soap into the toy, working from the outside in. Be careful not to squeeze too hard, as you don't want to push the stuffing out or damage the squeakers.\n4. Rinse thoroughly: Rinse the toys under running lukewarm water to remove all soap residue.\n5. Air dry: Gently squeeze out excess water and allow the toys to air dry. Avoid putting them in the dryer or exposing them to direct sunlight, as this can cause the materials to degrade or the squeakers to rust.\n\n**Avoid machine washing:**\n\nMachine washing can be too harsh for squeaky toys with stuffing inside. The agitation, spin cycle, and hot water can cause:\n\n* Squeakers to break or malfunction\n* Stuffing to come out or become lumpy\n* Materials to stretch, shrink, or lose their shape\n* Detergent residue to accumulate inside the toy\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Regularly cleaning your pet's toys can help prevent the buildup of bacteria and germs.\n* If the toys are heavily soiled or have a strong odor, you can soak them in a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar for about 30 minutes before washing.\n* Consider washing the toys in a mesh laundry bag or a soft, clean cloth to protect them from snagging or abrasion.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to clean Max's favorite squeaky toys safely and effectively!",
