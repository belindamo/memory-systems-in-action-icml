Visiting the General Sherman Tree and the Congress Trail can be a busy experience, but with some insider knowledge, you can minimize the crowds and make the most of your time. Here are some tips to help you plan your visit:\n\n**Best Time to Visit:**\n\n1. **Early Morning:** Arrive at the General Sherman Tree parking area between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM. The early morning hours offer a more peaceful experience, and you'll have a better chance to take photos without crowds.\n2. **Late Afternoon:** Visit the General Sherman Tree and Congress Trail between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. The afternoon sun creates a warm, golden light, and the crowds tend to dissipate as the day winds down.\n\n**Avoid Peak Hours:**\n\n1. **11:00 AM to 3:00 PM:** These hours tend to be the busiest, as most visitors arrive during this time. If possible, plan your visit around these peak hours to avoid the crowds.\n2. **Weekends and Holidays:** If you can, plan your visit on a weekday instead of a weekend or holiday, when possible. These days tend to attract more visitors.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Park at the Wolverton Creek Parking Area:** Instead of parking at the General Sherman Tree parking area, consider parking at the Wolverton Creek parking area, which is a short walk from the Congress Trailhead. This can help you avoid the crowds and chaos at the main parking area.\n2. **Take the Shuttle:** During peak season (May to October), the park offers a free shuttle service between the Giant Forest Museum and the General Sherman Tree. This can help reduce congestion and parking issues.\n3. **Be Prepared for Delays:** Even with planning, you might still encounter some crowds or delays. Be patient, and remember to enjoy the scenery and the giant sequoias around you.\n\nBy following these tips, you can minimize your exposure to crowds and make the most of your visit to the General Sherman Tree and the Congress Trail. Enjoy your time in Sequoia National Park!",
