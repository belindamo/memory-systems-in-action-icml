  "content": "Existentialist literature was a product of the philosophical movement known as existentialism, which emerged in the mid-20th century in Europe. The movement was founded on the belief that traditional philosophy, with its emphasis on rationality and objective truth, was inadequate to address the core questions of human existence. Existentialists sought to develop a new understanding of the human condition that was rooted in subjective experience, individual choice, and the angst or dread that arises from the recognition of the human condition.\n\nExistentialist literature reflected these ideas by exploring human experiences of alienation, isolation, and anxiety. Existentialist writers were interested in the individual's search for meaning in life, the nature of freedom, and the inherent absurdity of the human condition. These writers believed that human beings were fundamentally free to make choices, but also recognized that this freedom came with an immense responsibility. They emphasized the importance of individual agency and self-awareness, as well as the need to confront the realities of suffering, death, and despair.\n\nOverall, existentialist literature was grounded in the belief that human beings are unique, complex, and ultimately unknowable beings who must create their own meaning in life in the face of an indifferent and absurd universe.",
