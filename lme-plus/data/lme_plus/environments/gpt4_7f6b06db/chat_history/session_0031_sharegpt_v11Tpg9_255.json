Expertise in background checks: Intelligence officers are skilled in conducting thorough background checks, which can include examining an individual's criminal history, financial records, personal and professional connections, and any past behavior that might be of concern. This helps ensure that only individuals with a clean background and no security risks are cleared to go to the surface.\n2. Access to classified information: Intelligence agencies often have access to classified or sensitive information that may not be available to other departments. This allows them to conduct more comprehensive vetting processes and identify potential risks that might be overlooked by others.\n3. Experience in evaluating trustworthiness: Intelligence officers are trained in evaluating an individual's trustworthiness and identifying any potential vulnerabilities or motivations that could compromise their loyalty. This helps ensure that the support personnel on the surface are reliable and dedicated to the mission's objectives.\n4. Counterintelligence capabilities: The intelligence wing has expertise in detecting and countering espionage, sabotage, or other forms of covert activity. By vetting support personnel, they help ensure that no infiltrators or spies are introduced into the sensitive environment of the Forest Moon of Kodia III.\n5. Interagency collaboration: The intelligence wing often works closely with other agencies, such as the Frontier Service and the Second Expeditionary Fleet, enabling smooth communication and coordination. This collaboration allows the intelligence wing to efficiently share relevant information and make informed decisions about who should be allowed to work on the surface.\n\nOverall, the intelligence wing's unique skill set, access to sensitive information, and experience in security-related matters make it the ideal choice for vetting the rangers' support personnel and ensuring the safety and security of the Forest Moon of Kodia III."
