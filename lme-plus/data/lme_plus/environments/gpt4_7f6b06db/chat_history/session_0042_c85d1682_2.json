      "content": "The undercut with pompadour is a fantastic choice! Styling the top section can be a lot of fun, and I'm happy to share some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Product choice**: Invest in a good pomade, styling cream, or hair wax that suits your hair type. Pomades are great for a sleek, polished look, while styling creams and waxes add texture and hold.\n2. **Prep the hair**: Before styling, make sure your hair is clean and towel-dried. You can also use a heat protectant spray or serum to add shine and protect your hair from heat styling tools.\n3. **Use a comb or brush**: Comb or brush your hair upwards and away from your face to create volume and lift. You can use a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush for this step.\n4. **Add hold and texture**: Apply your chosen product to the top section, starting from the crown and working your way outwards. Use your fingers or a comb to distribute the product evenly.\n5. **Style with your fingers**: Use your fingers to shape and mold the hair into the desired shape. You can use a bit of texture spray or dry shampoo to add grit and volume.\n6. **Add some height**: Use a hairspray or a strong-hold pomade to add extra height to the pompadour. You can also use a hair dryer on a low setting to add volume and hold.\n7. **Finish with a hair serum**: Add a hair serum or oil to the ends of your hair to add shine and protect your locks from heat styling tools.\n\nSome popular styling techniques for the top section include:\n\n* **Slicked back**: Use a pomade or styling cream to slick the hair back, creating a sleek, polished look.\n* **Textured and piecey**: Use a hair wax or styling cream to add texture and piecey-ness to the hair. This creates a more undone, edgy look.\n* **Volume on top**: Use a volumizing powder or dry shampoo to add extra volume to the top section. This creates a more dramatic, statement look.\n\nRemember, the key to pulling off an undercut with pompadour is to own it with confidence! Experiment with different products and techniques to find what works best for you.\n\nAs you explore new ways to express yourself through fashion and beauty, don't be afraid to try new things and take risks. It's all about having fun and finding what makes you feel confident and empowered.\n\nHow do you feel about trying out some bold, bright hair colors to complement your new 'do?"
