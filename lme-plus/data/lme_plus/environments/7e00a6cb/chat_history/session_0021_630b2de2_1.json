      "content": "High-waisted styles are super popular right now, and AG Jeans has some amazing options.\n\nIn their Fall/Winter 2022 collection, AG Jeans has introduced several new high-waisted styles with stretch. Here are a few highlights:\n\n1. **The Prima**: This is a new high-waisted style with a slim-straight fit and a touch of stretch. It features a 9.5-inch rise and a 27-inch inseam. The Prima is available in several washes, including a gorgeous dark blue \"Washed Indigo\" and a trendy black \"Washed Black\".\n2. **The Farrah**: This style is a high-waisted, high-stretch jean with a relaxed fit through the thigh and a tapered leg. It has a 10-inch rise and a 28-inch inseam. The Farrah is available in a range of washes, including a beautiful light blue \"Washed Blue\" and a deep indigo \"Washed Dark\".\n3. **The Jodi**: This is a high-waisted, skinny-fit jean with a 9-inch rise and a 26-inch inseam. The Jodi has a bit of stretch for comfort and is available in several washes, including a stylish \"Washed Grey\" and a bold \"Washed Black\".\n\nAll of these styles feature AG Jeans' signature attention to detail, including premium denim fabrics, comfortable fits, and trendy designs.\n\nAG Jeans has also introduced some new fabrics and technologies in their Fall/Winter 2022 collection, including their \"Four-Way Stretch\" fabric, which provides flexibility and comfort in all directions. They've also incorporated sustainable materials and production methods whenever possible, so you can feel good about your purchase too.\n\nI recommend checking out AG Jeans' website or visiting an authorized retailer to see these styles in person. You might also want to read reviews or ask for recommendations from the sales team to find the perfect fit for your body and style."

      "content": "AG Jeans often offers doorbuster deals and limited-time offers during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but they also tend to have discounts available throughout the entire weekend. Here's what I've seen in previous years:\n\n**Doorbuster deals**: AG Jeans usually offers a few doorbuster deals on select styles, which are only available for a limited time (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, etc.). These deals are often the deepest discounts they offer, but the quantities are limited, and the styles might not be part of their regular collection.\n\n**Limited-time offers**: In addition to doorbusters, AG Jeans might offer limited-time discounts on specific styles or categories, like high-waisted jeans or outerwear. These offers are usually available for a shorter period, say 12-48 hours, and might be announced through email newsletters, social media, or on their website.\n\n**Weekend-long discounts**: AG Jeans often offers discounts on a wider range of styles throughout the entire Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend. These discounts might not be as deep as the doorbuster deals, but they're still a great opportunity to snag a good deal on your favorite styles.\n\n**Flash sales**: Keep an eye out for flash sales, which are short-term promotions (usually 1-2 hours) with exclusive discounts on specific styles or categories. AG Jeans might announce these flash sales through social media or email newsletters, so stay tuned!\n\n**Tiered discounts**: In some cases, AG Jeans might offer tiered discounts, where the more you spend, the more you save. For example, 20% off orders over $100, 25% off orders over $200, and so on.\n\nTo maximize your savings, I recommend:\n\n1. Sign up for AG Jeans' email newsletter to get early access to deals and exclusive promo codes.\n2. Follow AG Jeans on social media to stay informed about limited-time offers and flash sales.\n3. Check their website regularly throughout the weekend for doorbusters, limited-time offers, and weekend-long discounts.\n4. Use promo codes and discount codes whenever possible to stack your savings.\n\nRemember, popular styles and sizes might sell out quickly, so be prepared to act fast if you see a deal you like!"

      "content": "I'm also thinking of picking up a few more pairs of AG Jeans during the sale, since I know they retail for $200 but I got a great deal on them last time. Do you think they'll have a price match policy in place during the Black Friday sale?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "AG Jeans' price match policy is a great question!\n\nAG Jeans does have a price match policy in place, but it's essential to understand the details, especially during the Black Friday sale.\n\n**Price Match Policy**: AG Jeans offers a price match guarantee, which means that if you find a lower price on an identical AG Jeans product at an authorized retailer, they'll match that price. This policy applies to in-store and online purchases.\n\n**Black Friday Exclusions**: During the Black Friday sale, AG Jeans might exclude certain styles, collections, or promotions from their price match policy. This is because they're already offering discounted prices, and they might not be able to match lower prices from other retailers.\n\n**Authorized Retailers**: To qualify for a price match, the lower price must be from an authorized AG Jeans retailer. This includes AG Jeans' official website, AG Jeans stores, and authorized online retailers like Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, or Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\n**Price Match Process**: If you find a lower price on an AG Jeans product, you'll need to provide proof of the lower price to AG Jeans' customer service team. They'll verify the price and, if applicable, match it.\n\n**Important Notes**:\n\n* AG Jeans' price match policy only applies to identical products, including style, color, size, and fabric.\n* The lower price must be from an authorized retailer and be publicly advertised.\n* AG Jeans reserves the right to modify or cancel their price match policy at any time.\n\nTo ensure you can take advantage of the price match policy during the Black Friday sale, I recommend:\n\n1. Check AG Jeans' website for any exclusions or modifications to their price match policy during the sale.\n2. Verify the prices of the styles you're interested in at authorized retailers before making a purchase.\n3. Keep proof of the lower price, such as a screenshot or a printed copy of the advertisement.\n4. Reach out to AG Jeans' customer service team if you need to request a price match.\n\nBy understanding the price match policy, you can shop with confidence and potentially snag an even better deal on your favorite AG Jeans styles during the Black Friday sale!"
