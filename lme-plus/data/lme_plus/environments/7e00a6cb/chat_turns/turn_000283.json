Make sure to block out the time slot and add a note with the client's name, the purpose of the call, and any relevant details you want to discuss during the follow-up.\n\nIf you need any more help or have any other questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope the follow-up call goes smoothly and productively!",
