When the route is accessed, it will get the URL and summary of the updated content from the `url` and `summary` parameters in the request body. It will then call the `hub.publish()` method, passing in the URL and the summary as arguments. This will send a notification to the hub on your website, so that it can deliver the notification to all subscribed users.\n\nOnce the notification is successfully sent to the hub, the route will return a success response. This will allow the webhook to continue executing any other actions that it is configured to perform after sending the notification. If an error occurs during the notification process, the route will return an error response with a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error). This will indicate to the webhook that an error occurred and it should not continue executing any other actions.\n\nHere is an example of how the `/notify`",
