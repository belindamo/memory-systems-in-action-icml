Since you've been friends for a while, you've probably built a level of trust and familiarity, which makes it easier to ask for recommendations.\n\nDavid might be more than happy to share some new sci-fi shows with you, especially if he's been enjoying them himself. You could casually bring it up during the game night, maybe during a break or while you're setting up the next round of games.\n\nYou could say something like, \"Hey David, I've really been enjoying the sci-fi shows you've been recommending lately. Got any new ones you'd suggest I check out?\" or \"What's been your favorite sci-fi show recently? I'm always looking for something new to binge-watch.\"\n\nBy asking for his opinion and showing interest in his tastes, you're more likely to get some great recommendations. Plus, it's a great way to bond over your shared love of sci-fi and have some fun conversations about your favorite shows!\n\nJust remember to keep the conversation relaxed and friendly, and I'm sure you'll get some awesome recommendations from David. Happy gaming and binge-watching!",
