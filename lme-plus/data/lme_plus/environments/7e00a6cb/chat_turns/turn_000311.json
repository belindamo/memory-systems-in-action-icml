Here are some suggestions to help you allocate time for these activities while still meeting the deadline for the new product feature:\n\n1. **Schedule dedicated time for mentoring**: Set aside a specific time slot each week (e.g., 1-2 hours) for mentoring sessions with team members. This could be a recurring meeting or a flexible schedule that works for both you and your mentees.\n2. **Pair programming and knowledge sharing**: While working on the new product feature, invite team members to pair program with you. This will not only help them learn from you but also allow them to contribute to the feature's development. You can also share your knowledge and expertise through code reviews, design discussions, or ad-hoc teaching sessions.\n3. **Mentoring during feature development**: Identify specific tasks or components of the feature that can be delegated to team members. This will help them develop their skills while also contributing to the feature's development. You can provide guidance and feedback as needed, ensuring they're on the right track.\n4. **Leadership development through project management**: As you work on the new product feature, take on more project management responsibilities. This will help you develop your leadership skills, such as:\n\t* Coordinating with stakeholders and teams\n\t* Creating project plans and timelines\n\t* Identifying and mitigating risks\n\t* Communicating project progress and updates\n5. **Lunch and learns or brown-bag sessions**: Organize lunch and learns or brown-bag sessions on topics related to leadership, software development, or industry trends. This will help you share your knowledge and expertise with the team while also learning from others.\n6. **Time-blocking for reflection and planning**: Schedule time each week (e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour) to reflect on your progress, plan your tasks, and adjust your priorities as needed. This will help you stay focused on your goals and ensure you're allocating time for mentoring and leadership development.\n\nTo make time for these activities, consider the following:\n\n* Delegate tasks or responsibilities to team members where possible\n* Batch similar tasks together to optimize your time\n* Prioritize your tasks based on urgency and importance\n* Learn to say \"no\" to non-essential tasks that may derail your focus\n\nBy allocating time for mentoring and leadership development, you'll not only grow as a leader but also help your team members develop their skills, ultimately contributing to the team's overall success.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Are there any other ideas you'd like to explore?",
