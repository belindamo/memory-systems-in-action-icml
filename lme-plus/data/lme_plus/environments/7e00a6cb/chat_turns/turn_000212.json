  "content": "That's a good question. At the moment, there are no specific plans to vaccinate the players and coaches in the Primeira Liga, as the vaccination priority is currently being given to certain groups, such as the elderly, healthcare workers, and people with underlying medical conditions. However, the Portuguese government has stated that professional athletes and staff will be included in the next phase of the vaccination rollout, which is expected to begin in May 2021. This would mean that players and coaches in the Primeira Liga may be vaccinated in the near future, depending on how the rollout plan is executed. Nonetheless, it's important to remember that being vaccinated doesn't necessarily guarantee complete immunity from getting infected with the virus or transmitting it to others, so other measures will likely still need to be in place to keep everyone safe.",
