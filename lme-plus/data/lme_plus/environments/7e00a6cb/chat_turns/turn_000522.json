Decluttering and donating old items can be so liberating, and it's great that you were able to give back to the community by donating to Goodwill.\n\nOrganizing a closet can be a therapeutic process, and it's wonderful that you took the time to tackle it. It's not just about having a tidy space, but also about creating a sense of control and calm in our lives.
