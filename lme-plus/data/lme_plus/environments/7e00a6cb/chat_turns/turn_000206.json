  "content": "There is some data to suggest that iPhone users may be more likely to purchase electric cars like Tesla than Android users. According to a survey conducted by Experian Automotive in 2016, Tesla owners had the highest percentage of iPhone users at 91%, compared to 69% for Android. However, it's worth noting that this data is a few years old and may not necessarily reflect the current preferences of iPhone users. Additionally, the choice to purchase an electric car like Tesla is influenced by a variety of factors beyond just smartphone preference, such as environmental concerns, driving habits, and budget.",
