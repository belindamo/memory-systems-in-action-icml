My name is Worm, and I've come from a place not too far from here.\"\n4. Proto-Sarah: \"What place? I've never seen you before.\"\n5. Human Worm: \"A labyrinth. It's a strange, mystical realm that exists outside of our reality. I came here to observe and learn.\"\n6. Proto-Sarah: \"I don't understand. What do you want with me?\"\n7. Human Worm: \"I couldn't just stand by and watch you hurt yourself. I can sense the turmoil within you, and I want to help if I can.\"\n8. Proto-Sarah: \"How do you know what I'm feeling? No one has ever understood me like that before.\"\n9. Human Worm: \"I've seen much suffering in my time, and I know what it's like to feel lost and alone. I'm here for you, if you'll let me.\"\n10.
