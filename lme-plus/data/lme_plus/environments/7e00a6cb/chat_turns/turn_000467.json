A hero section on the PartsTrader website promoting PTInsights, which will be prominently displayed on the website and will help drive traffic to the PTInsights page.\n2. Social media posts and ads promoting PTInsights, which will help raise awareness of the product among current and past users of PartsTrader and drive traffic to the website.\n3. A 4-email drip campaign, which will provide detailed information on the features, benefits, and how PTInsights can help users optimize their shop performance and profitability, and drive traffic to the specific dashboard mentioned in the email.\n4. In-app ads, which will encourage users to view the PTInsights dashboards.\n5. Reports on website traffic, social media engagement, email engagement, in-app ad views, and PTInsights dashboard visits and return visits to be provided on a regular basis throughout the campaign. These reports will help track the success of the campaign and make adjustments as needed.\n\nIt should be noted that all of these content pieces are important for the success of the campaign and will need to be executed effectively in order to achieve the campaign's goals.",
