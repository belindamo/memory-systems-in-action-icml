  "content": "AG Jeans often offers doorbuster deals and limited-time offers during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but they also tend to have discounts available throughout the entire weekend. Here's what I've seen in previous years:\n\n**Doorbuster deals**: AG Jeans usually offers a few doorbuster deals on select styles, which are only available for a limited time (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, etc.). These deals are often the deepest discounts they offer, but the quantities are limited, and the styles might not be part of their regular collection.\n\n**Limited-time offers**: In addition to doorbusters, AG Jeans might offer limited-time discounts on specific styles or categories, like high-waisted jeans or outerwear. These offers are usually available for a shorter period, say 12-48 hours, and might be announced through email newsletters, social media, or on their website.\n\n**Weekend-long discounts**: AG Jeans often offers discounts on a wider range of styles throughout the entire Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend. These discounts might not be as deep as the doorbuster deals, but they're still a great opportunity to snag a good deal on your favorite styles.\n\n**Flash sales**: Keep an eye out for flash sales, which are short-term promotions (usually 1-2 hours) with exclusive discounts on specific styles or categories. AG Jeans might announce these flash sales through social media or email newsletters, so stay tuned!\n\n**Tiered discounts**: In some cases, AG Jeans might offer tiered discounts, where the more you spend, the more you save. For example, 20% off orders over $100, 25% off orders over $200, and so on.\n\nTo maximize your savings, I recommend:\n\n1. Sign up for AG Jeans' email newsletter to get early access to deals and exclusive promo codes.\n2. Follow AG Jeans on social media to stay informed about limited-time offers and flash sales.\n3. Check their website regularly throughout the weekend for doorbusters, limited-time offers, and weekend-long discounts.\n4. Use promo codes and discount codes whenever possible to stack your savings.\n\nRemember, popular styles and sizes might sell out quickly, so be prepared to act fast if you see a deal you like!",
