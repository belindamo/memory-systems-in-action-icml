  "content": "Adding small details to the windowsill is a fantastic idea! It will definitely help to create a more realistic and immersive scene. Tiny vases, decorative items, or even small toys or trinkets can add a lot of character to your windowsill and make it feel more lived-in.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when adding small details:\n\n* **Scale**: Make sure the details you add are proportional to the figurine and the windowsill. You don't want them to overpower the scene or look out of place.\n* **Theme**: Choose details that fit with the theme of your shadow box and Luna's personality. For example, if Luna loves to chase laser pointers, you could add a tiny laser pointer or a small toy mouse to the windowsill.\n* **Color**: Select details that complement the colors in your shadow box. You can use colors that match or contrast with the figurine and the background to create visual interest.\n* **Texture**: Mix and match different textures to add depth and variety to your windowsill. For example, you could add a smooth vase, a rough-textured decorative item, or a soft, fuzzy toy.\n* **Balance**: Make sure the details are balanced and visually appealing. You don't want one side of the windowsill to be too cluttered or the other side to be too bare.\n\nSome other ideas for small details you could add to the windowsill include:\n\n* A tiny book or magazine\n* A small potted plant or succulent\n* A miniature decorative box or container\n* A tiny photograph or picture frame\n* A small, delicate ornament or charm\n* A tiny piece of jewelry or trinket\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and be creative! Experiment with different details and arrangements until you find a look that you love.",
