Yes, the Roald Dahl Museum is definitely worth a visit if you are a fan of his books. The museum is housed in a historic building and includes interactive exhibits for children, including hands-on activities related to Dahl's stories. Visitors can also see the author's writing hut, where he wrote many of his most famous books, and learn about his life and creative process. The museum also hosts special events and workshops throughout the year, so it's a great place to visit for the whole family.",
