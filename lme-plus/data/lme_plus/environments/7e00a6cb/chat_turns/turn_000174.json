  "content": "AG Jeans' price match policy is a great question!\n\nAG Jeans does have a price match policy in place, but it's essential to understand the details, especially during the Black Friday sale.\n\n**Price Match Policy**: AG Jeans offers a price match guarantee, which means that if you find a lower price on an identical AG Jeans product at an authorized retailer, they'll match that price. This policy applies to in-store and online purchases.\n\n**Black Friday Exclusions**: During the Black Friday sale, AG Jeans might exclude certain styles, collections, or promotions from their price match policy. This is because they're already offering discounted prices, and they might not be able to match lower prices from other retailers.\n\n**Authorized Retailers**: To qualify for a price match, the lower price must be from an authorized AG Jeans retailer. This includes AG Jeans' official website, AG Jeans stores, and authorized online retailers like Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, or Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\n**Price Match Process**: If you find a lower price on an AG Jeans product, you'll need to provide proof of the lower price to AG Jeans' customer service team. They'll verify the price and, if applicable, match it.\n\n**Important Notes**:\n\n* AG Jeans' price match policy only applies to identical products, including style, color, size, and fabric.\n* The lower price must be from an authorized retailer and be publicly advertised.\n* AG Jeans reserves the right to modify or cancel their price match policy at any time.\n\nTo ensure you can take advantage of the price match policy during the Black Friday sale, I recommend:\n\n1. Check AG Jeans' website for any exclusions or modifications to their price match policy during the sale.\n2. Verify the prices of the styles you're interested in at authorized retailers before making a purchase.\n3. Keep proof of the lower price, such as a screenshot or a printed copy of the advertisement.\n4. Reach out to AG Jeans' customer service team if you need to request a price match.\n\nBy understanding the price match policy, you can shop with confidence and potentially snag an even better deal on your favorite AG Jeans styles during the Black Friday sale!",
