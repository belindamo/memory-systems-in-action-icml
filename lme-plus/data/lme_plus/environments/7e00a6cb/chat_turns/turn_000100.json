Rent controls: Governments might impose rent controls to limit rent increases, which are seen as a response. \n\n3. Zoning policies: Governments might implement zoning policies to control land use and limit or promote certain types of housing.\n\nJob Market:\n\n1. Education and training: To adjust the job market demands associated with demographic changes, governments could invest in education and training programs to upskill the workforce.\n\n2.

Entrepreneurship: Governments could promote entrepreneurship and the development of small and medium enterprises.\n\n4.
