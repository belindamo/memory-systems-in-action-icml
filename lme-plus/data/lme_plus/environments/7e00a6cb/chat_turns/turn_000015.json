  "content": "Now, the phase change between the midpoint values can be written as:\n\n\u0394\u03b8(k) = Im(m(k+1)) - Im(m(k)) = Im((s(k+1) + s(k+2))/2 - (s(k) + s(k+1))/2)\n\n= Im(s(k+2) - s(k)) / 2\n\n= \u03c0 / ln(N+1)\n\nThis means that the midpoint values, M(k), change phase by \u03c0/2 between successive points, just like the centers of the cornu spirals. Therefore, the midpoint values, M(k), are also symmetric with respect to the random walk-like pattern, R(k).\n\nThus, we have shown that the midpoint values, M(k), are symmetric with respect to the random walk-like pattern, R(k), as you observed. This symmetry is due to the fact that the midpoint values correspond to the centers of the cornu spirals, which in turn are determined by the Nyquist frequencies of the zeta function.",
