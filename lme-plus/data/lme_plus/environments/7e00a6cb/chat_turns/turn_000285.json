Can you please tell me what your favorite show is that you've been binge-watching for weeks? That way, I can get a sense of your taste in genres, tone, and style, and recommend something similar.\n\nIs it a drama, comedy, sci-fi, fantasy, or something else? Is it a light-hearted, feel-good show or a more intense, thought-provoking one?\n\nLet me know, and I'll do my best to suggest some TV shows that might scratch that same itch!",
