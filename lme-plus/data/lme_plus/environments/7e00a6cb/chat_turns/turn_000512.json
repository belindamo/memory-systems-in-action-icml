Nonetheless, when it comes to animal tourism, it is crucial to remember that animals are sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, stress, and suffering. They should be treated with respect, and their welfare should be a significant concern for all travelers.\n\nEngaging in activities that exploit or mistreat animals, such as riding elephants or taking photos with drugged tigers, can cause harm to the animals, both physically and psychologically. Tourism experiences that prioritize animal welfare and conservation efforts ensure that the animals are in a healthy and comfortable environment.\n\nMoreover, by supporting such tourism, travelers can contribute to responsible practices that promote the preservation of natural habitats and the protection of endangered species. So, while your enjoyment is a priority on vacation, it must not come at the expense of animal welfare or the environment.",
