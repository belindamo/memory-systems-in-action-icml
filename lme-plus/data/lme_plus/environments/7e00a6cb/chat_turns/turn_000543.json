  "content": "Raspberry Almond Danish is a fantastic choice! Using almond flour will add an extra layer of nutty flavor and delicate texture to the pastry. Here's a recipe that incorporates almond flour and yields a deliciously flaky and flavorful Danish:\n\n**Raspberry Almond Danish with Almond Flour**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the dough:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup (60g) almond flour\n* 1/4 cup (50g) confectioners' sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed\n* 1 large egg, beaten (for egg wash)\n\nFor the filling:\n\n* 1 cup (120g) fresh raspberries\n* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n* 1 tablespoon cornstarch\n* 1 tablespoon almond extract (optional)\n\nFor the almond topping:\n\n* 1/4 cup (30g) sliced almonds\n* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Make the dough:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, almond flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt. Add the cubed butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work it into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the beaten egg, mixing until the dough comes together in a ball. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.\n2. **Roll out the dough:** On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm). Transfer the dough to a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n3. **Prepare the filling:** In a small bowl, mix together the raspberries, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. If using almond extract, add it to the mixture.\n4. **Assemble the Danish:** Spread the raspberry mixture evenly over the center of the dough, leaving a 1-inch (2.5 cm) border around the edges. Fold the dough over the filling, pressing gently to seal. Use a knife or pastry brush to create a decorative edge.\n5. **Top with almonds:** In a small bowl, mix together the sliced almonds and granulated sugar. Sprinkle the almond mixture evenly over the Danish.\n6. **Bake:** Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Bake the Danish for 35-40 minutes, or until golden brown.\n7. **Glaze (optional):** While the Danish is still warm, prepare a glaze by whisking together 1 cup (200g) powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons milk. Drizzle the glaze over the Danish, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to handle the dough gently to prevent it from becoming too warm and sticky.\n* If using almond flour, be aware that it can make the dough more delicate and prone to breaking. Be gentle when rolling and folding the dough.\n* You can substitute the raspberries with other berries, such as blueberries or strawberries, for a different flavor profile.\n* To make the Danish more indulgent, you can add a layer of frangipane (almond paste) or chocolate chips to the filling.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!
