  "content": "I'm happy to help, but I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal knowledge of David and Michael, nor do I have any information about their preferences or interests. I can only provide general advice based on the games I previously recommended.\n\nIf you've been hanging out with David and Michael more frequently, you might have a better sense of their interests and preferences. Consider asking yourself:\n\n* Are they competitive or do they prefer cooperative games?\n* Do they enjoy strategy and complexity or do they prefer simpler, more casual games?\n* Are they fans of humor and silly games or do they prefer more serious, thought-provoking experiences?\n\nBased on your knowledge of David and Michael, you can choose games that align with their interests and preferences. If you're still unsure, you could consider asking them directly or suggesting a few options and seeing which ones they're most interested in.\n\nRemember, the goal of game night is to have fun and socialize with friends, so choose games that will create a enjoyable and engaging experience for everyone involved!",
