  "content": "Russia and Japan never officially declared war on each other during World War II, but they did have a number of conflicts in the region, including the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945 and the Soviet-Japanese War of 1945. The two countries did not establish diplomatic relations until 1956, when the Soviet Union and Japan signed the Joint Declaration of 1956, which formally ended the state of war between the two countries. The declaration also provided for the exchange of diplomats and the establishment of cultural and economic ties.",
