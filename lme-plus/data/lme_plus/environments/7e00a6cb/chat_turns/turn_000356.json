Do you have any specific meals or recipes in mind that you want to make, or are you just looking to restock your pantry and fridge with essentials?\n\nAlso, congratulations on accumulating 1,500 points on the Fetch Rewards app! That's a great way to earn some extra cash or rewards on your grocery purchases.\n\nOnce I have a better idea of what you need to buy, I can help you create a list and even provide some suggestions on how to maximize your Fetch Rewards points.",
