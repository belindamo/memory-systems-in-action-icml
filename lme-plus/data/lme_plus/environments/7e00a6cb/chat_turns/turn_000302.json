It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. I've also been considering sharing my readings with my doctor at my next appointment to get her input on my progress.\n\nBy the way, I'm also happy to report that my humidifier has been helping with my sinus issues. I've noticed that I've been sleeping much better since I started using it about a month ago.",
