The most important thing is to choose a heavy cream and cheddar cheese that you enjoy and that fit your taste preferences.\n\nRemember, for the creamy tomato soup, you'll want to look for a high-fat heavy cream (around 36% or higher) to get that rich and creamy texture. For the grilled cheese, a sharp cheddar with a good melting point will help create that perfect gooey, cheesy goodness.",
