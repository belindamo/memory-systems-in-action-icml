Here are some popular bread options for grilled cheese:\n\n1. **White Bread**: Classic white bread is a timeless choice for grilled cheese. It's soft, light, and won't overpower the cheese. Look for a high-quality, fresh white bread with a tender crumb.\n2. **Sourdough**: Sourdough bread adds a tangy, slightly sour flavor and a chewy texture that pairs well with the richness of the cheese. Its denser texture also helps hold the cheese and filling in place.\n3. **Whole Wheat**: Whole wheat bread adds a nuttier flavor and a slightly denser texture than white bread. It's a great option if you want a slightly healthier grilled cheese.\n4. **Baguette**: A crusty baguette can add a nice texture contrast to your grilled cheese. Look for a day-old baguette to get the best results.\n5. **Challah**: Challah bread has a rich, buttery flavor and a soft, fluffy texture that works beautifully with grilled cheese.\n6. **Texas Toast**: Texas toast is a type of white bread that's perfect for grilled cheese. It's soft, light, and has a slightly crispy crust that adds texture.\n\nFor a mozzarella and Monterey Jack grilled cheese, I'd recommend using a white bread or a sourdough bread. Both will provide a nice neutral flavor that won't overpower the cheese.\n\nIf you want to get fancy, you could try using a brioche or a ciabatta bread for a more artisanal twist. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time and temperature accordingly, as these breads might have a denser texture.\n\nNow, go forth and grill that cheese!",
