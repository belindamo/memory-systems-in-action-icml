Movies such as iRobot and Wall-E sparked my imagination and fuelled my curiosity about the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence and my passion and interest only grew stronger as I grew older. Rather than a fantasy I saw possibilities. However, it wasn\u2019t until a 20 day study camp at the MS Swaminathan research Foundation, a leading institution that researches in sustainable development and environmental stability, led by the Main architect of green revolution in India, Dr MS Swaminathan, I became acutely aware of the urgent need to address the environmental challenges facing the world today. I made the connection between AI and its potential applications for environmental sustainability. I resolved to combine my passion for AI with commitment to environmental sustainability to dedicate my life in a pursuit that ensures a better future for our planet. I have started thinking about various ways in which we can use AI to address environmental challenges such as pollution, climate change, destruction of ecosystems etc. For example robots that takes away plastic waste, or drones that can help monitor and manage ecosystems to identify early warning signs of degradation and/or damage. (\\*)So it became my ambition to be an AI researcher in one of the world\u2019s best robotics and autonomous systems research facility that aligns with my goals.\nAs AI was a new and emerging field in India in 2010 with limited specialised bachelor\u2019s degree courses, so I pursued a computer science degree which I completed with a distinction. (I wanted to) (Despite wanting to further my education) (but didn\u2019t have the resources to do so at that time) Due to the lack of resources at that time I was not able to pursue a Master\u2019s in AI. Hence, I joined IBM where I had the opportunity to take up additional AI projects, honing my technical skills and gain real world experience in the field. I continued to learn as much as I could about reinforcement learning and my project EXA(Expert Advice) was chosen as one of the top 10 projects in IBM Cognitive Build contest associated with IBM Watson. My focus became clearer and more defined so I quit my job at IBM to fully concentrate on deep learning, as I was only doing AI partially. My shear perseverance, tenacity and months of hard work enabled be to land a job in Quinnox as full time AI engineer. I was able to ideate, create and deploy more than 30 deep learning models in production involving computer vision, NLP and Reinforcement learning during the past five years. I was also granted a patent in 2021 for one of the AI Algorithms I have developed (US11205041B2) which was a catalyst in believing my ability to create unique and innovative solutions. Eventhough I was promoted and well paid(as per Indian standards) \nMy objective became more refined and lucid when I was developing an autonomous agent, Rover, for my recent project. I realised multi agent and multi modal reinforcement learning interests me the most and would help me in achieving my dream of creating autonomous agents than can help in maintaining a sustainable planet. The dream became more of a goal now. Now I am at crossroads in my life and career. I look around and find that I have more resources and opportunities than I first started. So I feel like I owe it to myself and my younger self to pursue this next step that will take me closer to the goal. After my masters I would like to pursue a PhD to focus solely in field to be eligible to become the AI researcher in one of the top research centres for Robotics and Autonomous Systems.\nI have been following research and publications in multi agent and multimodal reinforcement learning and I came to know about the research by Dr. Stefano V Aldrich of University of Endiburgh and was intrigued by it as it aligns perfectly with what I wanted to do in AI. \nBeing a global leader in robotics and autonomous systems MSc in AI from the school of informatics, University of Edinburgh will be able to offer me the rich intellectual environment to become an expert in the field of AI with its state of the art facilities and will provide me with opportunities to get guidance from world class researchers. Also I will be able to connect and collaborate with like minded peers and researchers and may even be able to form life long friendships. University of Edinburgh School of Informatics with CISA, ANC and IPAB will provide me with opportunities for personal and professional growth that may not be available elsewhere. Also I would like to publish papers in peer reviewed Ai conferences such as NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML, ICLR, ICCV etc. \nI always keep a growth mindset and is a continuous learner. I have made several contributions to open source software and maintains a blog. I give back to the developer community with my skills in Python, Pytorch and tensorflow and my answers in stack overflow had reached more than 1.4 million people world wide. As an IEEE and ACM volunteer, I was able to host and participate I many events associated with the same. My contributions in my current organisation have taken ideas to fully fledged products used by dozens of clients. I am a Python and Pytorch verified expert as certified by Pluralsight, I also have experience in Android apps using flutter. I use reinforcement learning to automate games like Asphalt during my personal time.I have more than 8 years of hands on experience in developing AI solutions. For instance I have developed a multimodal Rl agent that can navigate through apps on its own taking visual and textual inputs.\nI have a unique combination of academic background, practical experience and perspective that I believe will make me a strong candidate for the MSc in AI program at University of Edinburgh. My undergraduate degree in computer science has given me string foundation in programming algorithms and data structures. \nMy passion and commitment to develop robots that can maintain environmental stability is something I believe sets me apart. I have a strong academic background in computer science with a bachelors degree from a leading institution. Over the past few years I have focused my attention on how Ai can be applied to tackle environmental challenges. \nMy passion for the environment has been lifelong and I believe that AI and robotics have the potential to be powerful tools in addressing some of the most pressing environmental issues we face today. I am particularly interested in the development of agents that can aid in tasks such a monitoring and cleaning pollution, mitigating the impact of climate change and preserving biodiversity.\nTo pursue my goals I have worked on a variety of projects related to AI and Environment. For example I developed a deep learning model that can detect plastic waste from aerial images with an accuracy above 85%. I have also explored the use of RL in developing algorithms for controlling autonomous vehicles that can help cleaning up pollution.\nIn the MSc in AI program, I hope to further develop my skills and knowledge in areas such as robotics, computer vision and reinforcement learning as well as explore new areas such as multi agent autonomous systems. \nI am excited to work with faculty and fellow students who share my passion for using AI to address environmental challenges and to develop innovative solutions that can have a positive impact on our planet. I believe My academic background, technical skills and passion for the environment makes me a unique candidate for MSc at University of Edinburgh\u2019s School of Informatics."
