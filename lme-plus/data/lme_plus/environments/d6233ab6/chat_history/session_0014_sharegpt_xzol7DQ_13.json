      "content": "CDP's climate disclosure framework is a voluntary reporting framework that focuses specifically on climate-related risks and opportunities. It is not listed in the table above as it is not a framework developed or mandated by a regulatory body. However, CDP's framework can be used in conjunction with other reporting frameworks, such as GRI, SASB, TCFD, and IR, to provide more comprehensive reporting on an organization's climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities.\n\nCDP's climate disclosure framework is also aligned with the TCFD recommendations and can help organizations provide more detailed and standardized information on their climate risks and opportunities, which can be useful for investors, stakeholders, and decision-makers. In this sense, CDP's framework can be seen as complementary to the frameworks listed in the table above, as it provides a more focused approach to climate-related reporting."

      "content": "The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) proposes a new standardized reporting format for sustainability information to be included in annual reports. The proposed format is based on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), which is already used for financial reporting in the EU. The ESEF format requires companies to use Inline XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) when preparing their annual reports. XBRL is a global standard for exchanging business information and has been widely adopted for financial reporting.\n\nThe proposed format for sustainability reporting under the CSRD aims to make sustainability information more comparable and accessible for investors and stakeholders, while also reducing the reporting burden on companies by using the same format for both financial and sustainability information. The specific details of the new format, such as the data points and disclosure requirements, are still being developed and will be subject to further consultation and review. The format is expected to be introduced in 2024, with reporting required from 2026 onwards."

      "content": "The Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) does not prescribe a particular format for reporting. Instead, it requires companies to report relevant non-financial information in their management reports or in a separate sustainability report. The information to be disclosed includes a description of the company's business model, policies, outcomes, risks, and impacts related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, as well as information on the diversity policy applied in relation to the company's management and supervisory bodies.\n\nHowever, the European Commission has encouraged the use of internationally recognized reporting frameworks and standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), to ensure that the information disclosed is relevant, reliable, and comparable. These frameworks provide guidance on how to report non-financial information in a structured and consistent manner, but they do not prescribe a specific format for reporting.\n\nTherefore, while there is no mandatory reporting format under the NFRD, companies are encouraged to use recognized reporting frameworks and standards to improve the quality and comparability of their non-financial reporting."

      "content": "The Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) applies to large companies that are public-interest entities with more than 500 employees and that have a balance sheet total of over \u20ac20 million, or a net turnover of over \u20ac40 million. Public-interest entities are defined as companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the European Union, credit institutions, and insurance undertakings.\n\nIn addition, member states of the EU have the option to extend the scope of the NFRD to cover more companies or to require additional reporting requirements for the companies that fall under the scope of the directive.\n\nIt is worth noting that the EU is currently revising the NFRD with the aim of improving the quality, consistency, and comparability of non-financial reporting. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) would expand the scope of the reporting requirement to cover all large companies operating in the EU, regardless of whether they are listed or not. The CSRD is expected to be adopted in 2022 and will apply to reporting periods starting on or after January 1, 2024."
