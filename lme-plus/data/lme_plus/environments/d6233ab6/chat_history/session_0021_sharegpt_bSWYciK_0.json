      "content": "Yes, this phenomenon is common and well-known. It's called the incubation period and it refers to the process of unconsciously working on a problem in your mind, even when you are not actively thinking about it. During this time, your brain is still processing information and making connections, which can lead to the breakthrough you experience when you wake up or fall asleep. This is a normal part of the problem-solving process and is often referred to as \"sleeping on it.\""

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "There may not be a significant difference between finding a solution before falling asleep or upon waking up, as both instances are part of the incubation period. During this period, your brain continues to work on the problem, even when you're not actively thinking about it. The idea is that by letting your mind relax and wander, it can make new connections and find solutions that you may not have thought of while actively working on the problem. So whether it's before falling asleep or upon waking up, your brain has had time to incubate and process the information, leading to potential solutions."
