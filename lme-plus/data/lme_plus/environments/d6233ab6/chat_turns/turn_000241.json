  "content": "There has been some progress in increasing the representation of underrepresented groups in the faculty and staff at Catholic University of America due to these steps. For instance, in 2017, the university reported that the percentage of faculty members from underrepresented minority groups had increased from 6% to 13% over the previous ten years. The university has also reported a similar increase for staff members from underrepresented minority groups. \n\nThe university tracks its progress in increasing diversity and reports it publicly through its annual Diversity and Inclusion Report. The report provides information on the representation of underrepresented groups in the faculty, staff, and student body, as well as the university's progress on specific diversity and inclusion initiatives. The university's commitment to transparency enables stakeholders to monitor progress, identify areas of improvement, and hold the university accountable for its diversity objectives.",
