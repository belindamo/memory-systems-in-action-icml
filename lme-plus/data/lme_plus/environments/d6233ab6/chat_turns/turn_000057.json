  "content": "Yes, there have been some measurable impacts of the efforts being made to improve public education in Houston:\n\n1. Funding: In 2019, Texas lawmakers passed a school finance reform bill that increased funding for public education by $6.5 billion. This increase in funding is aimed at improving teacher pay, providing full-day pre-K for eligible families, and supporting low-income students.\n\n2. Achievement Gap: There has been some progress in closing the achievement gap in Houston. In the 2018-2019 school year, there was a 1% decrease in the achievement gap between white and Hispanic students and a 2% decrease in the gap between white and Black students compared to the previous year.\n\n3. Bilingual Education: Houston Independent School District's bilingual education program has been recognized for its success in improving academic outcomes for English Language Learners. In 2018, the district had a 94% graduation rate among English Language Learners, compared to a statewide rate of 67%.\n\n4. Alternative Certification Programs: Alternative certification programs have helped to address the teacher shortage in Houston. In the 2018-2019 school year, the Houston Independent School District hired over 2,000 new teachers through alternative certification programs.\n\nWhile there is still work to be done, these measurable impacts suggest that the efforts being made to improve public education in Houston are having a positive effect.",
