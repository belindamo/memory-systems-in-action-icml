Here are some tips to help you work with cotton lawn like a pro:\n\n**Preventing Fraying:**\n\n1. **Use a sharp rotary cutter and mat:** A sharp cutter and mat will help you make clean cuts, reducing the risk of fraying.\n2. **Cut on the grain:** Always cut your fabric on the grain line (parallel to the warp threads) to minimize fraying.\n3. **Use a walking foot or Teflon foot:** These specialized feet can help guide the fabric smoothly and prevent bunching or dragging, which can cause fraying.\n4. **Use a 1/4\" seam allowance:** A narrower seam allowance will reduce the amount of fabric that's prone to fraying.\n5. **Pink or clip seams:** Use pinking shears or clip the seam allowance at an angle to prevent fraying. This is especially important for curved seams.\n\n**Finishing Seams:**\n\n1. **Press, press, press:** Pressing your seams as you go will help reduce bulk and prevent fraying. Use a hot iron and steam to set the seams.\n2. **Use a serger or overlock machine:** If you have a serger or overlock machine, use it to finish your seams. This will enclose the raw edges and prevent fraying.\n3. **Use a zigzag stitch:** If you don't have a serger, use a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine to finish the seam allowance. This will help prevent fraying and give a clean finish.\n4. ** Bind seams with bias tape:** For a more decorative finish, use bias tape to bind the seams. This will add a pop of color and prevent fraying.\n5. **Topstitch:** Topstitching your seams can help reinforce the fabric and prevent fraying. Use a contrasting thread color to create a decorative effect.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use a cotton lawn-specific needle:** A sharp, cotton lawn-specific needle will help prevent skipped stitches and fabric damage.\n2. **Use a shorter stitch length:** A shorter stitch length will help prevent the fabric from bunching up or dragging, which can cause fraying.\n3. **Don't pull or stretch the fabric:** Cotton lawn can be prone to distortion, so avoid pulling or stretching the fabric as you sew.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to work with cotton lawn confidently and achieve a beautiful, professional-looking finish for your summer top.\n\nHappy sewing!",
