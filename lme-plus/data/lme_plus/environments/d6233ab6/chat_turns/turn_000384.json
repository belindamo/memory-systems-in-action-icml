  "content": "I do not have information on exactly when the slaves inherited by Martha Washington were completely freed. However, it is worth noting that the legal process for freeing slaves was complex and often required going to court, which could be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, Martha Washington passed away in 1802 and at that time, many states had laws that required freed slaves to leave the state within a certain period of time, or they could be re-enslaved. It is also possible that some of the slaves inherited by Martha were freed gradually over time, or that they were freed in accordance with the terms of her will. However, I do not have the exact information on this specific case.",
