  "content": "It appears that the three web search results provided are not related to a single topic, and therefore cannot be added to a single \"open seamless part.\"\n\n1. The first search result is from the PubChem website, and it discusses the recent review of elements 113, 115, 117 and 118 by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the decision to give them official names and symbols. The article also discusses how atomic weights have changed over time. [[1](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/periodic-table/)]\n2. The second search result is from the Envato Elements website, and it offers a collection of 115 seamless pattern add-ons that can be downloaded unlimited times with a subscription. These add-ons are designed by independent designers. [[2](https://elements.envato.com/add-ons/seamless+pattern)]\n3. The third search result is from the SeamlessDocs website, and it describes several \"Specialty Elements\" that can be added to a document using their platform. These elements include a select menu, image, and whiteout feature. [[3](https://help.seamlessdocs.com/en/articles/4242338-elements-unique-to-seamlessdocs)]\n\nIt seems that the provided search results are not related to each other, hence they cannot be added to a single \"open seamless part.\" Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?",
