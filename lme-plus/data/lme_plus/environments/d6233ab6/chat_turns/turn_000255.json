It's a powerful, thought-provoking show with excellent performances.\n2. **Shrill** (Hulu): A comedy series based on Lindy West's memoir, starring Aidy Bryant as a woman who decides to improve her life and find her voice. It's a heartwarming, relatable show with great humor and a strong lead performance.\n3. **Ramy** (Hulu): A comedy-drama series that follows the life of a first-generation American Muslim living in New Jersey. It's a fresh, authentic take on the Muslim-American experience, with great writing and performances.\n4. **Catch-22** (Hulu): A miniseries based on Joseph Heller's novel, set during World War II. It's a dark comedy with a great cast, including George Clooney, Christopher Abbott, and Kyle Chandler.\n5. **Little Fires Everywhere** (Hulu): A drama series based on Celeste Ng's novel, exploring the complex relationships between mothers and daughters in a small Ohio town.
