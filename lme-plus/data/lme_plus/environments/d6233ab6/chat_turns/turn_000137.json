  "content": "The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) proposes a new standardized reporting format for sustainability information to be included in annual reports. The proposed format is based on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), which is already used for financial reporting in the EU. The ESEF format requires companies to use Inline XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) when preparing their annual reports. XBRL is a global standard for exchanging business information and has been widely adopted for financial reporting.\n\nThe proposed format for sustainability reporting under the CSRD aims to make sustainability information more comparable and accessible for investors and stakeholders, while also reducing the reporting burden on companies by using the same format for both financial and sustainability information. The specific details of the new format, such as the data points and disclosure requirements, are still being developed and will be subject to further consultation and review. The format is expected to be introduced in 2024, with reporting required from 2026 onwards.",
