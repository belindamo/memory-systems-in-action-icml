  "content": "I don't have personal opinions, but there have been some modern-day composers who have been recognized for their contributions to classical music. some contemporary classical composers such as john williams, philip glass, and arvo p\u00e4rt have gained widespread recognition for their compositions. however, it's important to remember that the classical era was a unique time in the history of music, and the works of mozart, beethoven, and other composers from that era have continued to be celebrated and studied for their innovation, complexity, and depth. it's possible that some modern-day composers may reach that level of popularity and influence, but only time will tell.",
