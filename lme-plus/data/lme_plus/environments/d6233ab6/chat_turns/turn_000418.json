  "content": "In Mandarin Chinese, most nouns do not change form to indicate plurals. Instead, plurals are typically indicated through context or the use of quantifiers.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n1. Context: If the noun is accompanied by a number, it is usually assumed to be plural. For example, 'li\u01ceng ge r\u00e9n' (\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba) means 'two people', which is clearly plural.\n\n2. Quantifiers: When referring to a quantity, Mandarin Chinese often uses quantifiers instead of a plural form. For example, 'y\u012b b\u011bn sh\u016b' (\u4e00\u672c\u4e66) means 'one book', while 'li\u01ceng b\u011bn sh\u016b' (\u4e24\u672c\u4e66) means 'two books'. \n\n3. Reduplication: Some nouns can be reduplicated to indicate plurality. For example, 'm\u0101ma' (\u5988\u5988) means 'mom', while 'm\u0101mama' (\u5988\u5988\u5988) means 'moms'.\n\n4. Measure words: Mandarin Chinese uses measure words to indicate the quantity of nouns. For example, 'y\u012b zh\u012b y\u00e1' (\u4e00\u53ea\u9e2d) means 'one duck', and 'li\u01ceng zh\u012b y\u00e1' (\u4e24\u53ea\u9e2d) means 'two ducks'. \n\nOverall, Mandarin Chinese does not have strict rules for forming plurals, and plurals are usually indicated through context, quantifiers, reduplication, or measure words.",
