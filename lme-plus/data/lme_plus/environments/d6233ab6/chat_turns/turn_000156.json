  "content": "I think I'll go with the Traditional Elegance font pairing idea. Times New Roman is a classic serif font that will provide good contrast with the Lobster Script font for the quote. I'll use a font size of 18 points for the title and 12 points for the quote, and I'll choose a black font color to provide good contrast with the white background. I'll also leave some whitespace around the title and quote to create a clean and uncluttered design.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the layout of the album. I want to include a mix of photos, journaling, and memorabilia to make it more interesting and engaging. Can you suggest some layout ideas for the inside pages of the album?",
