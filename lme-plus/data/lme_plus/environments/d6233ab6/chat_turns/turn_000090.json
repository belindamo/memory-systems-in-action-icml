  "content": "As the people of Megapolis went about the task of rebuilding their city, Ao Lie noticed Wukong and Macaque making preparations to leave. He quickly ran towards them, especially Macaque.\n\n\"Hey, where are you guys going?\" asked Ao Lie.\n\nMacaque turned towards him with a smile. \"We have to go back home, to Flower-Fruit Mountain.\"\n\n\"But you can't leave yet,\" said Ao Lie. \"There's still so much to do here, and I don't want you to leave so soon. And Macaque, I... I feel like we have a connection. I don't want to lose that.\"\n\nMacaque put his hand on Ao Lie's shoulder. \"We'll be back, don't worry. And you're always welcome on Flower-Fruit Mountain.\"\n\nWukong added, \"Yes, you're one of us now. You helped us defeat Spider Queen and free our people. We're proud of you.\"\n\nAo Lie felt a warm sense of belonging flood through him. \"Thank you. I'm glad I could help.\"\n\nMacaque handed him a small jade pendant. \"Take this as a token of our friendship. It will bring you good fortune.\"\n\nAo Lie took the pendant and felt the weight of its significance. \"I'll treasure it always.\"\n\nWukong spoke up again. \"We have to go now. But we'll be back, and you'll come visit us too, won't you?\"\n\nAo Lie nodded, feeling a sense of hopefulness. \"Yes, I'll come visit you. And I'll keep fighting for our freedom here, until you come back.\"\n\nWith a final wave, Wukong and Macaque left, disappearing into the distance. Ao Lie watched them go with a mixture of sadness and gratitude. He had found a new family and a sense of purpose he never knew existed, and he knew that they would meet again soon.",
