Katz and Jerry A. Fodor (1963)\nIn the 1960s, the work of Jerrold J. Katz and Jerry A. Fodor marked a significant shift in the study of lexical semantics. Their book, \"The Structure of Language\" (1963), introduced componential analysis, a method for decomposing word meanings into basic, atomic semantic features. This approach aimed to capture the underlying structure of lexical concepts and marked the beginning of formal semantics.",
