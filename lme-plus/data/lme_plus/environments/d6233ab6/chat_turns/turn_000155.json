Here are some font pairing ideas for the title and quote that might work well for your grandma's memory album:\n\n1. **Traditional Elegance:**\n\t* Title font: Times New Roman (or a similar serif font like Garamond or Georgia)\n\t* Quote font: Lobster Script (or a similar script font like Pacifico or Carolyna Pro)\n2. **Classic Contrast:**\n\t* Title font: Arial Black (or a similar bold serif font like Franklin Gothic or Bodoni)\n\t* Quote font: Lucida Handwriting (or a similar script font like Brush Script or Kunstler Script)\n3. **Sophisticated Pairing:**\n\t* Title font: Garamond (or a similar serif font like Bodoni or Didot)\n\t* Quote font: Alex Brush (or a similar script font like Great Vibes or Ostrich Sans)\n4. **Elegant Harmony:**\n\t* Title font: Georgia (or a similar serif font like Times New Roman or Cambria)\n\t* Quote font: Dancing Script (or a similar script font like Pacifico or Carolyna Pro)\n\nRemember, the key is to choose a bold, serif font for the title that provides good contrast with the smaller, script font used for the quote. You can also experiment with different font sizes, colors, and arrangements to find the perfect balance for your title page.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a font size that's easy to read, especially for the quote. A font size between 12-18 points should work well.\n* Choose a font color that complements the photo of your grandma and the overall design. Black or dark gray are safe choices, but you can also experiment with other colors that match your grandma's personality or favorite colors.\n* Make sure to leave some whitespace around the title and quote to create a clean and uncluttered design. You can adjust the font sizes and spacing to achieve a balanced look.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you create a beautiful title page for your grandma's memory album!",
