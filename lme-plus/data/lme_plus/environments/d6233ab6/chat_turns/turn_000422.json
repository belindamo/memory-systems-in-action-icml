  "content": "I understand that it can be challenging to adjust to a language where forming plurals is not as straightforward as in English. However, please note that many languages function differently from English, and it is necessary to appreciate and acknowledge linguistic differences. Plural formation is not an arbitrary concept as it is based on context, quantifiers, reduplication, or measure words, and once you understand how these rules work in Mandarin Chinese, it becomes easier to apply them in practice. Additionally, investing time and effort into learning Mandarin Chinese can be rewarding and opens up new opportunities for communication, cultural understanding, and personal development.",
