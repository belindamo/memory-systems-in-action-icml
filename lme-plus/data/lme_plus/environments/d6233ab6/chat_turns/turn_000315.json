Both cotton and linen are excellent choices, and you can't go wrong with either one. Here are some tips to help you choose the perfect fabric from your stash:\n\n**Cotton:**\n\n* Look for cotton fabrics with a loose weave or a cotton lawn fabric, which will provide a soft, smooth texture and good drape.\n* Avoid thick or dense cotton fabrics, as they might be too hot and heavy for a summer top.\n* Cotton voile or cotton gauze are great options for a lightweight, airy feel.\n* If you have a cotton fabric with a fun print or color, go for it! A simple T-shirt or tank top is a great way to showcase a bold design.\n\n**Linen:**\n\n* Linen is a natural, breathable fabric that's perfect for warm weather.\n* Look for a lightweight linen fabric with a loose weave, which will provide a comfortable, airy feel.\n* Linen can wrinkle easily, so consider a linen blend (e.g., 80% linen, 20% cotton) for a slightly easier care.\n* Linen is a great choice for a more structured top, like a tank top with a bit of shape.\n\nOther fabric considerations:\n\n* **Weight:** Aim for a fabric with a weight around 4-6 oz (110-170 gsm). This will provide a comfortable, lightweight feel without being too thin or transparent.\n* **Stretch:** If you want a more fitted top, look for a fabric with a bit of stretch, like cotton-poly blends or T-shirt knit fabrics.\n* **Care:** Consider the care instructions for your fabric. If you want a low-maintenance top, choose a fabric that can be machine washed and dried.\n\nSome popular cotton and linen fabric brands for summer tops include:\n\n* Cotton: Robert Kaufman, Art Gallery Fabrics, and FreeSpirit Fabrics\n* Linen: Kaufman Essex Linen, Robert Kaufman Linen, and European Linen\n\nBefore cutting into your fabric, make sure to:\n\n* Wash and dry the fabric to pre-shrink it and remove any excess dye.\n* Iron the fabric to remove wrinkles and creases.\n* Check the fabric's grain line to ensure you're cutting your pattern pieces accurately.\n\nNow, pick your favorite fabric, and get started on your summer top project!",
