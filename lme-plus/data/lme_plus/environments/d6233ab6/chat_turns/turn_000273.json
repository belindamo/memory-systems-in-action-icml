Start small: Choose a small cleaning task, like making the bed or wiping down the kitchen counters, to get started. Once you've completed the task, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment and may be more motivated to tackle bigger tasks.\n\n2. Create a motivation playlist: Listen to energetic or uplifting music that pumps you up and gets you moving. You can even use music as a timer and clean for an entire song or two.\n\n3. Use a cleaning game: Challenge yourself to see how quickly you can clean a room, or compete with a family member or friend to see who can clean the most items in a certain amount of time.\n\n4. Set a timer: Set a timer for a certain amount of time, such as 15 or 20 minutes. See how much you can accomplish during that time, and if you're still not feeling motivated after the timer goes off, take a break and come back to it later.\n\n5. Think about the benefits: Remind yourself how good it feels to have a clean and organized space. Envision how you'll feel once the task is done. This can help you regain motivation and focus on the task at hand.\n\nRemember, the hardest part is often just getting started. Once you start cleaning, it may be easier to keep going. Be patient with yourself and don't feel guilty for needing breaks or taking your time.",
