One important thing to consider is budgeting for your shopping spree ahead of time, so you don't overspend and undo your cleaning efforts. You could also consider setting specific cleaning goals to achieve each week or accumulate points for each completed task, and once you reach a certain point total, you can reward yourself with a shopping spree.
