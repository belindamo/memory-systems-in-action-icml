I've had an intense conversation with my partner about our beliefs on relationships and commitment, and I realized that my beliefs have been shaped by societal expectations and cultural norms, rather than my own values and desires. I want to be more vulnerable in my relationship, but I'm not sure how to start. Can you give me some specific examples of how I can practice vulnerability with my partner?",
