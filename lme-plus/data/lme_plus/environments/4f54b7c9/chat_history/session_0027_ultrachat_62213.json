Learning a new language can also be an immersive experience, as you can listen to music or watch movies in the language you're learning, and practice speaking with native speakers. As you progress and become more confident, you may find it easier to achieve flow in the language learning process. So, if you're interested in learning a new language, I would definitely encourage you to give it a try! It could end up being a very fulfilling and enjoyable way to achieve flow."
