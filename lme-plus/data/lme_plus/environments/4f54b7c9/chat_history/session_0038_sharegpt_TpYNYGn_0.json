      "content": "1. The political arena in America is a challenging environment and requires a strategic approach to navigate successfully. The progressive/woke wave has become a significant force in shaping public opinion and shaping the discourse. This wave cannot be ignored, and it is imperative to adapt to current progressive understandings if one wants to succeed in the political arena.\n2. The author suggests that instead of resisting the progressive/woke wave, it is better to surf on it and place oneself on the \"right\" side of the equation. This means embracing the progressive values and understanding that the Jewish/Israel issue is just one of many important issues that must be addressed in a nuanced and inclusive manner. By aligning with the progressive values, one can effectively communicate the Jewish/Israel issue in a way that resonates with a wider audience.\n3. The author emphasizes the importance of adapting to the progressive values and not challenging ideas that are bigger than the Jewish/Israel issue. Challenging these ideas can result in resistance and a significant loss of support. By embracing the progressive values and adapting to the current understandings, one can build bridges and find common ground with those who may not share the same views. This approach can lead to a more inclusive and effective political strategy, and help to achieve the desired outcome for the Jewish/Israel issue."
