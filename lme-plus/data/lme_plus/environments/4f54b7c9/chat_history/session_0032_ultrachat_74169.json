      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the latest information on credit card eligibility criteria. However, here are some common factors that may affect eligibility:\n\n1. Income Requirements: Credit card companies typically require a minimum income level for approval of their cards. The income requirement varies depending on the card issuer and type of credit card, but typically a higher income means better card options.\n\n2. Credit Score: The credit score is a significant factor that credit card companies use to evaluate an applicant's creditworthiness. Generally, the higher the credit score, the better the chances of getting approved for a credit card. The credit score requirements differ depending on the type of credit card.\n\n3. Employment Status: Being employed can impact eligibility for certain credit cards since it shows a regular source of income. If an applicant is self-employed or unemployed, it can be more challenging to get approval for some credit cards.\n\n4. Credit History: A person's credit history, which includes their credit scores, payment history, and credit utilization, plays a crucial role in determining eligibility for credit cards. A good credit history could mean having more credit card options to choose from.\n\n5. Age: Most credit cards have a minimum age requirement for eligibility. It can vary from 18 to 21 years old, depending on the issuer and type.\n\nIt's important to note that credit card companies may also use unique criteria to determine eligibility for specific cards, so it's always best for an individual to check the card issuer's guidelines and requirements before applying for a credit card."

It would be best to check directly with the credit card companies' websites or customer service representatives to see which cards have the lowest income requirements. You can also try using financial comparison websites or credit card eligibility checkers to compare different credit cards and their eligibility requirements. However, keep in mind that meeting the income requirement is just one of the factors considered by credit card companies when assessing eligibility, so there may be other criteria that you need to meet to get approved for a card."
