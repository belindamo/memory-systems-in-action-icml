      "content": "Design System Component: App Bars Dynamic Island\n\nWhen to Use:\n\n* Use this component when you want to create a navigation bar that is fixed to the top or bottom of the screen, and can expand or collapse to show more options.\n* Use this component in mobile or web applications where there is a need for a dynamic navigation bar that adapts to the user's needs.\n\nAnatomy:\n\n* The App Bars Dynamic Island component consists of a fixed navigation bar at the top or bottom of the screen.\n* The navigation bar can have a logo, a title, and one or more options (e.g. buttons, links, etc.).\n* When the user taps or clicks on an option, the navigation bar can expand to show more options.\n\nPlacement:\n\n* The App Bars Dynamic Island component should be placed at the top or bottom of the screen, depending on the design and user experience requirements.\n* The component should be fixed in place so that it is always visible when the user scrolls the content.\n\nContent:\n\n* The App Bars Dynamic Island component should have a clear and concise title that describes the purpose of the app or the current screen.\n* The navigation options should be clearly labeled and easy to understand.\n* The navigation options should be grouped into logical categories, with the most important options placed prominently.\n\nBehaviors with States and Interactions:\n\n* The App Bars Dynamic Island component should have a default state where the navigation bar is collapsed and only the most important options are visible.\n* When the user taps or clicks on an option, the navigation bar should expand to show more options.\n* When the user taps or clicks on an option, the app should navigate to the corresponding screen or take the appropriate action.\n* When the user scrolls the content, the navigation bar should remain fixed in place.\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. <https://material.io/components/app-bars-top/>\n2. <https://uxdesign.cc/designing-better-navigation-bar-on-mobile-d37a501655f2>\n3. <https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/app-navigation-design-patterns/>\n\nNote: The links are not actual links, you can use them as a reference and search for similar articles or resources on the topic."

      "content": "Additional considerations:\n\n* The App Bars Dynamic Island component should be designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.\n* The component should have a consistent design and behavior across all screens and contexts where it is used.\n* The component should be accessible, ensuring that all navigation options can be accessed by keyboard and screen reader users.\n* The component should be easy to customize, allowing developers to change the color, typography, and other design elements to match the overall style of the app.\n* The component should be easy to integrate, providing clear and concise documentation for developers on how to implement and use the component.\n* The component should be well tested, ensuring that it works correctly and consistently across all supported browsers and devices.\n\nIn conclusion, the App Bars Dynamic Island component is a powerful and versatile navigation tool that can improve the user experience of mobile and web applications. By following the best practices and considerations outlined above, designers and developers can create an effective and intuitive navigation bar that adapts to the user's needs and enhances the overall usability and accessibility of the app."

The actual design may vary depending on the specific requirements and style of the app. The color tokens are place holders and should be changed accordingly to the design system.\n\nIn the table above, for each element (Navigation Bar, Option), the state (Default, Hover, Active, Focus, Disabled) is described. For each state, the property that changes (background, text color, border), and the color token (hex, RGB or color name) that corresponds to the element and state. For example, when the Navigation Bar is in its default state, the background color is primary. When an option is in hover state, the text color is secondary."
