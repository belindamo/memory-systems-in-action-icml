Sorting through souvenirs and mementos from your trip can be a fun and nostalgic experience. Here are some suggestions to help you declutter and organize your desk and bag:\n\n**Desk Organization**\n\n1. **Clear everything off**: Start by clearing everything off your desk, including papers, pens, and other items. This will give you a clean slate to work with.\n2. **Categorize and group**: Group similar items together, such as papers to file, items to throw away, and items to keep on your desk.\n3. **Assign a home**: Assign a home for each item on your desk. This means designating a specific spot for your pens, papers, and other items.\n4. **Use storage containers**: Use storage containers or bins to keep items like paper clips, pushpins, and other small items organized and out of sight.\n5. **Create a \"to-do\" station**: Create a \"to-do\" station on your desk with a notebook, pen, and any other items you need to stay on top of tasks.\n\n**Bag Organization**\n\n1. **Empty your bag**: Empty your bag completely and sort items into categories, such as clothes, souvenirs, and miscellaneous items.\n2. **Purge unnecessary items**: Get rid of any items that are broken, unnecessary, or no longer useful.\n3. **Organize by category**: Organize your items by category, such as keeping all your clothes together, all your souvenirs together, and so on.\n4. **Use packing cubes or pouches**: Use packing cubes or pouches to keep items like socks, underwear, and accessories organized and easy to find.\n5. **Keep frequently used items accessible**: Keep frequently used items, like your wallet and phone, in easy-to-reach pockets or compartments.\n\n**Souvenir Organization**\n\n1. **Sort and categorize**: Sort your souvenirs into categories, such as items to display, items to store, and items to give away.\n2. **Display meaningful items**: Display a few meaningful souvenirs, such as a favorite photo or a special memento, in a place of pride.\n3. **Store items safely**: Store items that you don't want to display in a safe and dry place, such as a storage bin or a memory box.\n4. **Consider a shadow box**: Consider creating a shadow box or a collage to display multiple souvenirs together.\n\nRemember, decluttering and organizing is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Start with small areas and work your way up. Good luck, and have fun sorting through your souvenirs!",
