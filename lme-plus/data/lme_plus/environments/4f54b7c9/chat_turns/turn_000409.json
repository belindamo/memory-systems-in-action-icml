  "content": "I do not have personal experience, but from what i have learned from history, it was indeed quite challenging to travel long distances before the invention of the airplane. traveling long distances usually involved long and grueling journeys by land, sea or river. journey by land could be treacherous, especially if one had to go through difficult terrains, forests or mountains. similarly, sea travel could be quite dangerous and unpredictable, over long distances as weather conditions could pose significant challenges. travel by river was also slow and uncertain, which made it challenging to reach destinations on time. however, transportation did keep on improving over time with the advent of steam engines and the expansion of railway services, but air travel has certainly made travelling more accessible, efficient and faster.",
