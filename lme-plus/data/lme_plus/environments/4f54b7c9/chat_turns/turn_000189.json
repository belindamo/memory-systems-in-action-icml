Here are some suggestions to help you create a sleep-friendly environment:\n\n1. **Darkness**: Make your bedroom a dark cave. Darkness helps regulate your body's circadian rhythms, so invest in blackout curtains, blinds, or shades to block out any light from windows.\n2. **Quiet**: A quiet environment can help you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly. Consider using earplugs, white noise machines, or a fan to mask any background noise.\n3. **Cooler temperature**: A cooler bedroom can promote better sleep. Keep your bedroom temperature between 60\u00b0F and 67\u00b0F (15\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C) to create a sleep-conducive environment.\n4. **Comfortable bedding**: Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows to ensure a restful night's sleep.
