By the way, speaking of seasonal, I had a blast in December when I decorated my apartment with lights, garlands, and a Christmas tree, and even started a new tradition of making hot chocolate from scratch - it was such a cozy way to spend winter nights. Do you have any spring-inspired recipe suggestions?",
