  "content": "The back-EMF of an inductor fades over time because the magnetic field generated by the inductor decreases over time as the current decreases. The magnitude of the back-EMF is proportional to the rate of change of the current, so as the current decreases, the back-EMF decreases.\n\nOnce the current has reached a steady state and is no longer changing, the back-EMF disappears completely. At this point, the inductor behaves as a simple resistor, allowing the current to flow through it with minimal opposition.\n\nIt's worth noting that the time it takes for the back-EMF to fade depends on various factors, including the inductance of the coil, the resistance of the circuit, and the rate at which the current is changing. In general, the higher the inductance and the resistance, the longer it takes for the back-EMF to fade.",
