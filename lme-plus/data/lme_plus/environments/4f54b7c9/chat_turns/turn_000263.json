  "content": "Energy from a source like a capacitor can be transferred into a magnetic field through an inductor by passing a current through the inductor. When a voltage is applied across the capacitor, electric charge begins to flow through the inductor, creating a magnetic field around the coil. The energy stored in the electric field of the capacitor is transferred into the magnetic field of the inductor as the current flows.\n\nThe rate of energy transfer from the capacitor to the inductor depends on the value of the inductance and the rate of change of the current. The larger the inductance, the greater the back-EMF generated by the inductor and the more energy that is stored in the magnetic field. The faster the rate of change of the current, the greater the rate of energy transfer from the capacitor to the inductor.\n\nAs the current reaches a steady state, the rate of energy transfer from the capacitor to the inductor decreases and eventually stops. At this point, the energy stored in the magnetic field of the inductor can be used to maintain the flow of current in the circuit or to drive current through other components. The physical mechanism for transferring energy from a source like a capacitor to a magnetic field through an inductor is based on the interaction between electric and magnetic fields, and is a fundamental aspect of electromagnetic theory.",
