To do that, I'll need some more information from you. Can you please provide the following:\n\n1. What is your vehicle's make, model, and year?\n2. How many miles are currently on your odometer?\n3. What is the recommended brake pad replacement interval for your vehicle (you can find this in your owner's manual or online)?\n4. Do you want to set the reminder based on mileage or time (e.g., every 12 months)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you set up a reminder for when you need to replace your brake pads.\n\n(And if you want to share more about your new floor mats, I'm all ears!)",
