  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks. So, I should get the appraisal report and then shop around for insurance companies that specialize in insuring valuable items like my grandmother's necklace. I also have an antique music box from my great-aunt and a set of depression-era glassware from my mom that I'd like to insure. Do you think I should get those items appraised as well, or would it be better to focus on insuring the necklace first?",
