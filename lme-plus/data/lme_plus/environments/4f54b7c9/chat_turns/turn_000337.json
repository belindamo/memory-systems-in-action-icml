However, I can tell you that the UK government has set various objectives to promote sustainable practices, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting a circular economy. Additionally, there are a number of businesses and organizations in and around Rotherham that provide support and guidance to companies looking to adopt sustainable practices. For example, the Yorkshire and the Humber Sustainable Business Network is a business-led organization that aims to help businesses across the region become more sustainable. The network runs events and campaigns on topics such as waste reduction, renewable energy, and sustainable transport. The Sheffield City Region also has a number of sustainable initiatives in place, including the SCR Green Business Growth Programme, which provides grants and support to businesses looking to invest in sustainable practices. These are just a few examples, and it is likely that there are more initiatives and policies that promote sustainable practices in Rotherham that I am not currently aware of.",
