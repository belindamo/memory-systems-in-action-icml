What are your top three goals for your morning routine (e.g., exercise, meditation, breakfast, getting ready, etc.)?\n3. How much time are you willing to dedicate to your morning routine (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours)?\n4. Are there any specific activities you want to prioritize in your morning routine (e.g., journaling, reading, playing with pets)?\n5. Are you a morning person or do you tend to hit the snooze button frequently?\n6. Do you have any constraints or limitations that might impact your morning routine (e.g., young children, pets, limited mobility)?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your needs and preferences, I can help you create a personalized morning routine that suits your lifestyle and goals.\n\nFeel free to provide any additional information that might be helpful in creating your ideal morning routine!",
