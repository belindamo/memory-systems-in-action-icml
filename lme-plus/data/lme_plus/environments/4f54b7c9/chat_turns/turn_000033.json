  "content": "Yes, that is generally true. Physicians in non-teaching hospitals may have fewer opportunities to teach and mentor medical students or residents. However, they may still have opportunities to work with other healthcare professionals, such as nurses or physician assistants. In a non-teaching hospital, a physician's primary focus is on patient care, and they may have less time and resources to devote to teaching and academic pursuits. Teaching hospitals, on the other hand, are dedicated to education and the training of the next generation of physicians, and therefore provide more opportunities for physicians to engage in teaching and research activities. However, it's important to note that there are exceptions, and even non-teaching hospitals may have some opportunities for physicians to teach, mentor, or conduct research.",
