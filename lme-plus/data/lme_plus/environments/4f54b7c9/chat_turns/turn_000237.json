Plus, it's a great way to catch up and learn more about her life since you last spoke.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention reconnecting after 5 years. Reconnecting with old friends can be a wonderful experience, and it's great that you're taking the time to rebuild your friendship.\n\nAsking Rachel about what got her into hiking can also lead to some great conversations. You might discover that she's been through some significant life changes or challenges that led her to take up hiking as a way to cope or find solace. By showing genuine interest in her life and experiences, you can strengthen your bond and create a deeper connection.\n\nSome questions you might ask Rachel include:\n\n* What inspired you to start hiking, and how has it impacted your life?\n* What are some of your favorite hiking spots in the area, and what do you love about them?\n* How has hiking helped you overcome challenges or achieve personal growth?\n* Are there any hiking-related goals or challenges you're working towards?\n* Would you be interested in planning a hike together soon?\n\nBy asking open-ended questions and actively listening to her responses, you can have a meaningful conversation that helps you reconnect and builds a stronger friendship.\n\nRemember, reconnecting with old friends is not just about catching up on each other's lives; it's also about creating new memories and experiences together. So, don't be afraid to suggest planning a hike or other activities that you can enjoy together!",
