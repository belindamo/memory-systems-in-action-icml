  "content": "It sounds like you want to use the structure of your files (e.g. file names, metadata, etc.) to automatically assign labels to your data. This is a common approach, and there are several tools and techniques you can use to achieve this.\n\nFor example, you could use the GCP Cloud Storage API to programmatically read the file names and metadata for each file in your GCP bucket. You can then use this information to automatically assign labels to your data. For example, you could use the file name to determine the document type (e.g. CD booklet, artist biography, etc.), and you could use the metadata to determine the date published, author, publication, artist, and release.\n\nYou could also use a tool like Pandas or TensorFlow to automatically label your data. These tools are popular in the data science community, and they provide a variety of algorithms and techniques for working with data. You can use these tools to read the file names and metadata for your files, and then use this information to automatically assign labels to your data.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a tool like DVC (Data Version Control) to manage your dataset. DVC is a command-line tool that allows you to version, share, and collaborate on datasets. You can use DVC to create a dataset from your GCP bucket's files, and then use the file names and metadata to automatically assign labels to your data.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just a few examples of how you can use the structure of your files to automatically label your data. The best approach for you will depend on your specific needs and goals, so you may need to experiment with different tools and techniques to find the right solution for your project. If you need help with this, you can consult the GPT-3 documentation or reach out to the GPT-3 community for support.",
