With this budget, you can expect to include a good bottle of wine, a few types of artisanal cheese, and some accompaniments like crackers, fruit, and nuts.\n\n**Wine and Cheese Pairing:** Here's a classic pairing that's hard to go wrong with:\n\n**Wine:** Sauvignon Blanc (around $15-$25)\n\n* A crisp and refreshing white wine that pairs well with a variety of cheeses.\n\n**Cheese:**\n\n* **Brie** (around $10-$15): A soft, creamy cheese with a white rind, perfect for spreading on crackers or bread.\n* **Manchego** (around $10-$15): A semi-firm, nutty cheese from Spain that pairs nicely with the crispness of the Sauvignon Blanc.\n\n**Accompaniments:**\n\n* **Water Crackers** (around $5): A neutral cracker that won't overpower the cheese and wine.\n* **Dried Fruits** (around $5): Dried cranberries, apricots, or cherries add a sweet and tangy contrast to the savory cheese and wine.\n* **Fresh Fruit** (around $5): A few fresh grapes, berries, or sliced apples add a refreshing touch to the basket.\n\n**Other Ideas:**\n\n* **Chutney or Jam** (around $5): A sweet or spicy chutney can add an interesting flavor dimension to the pairing.\n* **Nuts** (around $5): A small bag of artisanal nuts like almonds, walnuts, or pecans can provide a satisfying crunch.\n* **Garnishes** (around $5): Fresh herbs like parsley, rosemary, or thyme can add a fragrant and elegant touch to the basket.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Consider the couple's personal taste preferences when selecting the wine and cheese.\n* Choose a wine with a moderate price point, as it will likely be of higher quality than a very cheap option.\n* Don't be afraid to mix and match items to create a unique and thoughtful gift basket.\n* Add a personalized note or card to make the gift even more special.\n\nWith your budget, you can create a beautiful and impressive wine and cheese gift basket that will surely delight your friends.",
