However, I can tell you that environmental factors such as climate change and sustainability concerns have influenced industries in many parts of the world, including Rotherham. For instance, some industries have had to comply with regulations and adopt environmentally-friendly practices to reduce their carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. Some industries have also been forced to adapt to changing weather patterns that affect their production and supply chain. In Rotherham, which is a steel-producing region, sustainability concerns have led to the development of newer, more environmentally-friendly production methods. For instance, there has been a shift toward electric-powered furnaces, which emit less carbon dioxide than traditional coke ovens. Additionally, industries in Rotherham have been encouraged to embrace sustainable energy sources such as wind power and solar power to reduce their dependence on non-renewable energy sources.",
