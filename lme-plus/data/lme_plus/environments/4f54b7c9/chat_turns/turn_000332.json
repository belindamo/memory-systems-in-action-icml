I do like it\u2019s sleek design. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t toast evenly. I get teased by my family for how much I enjoy a simple slice of toast, lol. I bought our last toasted all the way back in 2009, and it was just your simple 4 slice toaster. This time around I wanted to go a little fancier (for my love of toast). I must have read so many reviews that I got my toasters confused, because this one doesn\u2019t even have a bagel feature and I wouldn\u2019t have had it as a contender if I had noticed that. But that\u2019s not even the issue after having and using it for awhile. I guess the bread I buy has larger slices than the average loaf. Not something I ever noticed before using this toaster. It cannot accommodate four slices. So if I\u2019m making breakfast for the family, it\u2019s two slices at a time. And some spots are nearly burnt, while others are barely toasted. When I do English muffins, setting 3 is to light and setting four is burnt. Since it\u2019s digital, there is no in between. I have read the included book and put my slices in the center as it states to do when only doing two slices and still have bad results. I\u2019m going to donate this toaster and purchase a different brand. Hopefully I\u2019ll have better luck.\nCustomer image\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Edward Farrey\n3.0 out of 5 stars Another underachieving toaster\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on February 21, 2023\nSize: 4 SliceVerified Purchase\nThis toaster does not toast the bread near the top of the slice as much as the remainder of the slice. The digital deal seems neat, but you are left with toasting on 2 and then toasting a bit more.... a 3 setting is too much and the toast will be dark and dry.... the dial type controller on the old style toasters allows one to just dial in the right amount of time (time is actually all one adjusts in a toaster)..... the toaster looks nice\nand is easy to operate but you have to baby sit your toast...... I can't believe various companies cannot make\na good taster ..... c'mon we have minds that can conquer this... it's just a toaster\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Kindle Customer\n3.0 out of 5 stars Big and loud\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on December 31, 2022\nSize: 4 SliceVerified Purchase\nUpon receiving the toaster, I was taken aback by how large, yet lightweight/flimsy it was. The dimensions are provided in product description so I shouldn\u2019t been surprised. I\u2019d recommend really measuring your space before buying. I have an angled roofline above where we use the toaster and it gets super hot at least 12\u201d above the toaster. I need to pull it forward so the ceiling doesn\u2019t get over hot. The sides of toaster also really get hot.\n\nThe cord isn\u2019t super long so measure that too (27\u201d, and comes out near-ish the plunger).\n\nThe big surprise is how jarring and loud the toaster eject is. The first time, my cat comically flew straight into air then ripped out of the room. Either I (and the cat) am getting used to it but over time it seems a bit less jarring (the 1st time was, as recommended, without bread to burn off the initial strong chemical smell \u2014 so perhaps weight of bread slows the eject down?).\n\nI would not necessarily recommend the toaster but will keep it. My next toaster will probably be the America\u2019s Test Kitchen highly-rated $100 Breville, this one was $35 ($40 minus $5 coupon). I do like the ability to toast 2 long slices (artisanal sourdough) or 4 English muffins at a time.\n5 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Tim S.\n3.0 out of 5 stars Top of bread doesn't get toasted!\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on December 5, 2022\nSize: 4 SliceVerified Purchase\nPros:\n1.) I appreciate the wide slots for specialty bakery breads that wouldn't fit in a normal toaster and the ability to cook four slices of standard bread at once.\n2.) The timing function is nice, especially when trying to get all the parts of the meal ready at the same time.\n3.) It's fairly easy to use.\n\nCons:\n1.) It doesn't seem to have a deep enough well for the bread, and/or the toaster elements don't come up high enough, so the top of the bread doesn't get toasted, and I have to turn it over and toast it a little longer on that side. Then the middle of the bread gets too well done. I like my toast fairly well done, but I hate hard toast, which is what often happens here unless you set it just right. I'd really like it to be a one-and-done situation.\n2.) The clean-out tray at the bottom never seems to have much on it when I try to empty it, yet the toaster spews crumbs and seeds all over the counter all the time, even when the clean-up tray is inserted.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm glad I didn't pay much for this toaster because the cons outweigh the pros, in my opinion. I'm going to look for a new toaster and read the reviews carefully and thoroughly this time.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Brownm279\n3.0 out of 5 stars ONly toasts 3/4 of the bread and needs calibration..\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on February 24, 2023\nSize: 2 SliceVerified Purchase\nThis is a nice toaster it's a shame it only toast 3/4 of the bread (in needs to go down more into the heating elements) and it has settings 1=toast, 2=dark toast, 3=burnt toast and 4&5 = flames/fire. I wish I could calibrate the settings.\nCustomer image\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Jay\n3.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful fits in my decor perfectly.\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on February 14, 2023\nSize: 2 SliceVerified Purchase\nI love the thin nature of the machine. I love the length it will be great for home made breads.\nOk now that I have put bread in the toaster, I have found that the top of the bread sticks out and doesn't toast. And the bottom is too dark.

It has consistently toasted the bottom part of the bread or bagel more darkly than the top part. Evenness has not been a strong point.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Elizabeth Swann\n3.0 out of 5 stars Cooks hot out of the box!\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on February 16, 2023\nSize: 2 SliceVerified Purchase\n1st two attempts for \u201clevel 4\u201d Golden haven\u2019t worked.

It has a physical lever to push the toast down, but you can't push the lever up to end the toast cycle early, like most toasters. You have to push a touch button on the side to cancel, meaning this element is controlled by a computer chip along with the toast level and will probably fail years before the rest of the hardware. But the bigger problem is that the toasting rack doesn't descend fully into the toasting zone, meaning even a bagel doesn't toast all the way at the top, while the bottom gets overly brown. I usually stand by the toaster and rotate the pieces. Kinda defeats the purpose.\nCustomer image",
