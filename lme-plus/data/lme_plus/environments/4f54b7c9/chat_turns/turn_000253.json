  "content": "An inductor resists a change in current because of the property of inductance. Inductance is the tendency of an electrical circuit to oppose changes in current.\n\nWhen the current in an inductor changes, it generates a magnetic field around the coil. The magnetic field then induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil, which opposes the change in current. This is known as Lenz's law, which states that the direction of the induced EMF is such that it opposes the change in current that produced it.\n\nAs a result, the induced EMF acts as a back-EMF, resisting the change in current. The magnitude of the induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of the current and the inductance of the coil. The greater the inductance of the coil, the greater the induced EMF and the greater the resistance to changes in current.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that inductors tend to smooth out changes in current and can act as low-pass filters, allowing low-frequency signals to pass through while blocking high-frequency signals.",
