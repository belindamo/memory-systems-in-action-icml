  "content": "**Bell Peppers and Onions:**\n\nDiced bell peppers and onions will add a sweet and savory flavor to your frittatas. They're a great choice because they:\n\n* Add moisture and texture\n* Provide a pop of color\n* Complement the eggs and cheese nicely\n\nFeel free to use any color bell pepper you like, but red or yellow might add a bit more sweetness. Just be sure to dice them fairly small so they cook evenly and blend in with the eggs.\n\n**Reheating Frittatas:**\n\nReheating frittatas is easy and convenient. Here are a few methods:\n\n1. **Microwave:** Wrap a frittata in a microwave-safe container or plastic wrap and heat for 20-30 seconds. Check if it's warmed through, and if not, heat for another 10-15 seconds.\n2. **Toaster Oven:** Place the frittatas on a baking sheet and heat in a toaster oven at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for 5-7 minutes, or until warmed through.\n3. **Conventional Oven:** Place the frittatas on a baking sheet and heat in a conventional oven at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for 10-12 minutes, or until warmed through.\n4. **Pan:** Wrap a frittata in foil and heat it in a pan over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until warmed through.\n\nTips:\n\n* When reheating, you can add a splash of water or milk to the frittata to keep it moist.\n* If you're reheating a frozen frittata, add a few extra minutes to the reheating time.\n* You can also reheat frittatas in the morning and then wrap them in a paper towel or cloth to keep them warm while you're getting ready.\n\nBy making frittatas ahead of time and reheating them in the morning, you'll save time and still enjoy a delicious, protein-packed breakfast.",
