  "content": "**Handling tough questions:**\n\n1. **Be honest and transparent**: If you don't know the answer to a question, it's okay to say so. Don't make something up or provide misleading information.\n2. **Provide a high-level overview**: If Sarah asks a detailed question, try to provide a high-level overview of the concept or process. You don't need to delve into minute details, but show that you have a solid understanding of the topic.\n3. **Offer to follow up**: If you're not prepared to answer a question on the spot, it's perfectly fine to say, \"That's a great question, Sarah. I'd be happy to follow up with more information on that later. Can I get back to you on that?\"\n4. **Don't get defensive**: Remember that Sarah is asking questions because she's interested in your project and wants to understand it better. Don't get defensive or take it personally if she asks a tough question.\n\n**When to provide more information:**\n\n1. **If it's relevant to the conversation**: If the question is directly related to the conversation and your project's value proposition, try to provide a concise answer.\n2. **If it's a key differentiator**: If the question is about a unique aspect of your project that sets it apart from others, it's worth providing more information to showcase your competitive advantage.\n3. **If it's a key concern**: If Sarah expresses a concern or hesitation about your project, address it directly and provide reassurance or additional context to alleviate her concerns.\n\n**What to say when you need to follow up:**\n\n* \"That's a great question, Sarah. I'd be happy to follow up with more information on that later. Can I get back to you on that?\"\n* \"I don't have that information readily available, but I can send you a follow-up email with more details.\"\n* \"Let me check on that and get back to you. I want to make sure I provide the most accurate information.\"\n\nRemember, it's not about having all the answers on the spot. It's about showing that you're knowledgeable, transparent, and willing to follow up with more information.\n\nHow do you feel about handling tough questions now? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any specific concerns you have about the meeting?",
