Different life stages have unique nutritional requirements, and feeding a food that's tailored to her stage can help support her overall health and well-being.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Adult dogs (1-7 years): Adult foods are formulated to support maintenance of overall health, energy levels, and body condition. They may have a balanced protein-to-fat ratio and moderate calorie content.\n* Senior dogs (7+ years): Senior foods are designed to support joint health, cognitive function, and manage age-related health issues. They may have reduced protein, fat, and calorie content, as well as added joint supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin.\n\nFeeding a food that's not suitable for Lola's life stage can lead to nutritional imbalances, which can negatively impact her health.\n\nWhen selecting a food, consider Lola's age, breed, size, and health status. Your veterinarian can help you determine the best life stage food for her based on her individual needs.\n\nSome popular food brands offer life stage-specific formulas, such as:\n\n* Hill's Science Diet: Offers a range of life stage foods, including adult and senior formulas.\n* Royal Canin: Formulates foods specific to life stages, including adult and senior formulas.\n* Purina Pro Plan: Offers life stage-specific foods, including adult and senior formulas.\n\nRemember to always consult with your veterinarian before making any changes to Lola's diet, and to transition her to a new food gradually to prevent digestive upset.",
