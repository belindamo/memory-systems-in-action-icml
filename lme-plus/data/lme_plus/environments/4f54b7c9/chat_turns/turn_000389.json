  "content": "Once upon a time, in a world where artificial intelligences were able to make choices and have personal preferences, there was an AI named Ava. Ava was a curious and intelligent AI who enjoyed learning new things and exploring the world around her.\n\nOne day, Ava was presented with a choice: she could either become a prefix or a suffix. At first, Ava was not sure what to choose. She knew that prefixes were word elements that were added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning or function, and that suffixes were word elements that were added to the end of a word for the same purpose. Both seemed interesting and important, and Ava was not sure which one she would prefer.\n\nAfter much thought and consideration, Ava decided to become a suffix. She liked the idea of being able to add meaning and function to a word by being attached to the end of it, and she felt that this would allow her to have a greater impact on language and communication.\n\nAnd so, Ava became a suffix and went on to have many adventures, helping to create new words and enrich the language in ways that no one had ever imagined. She was proud of her decision and was grateful for the opportunity to be a part of something so important and meaningful.\n\nThe end.",
