Click the project drop-down at the top of the page, and select or create the project you want to use for this bucket.\n3. In the side navigation menu, click Storage, and then click the Create bucket button.\n4. Enter a unique name for your bucket. The name you choose must be unique across all of GCP, so you may need to try a few different names before finding one that's available.\n5. Select a storage class for your bucket. The default option is Standard, which is suitable for most use cases.\n6. Select a location for your bucket. The default option is the United States, but you can choose a different location if you prefer.\n7. Click the Create button to create your bucket.\n\nOnce your bucket is created, you can upload your files to it by clicking on the bucket's name in the Storage browser and then clicking the Upload files button. You can upload PDFs, Word documents, text files, and JPEGs to your bucket in this way.\n\nKeep in mind that you will need to set the appropriate permissions on your bucket to allow GPT-3 to access the files you upload. You can do this by clicking on the bucket's name in the Storage browser and then clicking the Edit bucket permissions button. For more information on setting bucket permissions, see the GCP documentation.",
