However, it's important to remember that squirrels are adaptable creatures and can survive in urban areas if they have access to food, shelter, and water. You can help support the squirrel population by providing them with food, such as nuts or seeds, in a squirrel feeder in a safe location away from traffic and predators. You can also make sure to properly dispose of trash so that they do not ingest harmful substances. Additionally, planting trees in your yard can provide valuable habitat and shelter for squirrels and other wildlife.",
