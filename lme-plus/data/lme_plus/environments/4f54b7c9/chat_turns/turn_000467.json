I've been experimenting with different hashtags and noticed that using 5-7 relevant ones gets me the most engagement. Speaking of which, my most popular post in the past month was a photo of my homemade pasta dish, which got 57 likes - I captioned it with #foodie #homemadewithlove #pastalover. Can you give me some tips on how to increase my following on Instagram?",
