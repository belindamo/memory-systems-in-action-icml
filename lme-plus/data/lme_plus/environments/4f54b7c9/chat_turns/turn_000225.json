Here are some tips to help you approach them effectively:\n\n**Why it's a good idea:**\n\n1. **Targeted audience:** Antique dealers specialize in specific areas, so you're more likely to find someone who's interested in your items.\n2. **Expertise:** Dealers have knowledge about the market, prices, and what collectors are looking for, which can help you determine your items' value.\n3. **Network:** Dealers often have a network of collectors, other dealers, and auction houses, which can help you reach a broader audience.\n\n**Tips for approaching local antique dealers:**\n\n1. **Research:** Find dealers who specialize in tea sets and typewriters.
