You can ask your neighbors, friends, or even post on your neighborhood's social media group or Nextdoor community.\n\nSome questions you might want to ask your neighbors include:\n\n* Who do they use for pet grooming?\n* How long have they been using the groomer?\n* What services do they offer?\n* How would they rate the groomer's quality of work, communication, and customer service?\n* Have they had any issues or concerns with the groomer?\n* Would they recommend the groomer to others?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better sense of the groomer's reputation, quality of work, and customer service. You might also get some valuable tips or insights that can help you make a more informed decision.\n\nRemember to take notes and ask follow-up questions to clarify any concerns you might have. And don't be afraid to ask to see pictures of their pet's grooming results or ask for contact information to reach out to the groomer directly.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a great groomer for your furry friend!",
