I'll mention that the antique tea set came from my cousin Rachel and the vintage typewriter belonged to my dad, and share any relevant stories or documents that I have. If asked, I'll briefly mention that I'm decluttering and found the items, but I won't make it the central focus of the conversation. Thanks for the advice!",
