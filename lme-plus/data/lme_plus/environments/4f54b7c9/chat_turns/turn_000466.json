  "content": "Exactly!\n\nThat's a great approach! Starting with one appraisal report for each item will give you a solid foundation to work with. If you need to get multiple appraisals later, you can always do so. It's better to start with one and then add more if needed, rather than getting multiple appraisals upfront and potentially incurring unnecessary costs.\n\nRemember to choose a reputable and certified appraiser, and make sure they provide a detailed and well-documented report. This will help you get an accurate value for your items and ensure that you're well-prepared for the insurance process.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, good luck with the appraisal process, and I hope you get the valuations you're looking for!",
