  "content": "A magnetic field stores energy through the interaction between magnetic fields and moving charges (such as electrons). The energy stored in a magnetic field is proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength.\n\nThe magnetic field strength is proportional to the current flowing through a coil of wire, so the energy stored in the magnetic field is proportional to the square of the current. This stored energy can be used to drive electric current through other components in the circuit.\n\nThe stored energy in a magnetic field is a result of the magnetic field exerting a force on the moving charges in the circuit. The force is proportional to the magnetic field strength and the velocity of the moving charges. When the current in the circuit changes, the magnetic field also changes, inducing an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil. This induced EMF acts as a back-EMF, resisting the change in current and storing energy in the magnetic field.\n\nThe stored energy in the magnetic field can be used to drive electric current through other components in the circuit. When the magnetic field decreases, the stored energy is released, allowing the current to continue flowing. The physical mechanism for storing energy in a magnetic field is based on the interaction between magnetic fields and moving charges, and is a fundamental aspect of electromagnetic theory.",
