  "content": "Teaching hospitals are more common in the United States compared to non-teaching hospitals. According to the American Hospital Association, approximately 20% of all hospitals in the United States are teaching hospitals. This percentage is much higher in urban areas, where medical schools and research institutions are often located. Teaching hospitals play an important role in the healthcare system, as they provide not only acute patient care but also serve as centers for medical education, research, and innovation. In addition, because they are affiliated with medical schools and academic institutions, they often have the resources to provide more specialized and advanced care, such as organ transplant or intensive care for critically ill patients.",
