The dark chocolate and roasted almonds will provide a nice contrast to the creamy Brie and Manchego, and the crisp Sauvignon Blanc.\n\n**Gift Card or Personalized Note:** Both a gift card and a personalized note are great ideas, but they serve different purposes. Here's what you can consider:\n\n* **Gift Card:** A gift card to a wine store, gourmet market, or a favorite restaurant can be a thoughtful addition to the basket. It allows the recipients to explore new wines, cheeses, or dining experiences, and it shows you're willing to give them the freedom to choose something they'll truly enjoy.\n* **Personalized Note:** A heartfelt, handwritten note can make the gift even more special and personal. You could express your congratulations, share a fond memory, or simply express your appreciation for their friendship. This adds a touch of warmth and thoughtfulness to the gift.\n\n**Why Not Both?:** If you want to make the gift even more special, you could include both a gift card and a personalized note. The gift card provides a practical and fun element, while the note adds a personal and emotional touch.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If you decide to include a gift card, consider adding a small note or card with a personal message.\n* If you choose to write a personalized note, keep it brief, sincere, and heartfelt. A few sentences can go a long way in making the gift feel more special.\n* Consider the recipients' personalities and your relationship with them when deciding whether to include a gift card, personalized note, or both.\n\nBy adding a gift card or personalized note, you'll show your friends that you've put thought and effort into the gift, and that you care about their special day.\n\nNow, you've got a beautiful wine and cheese gift basket that's sure to impress!",
