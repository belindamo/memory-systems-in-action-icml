  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences, but I can provide you with general information about how the work-schedule of a physician in a teaching hospital differs from that in a non-teaching one.\n\nThe work-schedule of a physician in a teaching hospital will usually involve a significant amount of time dedicated to teaching and research, in addition to patient care. This is because teaching hospitals are affiliated with medical schools and prioritize the education and training of medical students and residents.\n\nPhysicians in teaching hospitals may also have more structured schedules, such as rounds with medical students or residents, and may be expected to attend lectures or conferences as part of their role in educating others.\n\nIn contrast, physicians in non-teaching hospitals tend to have schedules that are primarily focused on patient care. They may have more flexibility in their schedules or work with a smaller, more specialized team.\n\nOverall, the work-schedule of a physician in a teaching hospital is likely to be more rigorous and structured, with a greater emphasis on education and research.",
