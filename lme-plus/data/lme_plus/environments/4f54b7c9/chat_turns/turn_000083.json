Here are some tips on how to approach phrasing, dynamics, and articulation in these pieces:\n\n**Bach:**\n\n1. **Phrasing:** Bach's music is known for its intricate phrasing, which often features complex counterpoint and interweaving lines. Look for natural breathing points, such as cadences or changes in harmony, to guide your phrasing. Pay attention to the way the different voices interact and try to bring out the contrapuntal texture.\n2. **Dynamics:** Bach's dynamics are often subtle, but crucial to the overall expression. Look for contrasts between forte and piano, as well as gradual dynamic shifts. Be mindful of the range of your instrument and adjust your dynamics accordingly.\n3. **Articulation:** Bach's articulation is often characterized by a mix of legato and detached playing. Pay attention to the notation and use a range of articulations, from smooth and connected to short and detached. Be careful not to over-articulate, as this can disrupt the flow of the music.\n\n**Mozart:**\n\n1. **Phrasing:** Mozart's phrasing is often more lyrical and singing than Bach's. Look for long, flowing lines and try to create a sense of forward motion. Pay attention to the way the melody interacts with the accompaniment and try to bring out the harmony.\n2. **Dynamics:** Mozart's dynamics are often more extreme than Bach's, with sudden contrasts between forte and piano. Be prepared to play with a range of dynamics, from soft and delicate to loud and dramatic.\n3. **Articulation:** Mozart's articulation is often characterized by a mix of legato and detached playing, with a focus on clarity and precision. Pay attention to the notation and use a range of articulations, from smooth and connected to short and detached.\n\n**General tips:**\n\n1. **Practice with a metronome:** Both Bach and Mozart require a strong sense of rhythm and pulse. Practice with a metronome to develop a solid sense of tempo and timing.\n2. **Listen to recordings:** Study recordings of professional violinists playing these pieces and pay attention to their phrasing, dynamics, and articulation. This will help you develop your own interpretation and sense of style.\n3. **Experiment with different bowings:** Both Bach and Mozart require a range of bowings, from legato to detached. Experiment with different bowings to find the one that works best for each piece.\n4. **Pay attention to harmony:** Both Bach and Mozart were masters of harmony, and their music is full of complex chord progressions and counterpoint. Pay attention to the harmony and try to bring out the underlying structure of the music.\n5. **Practice slowly:** Both Bach and Mozart require precision and control. Practice slowly and carefully to develop a solid technical foundation, and then gradually increase the tempo as you become more comfortable.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to developing a compelling and expressive interpretation of these beautiful pieces. Good luck with your audition!",
