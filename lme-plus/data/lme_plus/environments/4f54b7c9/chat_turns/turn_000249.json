  "content": "Electric potential, or voltage, is created by a difference in electric charge between two points. This difference in charge creates an electric field, which exerts a force on charged particles and drives the flow of electric current through a circuit.\n\nThere are several sources that can create a difference in electric charge and generate voltage, including:\n\n1. Batteries: A battery generates voltage by converting chemical energy into electrical energy.\n2. Generators: A generator uses mechanical energy to generate voltage by rotating a coil of wire within a magnetic field.\n3. Solar cells: Solar cells convert sunlight into electrical energy by generating voltage due to the photovoltaic effect.\n4. Power plants: Power plants generate voltage by using thermal, hydro, wind, or nuclear energy to drive turbines, which in turn generate electricity.\n\nRegardless of the source, the resulting voltage can be used to drive electric current through a circuit and perform work, such as powering electric devices.",
