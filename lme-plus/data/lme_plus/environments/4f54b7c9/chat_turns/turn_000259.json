  "content": "The back-EMF of an inductor stores energy in the magnetic field generated by the inductor. The magnetic field is created by the flow of electric current through the coil, and its strength is proportional to the current.\n\nWhen the current in an inductor changes, the magnetic field also changes, which induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil. This induced EMF acts as a back-EMF, resisting the change in current. The energy required to change the current is stored in the magnetic field and is proportional to the square of the current.\n\nAs the current decreases, the magnetic field and the back-EMF also decrease, releasing the stored energy. The stored energy can be used to drive electric current through other components in the circuit.\n\nIn this way, the back-EMF of an inductor acts as a form of energy storage, storing energy in the magnetic field and releasing it as needed to maintain the flow of current in the circuit. The amount of energy stored in the magnetic field depends on the inductance of the coil and the magnitude of the current.",
