Strava's Club feature is an excellent way to stay connected with Rachel and track each other's progress.\n\nAs for inviting Alex and Emma to join the club, it's definitely worth considering. Since you've been playing tennis together, they might be interested in joining the club and tracking their own fitness activities. Here are a few pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Social motivation:** Having more friends in the club can provide an added motivation to stay active and competitive.\n2. **Variety of activities:** Since Alex and Emma are into tennis, they might be interested in tracking their tennis activities on Strava, which could bring a new dynamic to the club.\n3. **Cross-training:** You might discover new workout ideas or routes from Alex and Emma's tennis activities, which could help you mix up your jogging routine.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Different fitness goals:** If Alex and Emma are primarily focused on tennis, their fitness goals and activities might not align with your jogging goals, which could make it harder to find common ground.\n2. **Club focus:** If the club becomes too focused on tennis, it might detract from your jogging-focused goals with Rachel.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether to invite Alex and Emma to join the club. If you think they'll be interested in tracking their fitness activities and participating in the club, go for it! Just make sure to set clear expectations and boundaries to ensure the club remains focused on your jogging goals with Rachel.\n\nYou could also consider creating a separate club or group for your tennis friends, which would allow you to keep your jogging goals separate while still staying connected with Alex and Emma.\n\nWhat do you think? Will you invite Alex and Emma to join the club, or create a separate group for your tennis friends?"
