You can do these at home or at the gym.\n3. **Core strengthening**: Building on your Pilates experience, you might enjoy core-focused workouts like planking, Russian twists, or dynamic exercises that target your abs, obliques, and lower back.\n4. **Dance-based workouts**: If you enjoy movement and rhythm, consider trying dance-based workouts like Zumba, HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), or Hip Hop Abs. These classes are fun, energetic, and can be modified to suit your fitness level.\n5. **TRX suspension training**: TRX uses suspension straps to engage your core and work multiple muscle groups simultaneously.

This type of workout can be adapted to your fitness level and is an excellent way to improve cardiovascular endurance and overall fitness.\n7. **Restorative yoga or yin yoga**: If you're looking for a more relaxing, low-impact workout, consider restorative yoga or yin yoga.
