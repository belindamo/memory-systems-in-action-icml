  "content": "While it may seem easier to put testicles inside the body to avoid the risk of injury and infection, it is not physiologically possible. Testicles require a cooler temperature to produce healthy sperm, and the body temperature is too hot for this process to occur. About 35 degrees Celsius is the optimal temperature range for sperm production. If the testicles were inside the body at normal body temperature (about 37 degrees Celsius), sperm production would be reduced, resulting in infertility.\n\nFurthermore, the testicles have evolved outside the body for various other reasons, such as easier access for mating and better dissipation of excess heat. The scrotum also helps regulate the temperature by contracting or relaxing in response to environmental temperature changes, which allows for optimal sperm production. Therefore, while it may seem simpler to put the testicles inside the body like ovaries, it is not a feasible option due to the critical physiological temperature requirements for sperm production.",
