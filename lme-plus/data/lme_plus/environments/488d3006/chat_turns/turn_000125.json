Here's why:\n\n1. **Energy boost**: Breakfast helps kickstart your metabolism, providing energy for the day ahead.\n2. **Improved focus and concentration**: Eating a nutritious breakfast has been shown to improve cognitive function, memory, and mood.\n3. **Better weight management**: Skipping breakfast can lead to overeating later in the day, as you're more likely to reach for unhealthy snacks or overindulge in lunch.\n4. **Reduced stress**: Taking time for breakfast can help you feel more relaxed and in control, setting a positive tone for the day.\n\nIncorporating breakfast into your morning routine can be as simple as:\n\n* Preparing a quick and easy meal, such as oatmeal, scrambled eggs, or yogurt with fruit\n* Keeping healthy snacks on hand, like nuts, energy bars, or dried fruit\n* Even just having a glass of water or a cup of coffee/tea to get your body started\n\nAim to dedicate 15-30 minutes to breakfast, depending on your schedule and preferences. You can adjust the timing as needed, but make sure to prioritize this important meal.\n\nIn your case, since you mentioned skipping breakfast on the day you were late, it's likely that adding breakfast to your routine will help improve your focus and overall well-being.\n\nHere's an updated morning routine plan:\n\n**Week 3-4:**\n\n* Wake up at 7:00 AM\n* Stretching or light exercise (10 minutes)\n* Brushing teeth and washing face (5 minutes)\n* Breakfast (15-30 minutes)\n* Quick planning or meditation (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Week 5-6:**\n\n* Wake up at 6:45 AM\n* Stretching or light exercise (10 minutes)\n* Brushing teeth and washing face (5 minutes)\n* Breakfast (15-30 minutes)\n* Quick planning or meditation (10-15 minutes)\n* Additional activity (10-15 minutes, e.g., reading, journaling, or responding to emails)\n\n**Week 7-8:**\n\n* Wake up at 6:30 AM\n* Stretching or light exercise (10 minutes)\n* Brushing teeth and washing face (5 minutes)\n* Breakfast (15-30 minutes)\n* Quick planning or meditation (10-15 minutes)\n* Additional activity (10-15 minutes, e.g., reading, journaling, or responding to emails)\n\nFeel free to adjust this plan as needed, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance!",
