  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. You're correct that the eSpeak website I recommended does not explicitly mention support for phonetic transcriptions. eSpeak is primarily designed to generate speech from text input in various languages, including English. However, it does support a variety of phoneme sets for different languages, which can be used to represent the sounds of words in a phonetic transcription.\n\nIf you have a specific phonetic transcription you would like to generate an audio file for, you can try using the eSpeak command-line tool with the appropriate phoneme set for the language and dialect of the transcription. For example, the following command can be used to generate an audio file for the English word \"dude\" in the General American accent using the ARPAbet phoneme set:\n```css\nespeak -v en-us -x -q --pho=\"d u d\"\n```\nThis command will output the phoneme transcription for \"dude\" in ARPAbet format and generate an audio file for it. You can modify the phoneme transcription as needed to generate audio files for other words.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how eSpeak can be used to generate audio files from phonetic transcriptions. Please let me know if you have any other questions.",
