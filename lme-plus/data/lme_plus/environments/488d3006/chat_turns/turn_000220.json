However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal schedule or information, so I don't know what time your yoga class is on Wednesdays.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you figure it out:\n\n1. Check your calendar: Take a look at your calendar or planner to see if you've written down the time of your yoga class.\n2. Contact the studio: Reach out to the yoga studio where you take classes and ask them what time the class is on Wednesdays.\n3. Check the studio's website: Many studios have their schedules posted on their website, so you can check there to see what time the class is.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
