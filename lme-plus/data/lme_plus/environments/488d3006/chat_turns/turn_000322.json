I'll definitely take plenty of photos and share my experience with my friends and family. And who knows, maybe Luna will even get to see some bachata moves when I get back!\n\nI'm looking forward to immersing myself in the bachata culture, learning new techniques, and meeting fellow enthusiasts. Your tips and advice have been incredibly helpful, and I feel more confident and prepared for the festival.\n\n\u00a1Gracias por todo! I'll be sure to enjoy every moment of the festival and make the most out of this amazing opportunity.\n\n\u00a1Hasta luego!",
