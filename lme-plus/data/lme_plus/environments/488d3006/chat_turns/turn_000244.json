However, we can see that Norway has one of the highest adoption rates of electric cars in the world, with electric and hybrid cars accounting for a majority of new car sales in the country [[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/7176/e-mobility-in-norway/)][[2](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/norway-electric-cars-majority-sales/)]. As of 2020, there were 346,921 electric cars and 142,858 plug-in hybrids in Norway, representing 12.06% and 5.11% of the total vehicles in the country, respectively [[3](https://www.visitnorway.com/plan-your-trip/getting-around/by-car/electric-cars/)].\n\nAdditionally, we can find numerous listings for used cars for sale in Norway on platforms such as OOYYO [[4](https://www.ooyyo.com/norway/used-cars-for-sale/c=CDA31D7114D3854F111B926FAA651453/)] and TrueCar [[10](https://www.truecar.com/used-cars-for-sale/listings/fuel-electric/location-norway-sc/)], but there is no indication of the average price of used electric cars specifically. It is worth noting that Norway has implemented policies such as tax exemptions and reduced tolls to incentivize the adoption of electric cars, which may affect their pricing [[2](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/norway-electric-cars-majority-sales/)][[8](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/features/356121/electric-cars-norway-why-country-love-evs)].",
