  "content": "It sounds like you've been reflecting on your social media usage and its evolution over time. That's a great sign of self-awareness and growth!\n\nIt's interesting that you mention your yoga practice. It's not uncommon for people to use social media to share their accomplishments or hobbies, but it's great that you've shifted your approach. Instead of using social media as a way to showcase your practice, you're now using it as a means of reflection and introspection.\n\nThis shift in approach can be really beneficial. By focusing on reflection rather than bragging, you're able to use social media in a more mindful and intentional way. You're also setting a great example for others by showing that it's okay to be more thoughtful and less boastful online.\n\nIt's also worth noting that taking a step back and focusing on what's truly important to you is a great way to redefine your relationship with social media. By prioritizing your values and goals, you're able to use social media in a way that aligns with your values, rather than letting social media dictate your behavior.\n\nRemember, social media is just a tool, and it's up to us to use it in a way that serves us. It's great that you're taking steps to be more intentional with your social media usage, and I'm sure you'll continue to grow and learn as you navigate this journey.\n\nKeep being mindful of your social media usage, and don't be afraid to make changes as needed. You got this!",
