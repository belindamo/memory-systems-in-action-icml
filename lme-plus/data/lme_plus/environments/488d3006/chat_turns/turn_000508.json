It's not possible for you to have watched a Yankees game with Aaron Judge's walk-off home run the day after a Lakers game.\n\nAaron Judge is a star player for the Yankees, and he has hit many impressive home runs, but I'm not aware of a specific walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning. Maybe you're thinking of a different game or a different player?\n\nDon't worry, it can be easy to get sports teams and games mixed up. But I'm here to help you with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss!",
