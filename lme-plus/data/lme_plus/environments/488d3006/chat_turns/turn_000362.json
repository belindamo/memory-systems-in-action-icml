For example, a study published in the Journal of Adolescence found that when parents were overly involved in their children's homework, it could lead to decreased motivation and autonomy in the child.\n\nAnother study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that parental over-involvement (termed \"helicopter parenting\") was associated with lower levels of perceived autonomy among college students, which, in turn, negatively affected academic achievement and well-being.\n\nIt is important to note that these findings do not suggest that parental involvement is inherently negative, but rather that too much involvement without room for autonomy and independence can have unintended negative consequences. As with most things in life, a balance is key. Parents should aim to be supportive and involved without being overly controlling, and respect their child's need for independence and decision-making as they grow and develop.",
