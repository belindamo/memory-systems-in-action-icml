All NCAT application forms are available for download in PDF-fillable format, and some application types can be completed online. Information required on the application includes the names and contact details of both parties, the orders being sought, and the reasons why those orders are requested. If the case is about an urgent issue, parties should find out how to apply for an urgent hearing. An application fee may be payable depending on the case type, and a reduced concession fee is available for eligible persons. Time limits may also apply, and parties should check if time limits apply by reading the information for their type of case.
