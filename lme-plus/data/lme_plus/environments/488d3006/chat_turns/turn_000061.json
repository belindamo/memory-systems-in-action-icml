Here are some tips to help you keep your campsite clean and safe:\n\n**Food Storage:**\n\n1. **Use airtight containers:** Store food and scented items (e.g., toothpaste, soap, and lotion) in airtight containers to prevent odors from escaping.\n2. **Keep it sealed:** Ensure all containers are closed tightly, and consider using zip-top bags or plastic bins with secure lids.\n3. **Store away from campsite:** Keep food and scented items at least 100 yards away from your campsite, and preferably in a secure location, such as:\n\t* A hard-sided vehicle with windows and doors closed.\n\t* A bear locker or bear box (if available at the campsite).\n\t* A tree at least 10 feet off the ground and 4 feet out from the trunk.\n4. **Hang it high:** If you're in an area with bear activity, hang your food and scented items from a tree using a sturdy rope and a secure knot. Make sure the items are at least 10 feet off the ground and 4 feet out from the trunk.\n\n**Trash Management:**\n\n1. **Pack it in, pack it out:** Bring all trash and disposable items back with you when you leave the campsite.\n2. **Use bear-resistant trash cans:** If available, use bear-resistant trash cans or dumpsters provided at the campsite.\n3. **Keep trash clean and dry:** Ensure trash bags are tightly sealed and kept clean to prevent attracting wildlife.\n4. **Don't leave trash out:** Never leave trash or dirty dishes out overnight, as this can attract wildlife.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Be mindful of campsite cleanliness:** Keep your campsite clean and free of food scraps, dirty dishes, and trash.\n2. **Keep a clean cooking area:** Clean up cooking areas and utensils immediately after use.\n3. **Don't camp in areas with recent bear activity:** Check with park rangers or local authorities for information on bear activity in the area before setting up camp.\n4. **Make noise while hiking:** Make noise while hiking to avoid surprising bears and other wildlife.\n5. **Follow local regulations:** Familiarize yourself with local regulations and guidelines for food storage and trash management.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be doing your part to minimize the risk of attracting wildlife, especially bears, and helping to keep both humans and animals safe.",
