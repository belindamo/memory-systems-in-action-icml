Pilates is an excellent way to improve core strength, control, and overall body awareness.\n\nSince you mentioned the class was intense, I'm guessing it might have been a more dynamic or reformer-based Pilates class.

Some options could be:\n\n1. **Mat Pilates**: A more traditional Pilates class that focuses on bodyweight exercises and matwork.\n2. **Reformer Pilates**: The type of class you took, which uses the reformer machine to provide resistance and challenge your movements.\n3. **Cadillac Pilates**: A class that uses the Cadillac machine, which provides a more intense workout and targets specific muscle groups.\n4. **Pilates with props**: A class that incorporates props like resistance bands, weights, or balls to add variety and challenge to your workout.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and take rest days as needed. It's great that you're enjoying the class, and I'm sure you'll continue to see improvements in your strength, flexibility, and overall fitness.\n\nKeep me updated on your fitness journey, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need recommendations!",
