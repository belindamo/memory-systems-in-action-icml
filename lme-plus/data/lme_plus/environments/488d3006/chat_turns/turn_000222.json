What type of music do you usually enjoy in your Zumba classes? Do you like:\n\n1. Upbeat Latin rhythms (e.g., salsa, merengue, reggaeton)?\n2. Energizing pop and rock anthems?\n3. Hip-hop and R&B beats?\n4. A mix of everything?\n\nAlso, are you looking for playlists with specific energy levels or tempos? For example, do you want songs that are:\n\n1. High-energy and fast-paced?\n2. Medium-tempo and moderately energetic?\n3. Slower and more relaxing?\n\nLet me know your preferences, and I can suggest some playlists or individual songs to refresh your Zumba routine!",
