  "content": "The `systemctl list-unit-files` command is used to show a list of all unit files and their current state on a CentOS 7 machine. This command does not create a login session, so there is no need to log out.\n\nOnce you run the command and view the list of unit files, you can simply close the terminal window or press the `Enter` key to return to the command prompt.\n\nYou can also use the `Ctrl + C` keyboard shortcut to immediately stop the command and return to the command prompt.\n\nIf you are in a specific program you may use different command to exit, depends on the program you are using.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other question or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
