Encourage and support your child's independence: As your child grows and develops, it's important to encourage and support their independence by giving them space to make their own decisions and allowing them to experience the consequences of those decisions.\n\n2. Get involved in a way that respects your child's boundaries: Find ways to get involved in your child's education and personal growth that respect their boundaries and preferences. For example, you might ask them how involved they want you to be in their schoolwork, extracurricular activities, or social life, and adjust accordingly.\n\n3. Encourage open communication: Develop a relationship with your child that is based on open communication and trust, so that they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, feelings, and experiences with you.\n\n4. Know when to step back: Sometimes, the best thing you can do for your child is to step back and let them take the lead. If they are struggling with a problem, give them an opportunity to work through it on their own before jumping in to help.\n\n5. Focus on the big picture: Remember that your ultimate goal as a parent is to help your child develop into a confident, independent adult. Keep this in mind as you navigate the challenges of balancing your involvement and your child's need for independence.",
