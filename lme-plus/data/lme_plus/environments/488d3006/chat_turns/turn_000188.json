  "content": "Acknowledged. NCAT is the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which handles a range of civil and administrative cases in New South Wales. It was established on January 1, 2014, and consolidated the work of 22 former tribunals into a single point of access for specialist tribunal services in NSW. The Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 governs NCAT's operations. NCAT provides a simple, quick, and effective process for resolving disputes and reviewing administrative action, with services and processes to support self-representation by parties in most matters, plain language forms and documents, simplified processes, and a range of alternative dispute resolution methods. The types of cases dealt with by NCAT are broad and diverse, including tenancy issues, building works, decisions on guardianship, and administrative review of government decisions. NCAT's broad and diverse jurisdiction and case types are generally managed through its Divisions. NCAT's Appeal Panel provides a timely and cost-effective mechanism to enable prompt reviews of most Tribunal decisions.",
