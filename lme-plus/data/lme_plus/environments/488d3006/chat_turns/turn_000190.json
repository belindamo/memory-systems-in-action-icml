  "content": "Acknowledged. NCAT's jurisdiction and diverse case types are generally managed through its four Divisions and the Appeal Panel. To apply to NCAT, one must first identify the case type and complete an application form. When a notice of hearing is received from NCAT, parties should begin preparing for the hearing. NCAT uses a range of alternative resolution processes to help parties resolve their dispute before the hearing. On the day of the hearing or other listing event, parties should find out what to expect when they arrive at NCAT. After the hearing, NCAT will make a decision and orders. Certain Tribunal decisions can be internally appealed to the NCAT Appeal Panel.",
