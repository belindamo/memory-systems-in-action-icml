  "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to provide more information about the Pollock-Krasner grant.\n\nThe Pollock-Krasner Foundation was established in 1985 by Lee Krasner, the widow of Jackson Pollock, to support individual artists of all nationalities and backgrounds. The foundation seeks to promote the legacy of both artists by providing financial assistance to artists who demonstrate artistic merit and financial need.\n\nThe Pollock-Krasner grant is a monetary award that is meant to serve a practical purpose for the artist, such as helping to cover the costs of art supplies, studio rent, and other expenses. The award amount is determined by the individual needs of the artist and the evaluation of their work by a selection committee.\n\nThe grant is open to mid-career and established artists who have been actively working for at least 5 years, and who can demonstrate a commitment to their artistic practice through their work and exhibition history. To be eligible, artists must also be able to provide evidence of their financial need, such as proof of income, expenses, and debts.\n\nIn addition to providing financial support, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation also maintains an extensive archive of information about Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, and supports research and scholarly activities related to their work.\n\nOverall, the Pollock-Krasner grant is a valuable source of support for individual artists, and represents an important legacy of two of the most influential artists of the 20th century.",
