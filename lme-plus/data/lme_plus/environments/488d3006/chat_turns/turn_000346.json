Here's how:\n\n**Adding a keyword rule to your smart collection:**\n\n1. **Create a new rule:** In the \"Smart Collection\" dialog box, click the \"Add Rule\" button.\n2. **Choose \"Keyword\":** Select \"Keyword\" from the dropdown menu.\n3. **Specify the keyword:** Type in the keyword you want to use, such as \"beach\" or \"coast\".\n4. **Choose the keyword match:** Choose how you want to match the keyword. You can choose \"Contains\", \"Starts with\", \"Ends with\", or \"Exactly\" to specify how the keyword should match.\n5. **Add the rule:** Click \"Add\" to add the rule to your smart collection.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you want to create a smart collection that includes photos taken with your 50mm f/1.8 prime lens and also includes photos with the keyword \"beach\" or \"coast\". Your smart collection rules would look like this:\n\n* Lens: is 50mm\n* Keyword: contains \"beach\" or \"coast\"\n\n**How it works:**\n\nWhen you add a keyword rule to your smart collection, Lightroom will search for photos that match the specified keyword, in addition to the other rules you've set. In this case, Lightroom will include photos that were taken with the 50mm f/1.8 prime lens and also have the keyword \"beach\" or \"coast\" associated with them.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Use multiple keywords:** You can add multiple keyword rules to your smart collection to include photos with different keywords. For example, you could add a rule to include photos with the keyword \"surfing\" or \"sunset\".\n* **Use keyword hierarchies:** If you have a hierarchical keyword structure, you can use the \"Contains\" match type to include photos with keywords that are nested under a parent keyword. For example, if you have a keyword hierarchy like \"Travel > Beach > Surfing\", you could use the rule \"Keyword: contains 'Beach'\" to include photos with the keyword \"Surfing\" or any other keyword nested under \"Beach\".\n* **Use negative keywords:** You can use negative keywords to exclude photos with specific keywords. For example, you could add a rule to exclude photos with the keyword \"city\" to ensure that only beach-related photos are included in your smart collection.\n\nBy adding a keyword rule to your smart collection, you can capture a wider range of photos related to your beach trip, even if they weren't taken with your 50mm f/1.8 prime lens.",
