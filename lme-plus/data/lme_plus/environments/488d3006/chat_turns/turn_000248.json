  "content": "Males have testicles outside of the body because the temperature inside the body is too warm for sperm production. Testicles need to be kept at a temperature lower than the normal body temperature to produce healthy sperm. Keeping the testes outside the body helps in maintaining an optimal temperature for sperm production. The scrotum, the loose sac that contains the testes, helps regulate the temperature by contracting or relaxing in response to environmental temperature changes.\n\nOn the other hand, ovaries are located inside the female's body because they need to be protected and nourished during fetal development and throughout a woman's life. The ovaries release mature eggs into the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs. The fallopian tubes transport the fertilized egg to the uterus for implantation and development. Additionally, the ovaries need to maintain a constant internal environment for the production of female hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, which play important roles in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.",
