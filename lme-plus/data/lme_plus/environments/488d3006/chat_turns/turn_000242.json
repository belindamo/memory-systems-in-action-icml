  "content": "Given Lucy Dacus' intimate and introspective show at The Ritz on May 2nd, I think some of the bands I mentioned earlier would be a great fit to open for her. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Soccer Mommy**: Sophie Allison's music as Soccer Mommy shares a similar lo-fi, introspective quality with Lucy Dacus. Their music often deals with themes of youth, relationships, and self-discovery, which aligns well with Lucy Dacus' lyrical focus.\n2. **Adrianne Lenker (of Big Thief)**: As I mentioned earlier, Adrianne Lenker's solo work is a great fit for fans of Lucy Dacus. Her introspective and emotionally charged songwriting would complement Lucy Dacus' music nicely, and their shared introspective qualities would create a cohesive bill.\n3. **Waxahatchee**: Katie Crutchfield's music as Waxahatchee shares a similar indie-rock and folk influence with Lucy Dacus. Their music often deals with themes of relationships, identity, and personal growth, which aligns well with Lucy Dacus' lyrical focus.\n4. **Courtney Marie Andrews**: With her introspective lyrics and soaring vocals, Courtney Marie Andrews' music would be a great fit to open for Lucy Dacus. Their shared focus on introspective songwriting and indie-rock soundscapes would create a cohesive and engaging bill.\n\nAll of these bands have a similar introspective and emotionally charged quality to their music, which would complement Lucy Dacus' show nicely. They're also all relatively smaller acts, which would make them a good fit for an opening slot at a venue like The Ritz.\n\nOf course, the final decision would depend on Lucy Dacus' personal preferences and the tone she wants to set for her show. But based on their music and styles, I think any of these bands would be a great fit to open for her!",
