  "content": "These recommendations are really helpful! I'll definitely check them out. Speaking of dance classes, I actually took hip hop classes at a studio near my work before I started salsa, and I really enjoyed the high-energy vibe. The hip hop classes were a lot of fun, but I'm glad I made the switch to salsa because it's more low-key and I can actually learn the steps. Do you have any recommendations for bachata songs or artists? I've been listening to some bachata videos on YouTube to help me improve my technique, and I'm really interested in learning more about the genre.",
