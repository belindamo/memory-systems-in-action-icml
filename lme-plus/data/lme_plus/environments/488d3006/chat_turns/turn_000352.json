  "content": "You are correct that the figure I gave earlier on the prevalence of bat lyssavirus in flying foxes was inaccurate. It appears that the prevalence varies widely depending on the species of bat and the location. In some populations, such as the black flying fox, prevalence can be as high as 30%, while in others it can be much lower.\n\nThe word \"lyssavirus\" is pronounced li-suh-vahy-ruhs. The phonetic spelling is /\u02ccl\u026as\u0259\u02c8va\u026ar\u0259s/.\n\nIn addition to bat lyssavirus, there are several other viruses that affect the nervous system in humans. These include rabies virus, which is closely related to bat lyssavirus, as well as viruses that cause diseases such as polio, West Nile virus, and Zika virus.\n\nThere are also several other diseases that can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated animal tissue, including brains. These include prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD, which are caused by abnormal proteins called prions. Other diseases that can be transmitted through the consumption of contaminated animal tissue include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or \"mad cow\" disease) and kuru, a prion disease that was once prevalent in Papua New Guinea.",
