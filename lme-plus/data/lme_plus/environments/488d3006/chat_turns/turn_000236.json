  "content": "That's an interesting question! John Mayer's live shows are indeed known for their high level of musicianship and variety. Considering Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers' styles, I think Phoebe Bridgers might be a better fit to open for John Mayer. Here's why:\n\n* Musical diversity: Phoebe Bridgers' music often incorporates elements of folk, rock, and pop, which might appeal to John Mayer's diverse fan base. Her songs can range from introspective and quiet to more upbeat and driving, which could work well as an opener for Mayer's eclectic setlists.\n* Vocal range: Phoebe Bridgers' vocals are known for their emotional intensity and dynamic range, which could hold its own against Mayer's impressive guitar playing and vocal abilities.\n* Lyrical depth: Both Phoebe Bridgers and John Mayer are known for their thoughtful, storytelling-driven lyrics. This shared focus on lyrical depth could create a sense of continuity between their sets.\n\nJulien Baker's music, on the other hand, might be a bit more challenging to pair with John Mayer's style. Julien's sound is often more introspective and emotionally intense, which might not provide the same level of contrast and variety that Mayer's fans might expect from an opener. However, if the goal is to create a more subdued and introspective atmosphere, Julien Baker could still be a great fit.\n\nUltimately, it's up to personal taste, but I think Phoebe Bridgers' eclectic sound and emotional intensity could make her a great opener for John Mayer's show.",
