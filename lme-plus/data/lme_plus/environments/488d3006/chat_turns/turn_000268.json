  "content": "The macOS release of eSpeak is 64-bit. It was built as a Universal Binary, which means it includes both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, but it will run in 64-bit mode on a modern macOS system.\n\nNote that the specific version of eSpeak available through Homebrew may depend on the version of macOS and the installed software and libraries. However, as of the time of my knowledge cutoff (September 2021), the latest version of eSpeak available through Homebrew (version 1.48.04) is built as a 64-bit Universal Binary.",
