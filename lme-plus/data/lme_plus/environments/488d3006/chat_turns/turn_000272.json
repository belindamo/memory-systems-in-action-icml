The latest version of eSpeak for macOS available on the official eSpeak website as of my knowledge cutoff (September 2021) is version 1.48.15, which was released on January 1, 2021.\n\nIt's worth noting that the eSpeak website provides downloads for source code, which must be compiled on your system in order to use eSpeak. Alternatively, you can install eSpeak using a package manager like Homebrew, which will handle the installation and setup for you. The latest version of eSpeak available through Homebrew as of my knowledge cutoff is version 1.48.04.",
