Don't worry, I've got some alternative topping ideas for your Greek yogurt parfait:\n\n1. **Fresh Fruit**: Sliced strawberries, blueberries, bananas, or any other berries are a delicious and healthy choice. You can also try other fruits like diced peaches, kiwi, or mango.\n2. **Nuts**: Chopped nuts like almonds, walnuts, or pecans add a nice crunch and flavor. You can also try toasted nuts for a deeper flavor.\n3. **Seeds**: Chia seeds, flaxseeds, or hemp seeds provide a nutty flavor and a boost of omega-3s and fiber.\n4. **Cocoa Powder or Cinnamon**: Sprinkle a pinch of cocoa powder or cinnamon to give your parfait a chocolatey or warm flavor.\n5. **Honey or Maple Syrup**: Add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup for a touch of sweetness.\n6. **Coconut Flakes**: Toasted coconut flakes can add a nice tropical flavor and texture.\n7. **Caramelized Banana**: Slice a banana and cook it in a pan with a little butter and cinnamon until caramelized. This makes a delicious and sweet topping.\n8. **Creamy Toppings**: Try adding a dollop of peanut butter, almond butter, or cashew butter for added creaminess.\n9. **Jam or Preserves**: Use a fruit jam or preserve, like strawberry or apricot, to add a sweet and fruity flavor.\n10. ** Toasted Oats**: Toast some rolled oats in a pan with a little cinnamon and sugar for a crunchy and sweet topping.\n\nSince you have some time to prep in the morning, you could try making your own toppings ahead of time. For example, you could toast some nuts or coconut flakes the night before, or caramelize bananas in the morning while you're getting ready.\n\nWhich of these toppings sounds appealing to you? Do you have any other dietary restrictions or preferences I can consider?",
