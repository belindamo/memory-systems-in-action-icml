  "content": "Late May to early June is a great time to visit New York City, and the weather is usually quite pleasant during that period.\n\nIn New York City, late spring is a transitional season, and the weather can be quite lovely. Here's what you can expect:\n\n* **Temperatures**: Daytime temperatures usually range from the mid-60s to mid-70s Fahrenheit (18-24\u00b0C), while nighttime temperatures can dip to the mid-50s to low 60s Fahrenheit (13-18\u00b0C).\n* **Sunshine**: May and June are relatively sunny months in NYC, with an average of 9-10 hours of sunshine per day.\n* **Rainfall**: While it's not uncommon to experience some spring showers, May and June are relatively dry months, with an average of 4-5 inches (10-13 cm) of rainfall each.\n* **Humidity**: The humidity is usually relatively low during this time, making it comfortable for outdoor activities like attending a baseball game.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to pack layers, as the temperature can drop significantly at night, especially in the evenings. You might want to bring:\n\n* Lightweight clothing for warm days\n* A light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings\n* Comfortable shoes for walking around the city\n* A waterproof jacket or umbrella (just in case!)\n\nFor a Yankees game, you'll likely be sitting outside, so be prepared for the sun and potential wind. Don't forget to wear sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses to protect yourself during the day.\n\nOverall, late May to early June is a great time to visit NYC, and the weather should be pleasant for a fun day at Yankee Stadium!",
