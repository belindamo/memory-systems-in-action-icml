Here are some song recommendations with a tempo range of 120-140 BPM, which is suitable for a moderate-intensity jog:\n\n1. **Upbeat Pop/Rock**:\n\t* Walk the Moon - \"Shut Up and Dance\" (128 BPM)\n\t* Imagine Dragons - \"On Top of the World\" (130 BPM)\n\t* The Script - \"Hall of Fame\" (128 BPM)\n\t* OneRepublic - \"Counting Stars\" (122 BPM)\n\t* Maroon 5 - \"One More Night\" (128 BPM)\n2. **Indie/Alternative**:\n\t* Arcade Fire - \"Wake Up\" (126 BPM)\n\t* The 1975 - \"Girls\" (128 BPM)\n\t* Two Door Cinema Club - \"Sun\" (130 BPM)\n\t* The Neighbourhood - \"Sweater Weather\" (124 BPM)\n\t* Capital Cities - \"Safe and Sound\" (128 BPM)\n3. **Electronic/Dance**:\n\t* Daft Punk - \"Technologic\" (128 BPM)\n\t* Justice - \"D.A.N.C.E.\" (128 BPM)\n\t* Passion Pit - \"Take a Walk\" (130 BPM)\n\t* Chromeo - \"Night by Night\" (128 BPM)\n\t* Moby - \"Lift Me Up\" (128 BPM)\n4. **Classic Rock/Pop**:\n\t* Queen - \"Another One Bites the Dust\" (128 BPM)\n\t* The Police - \"Message in a Bottle\" (128 BPM)\n\t* Fleetwood Mac - \"Go Your Own Way\" (124 BPM)\n\t* The Cars - \"Just What I Needed\" (128 BPM)\n\t* Tom Petty - \"Running Down a Dream\" (126 BPM)\n\nThese songs should provide a consistent beat and tempo to match your leisurely 5-mile jog pace.
