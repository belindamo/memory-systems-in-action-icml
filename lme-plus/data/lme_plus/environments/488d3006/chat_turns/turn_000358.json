  "content": "Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski and Clifford Geertz were two prominent anthropologists who studied the social and cultural practices of various groups of people, including those who engaged in cannibalism. Here are some quotes from their writings:\n\nBronis\u0142aw Malinowski:\n\n* \"Cannibalism must be regarded as a form of eating, and as a part of a general social system of food consumption.\" (from his book \"Argonauts of the Western Pacific\")\n* \"We must recognize that food plays an immense part in the daily life of savages.\" (from \"Coral Gardens and Their Magic\")\n* \"The cannibalistic idea is therefore a highly ambiguous symbol, the connotation of which can be modified in different contexts.\" (from \"Crime and Custom in Savage Society\")\n\nClifford Geertz:\n\n* \"Cannibalism is not, in any simple or straightforward way, a physiological necessity or a psychological urge, but a cultural practice, embedded in social and symbolic structures and ordered by them.\" (from \"The Interpretation of Cultures\")\n* \"Cannibalism is one of those things that everybody knows about anthropology, but nobody actually knows anything about.\" (from a lecture titled \"The Culinary Triangle\")\n\nOverall, Malinowski and Geertz viewed cannibalism as a cultural practice that was deeply embedded in the social and symbolic structures of the groups that practiced it. They emphasized the need to understand the cultural context of cannibalism in order to truly grasp its meaning and significance.",
