  "content": "I remember during my solo camping trip to Big Sur, I made sure to store my food and trash properly to avoid attracting any wildlife. I kept my food in airtight containers and stored them in my car, and I made sure to pack out all my trash when I left the campsite. It's so important to be mindful of our impact on the environment and take steps to minimize our risk of encounters with wildlife. Do you have any recommendations for bear-resistant food storage containers or bags?",
