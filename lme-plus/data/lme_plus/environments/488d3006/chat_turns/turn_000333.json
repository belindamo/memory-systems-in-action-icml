I've been trying to figure out what sets my business apart from the competition and how to communicate that effectively to my target audience. I've identified my unique selling proposition (USP) as providing personalized support and guidance to small business owners who need help with their marketing efforts. My value proposition is centered around providing expert marketing guidance and support through personalized coaching services.\n\nHowever, I'm still refining my messaging and trying to make it more concise and scannable. I want to make sure that my target audience quickly understands the value I provide and how I can help them achieve their business goals.\n\nDo you have any feedback on my USP and value proposition? Are there any areas where I can improve?",
