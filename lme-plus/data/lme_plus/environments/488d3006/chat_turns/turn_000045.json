  "content": "Yes, some of these vintage shops in Porto Alegre may carry vinyl records. In particular, Armaz\u00e9m do Passado and Casa da Sogra are known to have a selection of vintage vinyl records. Armaz\u00e9m do Passado has a variety of vinyl records ranging from Brazilian music to rock and pop from various decades. Casa da Sogra also has a selection of vinyl records, including some rare and hard-to-find titles. While Brech\u00f3 Municipal and Pinga do Brech\u00f3 may not specialize in vinyl records, they may still have a small selection for sale, so it's worth checking out. Just keep in mind that the availability and selection of vinyl records may vary depending on the shop and their current inventory. It's always best to call or check their website or social media pages to see if they have what you're looking for before heading to the shop. Good luck!",
