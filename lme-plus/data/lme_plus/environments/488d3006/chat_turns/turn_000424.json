However, I can guide you through the process of reviewing your viewing history on your own.\n\nHere's how you can review your Apple TV+ viewing history:\n\n**On an Apple Device (iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV):**\n\n1. Open the TV app on your device.\n2. Tap or click on your profile icon in the top right corner.\n3. Tap or click on \"Purchased\" or \"Rented\" (depending on your region).\n4. Scroll down to the \"Apple TV+\" section.\n5. You'll see a list of all the Apple TV+ content you've watched, including shows and movies.\n\n**On a Non-Apple Device (e.g., Smart TV, Roku, or Android):**\n\n1. Open the Apple TV app on your device.\n2. Sign in with your Apple ID and password.\n3. Navigate to the \"Library\" or \"Watch History\" section.\n4. Look for the Apple TV+ content you've watched.\n\n**Reviewing Your Viewing History:**\n\nOnce you have access to your viewing history, take a closer look at the content you've watched on Apple TV+. Ask yourself:\n\n* How often do I watch Apple TV+ content?\n* Are there any shows or movies that I've watched multiple times?\n* Are there any new shows or movies that I'm excited to watch in the coming months?\n* Has Apple TV+ become a regular part of my entertainment routine?\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide whether to keep your subscription:\n\n* Have you watched at least one Apple TV+ show or movie in the past month?\n* Are there any upcoming shows or movies that you're eagerly waiting for?\n* Do you feel that the content on Apple TV+ is worth the monthly cost?\n\nIf you find that you haven't been using Apple TV+ regularly or don't have any shows or movies that you're interested in watching, it might be worth considering canceling your subscription. On the other hand, if you've been enjoying the content and have a steady stream of shows and movies you want to watch, it might be worth keeping.\n\nRemember, you can always cancel and resubscribe to Apple TV+ at any time, so it's not a permanent decision.",
