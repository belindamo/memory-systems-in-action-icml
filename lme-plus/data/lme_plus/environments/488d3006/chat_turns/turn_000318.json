It's great that you're taking the initiative to improve your skills, and I'm sure you'll find some amazing events and instructors in your area.\n\nAnd ah, Luna the cat is a bachata fan, huh? It's not uncommon for pets to be curious and even try to \"help\" with dance practices. Maybe Luna's trying to give you some feline feedback on your technique?\n\nRemember, practice is key, and having fun while doing it is even more important. Don't be afraid to make mistakes \u2013 they're an essential part of the learning process. And who knows, maybe Luna will become your own personal dance coach or biggest fan!\n\nKeep practicing, and I'm sure you'll be dancing like a pro in no time. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further recommendations. \u00a1Disfruta el baile!",
