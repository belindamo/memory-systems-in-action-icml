  "content": "Lobel's Sandwiches are a popular choice among Yankees fans.\n\nRegarding vegetarian and vegan options, Lobel's has made an effort to cater to diverse dietary needs. While their menu is primarily focused on meats, they do offer some vegetarian and vegan options:\n\n1. **Veggie Delight**: A vegetarian sandwich featuring avocado, sprouts, cucumber, and Swiss cheese on whole wheat bread.\n2. **Grilled Veggie Wrap**: A wrap filled with grilled zucchini, eggplant, red bell peppers, and hummus.\n3. **Vegan Black Bean Wrap**: A plant-based wrap with black beans, roasted vegetables, and guacamole.\n\nPlease note that these options might be subject to change, and it's always a good idea to check with the Lobel's staff or the Yankee Stadium website for the most up-to-date menu offerings.\n\nAdditionally, Yankee Stadium has introduced more vegan and gluten-free options throughout the concourse, so you might find other suitable choices beyond Lobel's. Just look for the \"V\" or \"GF\" symbols on the menus to indicate vegan or gluten-free options.\n\nEnjoy your meal, and I hope you and Mike have a fantastic time at the game!",
