  "content": "I'd like to create a collection for my beach trip photos that includes the ones I took with my 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. Can I also add a rule to include photos with a specific keyword, like \"beach\" or \"coast\"? That way, I can catch any photos that might not have been taken with the 50mm lens but are still related to the beach trip.",
