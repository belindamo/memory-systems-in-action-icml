  "content": "Lemon Balm is a wonderful choice for a morning pick-me-up.\n\nRegarding adding honey or sugar to herbal teas, it's entirely up to personal preference. Here are some tips to consider:\n\n**Plain is perfect**: Herbal teas can be quite delicate, and adding sweetener can mask their natural flavors. If you're new to herbal teas, try them plain first to appreciate their unique flavor profiles.\n\n**Honey, a gentle sweetener**: If you prefer your tea sweet, honey can be a good option. Honey's sweetness is more subtle than sugar, and it can complement the flavors of some herbal teas, like Lemon Balm. Start with a small amount (about 1-2 teaspoons) and adjust to taste.\n\n**Sugar, a bolder sweetener**: Sugar can overpower the flavors of herbal teas, so use it sparingly. If you prefer sugar, try using a small amount (about 1-2 teaspoons) and adjust to taste.\n\n**Other sweetener options**: You can also experiment with other natural sweeteners like stevia, agave nectar, or monk fruit sweetener if you're watching your calorie intake.\n\n**Lemon Balm and honey, a lovely pair**: In the case of Lemon Balm, a small amount of honey can enhance the tea's citrusy flavor and create a soothing, sweet-and-sour taste experience.\n\nRemember, the key is to taste as you go and adjust the sweetness to your liking. You can always add more honey or sugar, but it's harder to remove excess sweetness from your tea.\n\nEnjoy your Lemon Balm tea, and I hope you find the perfect balance of flavors for your taste buds!",
