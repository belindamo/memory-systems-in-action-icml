I'm particularly interested in visiting Fushimi Inari Shrine and Kinkaku-ji Temple, as I've heard so much about them. By the way, speaking of must-see places, I remember walking through the Fushimi Inari shrine during my solo trip to Japan last year, and it was such an incredible experience. The vibrant orange torii gates were so striking, and the hike up the mountain was really peaceful.",
