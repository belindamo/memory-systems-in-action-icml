This is combined with a forefoot Zoom unit for added cushioning and court feel.\n3. **Support:** The Why Not Zer0.4 features a low-cut collar for a more minimalist feel, but still provides good ankle support and stability. The shoe also has a sturdy heel counter to prevent slipping and provide additional support during lateral movements.\n4. **Traction:** The outsole features a unique herringbone traction pattern, designed to provide excellent grip and traction on the court.\n\n**Performance:**\nThe Why Not Zer0.4 is designed for high-level performance, similar to the LeBron 19.
