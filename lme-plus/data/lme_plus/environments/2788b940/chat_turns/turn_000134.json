The interactive dinosaur encyclopaedia will be designed to complement and enhance the existing dinosaur exhibits, providing additional layers of information and interactive experiences that cater to a diverse range of visitors, particularly children. The prototype will serve as a proof of concept, with the potential for future development and implementation at the museum.\n\nProblem Statement\nThe Naturalis Museum proudly showcases an impressive collection of dinosaur fossils, inspiring visitors to discover the richness of nature. To further align with its educational mission, the museum could benefit from an engaging and educational interactive dinosaur encyclopaedia that effectively presents relevant information in an accessible, immersive, and entertaining way. By offering an interactive experience that promotes learning through play and exploration, essential for children's cognitive development, the museum can encourage visitors of all ages to be more enthusiastic about dinosaurs, eager to learn and investigate.\n\nGoal\nThe goal of this project is to design a user-centred, clickable prototype for an interactive touchscreen dinosaur encyclopaedia that effectively enhances the learning experience for visitors at the Naturalis Museum, promoting a deeper understanding and appreciation for the richness of nature, particularly dinosaurs. The encyclopaedia will captivate visitors by providing engaging and immersive educational content, encouraging exploration, and fostering a passion for learning about the natural world. The encyclopaedia should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and age-appropriate, incorporating various multimedia elements and interactive features.",
