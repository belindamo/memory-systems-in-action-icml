Here is some suggested verbiage that you could use to close an annuity sale without directly asking if the client is ready to move forward:\n\n\"Based on our conversation today, it seems that an annuity could be a good fit for your investment strategy. It can provide you with a guaranteed income stream that can help protect against market volatility and provide peace of mind during retirement. The income rider option can help ensure that your income stream is adjusted for inflation and continues for the duration of your lifetime.\n\nOf course, every investment has risks and fees associated with it, but I believe that an annuity can help address some of the concerns that you have regarding longevity risk and inflation risk. We can also discuss different annuity options and riders to find the one that best meets your needs and financial goals.\n\nI'm here to help guide you through the entire process, and I'm available to answer any questions or concerns you may have. Ultimately, the decision to purchase an annuity is up to you. If you're interested, we can begin the process and move forward with the paperwork at your convenience.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist you with your financial planning.\"",
