It's also a great way to start the day feeling organized and accomplished.\n\nBy incorporating the mirror cleaning into your existing routine, you'll make it easier to maintain and won't have to worry about finding extra time in your day to do it. Plus, it's a great way to get into a habit of cleaning as you go, which can help prevent messes and make cleaning more manageable.\n\nRemember, it's all about creating small, achievable habits that can add up to make a big difference in the long run. You're already doing a great job with flossing daily and wiping down the sink and countertops, and now you're adding mirror cleaning to the mix. Keep up the good work!\n\nHow do you think you'll feel once you've established this new habit and your bathroom is consistently clean and tidy? Will it make a difference in your daily routine or overall sense of well-being?",
