  "content": "The Neck Stretch is a wonderful addition to the Neck and Shoulders Sequence, and it's easy to modify to suit your comfort level.\n\n**Neck Stretch:**\n\n1. **Start in Sphinx Pose**: Lie on your stomach with your forearms on the ground, lift your chest and head, and gaze forward. This will help you maintain a neutral spine and open chest.\n2. **Slowly tilt your head**: Gently tilt your head to the right, bringing your ear towards your right shoulder. Keep your chin level and avoid compressing your neck.\n3. **Hold and breathe**: Hold the stretch for 1-2 minutes, breathing deeply and slowly. Feel the stretch in the left side of your neck and shoulder.\n4. **Switch sides**: Repeat the stretch on the left side, tilting your head to the left and bringing your ear towards your left shoulder.\n\n**Modifications and Tips:**\n\n1. ** Gentle movement**: Move slowly and gently, avoiding any jerky or bouncy movements that might cause discomfort.\n2. **Don't force it**: If you experience any pain or discomfort, stop the stretch immediately and modify it to a more comfortable position.\n3. **Use a block or strap**: If you find it difficult to tilt your head, try using a block or strap to support your neck and shoulder. This can help you maintain a comfortable position and avoid straining.\n4. **Modify the angle**: If you find it uncomfortable to tilt your head all the way to your shoulder, try modifying the angle to a 45-degree tilt or even just a slight lean.\n5. **Add a chest opener**: If you experience any tension in your chest or shoulders, try adding a gentle chest opener, such as Sphinx Pose or Cobra Pose, before moving into the Neck Stretch.\n\n**Common Discomforts and Solutions:**\n\n1. **Neck or shoulder pain**: If you experience pain, stop the stretch and modify it to a more comfortable position. You can also try using a block or strap for support.\n2. **Dizziness or lightheadedness**: If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, slowly come out of the stretch and take a few deep breaths. You can also try practicing the stretch in a seated position instead of lying down.\n3. **Tension in the jaw or face**: If you experience tension in your jaw or face, try relaxing your facial muscles and focusing on your breath. You can also try gently massaging your jaw and face before and after the stretch.\n\nRemember, the goal of yin yoga is to honor your body's limitations and promote relaxation. If you experience any discomfort or pain, it's always better to err on the side of caution and modify the pose or come out of it altogether.",
