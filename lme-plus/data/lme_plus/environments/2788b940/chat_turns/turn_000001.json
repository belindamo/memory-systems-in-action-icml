  "content": "Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to the current demographic statistics of Armitage's population. However, I can provide some general information on how education levels impact the economy.\n\nHigher levels of education usually mean higher wages and better job opportunities, which could lead to a boosted economy. Individuals with higher education levels are more likely to obtain high-skilled jobs and contribute more to the economy. Moreover, educated individuals tend to be more innovative and entrepreneurial, leading to more job creation and economic growth.\n\nConversely, a population with low education levels could hinder the economy. Such individuals may lack the necessary skills for high-wage jobs or the know-how to create new businesses. This may lead to a loss of potential income for the individuals themselves and the town or city where they reside.\n\nOverall, education levels play an essential role in the economic well-being of a community.",
