  "content": "Context\nThe project will be set within the Naturalis Museum, the biodiversity center in Leiden, which aims to encourage visitors to discover the richness of nature. The interactive dinosaur encyclopedia will be designed to complement and enhance the existing dinosaur exhibits, providing additional layers of information and interactive experiences that cater to a diverse range of visitors, particularly children. The prototype will serve as a proof of concept, with the potential for future development and implementation at the museum. This project will be undertaken as part of a Bachelor's thesis at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.\n\nProblem Statement\nThe Naturalis Museum proudly showcases an impressive collection of dinosaur fossils, inspiring visitors to discover the richness of nature. However, there is an opportunity to further engage visitors, particularly children, by providing an accessible, immersive, and entertaining interactive dinosaur encyclopedia that aligns with the museum's educational mission. By offering an interactive experience that promotes learning through play and exploration, essential for children's cognitive development, the museum can encourage visitors of all ages to become more enthusiastic about dinosaurs, eager to learn and investigate.\n\nGoal\nThe goal of this project is to design a user-centered, clickable prototype for an interactive touchscreen dinosaur encyclopedia that effectively enhances the learning experience for visitors at the Naturalis Museum, promoting a deeper understanding and appreciation for the richness of nature, particularly dinosaurs. The encyclopedia will captivate visitors by providing engaging and immersive educational content, encouraging exploration, and fostering a passion for learning about the natural world. The encyclopedia should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and age-appropriate, incorporating various multimedia elements and interactive features. The development and assessment of the prototype will be conducted according to the standards and requirements of a Bachelor's thesis at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.",
