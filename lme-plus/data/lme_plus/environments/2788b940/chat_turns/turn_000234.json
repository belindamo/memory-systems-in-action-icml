Plus, it's one less thing to worry about when I'm getting ready in the morning. I'll be able to focus on more important things, like getting to work on time or planning out my day.\n\nAlso, I've been thinking about my partner's complaint about the toilet paper holder being too low. I might surprise them and raise it this weekend. Do you have any tips on how to do that safely and efficiently?",
