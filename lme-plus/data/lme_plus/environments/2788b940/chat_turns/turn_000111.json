Make sure to remove any excess water to prevent water spots.\n7. **Use a cleaning solution (optional)**: If you want to add an extra layer of protection or remove tough stains, apply a sneaker cleaning solution (like Nikwax Tech Wash or Jason Markk Repel) according to the product's instructions.\n8. **Dry the shoes**: Use a clean, dry cloth to blot the shoes and remove any excess moisture.
