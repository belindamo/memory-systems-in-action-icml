This sets the tone for the discussion.\n3. **Start with Open-Ended Questions**: Begin with broad, open-ended questions that encourage members to share their thoughts and opinions.

Encourage members to respectfully disagree and engage in constructive discussions.\n9. **Summarize and Wrap Up**: Towards the end of the discussion, summarize the key points and takeaways.

This shows that you're willing to adapt and respond to the group's needs.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to leading a engaging and thought-provoking book club discussion. Good luck, and I hope your book club enjoys discussing \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\"!",
