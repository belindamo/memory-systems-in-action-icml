Here are some tips to help you create an eye-catching display:\n\n1. **Create a cohesive look**: Choose a unifying theme, color scheme, or style for your display to create a cohesive look. This will help customers quickly understand your aesthetic and make your booth more visually appealing.\n2. **Use risers and levels**: Varying the heights of your displays using risers, pedestals, or shelves will add visual interest and create a sense of depth. This will also help customers see your pieces from different angles.\n3. **Group similar pieces together**: Grouping similar pieces, such as sculptures or wall art, together can create a sense of abundance and make it easier for customers to compare and choose.\n4. **Balance and symmetry**: Balance your display with a mix of large and small pieces, and consider creating a sense of symmetry to create a sense of harmony.\n5. **Lighting**: Good lighting can make a huge difference in highlighting your pieces. Consider using spotlights, LED lights, or natural light to showcase your work.\n6. **Backgrounds and linens**: Use neutral or complementary-colored backgrounds, tablecloths, or linens to create a clean and professional look. Avoid busy patterns or bright colors that might distract from your pieces.\n7. **Signage and labels**: Clearly label each piece with its title, price, and any relevant information (e.g., materials used). Consider creating a sign with your artist name, website, or social media handles.\n8. **Leave space to breathe**: Don't overcrowd your display. Leave enough space between pieces to create a sense of breathing room and make it easy for customers to view each piece individually.\n9. **Create a focal point**: Designate a central piece or area as the focal point of your display to draw customers in. This could be a particularly striking piece or a collection of smaller pieces arranged together.\n10. **Be prepared to rearrange**: Be prepared to adjust your display throughout the craft fair based on customer feedback and sales. This will help you refine your display and make it more effective.\n\nSome additional tips specific to ceramic decorative pieces:\n\n* Consider displaying your pieces on a decorative tablecloth or fabric that complements the colors and textures of your ceramics.\n* Use small pedestals or stands to elevate your pieces and create a sense of drama.\n* Group smaller pieces, like ornaments or mini-sculptures, together in a decorative bowl or vase to create a visually appealing arrangement.\n* Consider displaying your pieces on a wall or using a grid system to create a sense of depth and visual interest.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a beautiful and visually appealing display that showcases your decorative ceramic pieces and attracts customers to your booth!",
