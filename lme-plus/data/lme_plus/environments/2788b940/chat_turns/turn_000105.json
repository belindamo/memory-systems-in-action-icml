  "content": "I completely understand your concern! It's essential to prioritize your lower back health and avoid any poses that might exacerbate the issue.\n\nThe Neck Stretch I mentioned earlier does require some extension in the lower back, which might not be suitable for everyone, especially if you're experiencing lower back issues. Instead, I recommend focusing on neck and shoulder stretches that don't put pressure on your lower back. Here are some alternative poses you can try:\n\n**Neck and Shoulder Stretches without Lower Back Pressure:**\n\n1. **Ear to Shoulder**: Sit comfortably with your back straight, then gently bring your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute and switch sides.\n2. **Chin Tucks**: Sit or stand with good posture, then tuck your chin towards your chest. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute and release. Repeat 3-5 times.\n3. **Shoulder Rolls**: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion. Repeat 5-10 times.\n4. **Arm Circles**: Hold your arms straight out to the sides at shoulder height. Make small circles with your hands for 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n5. **Seated Neck Stretch**: Sit comfortably with your back straight, then gently turn your head to the right, bringing your ear towards your right shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute and switch sides.\n\n**Tips for Modifying Poses:**\n\n1. **Use props**: If you need to modify a pose, use props like blocks, straps, or pillows to support your body and maintain comfort.\n2. **Choose seated or standing poses**: Avoid lying down or bending forward, which can put pressure on your lower back.\n3. **Focus on gentle movements**: Avoid jerky or bouncy movements, and instead focus on slow, gentle movements that don't exacerbate your lower back issues.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your body's comfort and safety. If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop the stretch immediately and consult with a healthcare professional or yoga therapist for personalized guidance.\n\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!",
