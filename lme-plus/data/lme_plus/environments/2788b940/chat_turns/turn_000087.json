  "content": "Yes, it's a good idea to train your dog to stay calm when people visit. Here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. Teach your dog basic obedience commands such as \"sit\", \"stay\", \"come\", and \"leave it\". This training will help your dog listen to your commands when they are feeling overexcited.\n\n2. When visitors arrive, keep your dog on a leash or in a gated area. This will prevent them from jumping up or getting too close to visitors.\n\n3. Practice desensitization techniques by gradually exposing your dog to different visitors coming to your home or practicing with friends and family that you can familiarize your pet with.\n\n4. Reward your dog for good behavior. Giving your dog treats, praise, or a favorite toy, will help reinforce their calm behavior.\n\n5. Avoid reinforcing excited behavior. Don't give your dog attention, or let them greet visitors until they are calm and relaxed.\n\n6. Ensure your dog gets enough physical and mental stimulation daily. Boredom and a lack of exercise can cause overexcited behavior.\n\nRemember, training takes patience, dedication, and consistency. By following these tips and practicing regularly, you can help your dog stay calm and well-behaved around visitors.",
