Here are a few popular methods to get you started:\n\n**1. French Press Coffee**\n\n* 1 cup coarsely ground coffee beans\n* 4 cups water\n* Optional: sugar, cream, or flavorings\n\nCombine coffee and water in a French press.

Drip Coffee**\n\n* 1 cup coarsely ground coffee beans\n* 4 cups water\n* Optional: paper filter, sugar, cream, or flavorings\n\nUse a drip coffee maker or a pour-over cone with a paper filter. Add coffee grounds and water, and brew according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n**3. Cold Brew Coffee**\n\n* 1 cup coarsely ground coffee beans\n* 4 cups cold water\n* Optional: sugar, cream, or flavorings\n\nCombine coffee and water in a large container.

Espresso-Style Coffee**\n\n* 1 shot of finely ground coffee beans (about 1 tablespoon)\n* 1 cup hot water\n* Optional: sugar, cream, or flavorings\n\nUse an espresso machine or a stovetop espresso maker.
