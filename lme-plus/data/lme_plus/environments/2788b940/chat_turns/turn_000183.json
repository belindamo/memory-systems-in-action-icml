Helmet availability: Many bike-sharing programs offer helmets to riders at the time of rental. Some programs require riders to wear helmets, while others strongly recommend it.\n\n2. Rider education: Bike-sharing programs offer rider education training to inform riders of safe cycling practices. This may include tips such as riding in designated bike lanes or signaling when turning.\n\n3. Bike maintenance: Regular maintenance of the bicycles in the bike-sharing fleet is critical to ensure their safety. Bike-sharing programs carry out frequent maintenance checks and repairs to keep their bicycles in proper working condition.\n\n4. GPS tracking: Many bike-sharing programs use GPS tracking technology to keep track of their bicycles and to ensure they are being used safely. This technology can help identify unsafe behaviors, such as riding on sidewalks or through crowded areas.\n\n5. Infrastructure improvements: Bike-sharing programs work with city officials to improve infrastructure for cycling, such as adding bike lanes, bike parking, and traffic calming measures.\n\n6. Restricted areas: Bike-sharing programs may restrict certain areas or streets from bike use, especially in high-traffic areas, to prevent accidents and ensure rider safety.\n\nOverall, bike-sharing programs take rider safety seriously and use various measures to ensure that their riders can use bicycles in a safe and convenient way, especially in busy cities.",
