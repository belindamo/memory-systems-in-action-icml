  "content": "Yes, people do still go diving to explore the shipwrecks on Lake Superior. While many of the wrecks are deep and require specialized equipment and training, there are some that can be explored by divers of all levels.\n\nThere are also tour companies that offer boat tours of the shipwrecks, allowing visitors to see the wrecks from above the water. Some of these tours even provide researchers and historians as guides to explain the stories behind the wrecks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that divers and visitors need to show respect for the shipwrecks and the memories of those who lost their lives. As such, many of the wrecks are protected by law, and it is against the law to remove artifacts from them.",
