  "content": "D. 12 months\n\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), if a consumer claims in good faith that he or she has been a victim of a fraud-related crime, a nationwide consumer reporting agency must include a fraud alert on the consumer's credit report for at least 12 months. A fraud alert is a notice that is placed on a consumer's credit report to alert creditors and other organizations that the consumer may be a victim of identity theft or fraud. The fraud alert requires creditors and other organizations to take additional steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending credit or taking other actions that may involve the use of the consumer's personal information.\n\nFraud alerts are an important tool for helping to protect consumers against identity theft and fraud. If a consumer believes that he or she may be a victim of identity theft or fraud, he or she can contact a nationwide consumer reporting agency and request that a fraud alert be placed on their credit report. The consumer will then need to provide appropriate documentation, such as a police report, to confirm that they are a victim of fraud. Once the fraud alert is placed on the consumer's credit report, it will remain in effect for at least 12 months, unless the consumer requests that it be removed earlier. It is important for consumers to be proactive in protecting their personal information and to take steps to prevent identity theft and fraud.",
