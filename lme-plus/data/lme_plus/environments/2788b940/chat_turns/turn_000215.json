Here are some pros and cons of selling functional vs. decorative pieces to help you decide:\n\n**Functional Pieces:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Practical appeal**: Functional pieces like mugs, bowls, and plates are useful and can be used daily, making them appealing to customers.\n2. **Broad appeal**: Functional pieces tend to appeal to a wider audience, as people are more likely to buy something they can use.\n3. **Pricing**: Functional pieces can be priced competitively, as customers are often willing to pay for something they can use regularly.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Competition**: Functional pieces are often more common at craft fairs, so you may face more competition from other sellers.\n2. **Quality control**: Functional pieces need to be durable and food-safe, which can be a challenge for beginners. You'll need to ensure your pieces meet these standards.\n\n**Decorative Pieces:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Unique appeal**: Decorative pieces like sculptures, figurines, or wall art can be truly unique and showcase your creativity.\n2. **Less competition**: Decorative pieces are often less common at craft fairs, so you may stand out from the crowd.\n3. **Artistic expression**: Decorative pieces allow you to express your artistic vision without the constraints of functionality.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Niche appeal**: Decorative pieces may appeal to a smaller audience, as they're often more subjective in terms of taste.\n2. **Pricing**: Decorative pieces can be priced higher, but you'll need to justify the price with the piece's uniqueness, quality, and your artistic skill.\n\nConsidering you've only been taking classes for a few months, I'd recommend starting with decorative pieces. Here's why:\n\n1. **Less pressure**: Decorative pieces don't require the same level of functionality and durability, so you can focus on showcasing your creativity without worrying about food safety or durability.\n2. **Develop your style**: Decorative pieces allow you to experiment with different techniques, forms, and themes, helping you develop your unique style and artistic voice.\n3. **Lower risk**: If you're new to selling your work, decorative pieces can be a lower-risk option. You can test the market, gather feedback, and refine your skills without investing too much time and resources.\n\nThat being said, if you have a few functional pieces that you're confident in, it's okay to bring a small selection to the craft fair. Just make sure you're prepared to address any quality control concerns and price them competitively.\n\nRemember, the craft fair is an opportunity to learn, gain experience, and get feedback from customers. Focus on showcasing your creativity, and don't be afraid to experiment and adapt as you go!",
