The hike up the mountain can be challenging, but the scenery and the sense of accomplishment make it well worth it.\n\nI'm glad you have fond memories of your solo trip to Japan, and I'm sure you'll create even more unforgettable experiences on this trip. Kyoto has a way of captivating visitors, and I'm sure you'll fall in love with the city all over again.\n\nSince you've already visited Fushimi Inari Shrine, you might want to consider exploring some of the lesser-known trails and areas within the shrine. For example, you could hike up to the Okusha Shrine, which is located at the top of the mountain and offers stunning views of Kyoto. Or, you could explore the smaller, quieter trails that branch off from the main path, which can be just as beautiful and peaceful.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, I'm sure you'll have an amazing time in Kyoto. Enjoy your trip, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more recommendations or advice!",
