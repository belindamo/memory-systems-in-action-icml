  "content": "While the wild thing on the cover of the 25th anniversary edition of Where the Wild Things Are could be interpreted as Max in his wild thing costume, the image is more likely meant to represent one of the wild things that Max encounters on the island. The wild things are a central part of the story, and their inclusion on the cover helps to convey the sense of adventure and excitement that Max experiences in the story. Additionally, Max is typically portrayed in his wolf suit on the cover and in the illustrations, so it is unlikely that he would be depicted in the guise of a wild thing on the cover.",
