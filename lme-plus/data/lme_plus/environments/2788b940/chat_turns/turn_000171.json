Congratulations on repotting your plant and helping it recover. Here are some general tips to keep your indoor plants happy and thriving:\n\n**1. Lighting:** Most plants need bright, indirect light. Placing plants near a sunny window or using grow lights can help. However, some plants like low-light conditions, so research the specific needs of your plant.\n\n**2. Watering:** Overwatering is a common mistake. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Water only when the soil feels dry. Water thoroughly, but make sure the pot has good drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.\n\n**3. Humidity:** Indoor plants prefer a humid environment, typically between 40-60% relative humidity. You can increase humidity around your plant by placing it on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier.\n\n**4. Temperature:** Most plants prefer daytime temperatures between 65-75\u00b0F (18-24\u00b0C) and nighttime temperatures 5-10\u00b0F (3-6\u00b0C) lower. Avoid placing plants near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n\n**5. Fertilization:** Feed your plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n\n**6. Pruning:** Prune your plant regularly to maintain its shape, encourage growth, and remove dead or diseased leaves. Use clean, sharp tools to prevent spreading diseases.\n\n**7. Potting mix and repotting:** Use a well-draining potting mix to prevent waterlogged soil. Repot your plant every 1-3 years, as needed, to provide fresh nutrients and a larger pot if necessary.\n\n**8. Pest control:** Check your plant regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or aphids. Isolate infested plants, and treat them with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n\n**9. Soil pH:** Most plants prefer a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH (6.0-7.0). Test your soil pH and adjust it if necessary.\n\n**10. Observe and adjust:** Monitor your plant's response to its environment and adjust your care routine accordingly. Research specific care requirements for your plant species, as some may have unique needs.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to becoming an indoor plant expert!\n\nWhat type of plant do you have, and what challenges were you facing before repotting?",
