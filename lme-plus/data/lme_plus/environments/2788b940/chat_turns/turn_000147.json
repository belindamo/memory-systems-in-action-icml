  "content": "EcoAdventure International's \"Surf and Turf\" trip is an exciting adventure that combines surfing, hiking, and cultural experiences in Costa Rica. Here's what I found out about the accommodations and meals on this trip:\n\n**Accommodations:**\n\n* EcoAdventure International uses a combination of eco-lodges, boutique hotels, and surf camps to provide comfortable and sustainable accommodations throughout the trip.\n* You can expect to stay in shared rooms or cabins with private bathrooms, and some properties may have amenities like pools, yoga decks, or ocean views.\n* The accommodations are carefully selected to minimize environmental impact and support local communities.\n\n**Meals:**\n\n* Meals are a fusion of traditional Costa Rican cuisine with modern twists, using fresh, locally sourced ingredients whenever possible.\n* Breakfasts typically include options like gallo pinto (a traditional Costa Rican dish), fruits, and granola, while lunches might feature sandwiches, salads, or soups.\n* Dinners are often three-course meals, with dishes like seafood paella, grilled meats, or vegetarian options.\n* Snacks and refreshments are provided throughout the day, and you'll have opportunities to try local specialties like ceviche or empanadas.\n\n**Airport Transfers and Travel Arrangements:**\n\n* EcoAdventure International offers airport transfers from San Jos\u00e9 (SJO) or Liberia (LIR) airports to the starting point of the trip.\n* They can also assist with arranging additional travel arrangements, such as domestic flights or shuttle services, if you need to travel to or from other destinations in Costa Rica.\n* You'll need to book your international flights to Costa Rica separately, but EcoAdventure International can provide guidance on the best arrival and departure dates for the trip.\n\n**Other Logistics:**\n\n* EcoAdventure International provides all necessary equipment for surfing, hiking, and other activities, so you don't need to bring your own gear.\n* They also provide transportation between activities, so you can focus on enjoying the trip without worrying about logistics.\n* The trip leaders and guides are experienced and knowledgeable about the local environment, culture, and activities, and will ensure your safety and comfort throughout the trip.\n\nIt's always a good idea to confirm the details with EcoAdventure International directly, but they seem to have a reputation for providing excellent service and attention to detail.",
