Here are some general tips to help you prevent acne:\n\n1. **Keep your skin clean**: Wash your face twice a day, morning and night, using a gentle cleanser that suits your skin type. Be sure to remove all makeup and impurities before bedtime.\n2. **Use the right products**: Choose products labeled \"non-comedogenic\" or \"oil-free\" as they are less likely to clog pores. Look for products containing salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil, which have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.\n3. **Exfoliate regularly**: Exfoliating helps remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, reducing the risk of acne. Use a gentle exfoliating scrub or a chemical exfoliant containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) one to three times a week.\n4. **Moisturize**: Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated. Look for moisturizers containing hyaluronic acid, which can help retain moisture without clogging pores.\n5. **Keep your hands away**: Try to avoid touching your face, especially your nose, mouth, and forehead, as this can transfer bacteria and oils to your skin.\n6. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to flush toxins out of your body and keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.\n7. **Eat a balanced diet**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help regulate your skin. Avoid processed and sugary foods that can trigger inflammation.\n8. **Manage stress**: High stress levels can lead to acne. Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n9. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate your skin and reduce stress.\n10. **Don't overdo it**: Avoid using too many products or over-exfoliating, as this can irritate your skin and lead to more acne.\n\nSince you've been using a new face wash for a month and it's been helping, it's great that you're already on the right track! Continue to monitor your skin and adjust your skincare routine as needed. If your skin issues persist or worsen, consider consulting a dermatologist for personalized advice.\n\nRemember, everyone's skin is unique, so it may take some trial and error to find the right combination of products and habits that work for you. Be patient, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns!",
