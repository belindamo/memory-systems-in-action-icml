You can also consider mulching around the base of the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.\n\nMoving on to your bookshelf organization... Congratulations on decluttering and donating books to the local library! Here are some tips to help you organize your bookshelf:\n\n**1. Categorize and group:** Divide your books into categories (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, biographies, self-help, etc.). Within each category, group books by author, title, or color to create a visually pleasing arrangement.\n\n**2. Prioritize frequently read books:** Place your most frequently read or favorite books at eye level or near the front of the shelf for easy access.\n\n**3. Use bookends and dividers:** Bookends can keep books upright and organized, while dividers can separate categories or create sections within a category.\n\n**4. Store less frequently used books:** Consider storing less frequently used books, such as reference books or textbooks, on higher or lower shelves to free up prime space for your favorite titles.\n\n**5. Leave some space:** Don't overcrowd your shelves. Leave about 1-2 inches of space between books to create a clean, uncluttered look and make it easier to add or remove books.\n\n**6. Consider a rainbow organization:** Organize your books by color to create a visually appealing rainbow effect on your shelf. This can be a fun and creative way to display your book collection.\n\n**7. Keep related items together:** Store bookmarks, booklights, or other reading accessories in a designated area, like a small basket or container, to keep them organized and within reach.\n\n**8. Dust and clean regularly:** Regularly dust and clean your bookshelf to keep it looking its best and prevent dust from accumulating on your books.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you'll be able to create a beautiful and functional bookshelf that showcases your love for reading.\n\nDo you have a favorite book or author that you're particularly proud to display on your bookshelf?",
