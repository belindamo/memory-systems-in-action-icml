  "content": "Payoff matrix:\n\nIn order to determine the optimal solution for improving our employee onboarding process, we can use a payoff matrix to weigh the pros and cons of each technique. In this case, the payoff matrix might look something like this:\n\n| Technique | Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lateral synthesis | Generates a wide range of ideas that may not have been considered otherwise<br>Encourages more creative and outside-the-box thinking | May not result in a comprehensive or nuanced understanding of the problem<br>May not be practical or feasible in all cases |\n| Triangulation | Provides a more holistic and multi-faceted view of the problem<br>Develops more comprehensive and effective strategies | May require significant effort to gather and analyze feedback from multiple sources<br>May not generate transformative or disruptive ideas |\n| Fractal synthesis | Provides a more complex and nuanced understanding of the problem<br>Develops strategies that are more tailored to the specific needs and challenges of our organization | May require significant data analysis and modeling<br>May not generate innovative or creative ideas |\n\nFinal output:\n\nBased on our analysis, the optimal solution for improving our employee onboarding process is lateral synthesis. This technique generates a wide range of ideas that may not have been considered otherwise, and encourages more creative and outside-the-box thinking. While it may not result in a comprehensive or nuanced understanding of the problem, the benefits of using this technique far outweigh the costs, as it allows us to generate a wide range of potential solutions and to identify opportunities for innovation and improvement.\n\nThe second and third best techniques for this problem are triangulation and fractal synthesis, respectively. Both of these techniques can be effective tools for gaining a deeper understanding of the problem and developing targeted and effective strategies. However, they may not generate as many innovative or creative ideas as lateral synthesis, and may not be as focused on generating disruptive or transformative ideas. Nonetheless, they can still be useful tools in our toolkit, and can be employed in conjunction with lateral synthesis to achieve the best possible results.",
