Now, let's talk about adding some protein or vegetables to make the dish more substantial.\n\n**Protein options:**\n\n1. **Pan-seared chicken**: Sliced or diced chicken breast, cooked with some olive oil, garlic, and herbs, can be a great addition to the dish.\n2. **Crispy pancetta or bacon**: Crumbled or diced pancetta or bacon can add a smoky, savory flavor to the sauce.\n3. **Sauteed shrimp**: Quickly cooked shrimp can add a pop of protein and flavor to the dish.\n4. **Grilled sausage**: Sliced or crumbled sausage, like Italian sausage or Chorizo, can add a meaty, spicy flavor.\n\n**Vegetable options:**\n\n1. **Roasted vegetables**: Roasted vegetables like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, or asparagus can add some nice texture and flavor contrast to the dish.\n2. **Sauteed spinach**: Quickly cooked spinach can add a burst of nutrients and flavor to the sauce.\n3. **Sliced bell peppers**: Bell peppers can add a crunchy texture and a bit of sweetness to the dish.\n4. **Mushroom duxelles**: A mixture of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and herbs can add an earthy, umami flavor to the sauce.\n\nSome ideas for combining protein and vegetables:\n\n* **Chicken and mushroom duxelles**: Add saut\u00e9ed chicken to the mushroom duxelles and sauce for a hearty, savory option.\n* **Shrimp and spinach**: Add saut\u00e9ed shrimp and spinach to the sauce for a light, refreshing option.\n* **Pancetta and roasted vegetables**: Add crispy pancetta and roasted vegetables to the sauce for a rich, satisfying option.\n\nRemember, the key is to balance the flavors and textures so that each component complements the others. You can't go wrong with a classic combination like chicken and mushrooms, but feel free to experiment and find your own favorite pairings!\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards adding protein, vegetables, or a combination of both to your wild mushroom sauce with pappardelle?",
