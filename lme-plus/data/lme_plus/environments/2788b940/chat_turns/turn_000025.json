An annuity can provide a guaranteed income stream that can help protect against market volatility and provide peace of mind during retirement. Additionally, with the income rider option, we can ensure that your income stream is adjusted for inflation and continues for the duration of your lifetime.\n\nOf course, there are always risks and fees associated with any investment, but after careful consideration, it seems that an annuity can help address some of the concerns that you have regarding longevity risk and inflation risk. I believe that an annuity can help you meet your financial goals, and I'm here to help you through the entire process.\n\nSo, are you ready to move forward with the purchase of an annuity? If you have any additional questions or concerns, I'm happy to discuss them with you now. Otherwise, let's start the paperwork and get you on your way to a more secure retirement.\"",
