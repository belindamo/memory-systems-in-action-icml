  "content": "That's understandable, and everyone has their own comfort level and preferences when it comes to transportation. But it's important to note that cycling, even in busy cities, can be a safe and convenient mode of transportation, with numerous benefits for the environment, physical health, and personal finances.\n\nWhile there are certain risks associated with bike-sharing programs or cycling in general, there are also many measures and resources available to help ensure your safety. For example, many cities are improving infrastructure for cycling, such as adding bike lanes, traffic calming measures, and bike parking. Cities are also working to educate drivers to be more aware of cyclists on the roads.\n\nIf you are interested in trying out bike-sharing, I would encourage you to start slow and begin using it for short trips in quieter areas or in parks with bike paths. You can also start by reviewing the safety information provided by the bike-sharing program and familiarizing yourself with local traffic laws and regulations.\n\nUltimately, the choice of how to get around is a personal one and should be based on your own comfort level and preferences. But it's always good to consider all the options available and weigh the benefits and risks of each.",
