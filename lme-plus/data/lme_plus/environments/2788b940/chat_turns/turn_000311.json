I'll definitely focus on Gion, Ponto-cho, and Nishiki Market for food exploration. By the way, speaking of amazing food discoveries, I still remember that incredible ramen shop I stumbled upon in Kyoto during my solo trip - it was a real highlight of my trip. Do you have any recommendations for good ramen shops in Kyoto?",
