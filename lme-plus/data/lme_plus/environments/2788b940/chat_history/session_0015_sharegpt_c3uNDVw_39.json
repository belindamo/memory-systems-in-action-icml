      "content": "Problem Statement: The Naturalis Museum proudly showcases an impressive collection of dinosaur fossils, inspiring visitors to discover the richness of nature. To further align with its educational mission, the museum could benefit from an engaging and educational interactive dinosaur encyclopedia that presents relevant information in an accessible, immersive, and entertaining way. By offering an interactive experience that promotes learning through play and exploration, essential for children's cognitive development, the museum can encourage visitors of all ages to be more enthusiastic about nature, eager to learn and investigate.\n\nGoal: The goal of this project is to design and develop an interactive dinosaur encyclopedia that enhances the learning experience for visitors at the Naturalis Museum, promoting a deeper understanding and appreciation for the richness of nature, particularly dinosaurs. The encyclopedia will captivate visitors by providing engaging and immersive educational content, encouraging exploration, and fostering a passion for learning about the natural world.\n\nContext: The project will be set within the Naturalis Museum, a national museum of history in Leiden, which aims to encourage visitors to discover the richness of nature. The interactive dinosaur encyclopedia will be designed to complement and enhance the existing dinosaur exhibits, providing additional layers of information and interactive experiences that cater to a diverse range of visitors, particularly children.\n\nMethodology: The project will follow a user-centered design approach, focusing on the needs and preferences of the Naturalis Museum's visitors. The process will involve four main phases: research, concepting, design, and testing. In each phase, the educational mission of Naturalis will be kept in mind, ensuring that the final product aligns with the museum's core values and objectives. By incorporating relevant research, effective design methods, and iterative testing, the interactive dinosaur encyclopedia will provide an engaging, educational, and enjoyable experience that embodies the spirit of Naturalis' mission: \"Together, we discover the richness of nature.\""
