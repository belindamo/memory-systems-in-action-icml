On November 10, 1975, the ship sank during a severe storm on Lake Superior, taking all 29 crew members with it. The tragedy was immortalized in the song \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" by Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nAnother notable shipwreck is the SS Cyprus, which sank in 1907 after being caught in a storm. The ship was carrying a cargo of copper, and some estimates suggest that as much as 20 million pounds of copper remain on the lake bottom to this day.\n\nThere are many other shipwrecks on Lake Superior that have captured people's imaginations over the years, making it a fascinating destination for divers and history buffs alike."

      "content": "Yes, people do still go diving to explore the shipwrecks on Lake Superior. While many of the wrecks are deep and require specialized equipment and training, there are some that can be explored by divers of all levels.\n\nThere are also tour companies that offer boat tours of the shipwrecks, allowing visitors to see the wrecks from above the water. Some of these tours even provide researchers and historians as guides to explain the stories behind the wrecks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that divers and visitors need to show respect for the shipwrecks and the memories of those who lost their lives. As such, many of the wrecks are protected by law, and it is against the law to remove artifacts from them."
