      "content": "Yes, there are a few things you can do to help your candles last longer:\n\n1. Trim the wick: Before you light your candle, make sure to trim the wick to about 1/4 inch. A longer wick can cause the flame to burn too high, which can result in the wax melting faster and the candle burning out more quickly.\n\n2. Burn the candle for long enough: It's important to burn your candle for long enough so that the wax melts evenly across the entire surface. This will prevent tunneling, where the wax only melts in the center, leaving wax along the edges of the container. To do this, burn your candle for 1 hour per inch of its diameter each time you light it.\n\n3. Avoid drafts: Burning your candle in a drafty room or near an open window will cause the candle to burn faster, reducing its overall lifespan. So, make sure to place your candle in a still location away from any drafts.\n\n4. Use a candle snuffer: Blowing out a candle can create smoke, which can build up on the wick and affect the scent of the candle. To avoid this, use a candle snuffer to extinguish the flame instead.\n\nBy following these tips, you may be able to enjoy your candles for a longer period of time and get the most out of your investment."
