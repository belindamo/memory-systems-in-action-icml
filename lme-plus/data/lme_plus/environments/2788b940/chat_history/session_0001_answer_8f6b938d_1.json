Examples include leg swings, arm circles, hip openers, and torso twists.

This will help engage your core and prepare your lower body for the high-energy movements.\n4. **Mobility Exercises**: Do some mobility exercises like leg swings, high knees, or side-to-side shuffles to loosen up your hips, knees, and ankles.\n5. **Get Your Groove On**: Put on your favorite upbeat song and dance around! Get your body moving, tap your feet, and get those endorphins pumping. This will help get you in the right mindset and get your energy levels up.\n\nRemember to keep your warm-up gentle and gradual. You want to increase your heart rate and temperature, but you don't want to exhaust yourself before the class even starts.\n\nHere's an example of what your 15-minute warm-up routine could look like:\n\n* 3 minutes of light jogging in place or jumping jacks\n* 4 minutes of dynamic stretching (leg swings, arm circles, hip openers, etc.)\n* 3 minutes of muscle activation (planks, leg raises, glute bridges, etc.)\n* 3 minutes of mobility exercises (leg swings, high knees, side-to-side shuffles, etc.)\n* 2 minutes of dancing to your favorite song to get pumped up and ready to go!\n\nBy following this warm-up routine, you'll be ready to take on your Zumba class with energy, enthusiasm, and a reduced risk of injury.
