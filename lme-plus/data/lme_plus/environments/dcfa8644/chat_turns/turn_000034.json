I'll definitely need to prioritize rest and recovery, as well as listen to my body and make adjustments as needed. I might consider working with a coach or experienced triathlete to help me develop a customized training plan.\n\nBy the way, speaking of customized training plans, do you have any tips on how to create a balanced training plan that incorporates all three disciplines of triathlon training? I want to make sure I'm allocating my time and energy effectively to improve my overall performance.",
