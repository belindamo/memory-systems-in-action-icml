  "content": "Poisson's ratio is a measure of the deformation of a material in response to an applied force, and is defined as the negative ratio of the transverse strain to the axial strain:\n\n\u03bd = -\u03b5\\_lateral / \u03b5\\_axial\n\nwhere \u03bd is Poisson's ratio, \u03b5\\_lateral is the lateral or transverse strain, and \u03b5\\_axial is the axial or longitudinal strain.\n\nIn other words, Poisson's ratio describes the degree to which a material will deform laterally or transversely when it is stretched or compressed axially. If Poisson's ratio is positive, the material will tend to expand laterally when stretched axially, and contract laterally when compressed axially. If Poisson's ratio is negative, the opposite is true: the material will tend to contract laterally when stretched axially, and expand laterally when compressed axially. If Poisson's ratio is exactly 0, the material will not deform laterally when stretched or compressed axially.\n\nPoisson's ratio is a dimensionless quantity and its value typically ranges between -1 and 0.5 for most materials, although some materials may have negative or greater-than-0.5 values in certain circumstances.\n\nThe value of Poisson's ratio is an important material property that can affect the mechanical behavior of a material. For example, materials with high Poisson's ratios tend to be more compliant and deformable than materials with low Poisson's ratios. Poisson's ratio is often used in the design and analysis of structures and components to predict their deformation and failure behavior under different loading conditions.",
