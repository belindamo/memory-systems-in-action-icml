I've been experimenting with different cuisines lately, and recently took a cooking class where we learned how to make homemade pasta from scratch. It was a lot of fun and I was surprised at how easy it was to make. Anyway, back to the Vegetable Wot, do you have any suggestions for a side dish that would complement the flavors of the stew?",
