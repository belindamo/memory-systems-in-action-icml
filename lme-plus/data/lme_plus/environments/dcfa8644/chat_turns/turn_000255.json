Clarks and Vans are both great brands with a wide range of neutral shoes that should complement your yellow shirt and white pants nicely.\n\nAnd that's so sweet that you and your family got matching outfits! It's always fun to have a special bonding experience like that. I'm sure you'll treasure the memories of wearing those outfits together.
