Since bedrooms often have limited direct sunlight, I'll recommend plants that can thrive in indirect sunlight and are great air purifiers:\n\n1. **Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)**: Pothos is a popular choice for bedrooms because it can tolerate low to medium indirect sunlight. It's also a great air purifier, removing toxins like formaldehyde and benzene from the air.\n2. **Snake Plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata)**: Snake plants are known for their ability to purify the air and thrive in low-light conditions, making them perfect for bedrooms. They can remove toxins like formaldehyde and benzene from the air.\n3. **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii)**: Peace lilies prefer well-draining soil and indirect sunlight, making them a great choice for bedrooms. They're also excellent air purifiers, removing pollutants like ammonia, benzene, and acetone from the air.\n4. **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**: Dracaena is a versatile plant that can tolerate low to medium indirect sunlight. It's also a great air purifier, removing toxins like trichloroethylene and formaldehyde from the air.\n5. **Philodendron (Philodendron spp.)**: Philodendron is a low-maintenance plant that can thrive in indirect sunlight.
