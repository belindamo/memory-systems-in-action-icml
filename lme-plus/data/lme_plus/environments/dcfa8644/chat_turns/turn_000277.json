It's great that you're thinking about it, and it's always better to double-check than to risk neglecting important tasks.\n\n**Tips to Help You Keep Track:**\n\n1. **Check your owner's manual**: Your car's manual usually has a maintenance schedule section that outlines recommended tasks and intervals.\n2. **Look for stickers or reminders**: Many oil change shops and mechanics leave stickers on your windshield or provide reminders for upcoming maintenance tasks.\n3. **Use a maintenance log**: Keep a log or spreadsheet to record your car's maintenance history, including oil changes, tire rotations, and other tasks.\n4. **Set reminders**: Set reminders on your phone or calendar for upcoming maintenance tasks, so you don't forget.\n5. **Check your car's computer**: Many modern cars have built-in systems that track maintenance tasks and provide reminders.\n\n**When in Doubt, Check the Oil:**\n\nIf you're unsure when your last oil change was, it's always a good idea to check the oil level and condition. Here's how:\n\n1. Make sure your car is parked on a level surface.\n2. Turn off the engine and let it sit for a few minutes.\n3. Locate the oil dipstick under the hood.\n4. Pull out the dipstick and wipe it clean with a lint-free rag or paper towel.\n5. Insert the dipstick back into the oil reservoir and pull it out again.\n6. Check the oil level by looking at the end of the dipstick. The level should be between the \"MIN\" and \"MAX\" marks.\n7. Check the oil color and consistency. If it's dark, dirty, or has particles, it might be time for an oil change.\n\nIf you're still unsure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and get an oil change or consult with a mechanic.\n\nStay on top of your car's maintenance, and you'll be driving smoothly in no time!",
