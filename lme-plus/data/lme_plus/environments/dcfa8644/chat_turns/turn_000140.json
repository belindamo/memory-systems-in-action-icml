  "content": "Symbolically, a human and a tree can be seen as similar in a number of ways. For example, both a human and a tree can be seen as symbols of growth and development. Just as a tree begins as a small seed and grows into a large, strong plant over time, a human also grows and develops from a small, helpless infant into a mature, capable adult. Additionally, both a tree and a human can be seen as symbols of the cycle of life. Just as a tree goes through the seasons, shedding its leaves in the fall and regrowing them in the spring, a human also goes through various stages of life, from birth to death. Finally, both a tree and a human can be seen as symbols of the connection between the natural world and the human experience. Just as a tree provides shade, shelter, and oxygen for other living things, a human also interacts with and relies on the natural world in many ways.",
