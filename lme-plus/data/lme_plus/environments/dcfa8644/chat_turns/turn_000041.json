  "content": "Tracking your income is just as important as tracking your expenses. You can definitely add an income tracker to your spreadsheet. Here's how:\n\n**Setting up an income tracker:**\n\n1. Create a new sheet in your spreadsheet by clicking on the \"+\" button at the bottom of the screen.\n2. Name this new sheet \"Income\" or \"Income Tracker\".\n3. Set up the following columns:\n\t* **Date**: The date you received the income.\n\t* **Source**: The source of the income (e.g., paycheck, freelance work, gift, etc.).\n\t* **Amount**: The amount of income received.\n\t* **Total Income**: A running total of your income. You can use a formula to calculate this automatically.\n\t* **Notes**: Any additional notes or comments about the income.\n\n**Tips for tracking income:**\n\n* Consider setting up separate rows for each income source, such as a row for your primary job, a row for freelance work, and a row for any other regular income sources.\n* Use the `=SUM(B:B)` formula to calculate the total income in the \"Total Income\" column, where \"B\" is the column letter for the \"Amount\" column.\n* You can also use formulas to calculate your average monthly income, total income for the year, or other metrics that are important to you.\n* If you receive income on a regular schedule (e.g., bi-weekly paychecks), you can set up a formula to automatically calculate your projected income for the month or year.\n\n**Linking income and expenses:**\n\nNow that you have both income and expense trackers set up, you can start to see the big picture of your financial situation. You can use formulas to calculate your net worth, savings rate, or other financial metrics.\n\nFor example, you can create a new column in your expense tracker to calculate your \"Remaining Income\" after subtracting your expenses from your income. This can help you see how much money you have left over each month for savings, debt repayment, or discretionary spending.\n\nHere's an example formula:\n`=Income!B2-Expenses!C:C`\nThis formula assumes that:\n* Your income is in cell B2 of the \"Income\" sheet.\n* Your expenses are in column C of the \"Expenses\" sheet.\n* The formula will subtract the total expenses from the income to give you the remaining income.\n\nRemember to adjust the cell references and sheet names to match your specific spreadsheet setup.\n\nBy tracking both your income and expenses, you'll have a more complete picture of your financial situation and be able to make more informed decisions about your money.",
