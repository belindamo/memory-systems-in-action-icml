Making it from scratch requires some time and patience, but it's worth the effort. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups teff flour\n* 2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast\n* 1 1/2 cups water\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the teff flour, all-purpose flour, and yeast.\n2. Gradually add the water, mixing until a smooth batter forms. The batter should be thick but still pourable.\n3. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let the mixture ferment in a warm place for 24-48 hours. The mixture will start to bubble and emit a sour smell.\n4. Preheat a non-stick skillet or injera pan over medium-high heat.\n5. Using a ladle, pour a small amount of the batter onto the skillet, spreading it evenly to form a circular shape.\n6. Cover the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the edges start to curl and the surface is dry.\n7. Remove the injera from the skillet and let it cool. Repeat with the remaining batter.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a high-quality teff flour, as it's essential for the injera's flavor and texture.\n* Make sure the fermentation process is complete, as it will affect the injera's texture and flavor.\n* Traditionally, injera is cooked on a special injera pan or a clay pot, but a non-stick skillet will work as well.\n* Injera can be made ahead of time and stored for up to 3 days. Simply reheat it by wrapping it in a damp cloth and microwaving for 20-30 seconds.\n\n**Tips for serving:**\n\n* Serve the Vegetable Wot with a piece of injera bread, using it to scoop up the flavorful stew.\n* Offer additional injera bread on the side for guests to use as needed.\n* Consider adding some Ethiopian-style condiments, such as awaze sauce or mit",
