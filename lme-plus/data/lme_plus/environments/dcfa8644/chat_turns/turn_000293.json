  "content": "Heidegger proposes that rather than reducing humans to subjects or objects, we ought to view them as beings-in-the-world. This means that human existence is always already situated within a particular context and that humans are actively engaged in the world through their activities and projects. \n\nMoreover, Heidegger suggests that we need to understand the world not as an objective and stable reality that exists independently of our experiences, but rather as a relational and historical reality that is always shaped by our past and cultural conditions. \n\nHeidegger also proposes that we need to pay close attention to our own experiences of being-in-the-world and examine the structures and conditions that shape our existence. By doing so, He argues that we can develop an understanding of human existence that goes beyond traditional philosophical categories of subjectivity and objectivity. \n\nIn summary, Heidegger's alternative proposal is to understand human beings as beings-in-the-world, actively engaged with their environment and always shaped by their past and cultural conditions.",
