For example:\n\n* What type of pet is Luna (dog, cat, bird, etc.)?\n* How old is Luna?\n* What kind of food does Luna eat (dry, wet, raw, etc.)?\n* Does Luna have any health issues or allergies that require specific supplies?\n* What are Luna's favorite toys or activities?\n\nThis information will help me provide you with a more tailored list of supplies to consider.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general pet supply categories to consider:\n\n* Food and treats\n* Toys and chews\n* Grooming tools (brushes, nail clippers, shampoo, etc.)\n* Bedding and accessories (beds, blankets, etc.)\n* Litter and cleaning supplies (if applicable)\n* Health and wellness products (medications, supplements, etc.)\n* Training aids and equipment (leashes, collars, etc.)\n\nLet me know if there's anything specific you're concerned about or if you have any questions!",
