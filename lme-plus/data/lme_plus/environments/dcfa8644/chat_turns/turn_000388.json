  "content": "While The Neighbourhood and Banks are often associated with dark, atmospheric R&B and indie-electronic sounds, their music can also appeal to fans of indie-folk and acoustic genres. Here's why:\n\n**The Neighbourhood:**\n\n* Their music often features introspective and emotive lyrics, which are common in indie-folk.\n* They've experimented with acoustic instrumentation, like guitars and pianos, in some of their songs, which might appeal to indie-folk fans.\n* The Neighbourhood's sound is often described as moody and atmospheric, which can be similar to the introspective, emotive quality found in indie-folk.\n* Some of their songs, like \"Sweater Weather\" or \"Afraid\", have a more stripped-down, acoustic feel that might appeal to fans of indie-folk.\n\n**Banks:**\n\n* Banks' music often features introspective and emotionally charged lyrics, which are similar to those found in indie-folk.\n* Her sound is often described as dark and moody, which can be similar to the introspective, emotive quality found in indie-folk.\n* While Banks' music is often more electronic and R&B-infused, she has explored acoustic instrumentation in some of her songs, like \"Beggin for Thread\" or \"Drowning\".\n* Banks' vocal style, with its emotional intensity and vulnerability, might appeal to fans of indie-folk vocalists like The Lumineers' Wesley Schultz.\n\nThat being said, both The Neighbourhood and Banks are distinctly different from indie-folk artists like The Lumineers. Their sound is often darker, more atmospheric, and more electronic-infused. However, fans of indie-folk who appreciate introspective lyrics, emotive vocals, and atmospheric soundscapes might find common ground with these artists.\n\nIf you're looking for a more direct connection to indie-folk, you might want to explore artists like:\n\n* Hozier: Known for his soulful, blues-infused indie-folk sound, which shares some similarities with The Neighbourhood's darker, more atmospheric tracks.\n* Vance Joy: An Australian indie-folk artist with a warm, introspective sound that might appeal to fans of The Lumineers.\n* Phoebe Bridgers: A introspective indie-folk artist with a dark, emotive sound that might appeal to fans of Banks' more acoustic tracks.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any other questions!",
