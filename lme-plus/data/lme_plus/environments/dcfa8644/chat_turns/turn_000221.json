  "content": "That's helpful!\n\nWith the fact that it wasn't an origin story, and the lead actor's performance being notable, I can try to make some educated guesses.\n\nGiven that it was a light-hearted and funny movie, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and ask:\n\nCould the movie be \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" (2021) or \"Morbius\" (2022)?\n\nBoth of these movies are solo films, part of the MCU, and have received praise for their visual effects and lead performances. Simu Liu's performance as Shang-Chi was particularly well-received, and Morbius features a strong performance from Jared Leto.\n\nIf neither of these sound quite right, here are a few more questions to help narrow it down:\n\n* Was the movie a more recent release (2020 or later), or do you think it might be a bit older?\n* Do you remember any specific scenes, quotes, or moments from the movie that stuck with you?\n* Was the movie more of a superhero-action film, or did it have elements of other genres (e.g. comedy, sci-fi, fantasy)?",
