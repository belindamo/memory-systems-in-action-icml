To give it more flavor, consider adding some of the following spices and seasonings:\n\n1. **Cumin**: A staple in many chili recipes, cumin adds a warm, earthy flavor. Start with 1/2 teaspoon and adjust to taste.\n2. **Chili powder**: You've already mentioned adding chili powder, but I'll emphasize its importance again. Use a high-quality chili powder blend that contains a mix of spices, including chili peppers, garlic, and cumin.\n3. **Paprika**: A sweet or smoked paprika can add depth and a slightly sweet flavor to your chili. Use about 1/4 teaspoon to start.\n4. **Oregano**: This herb adds a pungent, earthy flavor that pairs well with the richness of the beef and tomatoes. Use about 1/4 teaspoon.\n5. **Cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes**: If you like a little heat in your chili, add some cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes. Start with a small amount (1/4 teaspoon) and adjust to taste.\n6. **Salt and pepper**: Don't forget to season your chili with salt and pepper to bring out the flavors. Use about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper to start.\n7. **Tomato paste**: If you want to add more depth to your chili, consider adding 1-2 tablespoons of tomato paste. This will intensify the tomato flavor and add a rich, umami taste.\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n1. **Acidity**: A splash of vinegar (about 1 tablespoon) or a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies can add a nice acidity to balance the richness of the chili.\n2. **Brown sugar or molasses**: A small amount of brown sugar or molasses (about 1 tablespoon) can balance the acidity and add a hint of sweetness.\n3. **Fresh or dried herbs**: Consider adding some fresh or dried herbs like parsley, basil, or cilantro to add a bright, fresh flavor to your chili.\n\nRemember, the key to making a great chili is to taste and adjust as you go. Don't be afraid to experiment and add your own favorite spices and seasonings to make the recipe your own.",
