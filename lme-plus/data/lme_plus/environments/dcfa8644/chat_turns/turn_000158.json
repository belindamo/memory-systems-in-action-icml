Making homemade pasta from scratch can be a very rewarding experience.\n\nFor a side dish to complement the Vegetable Wot, I would recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Gomen Be Sega** (Ethiopian-Style Collard Greens): This is a traditional Ethiopian side dish made with collard greens, onions, garlic, and spices. It's a great way to add some greens to your meal and the bitter flavor of the collard greens will balance out the richness of the stew.\n2. **Tikel Gomen** (Ethiopian-Style Cabbage and Carrot Stir-Fry): This is a simple and flavorful side dish made with saut\u00e9ed cabbage, carrots, onions, and spices. It's a great way to add some crunch and freshness to your meal.\n3. **Yasa Tibs** (Ethiopian-Style Sauteed Spinach): This is another popular Ethiopian side dish made with saut\u00e9ed spinach, onions, garlic, and spices. It's a great way to add some nutrients and flavor to your meal.\n4. **Injera Salad**: If you want to keep things simple, you could make a salad using torn pieces of injera bread, mixed with chopped tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle of salt, and you're good to go!\n5. **Roasted Vegetables**: Roasted vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or sweet potatoes can provide a nice contrast in texture to the stew. Simply toss the vegetables with some olive oil, salt, and your choice of spices, and roast in the oven until tender and caramelized.\n\nThese are just a few ideas, but ultimately, the choice of side dish will depend on your personal preferences and the flavors you want to highlight. You can't go wrong with a simple green salad or some roasted vegetables, but if you want to stay true to the Ethiopian theme, one of the above options would be a great choice.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear how your Vegetable Wot turns out!",
