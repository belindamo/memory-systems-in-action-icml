  "content": "Fueling up is crucial on a road trip, especially when driving through rural areas. I'm glad you learned from your Yellowstone trip to plan ahead for fuel stops.\n\nOn the I-80 W route, you'll generally find a good number of fuel stations, especially near cities and towns. However, there are some stretches where stations are farther apart, so it's essential to keep an eye on your fuel level and plan accordingly.\n\n**Long stretches without gas stations:**\n\n1. **Nebraska Sandhills**: Between North Platte and Ogallala, Nebraska, you'll encounter a relatively long stretch (around 70 miles) without many fuel stations. Be sure to fill up in North Platte or Ogallala before continuing west.\n2. **Wyoming's High Plains**: From Sidney, Nebraska, to Laramie, Wyoming, there's a stretch of about 100 miles with limited fuel options. Fill up in Sidney or take advantage of the services at the Little America Travel Center (Exit 68, I-80).\n\n**Tips for fueling up:**\n\n1. **Use fuel station finders**: Websites like GasBuddy or Roadtrippers can help you locate fuel stations along your route and filter by price, distance, and amenities.\n2. **Fill up when possible**: When you see a fuel station, especially in rural areas, consider filling up, even if you're not running low. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n3. **Keep an eye on your fuel level**: Monitor your fuel level regularly, especially when driving through rural areas, and plan your fuel stops accordingly.\n4. **Take advantage of travel centers**: Places like the Little America Travel Center (Wyoming) or the Iowa 80 Truckstop (Iowa) offer fuel, food, and amenities, making them great places to stop and refuel.\n\nBy being mindful of these stretches and planning your fuel stops, you'll be well-prepared for your drive to Grand Teton National Park. Safe travels, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions!",
