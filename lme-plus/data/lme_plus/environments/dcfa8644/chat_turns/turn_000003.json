  "content": "Tiered pricing structures can be an excellent way to incentivize larger orders and reward your wholesale customers for their loyalty. Here are some examples of tiered pricing structures that might work for your candles:\n\n**Example 1: Simple Tiered Pricing**\n\n* 1-11 candles: $4.40 each (base price)\n* 12-24 candles: $4.00 each (10% discount)\n* 25-49 candles: $3.60 each (18% discount)\n* 50+ candles: $3.20 each (27% discount)\n\n**Example 2: Gradual Discount**\n\n* 1-5 candles: $4.40 each\n* 6-10 candles: $4.20 each (5% discount)\n* 11-20 candles: $4.00 each (10% discount)\n* 21-30 candles: $3.80 each (14% discount)\n* 31+ candles: $3.60 each (18% discount)\n\n**Example 3: Breakpoint Discounts**\n\n* 1-9 candles: $4.40 each\n* 10-19 candles: $4.00 each (10% discount)\n* 20-49 candles: $3.60 each (18% discount)\n* 50-99 candles: $3.20 each (27% discount)\n* 100+ candles: $2.80 each (36% discount)\n\n**Example 4: Tiered Pricing with Volume Discounts**\n\n* Small Order (1-11 candles): $4.40 each\n* Medium Order (12-24 candles): $4.00 each (10% discount)\n* Large Order (25-49 candles): $3.60 each (18% discount)\n* Bulk Order (50-99 candles): $3.20 each (27% discount)\n* Wholesale Order (100+ candles): $2.80 each (36% discount)\n\nThese are just a few examples, and you can adjust the tier levels, discounts, and pricing to fit your specific business needs. Consider the following when structuring your tiered pricing:\n\n* **Breakpoints**: Choose breakpoints that make sense for your business, such as 10, 25, 50, or 100 candles. These breakpoints should be significant enough to incentivize larger orders but not so high that they're unrealistic.\n* **Discount percentages**: Decide on the discount percentages for each tier. You can use a fixed percentage (e.g., 10% off) or a progressive discount (e.g., 10% off for the first tier, 15% off for the second tier, etc.).\n* **Pricing psychology**: Consider the psychological impact of pricing on your customers. For example, $3.99 might be more appealing than $4.00, even if the difference is minimal.\n* **Competitor analysis**: Research your competitors' pricing structures to ensure your tiers and discounts are competitive.\n* **Profit margins**: Make sure your tiered pricing structure still allows for a reasonable profit margin at each level.\n\nRemember to communicate your tiered pricing structure clearly to your wholesale customers, either through a price list, website, or direct communication. This will help them understand the benefits of ordering in bulk and encourage larger purchases.",
