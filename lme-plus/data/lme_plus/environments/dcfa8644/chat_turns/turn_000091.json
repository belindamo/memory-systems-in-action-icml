  "content": "Adding Korean chili flakes to the marinade will give your Korean-Style BBQ Chicken an authentic kick.\n\nNow, when it comes to hot sauces and spicy ingredients that pair well with BBQ, I've got a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Frank's RedHot**: A classic hot sauce that pairs well with BBQ sauce. It adds a nice balance of heat and tanginess.\n2. **Sriracha**: Another popular hot sauce that adds a spicy kick to BBQ. It's especially good with sweet and smoky BBQ sauces.\n3. **Cholula**: A Mexican hot sauce made from arbol peppers, it adds a slightly sweet and smoky heat to BBQ.\n4. **Hot sauce of your choice**: Experiment with different hot sauces to find the one that complements your BBQ sauce the best. Some other options include Tabasco, Louisiana Hot Sauce, or Valentina.\n5. **Diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers**: Add some diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers to your BBQ sauce for an extra kick of heat. You can also use them in the marinade for added flavor.\n6. **Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce**: These smoked jalape\u00f1os add a deep, smoky heat to BBQ sauce. Use them sparingly, as they can be quite potent.\n7. **Korean chili paste (gochujang)**: This fermented soybean paste has a thick, sticky consistency and a sweet, savory, and spicy flavor. It's a great addition to BBQ sauce or marinades.\n\nRemember, when working with spicy ingredients, start with a small amount and taste as you go. You can always add more heat, but it's harder to remove it once it's added.\n\nWhat's your favorite hot sauce or spicy ingredient to add to your BBQ sauce?",
