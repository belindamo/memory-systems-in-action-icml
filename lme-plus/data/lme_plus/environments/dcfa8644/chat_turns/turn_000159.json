  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I think I'll try making the Gomen Be Sega to go along with the Vegetable Wot. I've been enjoying exploring different cuisines and cooking techniques, and recently attended a food festival in my city where I got to try all sorts of different cuisines, including Ethiopian, Thai, and Mexican. The Ethiopian booth had a delicious vegetarian platter with injera bread and several different stews. I ended up buying a cookbook from the vendor and can't wait to try making some of the dishes at home. Do you have any tips for making the Gomen Be Sega, or any variations I could try?",
