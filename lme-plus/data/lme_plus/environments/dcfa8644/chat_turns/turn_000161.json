  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I think I'll try making the Gomen Be Sega with some chickpeas added for extra protein. I've been experimenting with different cuisines and cooking techniques, and recently took a cooking demonstration at a local kitchen store where we learned how to make Korean BBQ-style dishes. The chef demonstrated how to make marinated beef short ribs, kimchi fried rice, and spicy cucumber salad. I was impressed by how quickly and easily the chef prepared each dish, and I ended up buying the cookbook and some of the ingredients to try to make the dishes at home. Do you have any tips for working with Korean chili flakes, or gochugaru?",
