  "content": "Can you give me feedback on this text. I was answering the following question: Tod writes, \u201cour house has broken windows\u201d. What does this tell us about Tod\u2019s home life?\n\nHere is my answer: I think this reflects that Tod\u2019s home life is not the best. His family must have financial troubles of some sort to not be able to afford new windows. This is not a want, a cool toy that you cannot buy. This is a need because you need windows to keep from the cold, to be safe, and to have a decent lifestyle. If Tod\u2019s family cannot even afford windows, I wonder if his home life would affect his bullying behavior. To back up this statement, we learn later in the book that Tod\u2019s mom works at the dry cleaner. I do not think that her job would provide enough since we still do not know what Tod\u2019s stepfather does for a living.",
