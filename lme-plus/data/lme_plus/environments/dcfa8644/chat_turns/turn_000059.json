Here's how they can contribute:\n\n1. **Bell peppers**: Green or red bell peppers will add a sweet, crunchy texture and a bit of freshness to your chili. They're a classic addition to many chili recipes.\n2. **Jalapenos**: If you like a little heat in your chili, jalapenos are a great choice. They'll add a moderate level of heat and a bright, grassy flavor. You can use fresh or canned jalapenos, depending on your preference.\n\nOther ingredients you might consider adding to give your chili extra flavor and texture include:\n\n1. **Diced onions**: In addition to the onions you're already browning with the beef, you could add some diced onions to the slow cooker for extra flavor and texture.\n2. **Garlic**: Like onions, garlic is a fundamental flavor component in many chili recipes. You can mince a few cloves and add them to the slow cooker for extra depth of flavor.\n3. **Mushrooms**: Sliced or chopped mushrooms can add an earthy flavor and meaty texture to your chili.\n4. **Tomato paste**: As I mentioned earlier, tomato paste can intensify the tomato flavor and add a rich, umami taste to your chili.\n5. **Beer or broth**: Adding a splash of beer or beef broth can enhance the flavor and moisture of your chili.\n\n**Remember:**\n\nThe key to making a great chili is to taste and adjust as you go. Don't be afraid to experiment and add your own favorite ingredients to make the recipe your own. And don't overdo it \u2013 too many ingredients can make the flavor profile muddy.\n\nNow, get cooking and enjoy the process of creating your delicious slow cooker chili!",
