However, I can ask you some questions to help me better understand your current setup and provide suggestions based on your description.\n\nPlease feel free to share some details about your current display, such as:\n\n1. What type of table or stand are you using?\n2. How are you arranging your candles on the table? Are they grouped by type, scent, or color?\n3. What kind of signage are you using, if any? Are you displaying your business name, product names, and prices?\n4. Are you using any decorative elements, such as tablecloths, backdrops, or risers?\n5. What kind of lighting are you using to illuminate your display?\n6. Are there any specific challenges you're facing with your current display, such as lack of space or difficulty attracting customers?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your current setup, I can provide you with constructive criticism and suggestions to improve your display and make it more visually appealing.",
