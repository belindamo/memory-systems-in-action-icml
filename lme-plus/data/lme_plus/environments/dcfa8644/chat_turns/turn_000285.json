  "content": "According to the US Census Bureau, approximately 22% of Detroit residents 25 years and older hold a bachelor's degree or higher, which is lower than the national average of 33%. Additionally, a significant proportion of Detroit residents do not have a high school diploma or GED (about 16%). This low level of educational attainment can limit access to higher-paying jobs in industries like finance, healthcare, and technology, which often require a college degree or specialized training. Those with less education may be relegated to lower-paying jobs in service industries or manual labor, which don't pay as well and often have more limited opportunities for advancement. The education level of Detroit residents may also impact the city's economic growth and ability to attract higher-paying employers.",
