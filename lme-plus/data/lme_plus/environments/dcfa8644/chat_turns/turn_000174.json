This will help the materials retain their form and prevent further stretching.\n3. **Apply heat**: Gently apply heat to the affected areas using a hair dryer or a warm cloth. This can help the materials relax and return to their original shape. Be cautious not to apply too much heat, as this can damage the materials.\n4. **Use a shoe stretcher**: Consider investing in a shoe stretcher specifically designed for Vans. These devices can help stretch the shoes back to their original shape and fit.\n5. **Condition the leather**: If your Vans have leather uppers, apply a leather conditioner to help restore the material's natural flexibility and suppleness. This can help the shoes regain their original fit and feel.\n6. **Try the freezer trick**: Place the shoes in the freezer for a few hours. The cold temperature can help contract the materials, which may help them return to their original shape. However, be cautious when using this method, as it may not work for all materials.\n\nRemember to be patient and gentle when trying to restore your Vans to their original shape. Avoid using harsh chemicals, excessive heat, or force, as these can damage the materials and make the problem worse.\n\nI hope these tips help you get your favorite Vans back to their original fit!",
