Now, let's talk about achieving those perfect grill marks on your chicken breasts!\n\nHere are some tips to help you get those beautiful, caramelized grill marks:\n\n1. **Clean grill grates**: Make sure your grill grates are clean and brush them with oil before heating up. This will prevent the chicken from sticking and ensure a smooth, even sear.\n2. **Preheat your grill**: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F to 425\u00b0F). You want the grill to be hot, but not smoking hot, as this can burn the outside before cooking the inside.\n3. **Dry the chicken**: Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels, especially if you've marinated them. Excess moisture can prevent the chicken from searing properly.\n4. **Oil the grates (again)**: Just before placing the chicken on the grill, brush the grates with a small amount of oil. This will help create a non-stick surface and promote even browning.\n5. **Grill at an angle**: Place the chicken breasts on the grill at an angle, so the lines on the grill grate create a diagonal pattern on the chicken. This will help you achieve those nice, diamond-shaped grill marks.\n6. **Don't press down**: Resist the temptation to press down on the chicken with your spatula, as this can squeeze out juices and prevent even browning. Let the chicken cook undisturbed for a few minutes on each side.\n7. **Rotate for symmetry**: Rotate the chicken breasts 90 degrees after 3-4 minutes on each side to create a crisscross pattern. This will give you those beautiful, symmetrical grill marks.\n8. **Don't overcook**: Cook the chicken to the recommended internal temperature (165\u00b0F), but avoid overcooking, which can make the chicken dry and tough.\n9. **Let it rest**: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender and juicy.\n\nSome additional tips for Korean-Style BBQ Chicken:\n\n* Use a mixture of sugar, garlic, and sesame oil in your marinade to promote caramelization and create a sticky, sweet glaze.\n* Grill the chicken for 5-6 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F.\n* Brush the chicken with your sweet and smoky BBQ sauce during the last 2 minutes of grilling to give it a nice glaze.\n\nFor BBQ Chicken Tacos:\n\n* Grill the chicken for 5-6 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F.\n* Slice the chicken into thin strips and toss with your BBQ sauce, lime juice, and cilantro for added flavor.\n* Serve with your favorite taco toppings, such as avocado, sour cream, and salsa.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve those perfect grill marks and enjoy delicious, flavorful chicken breasts for your Korean-Style BBQ Chicken and BBQ Chicken Tacos!",
