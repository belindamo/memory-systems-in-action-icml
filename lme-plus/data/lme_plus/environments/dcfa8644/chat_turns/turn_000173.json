  "content": "I realized I've been meaning to get my favorite pair of Vans back to their original shape. I lent them to my brother when he came to visit last month, and when he returned them on February 10th, I noticed they were a bit tighter than I remembered. I think he might have stretched them out or something. Do you have any tips on how to restore them to their original fit?",
