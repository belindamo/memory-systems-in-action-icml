Here's a rough estimate of the logistics:\n\n* Governors Ball Music Festival is held on Randall's Island, and the festival grounds are usually open from around 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM.\n* The Blue Note Jazz Club and Village Vanguard are both located in Greenwich Village, which is approximately a 20-30 minute drive or Uber ride from Randall's Island, depending on traffic.\n* Jazz sets at these clubs typically start around 8:00-9:00 PM, with some earlier sets during the weekend afternoons.\n\nConsidering the festival schedule and travel time, you might be able to squeeze in a visit to a jazz club, but it would require some careful planning and flexibility:\n\n* You could try to catch an early afternoon set at the jazz club (if they have one scheduled) and then head to the festival.\n* Alternatively, you could plan to leave the festival during a break between sets (e.g., around 6:00-7:00 PM) and head to the jazz club for a late set. However, you'd need to be prepared to miss some of the festival's evening performances.\n\nKeep in mind that both the Blue Note Jazz Club and Village Vanguard are popular spots, and you might not be able to get in without a reservation or tickets in advance. Be sure to check their schedules and book your spot ahead of time to avoid disappointment.\n\nIf you're willing to take the risk and make it work, it could be an amazing way to experience the best of both worlds: a day of music at Governors Ball and an evening of jazz at a legendary club. Just be prepared for a busy day and potential transportation challenges.",
