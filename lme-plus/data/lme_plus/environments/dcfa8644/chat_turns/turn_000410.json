  "content": "The \"Turbocharged Tuesdays\" event at the speedway is a great way to connect with like-minded enthusiasts and potentially find a tuner who's familiar with FuelTech systems and high-performance Mustangs.\n\nSince you're already in the local area, I recommend reaching out to the event organizers or other participants to ask for recommendations on tuners who attended the event or are familiar with the speedway. They might be able to point you in the right direction.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try visiting local performance shops or speed shops in the area, as they often have connections with tuners who specialize in high-performance vehicles. Don't hesitate to ask questions, such as:\n\n* Have you worked with FuelTech systems before?\n* Do you have experience with high-performance Mustangs?\n* Can you provide examples of previous work or references from satisfied customers?\n* What's your approach to tuning, and what kind of support do you offer?\n\nBy asking the right questions and doing your research, you'll be able to find a reputable tuner who can help you get the most out of your FuelTech system and fuel injector upgrade.\n\nRemember to also keep an eye out for tuners who are willing to work with you to achieve your specific performance goals, whether that's increasing horsepower, improving acceleration, or enhancing overall drivability.\n\nGood luck in your search, and I hope you find a great tuner to help you unlock the full potential of your Mustang!",
