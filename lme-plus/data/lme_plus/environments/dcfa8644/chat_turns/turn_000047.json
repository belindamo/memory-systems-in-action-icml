Create a new sheet in your spreadsheet, e.g., \"Credit Card Debt\".\n2. Set up columns for:\n\t* **Credit Card**: The name of the credit card.\n\t* **Current Balance**: The current outstanding balance on the credit card.\n\t* **Interest Rate**: The annual percentage rate (APR) of the credit card.\n\t* **Minimum Payment**: The minimum payment required each month.\n\t* **Total Interest Paid**: The total interest paid on the credit card since you started tracking.\n\t* **Payoff Goal**: The date you want to pay off the credit card debt.\n3. Enter the details for each credit card you want to track.\n\n**Creating a debt repayment plan:**\n\n1. Determine how much you can realistically pay each month towards your credit card debt.\n2. Use a debt repayment calculator or create a formula to calculate how long it will take to pay off each credit card based on your monthly payment amount.\n3. Prioritize your credit cards by focusing on the one with the highest interest rate or the smallest balance (depending on your personal preference).\n4. Create a plan to pay off each credit card, one by one, by allocating your monthly payment towards the priority card first.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose you have two credit cards:\n\n| Credit Card | Current Balance | Interest Rate | Minimum Payment | Payoff Goal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Card A | $2,000 | 18% | $50 | 12 months |\n| Card B | $1,500 | 12% | $30 | 9 months |\n\nYou can allocate $100 per month towards your credit card debt. You decide to prioritize Card A with the higher interest rate.\n\n| Month | Card A Payment | Card B Payment | Total Payment |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | $100 | $0 | $100 |\n| 2 | $100 | $0 | $100 |\n| 3 | $100 | $0 | $100 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| 12 | $100 | $100 | $200 |\n\nIn this example, you'll pay off Card A in 12 months, and then focus on paying off Card B.\n\n**Tips for paying off credit card debt:**\n\n* Pay more than the minimum payment each month to reduce the principal balance and interest paid.\n* Consider consolidating your debt into a lower-interest credit card or personal loan.\n* Cut expenses and allocate the savings towards your debt repayment.\n* Use the snowball method or avalanche method to prioritize your debt repayment.\n* Review and adjust your plan regularly to stay on track.\n\nBy tracking your credit card debt and creating a plan to pay it off, you'll be more likely to stay motivated and achieve your goal of becoming debt-free.",
