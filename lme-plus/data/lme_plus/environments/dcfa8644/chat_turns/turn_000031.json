Set specific, measurable goals**: Define what you want to achieve through your interval training, such as increasing your endurance, improving your speed, or boosting your overall fitness. Having specific goals will help you stay focused and motivated.\n\n**2. Track your workouts**: Keep a workout log or use a fitness app to track your interval workouts, including the duration, intensity, and any notes about how you felt during the workout. This will help you see your progress over time and identify areas for improvement.\n\n**3. Monitor your heart rate and perceived exertion**: Wear a heart rate monitor or use a perceived exertion scale (e.g., 1-10) to track your intensity levels during workouts. This will help you adjust the intensity of your intervals and ensure you're challenging yourself appropriately.\n\n**4. Take progress photos and measurements**: Take progress photos and measurements (e.g., weight, body fat percentage, circumference) regularly to track visual changes in your body.\n\n**5. Celebrate small victories**: Celebrate small victories along the way, such as increasing your interval duration or completing a challenging workout. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged.\n\n**6. Find a workout buddy or accountability partner**: Having someone to hold you accountable and share the experience with can be a great motivator. Consider finding a workout buddy or joining a fitness group to stay motivated.\n\n**7. Reward yourself**: Set up a reward system to motivate yourself. For example, treat yourself to a new workout outfit or a post-workout smoothie after reaching a milestone.\n\n**8. Stay positive and patient**: Remember that progress takes time, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Stay positive, focus on your progress, and don't get discouraged by setbacks.\n\n**9. Mix it up**: To avoid plateaus, mix up your interval workouts by trying new exercises, changing the duration or intensity, or incorporating different types of cardio (e.g., running, swimming).\n\n**10. Seek professional guidance**: If you're new to interval training or need guidance on how to modify the intervals to suit your fitness level, consider working with a personal trainer or fitness coach.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to track your progress, stay motivated, and achieve your fitness goals.\n\nHow do you plan to track your progress and stay motivated?
