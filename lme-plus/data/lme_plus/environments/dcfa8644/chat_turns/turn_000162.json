Korean BBQ-style dishes are always a crowd-pleaser, and it's wonderful that you got to learn from a chef and take home some inspiration.\n\nNow, about working with Korean chili flakes, or gochugaru, here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n**Tips for working with gochugaru:**\n\n1. **Start with a small amount**: Gochugaru can be quite spicy, so it's better to start with a small amount and adjust to taste. You can always add more heat, but it's harder to remove it once it's added.\n2. **Use the right type of gochugaru**: There are different types of gochugaru, ranging from mild to extremely hot. Look for a reputable brand and choose a type that suits your desired level of heat.\n3. **Toast the gochugaru**: Toasting the gochugaru in a dry pan or oven can bring out its flavor and aroma. Simply heat the gochugaru in a pan over low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant.\n4. **Mix with other ingredients**: Gochugaru can be quite potent, so it's often mixed with other ingredients like soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and sugar to balance out the flavor.\n5. **Store properly**: Gochugaru can lose its potency if exposed to air, light, or moisture. Store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.\n\n**Substitutions and variations:**\n\n1. **Substitute with cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes**: If you can't find gochugaru or prefer a milder heat, you can substitute with cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes.\n2. **Add to marinades and sauces**: Gochugaru is a great addition to marinades, sauces, and dips. It adds a depth of flavor and heat that's hard to replicate with other ingredients.\n3. **Use in soups and stews**: Gochugaru is a common ingredient in Korean soups and stews, adding a spicy kick and depth of flavor.\n4. **Make a gochugaru paste**: Mixing gochugaru with water or oil creates a paste that can be used as a condiment or added to dishes for extra heat.\n\nI hope these tips help you in your Korean cooking adventures!",
