Sweet and smoky is a great flavor combination for grilled chicken breasts.\n\nDon't worry about overcooking the chicken - it's a common mistake, especially when you're trying out new recipes or techniques. Timing can be tricky, but with practice, you'll get the hang of it!\n\nHere are a few tips to help you achieve perfectly cooked chicken breasts:\n\n1. **Use a thermometer**: Invest in a good meat thermometer to ensure your chicken reaches a safe internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n2. **Don't overcrowd**: Grill or cook chicken breasts individually to prevent them from steaming instead of searing. This will help you achieve a crispy exterior and a juicy interior.\n3. **Don't press down**: Resist the temptation to press down on the chicken with your spatula, as this can squeeze out juices and make the chicken dry.\n4. **Grill at a medium-high heat**: A medium-high heat will help you achieve a nice sear on the outside while cooking the inside to perfection.\n5. **Flip frequently**: Flip the chicken breasts every 4-5 minutes to ensure even cooking and to prevent burning.\n6. **Let it rest**: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender and juicy.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your chicken doesn't turn out exactly as you hoped the first time. Keep experimenting, and you'll soon become a grill master!\n\nWhat do you think about trying out a Korean-Style BBQ Chicken or BBQ Chicken Tacos recipe with your sweet and smoky BBQ sauce?",
