For example:\n\n* Was it part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) or an X-Men movie?\n* Was it a solo movie or a team-up film?\n* Do you remember any specific characters, actors, or actresses in the movie?\n* Was it a light-hearted, humorous movie or a more serious, dramatic one?\n* Do you recall any memorable scenes, plot points, or action sequences from the movie?\n* Was it a recent release (like in the past year or two) or a bit older?\n\nAny details you can provide will help me try to identify which Marvel movie you're thinking of!",
