  "content": "**Substituting paprika:**\n\nPaprika does add a smoky, slightly sweet flavor to the fajita seasoning blend. If you're not a fan of smoky flavors, you can substitute it with another spice to change the flavor profile. Here are a few options:\n\n* **Coriander**: This will add a warm, earthy, and slightly citrusy flavor to your fajitas. Use the same amount called for in the recipe (1 tablespoon).\n* **Ground oregano**: This will introduce a pungent, earthy flavor with a hint of bitterness. Use about half the amount called for in the recipe (1/2 tablespoon), as oregano can be quite potent.\n* **Mexican oregano**: This variety of oregano has a more delicate flavor than regular oregano and is commonly used in Mexican cuisine. Use the same amount as regular oregano (1/2 tablespoon).\n* **Dried cilantro**: This will add a fresh, herbal flavor to your fajitas. Use about half the amount called for in the recipe (1/2 tablespoon), as cilantro can be quite potent.\n\nKeep in mind that each of these substitutes will change the flavor profile of your fajita seasoning blend. If you're unsure, start with a small batch and taste as you go to adjust the seasoning to your liking.\n\n**Other options:**\n\nIf you want to maintain a similar depth of flavor without the smokiness, you could try adding a small amount of:\n\n* **Ground cinnamon**: This will add a warm, sweet flavor. Use about 1/4 teaspoon.\n* **Ground cloves**: This will introduce a subtle, warm, and slightly sweet flavor. Use about 1/4 teaspoon.\n\nRemember, when substituting or adding new spices, it's essential to taste as you go and adjust the seasoning to your liking. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess seasoning.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear how your fajitas turn out!",
