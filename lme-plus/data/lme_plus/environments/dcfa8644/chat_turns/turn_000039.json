Open Google Sheets and create a new spreadsheet by clicking on the \"+\" button.\n2. Give your spreadsheet a title, such as \"Online Shopping Expenses\" or \"Personal Expense Tracker\".\n3. Set up the following columns:\n\t* **Date**: The date you made the purchase.\n\t* **Category**: The type of item you purchased (e.g., electronics, clothing, entertainment, etc.).\n\t* **Item Description**: A brief description of the item you purchased.\n\t* **Cost**: The cost of the item, including any shipping or taxes.\n\t* **Total Spend**: A running total of your expenses. You can use a formula to calculate this automatically.\n\t* **Notes**: Any additional notes or comments about the purchase.\n4. You can add more columns if you want to track additional information, such as:\n\t* **Store**: The online store where you made the purchase.\n\t* **Payment Method**: The payment method you used (e.g., credit card, PayPal, etc.).\n\t* **Tags**: Keywords or tags to help you categorize your expenses further (e.g., \"gift\", \"subscription\", etc.).\n\n**Categorizing your expenses:**\n\nYes, it's a good idea to separate your expenses into categories to get a better understanding of where your money is going. You can create a list of categories that make sense for your spending habits. Here are some common categories to consider:\n\n* Electronics\n* Clothing\n* Entertainment (e.g., movies, music, games)\n* Home and Garden\n* Health and Beauty\n* Food and Beverages\n* Travel\n* Gifts\n* Subscriptions (e.g., streaming services, software, etc.)\n* Miscellaneous\n\nYou can also create subcategories within each category to further break down your expenses. For example, under \"Electronics\", you could have subcategories like \"Smartphones\", \"Laptops\", \"Gaming Consoles\", etc.\n\n**Tips and formulas:**\n\n* Use the `=SUM(C:C)` formula to calculate the total spend in the \"Total Spend\" column, where \"C\" is the column letter for the \"Cost\" column.\n* Use filters and sorting to easily view your expenses by category, date, or cost.\n* Consider setting up a separate sheet for each month or quarter to track your expenses over time.\n* You can also use conditional formatting to highlight expenses that exceed a certain amount or fall within a specific category.\n\nNow that you have your spreadsheet set up, start tracking your expenses, including your new portable power bank!",
