  "content": "If you have limited time, I recommend prioritizing the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Vatican City as they are the most iconic and significant sites in Rome. Following that, I would recommend visiting the Catacombs of St. Callixtus, as it is the largest and most well-preserved underground cemetery in Rome. It contains the crypt of the popes of the third century and several notable martyrs. The Domitilla Catacombs are also worth considering as they are the oldest continuously excavated catacombs in Rome and contain a significant number of frescoes and inscriptions. The Catacomb of Priscilla is renowned for its beautiful frescoes, which include the oldest known image of the Madonna and Child. However, it is slightly further out than the other two and can be a bit more difficult to get to. Ultimately, it depends on your interests, but these suggestions should provide a good balance of history and cultural significance.",
