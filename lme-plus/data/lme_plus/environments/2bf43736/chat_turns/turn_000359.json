  "content": "The Biden campaign released a statement praising the deal to reopen the government. \"We are glad that Congress has come to an agreement to end the damaging government shutdown,\" the statement read. \"The American people have suffered long enough, and it's time for our elected officials to put aside their differences and do what's best for the country. As President, Joe Biden will always put the interests of the American people first and work to find common ground with his political opponents.\" The statement did not address the ongoing dispute over funding for the border wall, but emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation to address the nation's challenges.",
