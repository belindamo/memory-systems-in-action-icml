  "content": "The Fitbit Inspire HR can indeed track naps, not just overnight sleep.\n\nThe Inspire HR automatically detects naps that are at least 15 minutes long, and it will track them separately from your overnight sleep. This means you can see how much time you spent napping during the day, as well as the quality of your nap sleep.\n\nTo track naps, simply wear your Inspire HR as you normally would, and it will automatically detect when you're sleeping. You can then view your nap data in the Fitbit app, along with your overnight sleep data.\n\nHere are some tips to keep in mind when tracking naps with the Inspire HR:\n\n1. **Make sure you're wearing the Inspire HR correctly**: Wear the tracker on your non-dominant wrist, and make sure it's snug but not too tight.\n2. **Naps must be at least 15 minutes long**: If you take a shorter nap, the Inspire HR might not detect it as a nap.\n3. **You can track multiple naps per day**: If you take multiple naps throughout the day, the Inspire HR will track each one separately.\n4. **Nap data is separate from overnight sleep data**: You can view your nap data separately from your overnight sleep data in the Fitbit app.\n\nTracking naps can be really helpful in understanding your overall sleep patterns and habits. By seeing how much you're sleeping during the day, you might identify patterns or habits that are affecting your ability to fall asleep at night.\n\nRemember, it's essential to establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing sleep environment to improve the quality of your sleep. The Fitbit Inspire HR can be a powerful tool in helping you achieve that!\n\nI hope this helps, and happy tracking!",
