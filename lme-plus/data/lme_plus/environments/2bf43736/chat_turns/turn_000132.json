I've also been trying to focus on the positive aspects of our friendship and show my appreciation for them. However, I've been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt lately, especially when I compare myself to others on social media. Do you have any advice on how to overcome these feelings and focus on my own goals and achievements?",
