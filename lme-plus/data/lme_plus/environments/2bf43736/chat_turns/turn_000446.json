He goes on to describe the different aspects of the active purgative way, including the practice of mortification, the cultivation of the virtues, and the avoidance of occasions of sin.\n\nTanqueray then discusses the role of prayer in the active purgative way, emphasizing the importance of mental prayer and the use of spiritual reading and meditation to deepen one's relationship with God. He also explains the importance of the sacraments in the active purgative way, particularly confession and the Eucharist, which provide grace and strength for the spiritual journey.\n\nThroughout the chapter, Tanqueray draws on the teachings of various spiritual writers, including St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila, to support his arguments. He also emphasizes the importance of humility and trust in God's providence in the active purgative way, as the process of purification can be difficult and challenging.\n\nOverall, the third chapter of the first book of the second part of Tanqueray's Spiritual Life treatise provides a deeper exploration of the active purgative way and its importance in the spiritual life. It emphasizes the need for detachment from sin and worldly things, the cultivation of the virtues, and the importance of prayer and the sacraments in the spiritual journey.",
