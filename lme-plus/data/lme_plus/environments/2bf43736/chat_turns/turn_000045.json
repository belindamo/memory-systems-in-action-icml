It's available for both Mac and PC.\n\n**Audio Interface:**\n\n1. **Focusrite Scarlett series** (~ $100-$300): A popular, beginner-friendly audio interface that connects your instruments to your laptop.

Look for budget-friendly options like the KRK RP5 G3 (~ $150) or the Yamaha HS8 (~ $200).\n2. **Acoustic Treatment:** Remember to invest in acoustic treatment for your room to minimize echo and reverberation (as mentioned earlier).\n3. **Cables and Connectors:** Make sure you have the right cables and adapters to connect your instruments, microphones, and audio interface to your laptop.\n\n**Tips for Recording Ukulele:**\n\n1. **Use a condenser microphone:** They're more sensitive and can capture the ukulele's high frequencies.\n2. **Position the microphone:** Experiment with mic placement to find the sweet spot. Try 6-12 inches away from the ukulele, angled towards the sound hole.\n3. **Use a pop filter:** A pop filter can reduce plosive sounds and mouth noises when recording vocals.\n4. **Record in a dry room:** A room with minimal echo and reverberation will give you a cleaner recording.\n\nRemember, the key to getting started with recording is to keep it simple, experiment, and have fun! You can always upgrade your gear and software as you become more comfortable with the recording process.\n\nHappy recording, and I hope you enjoy your new music room!",
