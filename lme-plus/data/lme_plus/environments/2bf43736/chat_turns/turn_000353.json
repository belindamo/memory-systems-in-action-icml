  "content": "Nancy Pelosi, Donald Trump, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Sinema met for a tense negotiation over funding for the President's border wall. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer, the top Democrats in Congress, strongly opposed the President's plan, while Ms. Sinema, a moderate Democrat, sought a compromise. The meeting was marked by sharp exchanges, with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Trump often speaking over each other and Mr. Schumer attempting to mediate. Ultimately, the negotiation ended without a resolution, as the Democrats refused to agree to the President's demands. The impasse has resulted in a partial government shutdown, with no end in sight.",
