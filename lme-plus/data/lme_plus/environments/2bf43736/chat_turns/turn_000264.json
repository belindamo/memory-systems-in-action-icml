We approach this from both an applied and theoretical perspective.\n\nFrom an applied perspective, the Soccer Player Action Description Language (SPADL) has been widely used for representing event data in soccer. SPADL unifies existing event stream formats into a common vocabulary, enabling subsequent data analysis. SPADL is a tabular, action-oriented data format, where actions are a subset of events that require a player to perform them. For example, a passing event is an action, whereas an event signifying the end of the game is not an action.\n\nSPADL has two main versions: Regular SPADL (R-SPADL) and Atomic SPADL (A-SPADL). R-SPADL represents a game as a sequence of on-the-ball actions $[a\\_1, a\\_2, ... , a\\_m]$, where $m$ is the total number of actions that happened in the game. Each action is a tuple of the same twelve attributes: game\\_id, period\\_id, seconds, player, team, start\\_x, start\\_y, end\\_x, end\\_y, action\\_type, result, bodypart. In contrast, A-SPADL removes the result attribute and adds a few new action types that indicate some of the omitted action results (goal, out, yellow card, red card). Each action in A-SPADL is now a tuple of the following eleven attributes: game\\_id, period\\_id, seconds, player, team, x, y, dx, dy, action\\_type, bodypart.\n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed for valuing actions in soccer using event stream data. The count-based approach assigns weights to each action type and calculates a weighting sum of the number of times a player performs each action type during a match. These weights are typically learned by training a model that correlates these counts with either the match outcome or the number of goals scored (or conceded).\n\nThe expected possession value (EPV) approaches, on the other hand, separate a match into possessions or phases, which are sequences of consecutive on-the-ball actions where the same team possesses the ball. These models value each action that progresses the ball by estimating how much the action changed the team\u2019s chances of producing a goal.\n\nIn contrast, the action-based approaches value a broader set of actions and take the action and game context into account. The VAEP model, which we use in this paper, is an example of an action-based approach. VAEP uses SPADL-derived features as input (regular or atomic) and was initially a binary classifier that predicts whether a team scores a goal within a certain time window after an action. VAEP has since been extended to a regression model that predicts the expected goal difference at the end of the match.\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, reinforcement learning has been widely used in sports analytics. Reinforcement learning is a framework for learning how to take actions in an environment in order to maximize a reward signal. In the context of sports analytics, the environment is the game and the actions are the decisions made by the players or the coach. The reward signal is typically a measure of the team\u2019s performance, such as the number of goals scored.\n\nOne of the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to sports is the large state and action spaces. In soccer, for example, the state space consists of all the possible configurations of the players and the ball on the field, and the action space consists of all the possible movements and actions that the players can take.
