  "content": "I think I'll start with Instagram and Facebook, as they seem to be the most popular platforms for fashion brands. I like the idea of creating a sustainability series on Instagram, where I can share behind-the-scenes content, customer photos, and educational tips on sustainable fashion practices. On Facebook, I can share more in-depth content, such as blog posts, promotions, and events. Do you have any tips on how to create engaging content for these platforms?",
