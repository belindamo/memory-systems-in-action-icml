  "content": "The first set of abstracts investigates the carbon emission scales of residential and commercial buildings in 30 provinces in China. The authors find that more than three-quarters of the samples can be fitted by the carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) model, and approximately half of the provincial residential and commercial buildings peak at different emission scales, except for emission per floor space. The second set of abstracts examines the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis using the fishing grounds footprint (FGF) as the environmental degradation indicator in China from 1961 to 2017. The authors find that total fisheries production has a detrimental effect on the environment, and suggest implementing a common fishing policy at the regional and global levels to stabilize the FGF and using new technologies that are harmless to the environment at every stage of fishery production processes may be beneficial for the environment. The third set of abstracts investigates EKC heterogeneity in a panel of 290 cities from 2001 to 2018. The authors identify different curve shapes and turning points associated with EKC heterogeneity and consider three regulations effective to strike a balance between urban emission reduction and long-term economic growth. The fourth set of abstracts constructs a differentiated energy Kuznets curve (EKC) and a Cobb-Douglas production function based on provincial time series data to analyse the evolution of the influential mechanism on mainland China's economic development. The authors find that mainland China's energy intensity first increases and then decreases and shows an asymmetric inverted U-shaped curve, and there are also significant differences in various provinces' EKCs.",
