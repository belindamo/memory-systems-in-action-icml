Sorry for the trouble. We're aware and working to get this fixed.\"\n\nRecently, many Twitter users have been complaining about bugs on the platform. To address this, Musk instructed Twitter employees to prioritize system stability and robustness over new feature development, particularly with the Super Bowl approaching, as reported by The Information.\n\nSince 2017, Twitter users have been able to share tweets with a maximum of 280 characters. It is worth noting that Twitter's paid subscribers under Twitter Blue can now post up to 4,000 characters per tweet, a new feature rolled out by the platform.",
