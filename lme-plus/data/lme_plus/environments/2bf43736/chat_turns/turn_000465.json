  "content": "In the first set of abstracts, Chen et al. (2022) investigate the emission scales of carbon emission changes in residential and commercial building operations across 30 provinces in China using the carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) model. They find that the CKC model can fit more than three-quarters of the samples and that most CKCs are inverted U-shaped. Additionally, they observe that approximately half of the provincial residential and commercial buildings peak at different emission scales, except for emission per floor space.\n\nIn the second set of abstracts, Yilanci et al. (2022) study the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis using the fishing grounds footprint (FGF) as the environmental degradation indicator in China from 1961 to 2017. They find that total fisheries production has a detrimental effect on the environment and suggest implementing a common fishing policy at regional and global levels to stabilize the FGF.\n\nIn the third set of abstracts, Li et al. (2021) investigate the heterogeneity of the EKC in a panel of 290 cities from 2001 to 2018. They find that different curve shapes and turning points are associated with EKC heterogeneity, and that pollution rights trading, low-carbon city, and CO2 emission trading regulations are effective in reducing urban emissions and striking a balance between urban emission reduction and long-term economic growth.\n\nFinally, in the fourth set of abstracts, Wang et al. (2021) construct a differentiated energy Kuznets curve (EKC) and a Cobb-Douglas production function based on provincial time series data to analyze the evolution of the influential mechanism on mainland China's economic development. They find that there are significant differences in various provinces' EKCs and that the starting points, inflection points, and evolution trajectories of these EKCs are different among mainland China's provinces.",
