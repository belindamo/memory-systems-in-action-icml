  "content": "A farm can be classified as a ranch if it primarily raises animals, usually for their meat, milk, or hide, and if it is large in size. The exact definition of a ranch can vary depending on the region or country, but in general, a farm that focuses on animal husbandry on a significant scale would be considered a ranch. It's worth noting that some farms may have a mix of crops and animals and in that case it would be considered a mixed farm.",
