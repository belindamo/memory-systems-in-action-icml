If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop and consult with your yoga instructor or a medical professional.\n6. **Incorporate yoga into your warm-up and cool-down**: Use yoga poses as a dynamic warm-up before runs or as a cool-down to stretch and recover after runs.\n7. **Make it a habit**: Try to make yoga a regular part of your routine, just like running. The consistency will help you see improvements in your flexibility, balance, and overall running performance.\n\n**Sample Yoga Routine for Runners**\n\nHere's an example routine you can follow:\n\nMonday (20 minutes):\n\n* Mountain pose (5 minutes)\n* Downward-facing dog (3 sets of 30 seconds)\n* Pigeon pose (3 sets of 30 seconds per side)\n* Seated forward fold (3 sets of 30 seconds)\n* Savasana (5 minutes)\n\nWednesday (20 minutes):\n\n* Tree pose (3 sets of 30 seconds per leg)\n* Warrior II (3 sets of 30 seconds per side)\n* Triangle pose (3 sets of 30 seconds per side)\n* Seated spinal twist (3 sets of 30 seconds per side)\n* Savasana (5 minutes)\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust the routine as needed.
