Sharing a series of photos or a short video can be a great way to showcase Luna's playful personality and capture the dynamic movement of her playing with the yarn. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Series of photos:**\n\nPros:\n\n* You can showcase different moments and expressions of Luna's playtime\n* Easier to edit and caption individually\n* Can be a great way to tell a story or show a sequence of events\n\nCons:\n\n* May be overwhelming if you share too many photos at once\n* Might not be as engaging as a video\n\n**Short video:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Can capture the movement and action of Luna playing with the yarn in a more dynamic way\n* Can add music or sound effects to enhance the experience\n* Can be more engaging and attention-grabbing than a single photo\n\nCons:\n\n* May require more editing and production time\n* Could be difficult to keep it short and sweet (under 60 seconds is ideal for Instagram)\n\n**Combining both:**\n\nYou could also consider sharing a series of photos and a short video together! This way, you can showcase the best of both worlds. For example, you could share 2-3 photos of Luna playing with the yarn, and then add a short video clip (10-15 seconds) of her in action.\n\nUltimately, it depends on your personal preference, your audience's engagement style, and the type of content you're comfortable creating. If you do decide to create a video, make sure to keep it short, sweet, and optimized for sound-off viewing (since many users watch videos with the sound off).\n\nWhich direction are you leaning towards?",
