Their chicken sandwiches are definitely a popular favorite among many people.\n\nAs for your question, I don't have real-time information about specific mall locations or food court options. However, I can suggest a few ways to find out if there's a Chick-fil-A at your mall's food court:\n\n1. **Check the mall's website or app**: Look up the mall's website or mobile app to see a list of food court vendors. You can usually find this information under the \"Dining\" or \"Food Court\" section.\n2. **Call the mall's customer service**: Give the mall's customer service number a call and ask if they have a Chick-fil-A location in their food court.\n3. **Check Chick-fil-A's website**: You can also visit Chick-fil-A's website and use their location finder tool to see if there's a location near you or at the mall.\n\nIf there is a Chick-fil-A at the mall's food court, you can treat yourself to that delicious chicken sandwich again! If not, you can always consider other options or suggest an alternative to your friends.\n\nHope this helps, and I hope you get your Chick-fil-A fix soon!",
