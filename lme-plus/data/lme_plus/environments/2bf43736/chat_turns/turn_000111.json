It's a great way to get familiar with the tool and explore its features without committing to a paid subscription.\n\nRegarding applying what you learn to your current project, I recommend a hybrid approach:\n\n1. **Start with smaller personal projects**: Begin by working on smaller personal projects that allow you to practice and apply your new skills in a low-stakes environment. This will help you build confidence and fluency with the tools and techniques.\n2. **Apply to your current project incrementally**: As you gain more experience and confidence, start applying what you've learned to your current project for the major bank. Start with small, incremental changes or additions, and gradually work your way up to more significant contributions.\n\nThis approach will help you:\n\n* Build a solid foundation in data visualization and Python programming\n* Develop a portfolio of personal projects that demonstrate your skills\n* Gradually apply your new skills to your current project, reducing the risk of errors or misunderstandings\n\nSome potential personal projects to consider:\n\n* Visualizing a dataset from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository\n* Creating a dashboard to track personal metrics, such as fitness or finance data\n* Analyzing and visualizing a dataset related to a hobby or interest\n\nBy working on smaller projects first, you'll be able to:\n\n* Develop a deeper understanding of the tools and techniques\n* Identify and overcome any challenges or obstacles\n* Refine your skills and confidence before applying them to your current project\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with the tools and techniques, you can start applying them to your current project, and you'll be more likely to succeed.\n\nHow does that sound?",
