Here are some examples of modern games that continue to follow the legacy of Ultima:\n\n1. Kingdom Come: Deliverance: Kingdom Come is a medieval-themed RPG that takes place in a historically accurate depiction of Bohemia in the early 15th century. The game features a richly detailed open world that players can explore, full of realistic NPCs and intricate quests. The game's combat system and character development are also reminiscent of Ultima's style.\n\n2. Divinity: Original Sin II: Divinity: Original Sin II is a classic-style RPG that allows players to create their own character and explore a massive open world, full of secrets and hidden quests. The game's deep character customization and non-linear storyline take inspiration from Ultima's approach to world-building and quest design.\n\n3. Kenshi: Kenshi is a post-apocalyptic RPG that takes place in a mystical eastern-inspired world. Players can create their own character and explore the game's vast open world, full of dangers and opportunities. The game's complex character development system and sandbox-style gameplay draw heavily from Ultima's design principles.\n\n4. Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire: Pillars of Eternity II is another classic-style RPG that offers players a deep, immersive world to explore. The game features many of the same design elements that made Ultima so popular, including highly customizable characters, a branching storyline, and a large, open world to explore.\n\nThese are just some examples of modern games that have been heavily influenced by Ultima's open-world gameplay and character customization. There's no doubt that Ultima's legacy continues to inspire new games in the RPG genre, as developers seek to capture the same magic that made Ultima such a beloved series in the first place.",
