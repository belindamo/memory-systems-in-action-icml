  "content": "After a record-breaking 35-day partial government shutdown, Congress reached a deal to temporarily reopen the government. The agreement came after a remarkable series of late-night calls and back-channel negotiations between Nancy Pelosi, Donald Trump, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Sinema. The deal, which provides funding for the government until February 15, does not include money for the President's border wall, but allows for a bipartisan committee to continue negotiations on border security. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer hailed the agreement as a victory for the American people, while Mr. Trump vowed to continue fighting for his signature campaign promise. The agreement was welcomed by federal workers, who will now be able to return to their jobs and receive back pay.",
