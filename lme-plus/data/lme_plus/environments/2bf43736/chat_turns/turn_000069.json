  "content": "N.T. Wright is a renowned British New Testament scholar, Anglican bishop, and prolific author. He's written numerous books on theology, biblical studies, and Christian living, and is widely respected for his insightful and accessible writing style.\n\nN.T. Wright's background is quite impressive:\n\n* He holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Oxford and has taught at several universities, including Cambridge and McGill.\n* He served as the Bishop of Durham from 2003 to 2010 and is currently the Chair of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n* He's written over 70 books, including the popular \"For Everyone\" series, which aims to make biblical scholarship accessible to a broad audience.\n\nAs for what inspired him to write \"Lent for Everyone,\" Wright has said that he wanted to create a devotional that would help people engage with the Gospel of Mark in a more intentional way during Lent. He believes that Lent is a time for Christians to reflect on their faith, and he hopes that his devotional will encourage readers to slow down, read the Bible carefully, and allow the Gospel to shape their lives.\n\nNow, about your Lenten goal of volunteering at a local soup kitchen! That's a wonderful idea. I'm not aware of specific organizations near St. Mary's Church, but I can suggest a few ways to find opportunities in your area:\n\n1. **Google search**: Type in \"soup kitchens near me\" or \"food banks near St. Mary's Church\" to find organizations in your area.\n2. **VolunteerMatch**: This website allows you to search for volunteer opportunities by location and cause. You can filter results to find soup kitchens or food banks near you.\n3. **Local church or community center**: Reach out to St. Mary's Church or other local churches, community centers, or non-profit organizations in your area to ask if they know of any soup kitchens or food banks that need volunteers.\n4. **Feeding America**: This organization is a network of food banks across the United States. You can search for food banks in your area and contact them directly to ask about volunteer opportunities.\n\nRemember to approach any organization you're interested in with an open mind and a willingness to learn. They may have specific requirements or training for volunteers, so be sure to ask about their process and what you can expect.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a meaningful and fulfilling Lenten journey!",
