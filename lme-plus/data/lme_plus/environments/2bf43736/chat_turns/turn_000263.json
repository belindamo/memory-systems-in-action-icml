  "content": "The follwing is an outline of a Related Work section from a Machine Learning and Sports Analytics paper that would be submitted to a top conference in the area. Write the entire Related Work section with academic rigor.\n\n- Introduce Related Work section\n - Approach section from an applied and a theoretical perspective\n- Applied perspective\n - Soccer Player Action Description Language (SPADL)\n - Event data representation\n - Unifies the existing event stream formats into a common vocabulary that enables subsequent data analysis\n - Is\u00a0a tabular action-oriented data format\n - Actions are a subset of events that require a player to perform the action\n - For example, a passing event is an action, whereas an event signifying the end of the game is not an action\n - Regular SPADL\n - Regular SPADL (R-SPADL) represents a game as a sequence of on-the-ball actions\u00a0$$[a\\_1, a\\_2, . . . , a\\_m]$$, where\u00a0$$m$$\u00a0is the total number of actions that happened in the game. Each action is a tuple of the same twelve attributes:\n - game\\_id: the ID of the game in which the action was performed\n - period\\_id: the ID of the game period in which the action was performed\n - seconds: the action's start time\n - player: the player who performed the action\n - team: the player's team\n - start\\_x: the x location where the action started\n - start\\_y: the y location where the action started\n - end\\_x: the x location where the action ended\n - end\\_y: the y location where the action ended\n - action\\_type: the type of the action (e.g., pass, shot, dribble)\n - result: the result of the action (e.g., success or fail)\n - bodypart: the player's body part used for the action\n - Atomic SPADL\n - Atomic SPADL (A-SPADL) is an alternative version of R-SPADL that removes the result attribute and adds a few new action types that indicate some of the omitted action results (goal, out, yellow card, red card). Each action is now a tuple of the following eleven attributes:\n - game\\_id: the ID of the game in which the action was performed\n - period\\_id: the ID of the game period in which the action was performed\n - seconds: the action's start time\n - player: the player who performed the action\n - team: the player's team\n - x: the x location where the action started\n - y: the y location where the action started\n - dx: the distance covered by the action along the x-axis\n - dy: the distance covered by the action along the y-axis\n - action\\_type: the type of the action (e.g., pass, shot, dribble)\n - bodypart: the player's body part used for the action\n - Valuing Actions\n - Three main approaches for valuing actions in soccer using event stream data\n - Count-based\n - Rates players by: assigning a weight to each action type, and calculating a weighting sum of the number of times a player performs each action type during a match. \n - The weights are typically learned by training a model that correlates these counts with either the match outcome or the number of goals scored (or conceded).\n - Expected possession value (EPV) approaches\n - Separates a match into possessions or phases, which are sequences of consecutive on-the-ball actions where the same team possesses the ball. \n - These models value each action that progresses the ball by estimating how much the action changed the team\u2019s chances of producing a goal\n - Action-based approaches\n - Value a broader set of actions and by taking the action and game context into account\n - VAEP is action-based\n - VAEP uses SPADL-derived features as input (regular or atomic)\n - VAEP was initially a binary classification task to estimate the probability of scoring and conceding a goal within the subsequent ten actions\n - However, goals are a weak signal with lots of noise from which it might be harder learn to make good predictions\n - Later, a change in the underlying task in VAEP from binary classification to regression to learn from better signal\n - xG (numeric) as label is a stronger signal than goals (binary) as it is a general measure of the quality of a shot, independent of its outcome\n - Label quality and training data volume tradeoff\n - Learning the value of all actions from goals might be quite a stretch if data is limited, as the signal is weak\n - At the same time, learning an xG model requires some data exclusively for that\n- Theoretical perspective\n - Verification of Trees using Anytime Search (VERITAS)\n - Is an algorithm that addresses multiple different types of verification tasks on tree ensembles by modeling them as a generic optimization problem\n - One of them problems VERITAS can be used for are Counterfactual Explanations (CE's)\n - VERITAS is the first fine-grained anytime algorithm to produce both an upper and a lower bound on the output of a tree ensemble model\n - Outperforms the state of the art in terms of quality of the bounds for many tasks",
