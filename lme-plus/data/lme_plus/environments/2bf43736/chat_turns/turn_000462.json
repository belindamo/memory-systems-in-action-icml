  "content": "Yes, Ultima has influenced many other design elements beyond open-world gameplay and character customization, such as morality systems, NPC interaction, and storytelling.\n\n1. Morality systems: Ultima was one of the first games to introduce a morality system that tracked the player's choices and actions in the game world. This system allowed players to role-play their characters and make choices that would affect the story and the game world at large. Many modern RPGs such as Mass Effect and Fable, have taken inspiration from Ultima's morality system.\n\n2. NPC Interaction: Ultima was one of the first games to feature an NPC interaction system that allowed players to converse with non-player characters and learn more about the game world. This system allowed players to gather information about quests and discover hidden secrets. This influence can be seen in modern adventure games such as the Elder Scrolls series and The Witcher.\n\n3. Storytelling: Ultima was also known for its engaging storytelling, which featured strong characters and complex plots. The game's designers used plot twists and ambiguous moral choices to keep players engaged and invested in the story. This approach to storytelling has been influential in many other RPGs, such as The Witcher 3, which features a branching storyline with many plot twists and turns.\n\nSo, beyond the realm of open-world gameplay and character customization, Ultima's influence can be seen in morality systems, NPC interaction, and storytelling. These design elements have continued to influence modern games and will likely continue to do so for many years to come.",
