Remember to be gentle with yourself and adjust the routine as needed to fit your unique needs and preferences.\n\nSome additional tips to help you make the most of your morning routine:\n\n* Try to avoid screens (e.g., phones, tablets, or laptops) for at least 30 minutes after waking up to help your brain wake up more gently.\n* Consider making your breakfast or lunch the night before to save time in the morning.\n* Keep your email check focused and efficient to avoid getting sucked into non-essential tasks.\n* Use the buffer time to do something enjoyable, like reading a book, listening to music, or simply taking a few deep breaths.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further adjustments to your morning routine.",
