  "content": "Contemplative prayer and meditation can be a powerful way to deepen your connection with God. And yes, I'm happy to report that St. Mary's Church does offer a contemplative prayer group!\n\nThe group meets weekly, usually on Wednesday evenings, and is led by a trained spiritual director. They explore various forms of contemplative prayer, including centering prayer, lectio divina, and mindfulness meditation. The group provides a safe and supportive environment for people to explore their spirituality and deepen their connection with God.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more or would like to attend a meeting, I recommend reaching out to the church office or checking their website for more information. They might also have other resources or events that can help you on your contemplative journey.\n\nRemember, contemplative prayer is a journey, and it's essential to approach it with an open heart and mind. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be discouraged if you encounter challenges or distractions. With regular practice and patience, you can develop a deeper sense of connection with God and cultivate a more contemplative spirit.\n\nMay you find peace and guidance on your contemplative journey!",
