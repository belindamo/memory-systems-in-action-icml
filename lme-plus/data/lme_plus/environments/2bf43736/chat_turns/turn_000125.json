Building credibility: Sharing expertise and engaging with followers on personal social media can help entrepreneurs showcase their knowledge and experience, which can increase their credibility and trustworthiness in their industry.\n\n2. Networking: Personal social media can help entrepreneurs expand their network and connect with others in their industry or related fields.\n\n3. Humanizing the brand: A personal social media presence can help entrepreneurs humanize their brand and showcase their personality or values, which can help build stronger relationships with their followers and lead to increased engagement.\n\n4.
