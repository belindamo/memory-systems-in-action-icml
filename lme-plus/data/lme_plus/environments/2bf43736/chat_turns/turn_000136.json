Let me try again.\n\nActually, I've been doing a lot of journaling and reflection lately, especially since I started seeing a therapist. It's been really helpful in identifying my triggers and working through childhood trauma. I've also been doing a lot of reflection outside of our sessions, which has helped me gain more insight into my thoughts and feelings.\n\nI think journaling and reflection can be really powerful tools for personal growth and self-awareness. It's amazing how much you can learn about yourself just by taking the time to reflect on your thoughts and feelings.\n\nBut I'm curious, do you have any suggestions on how to stay motivated and consistent with journaling and reflection? Sometimes I find myself getting lazy or feeling like I'm not doing it \"right,\" and it's hard to keep up the habit.",
