I'd be happy to help you come up with some outfit ideas for a casual day out with friends.\n\nFirst, let's start with the graphic t-shirts from H&M. What's the vibe of the designs? Are they bold and colorful, or more subtle and minimalist?\n\nAssuming they're fairly casual, here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Jeans and sneakers**: Pair your graphic tee with a pair of comfortable jeans (light wash or dark, depending on the color of the tee) and your new sneakers from Foot Locker. This is a classic, easy combo that's perfect for a casual day out.\n2. **Skirt and sneakers**: If you want to add a bit of femininity to your outfit, try pairing the graphic tee with a flowy skirt (midi or maxi length works well). The sneakers will still keep the look casual and relaxed.\n3. **Joggers and sneakers**: Joggers are a great alternative to jeans, and they can add a sporty touch to your outfit. Pair them with your graphic tee and sneakers for a comfortable, laid-back look.\n\nNow, let's incorporate your new Coach handbag into the mix! Since it's versatile, you can pair it with any of the above outfits. Here are a few more ideas:\n\n1. **Add a denim jacket**: Throw on a denim jacket over your graphic tee and jeans/skirt/joggers combo. This adds a cool, casual layering element to your outfit, and the Coach handbag will add a touch of sophistication.\n2. **Swap sneakers for sandals**: If the weather permits, swap out your sneakers for sandals or slides. This will instantly dress down your outfit and make it perfect for a summer day out with friends.\n3. **Try a hat and sunglasses**: Add a trendy touch to your outfit with a hat and sunglasses. This will not only protect you from the sun but also add a stylish element to your overall look.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different combinations of these ideas, and don't be afraid to add your own personal touches to make the outfit truly yours!\n\nWhich of these ideas resonates with you, or do you have any other questions about styling your new pieces?",
