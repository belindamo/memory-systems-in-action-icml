To help buildings hit the carbon peak goal, we investigate the different emission scales of carbon emission changes of residential and commercial building operations across 30 provinces in China through the carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) model. We observe that (1) more than three-quarters of the samples can be fitted by the CKC model. Most CKCs are the inverted U-shaped, residential and commercial buildings occupying 93% and 90% at the total emission scale, respectively. In addition, the remains can be illustrated as N-shaped curves. (2) Under the premise of CKCs existence, approximately half of the provincial residential and commercial buildings peak at different emission scales, except for emission per floor space (residential: 89%; commercial: 81%). Provinces with better economic development have a higher peaking probability. In the total emissions, the peaking probability in residential buildings is 33% and 50% for provinces with economic indicators <20,000 Chinese Yuan and 30,000-40,000 Chinese Yuan, respectively, and 22% and 67% for commercial buildings, respectively. (3) Taking carbon intensity as a case study, decoupling analysis examines the robustness of the CKC estimation. Overall, we close the gap of the CKC estimation in commercial and residential buildings, and the proposed methods can be treated as a tool for other economies to illustrate the retrospective and prospective trajectories of carbon emissions in building operations.\nVeli Yilanci, Ibrahim Cutcu, Bilal Cayir,\n2022,\nAbstract: This study tests the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis by using the fishing grounds footprint (FGF) as the environmental degradation indicator in China from 1961 to 2017. The study also uses China?\uea03 total fisheries production as a control variable. Since the results of the analysis indicate a long-run relationship between the variables, we estimate the long- and short-run coefficients that present evidence for the validity of the EKC in the long-run. We find that total fisheries production has a detrimental effect on the environment. The findings of the study have important policy implications for decision-makers: Implementing a common fishing policy at the regional and global levels to stabilize the FGF and using new technologies that are harmless to the environment at every stage of fishery production processes may be beneficial for the environment.\nLi He, Xiaoling Zhang, Yaxue Yan,\n2021,\nAbstract: Although an ?\ue95cnverted U-shaped??economy-environment nexus is proposed in the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, this initial configuration is considered to be too restrictive. Considering the diversified pollution, regional heterogeneity and strong government intervention in China, this article investigates EKC?\uea03 heterogeneity in a panel of 290 cities from 2001 to 2018. Through the investigation of the lag effect and spatial spillover effect of pollution emissions, the heterogeneity of EKC is examined among different pollutants and different regions. Moreover, such heterogeneity pattern also exists between pilot cities and non-pilot cities of three environmental policies (?\ue963ollution rights trading (PRT)?? ?\ue95fow-carbon city??and ?\ue946O2 emission trading??. The results show that different curve shapes and turning points are associated with EKC heterogeneity. Three regulations are considered effective to strike a balance between urban emission reduction and long-term economic growth. Pollution rights??trading could contribute to the earlier ?\ue957ecoupling??between urban pollution (both industrial pollution and haze pollution) and economic growth in the pilot cities significantly. The implementation of the ?\ue95fow-carbon city??and ?\ue946O2 emission trading??are considered conducive to reducing the emissions of industrial SO2, with the former also resulting in fewer industrial smog emissions. The main contributions of this study are to identify both the temporal and spatial effects of pollution, develop the multidimensional analysis framework on the heterogeneity of EKC and investigate the dual effects of institutional power upon EKC as well as EKC heterogeneity. The implications, nevertheless, are considered as 1) the coordinated environment prevention and control between different regions and 2) the strict inspection of existing policy implementation by respecting each of their heterogeneous effects between regions.\nZhibao Wang, Nana Zhao, Wendong Wei, Qianwen Zhang,\n2021,\nAbstract: The differentiated research of energy consumption has important practical and theoretical significance. For this purpose, this paper constructs a differentiated energy Kuznets curve (EKC) and a Cobb-Douglas production function based on provincial time series data to analyse the evolution of the influential mechanism on mainland China?\uea03 economic development. Mainland China?\uea03 energy intensity first increases and then decreases and shows an asymmetric inverted U-shaped curve. There are also significant differences in various provinces??EKCs. The starting points, inflection points and evolution trajectories of these EKCs are different among mainland China?\uea03 provinces. When the economic level at the inflection point is higher, the energy intensity will be lower. The reason for these differences in various provinces??EKCs is that the unit energy consumption variation (UE) and the total energy consumption increase value (TE) in various Class production functions are different. Specifically, the contribution of energy input and technical progress to economic development is significant, while energy consumption is still the factor that drives economic development in most of mainland China?\uea03 provinces.\nChang Xu, Zhang Yiwen, Baodong Cheng, Lingchao Li, Mengzhen Zhang,\n2020,\nAbstract: As one of the most common environmental problems, noise pollution in modern cities has been causing many short-term and long-term health problems. This study examines whether the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) exists on China?\uea03 noise pollution problem. Based on the two-way fixed effects model, we study the relationship between noise pollution and economic development based on the noise monitoring data from 111 cities in China from 1991 to 2017, and the robustness test was conducted using GMM and semi-parametric methods. We find that 1) Relationship between noise pollution and economic development in China is inverted N-shaped at the national scale. 2) Shapes of noise pollution EKC curves have substantial regional variations: the curve is inverted N-shaped in the eastern region, inverted U-shaped in the central region, and linear in the western region. 3) Missing key variables in the parameter regression will change the turning point. 4) Development of the tertiary industry will increase noise pollution. Our research results show that economic development does not necessarily lead to environmental degradation. The government should play an important role in noise pollution control and pay more attention to the environmental demands of society."
