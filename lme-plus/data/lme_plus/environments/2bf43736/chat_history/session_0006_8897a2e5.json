      "content": "N.T. Wright is a renowned British New Testament scholar, Anglican bishop, and prolific author. He's written numerous books on theology, biblical studies, and Christian living, and is widely respected for his insightful and accessible writing style.\n\nN.T. Wright's background is quite impressive:\n\n* He holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Oxford and has taught at several universities, including Cambridge and McGill.\n* He served as the Bishop of Durham from 2003 to 2010 and is currently the Chair of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n* He's written over 70 books, including the popular \"For Everyone\" series, which aims to make biblical scholarship accessible to a broad audience.\n\nAs for what inspired him to write \"Lent for Everyone,\" Wright has said that he wanted to create a devotional that would help people engage with the Gospel of Mark in a more intentional way during Lent. He believes that Lent is a time for Christians to reflect on their faith, and he hopes that his devotional will encourage readers to slow down, read the Bible carefully, and allow the Gospel to shape their lives.\n\nNow, about your Lenten goal of volunteering at a local soup kitchen! That's a wonderful idea. I'm not aware of specific organizations near St. Mary's Church, but I can suggest a few ways to find opportunities in your area:\n\n1. **Google search**: Type in \"soup kitchens near me\" or \"food banks near St. Mary's Church\" to find organizations in your area.\n2. **VolunteerMatch**: This website allows you to search for volunteer opportunities by location and cause.
