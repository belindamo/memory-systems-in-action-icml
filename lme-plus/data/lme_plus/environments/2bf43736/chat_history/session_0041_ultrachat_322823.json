      "content": "Yes, there are quite a few recent games that have been heavily influenced by Ultima's open-world gameplay and character customization. Here are some examples of modern games that continue to follow the legacy of Ultima:\n\n1. Kingdom Come: Deliverance: Kingdom Come is a medieval-themed RPG that takes place in a historically accurate depiction of Bohemia in the early 15th century. The game features a richly detailed open world that players can explore, full of realistic NPCs and intricate quests. The game's combat system and character development are also reminiscent of Ultima's style.\n\n2. Divinity: Original Sin II: Divinity: Original Sin II is a classic-style RPG that allows players to create their own character and explore a massive open world, full of secrets and hidden quests. The game's deep character customization and non-linear storyline take inspiration from Ultima's approach to world-building and quest design.\n\n3. Kenshi: Kenshi is a post-apocalyptic RPG that takes place in a mystical eastern-inspired world. Players can create their own character and explore the game's vast open world, full of dangers and opportunities. The game's complex character development system and sandbox-style gameplay draw heavily from Ultima's design principles.\n\n4. Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire: Pillars of Eternity II is another classic-style RPG that offers players a deep, immersive world to explore. The game features many of the same design elements that made Ultima so popular, including highly customizable characters, a branching storyline, and a large, open world to explore.\n\nThese are just some examples of modern games that have been heavily influenced by Ultima's open-world gameplay and character customization. There's no doubt that Ultima's legacy continues to inspire new games in the RPG genre, as developers seek to capture the same magic that made Ultima such a beloved series in the first place."

      "content": "Interesting, but are there any games that go beyond just open-world gameplay and character customization? What other design elements has Ultima influenced?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, Ultima has influenced many other design elements beyond open-world gameplay and character customization, such as morality systems, NPC interaction, and storytelling.\n\n1. Morality systems: Ultima was one of the first games to introduce a morality system that tracked the player's choices and actions in the game world. This system allowed players to role-play their characters and make choices that would affect the story and the game world at large. Many modern RPGs such as Mass Effect and Fable, have taken inspiration from Ultima's morality system.\n\n2. NPC Interaction: Ultima was one of the first games to feature an NPC interaction system that allowed players to converse with non-player characters and learn more about the game world. This system allowed players to gather information about quests and discover hidden secrets. This influence can be seen in modern adventure games such as the Elder Scrolls series and The Witcher.\n\n3. Storytelling: Ultima was also known for its engaging storytelling, which featured strong characters and complex plots. The game's designers used plot twists and ambiguous moral choices to keep players engaged and invested in the story. This approach to storytelling has been influential in many other RPGs, such as The Witcher 3, which features a branching storyline with many plot twists and turns.\n\nSo, beyond the realm of open-world gameplay and character customization, Ultima's influence can be seen in morality systems, NPC interaction, and storytelling. These design elements have continued to influence modern games and will likely continue to do so for many years to come."
