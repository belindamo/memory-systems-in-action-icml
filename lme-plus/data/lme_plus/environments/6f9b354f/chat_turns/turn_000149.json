You're absolutely right, I'm a chat assistant and cannot directly book a room for you.\n\nThank you for pointing that out, and I'm glad I could still provide you with the necessary guidance to book your stay at HI San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nRemember to follow the steps I outlined earlier to book your room through the Hostelling International website or another online travel agency. If you need any help with the booking process or have any questions, I'll be here to assist you.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you have an amazing time in San Francisco!",
