But what constitutes creepy? Is it an underlying intuition? A safe preservation mechanism? Well, Doyle and colleagues (2022) investigated that by employing eye-tracking software to identify precisely where participants were looking the longest when examining thirty faces for attractiveness, trustworthiness, and creepiness.\n\nThey found that the eye region was by far the most looked at and that participants who had previously scored high on ambiguity discomfort were likelier to rate others as \u2018creepy\u2019 compared to those who scored highly on fear of the unknown or uncertainty intolerance (yes, these concepts ARE different).\n\nThe researchers note that while there is no evidence to support the notion that individuals labelled as \u2018creepy\u2019 genuinely pose a threat, this label may cause that individual significant harm. Indeed, our ability to correctly identify people as \u2018creepy\u2019 is essential not just for our self-preservation but for preserving others\u2019 from stigma and social marginalisation.\n\n* by @diana chiang\n\nCOVID affected the intercultural connections of our hobbies\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nNaturally following the pandemic, there has been a shift in how we spend our time, who we spend it with, and how much.\n\nBut this also massively differs from culture to culture, country to country. Has COVID made us more locally or globally involved?\n\nUsing network analysis and data gathered from Google Trends based on 50 different countries, Thamprasert, et al. (2021) investigated the interest and country relationships in 10 other hobbies before and after the pandemic.\n\nThe analysis identified that the relationships between hobbies such as art, collecting, and pet care were weak between countries. In contrast, the relationships regarding learning, cooking, music, games, and sports interest became stronger between nations.\n\nThis has exciting applications for widening our understanding of cultural interaction and understanding within a global market.\n\nYou can further explore the specific hobby-based relationships between regions in Thamprasert and colleagues\u2019 (2021) conference paper.\n\n* by @diana chiang\n\nEmotional well-being impacts our social connections\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThere have been piles of research suggesting that emotional well-being, feelings of agency, and our social relationships are intertwined, so this might not shock us. However, the directionality of these relationships has long been under question.\n\nTo answer this question scientifically, Vella-Brodrick, Joshanloo, and Slemp (2022) conducted a 13-year-long longitudinal study following the lives of more than 22,000 participants. These people came from various backgrounds across Australia and had an average age of 35 at the start of the study. Survey data were collected four times every four years.\n\nThe results showed that contrary to prior research generally referring to mental well-being as an outcome or consequence of good social relationships and high agency perceptions, mental well-being was a predictor of the two variables. In fact, early social relationship connectedness was not a predictor but a consequence of agency and mental well-being.\n\nThese findings pause a long-standing debate and emphasise the importance of taking care of your mental well-being, which will likely yield infinite rewards.\n\n* by @diana chiang\n\n---\n\nYou probably underestimate thinking\n===================================\n\nInspired by previous studies exploring spontaneous thinking and metamotivation, a collaboration between Aya Hatano, Cansu Ogulmus, Hiroaki Shigemasu,",
