And by tackling one deeper cleaning task per week, you're making progress on those bigger projects that can make a big impact on your space and mental clarity.\n\nMaking your bed and wiping down kitchen counters are great daily habits to get into. They help create a sense of order and can set a positive tone for the rest of the day. And by vacuuming and tidying up the living room weekly, you're maintaining a comfortable and inviting space for relaxation and socializing.\n\nI love that you're also prioritizing deeper cleaning tasks, like organizing your closet or cleaning the fridge. These tasks can be daunting, but by breaking them down into smaller, weekly goals, you're making progress and creating a sense of accomplishment.\n\nSome additional tips to consider:\n\n* **Create a schedule**: Write down your daily and weekly tasks and check them off as you complete them. This can help you stay on track and see your progress.\n* **Start small**: Don't try to tackle too much at once. Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and focus on one area at a time.\n* **Make it a habit**: Try to perform your daily tasks at the same time every day, so it becomes a habit. For example, making your bed as soon as you get up or wiping down the counters after dinner.\n* **Get the whole family involved**: If you live with others, consider dividing up tasks among household members to make it more manageable and share the responsibility.\n* **Reward yourself**: After completing a deeper cleaning task, take some time to relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Put your feet up, read a book, or enjoy a cup of coffee in your newly organized space!\n\nWhat's been the most challenging part of maintaining your daily cleaning routine, and how do you motivate yourself to keep going?\n\nAnd, I'm curious, what's the next deeper cleaning task on your list?",
