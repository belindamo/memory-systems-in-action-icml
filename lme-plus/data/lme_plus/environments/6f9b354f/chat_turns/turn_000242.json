  "content": "Ice Cube's early solo work and his time with N.W.A. were both highly influential in hip-hop music, but they had distinct differences in themes, styles, and sounds.\n\nIn his early solo work, Ice Cube focused on social and political issues that affect marginalized communities. His debut solo album, \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,\" was a groundbreaking release that dealt with topics such as police brutality, racism, and poverty. Ice Cube's lyrics were raw and uncompromising, using profanity and vivid descriptions to paint a picture of life in the inner city. The album also featured samples of jazz and funk to create a distinct sound that was different from the hardcore rap of N.W.A.\n\nIn contrast, Ice Cube's work with N.W.A. was focused more on gangsta rap, which celebrated the criminal lifestyle and glamorized violence. Although he was the primary writer for the group, Ice Cube's lyrics were more aggressive and used more profanity than in his solo work. He also adopted a more confrontational, in-your-face style that matched the group's overall sound.\n\nDespite these differences, both Ice Cube's early solo work and his time with N.W.A. had a profound impact on hip-hop music. They both challenged mainstream culture and represented a voice for the underrepresented, bringing issues of racism, poverty, and police brutality to the forefront of the music industry.",
