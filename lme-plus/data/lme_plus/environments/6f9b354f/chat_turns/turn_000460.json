  "content": "I remember attending the Sunday mass at St. Mary's Church on January 10th, which was a special occasion as it was my grandmother's birthday and the priest prayed for her good health. The sermon that day was about forgiveness, and it really resonated with me. I've been thinking about forgiveness a lot lately, and I'm interested in learning more about the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Can you tell me more about it?",
