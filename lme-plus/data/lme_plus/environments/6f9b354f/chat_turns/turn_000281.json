  "content": "Assuming you are referring to the Eulsa Treaty (also known as the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905), here is a description of how it was passed:\n\nThe Eulsa Treaty was signed on November 17, 1905, between Japan and Korea, during a period of Japanese imperial expansion in East Asia. The treaty was imposed on Korea by Japan, which had just won a war against Russia and was seeking to expand its influence in the region.\n\nThe treaty was negotiated by Japanese and Korean officials, but it was heavily weighted in Japan's favor, and the Korean officials were effectively forced to accept its terms under duress. The treaty effectively made Korea a protectorate of Japan, giving Japan control over Korean foreign affairs and granting Japanese officials extraterritorial rights in Korea.\n\nThe Eulsa Treaty was highly controversial in Korea, and it sparked widespread protests and unrest. Many Koreans saw the treaty as a violation of their country's sovereignty and as evidence of Japan's imperialistic ambitions in the region. The Korean emperor, Gojong, protested the treaty and sought international support to overturn it, but he was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nThe Eulsa Treaty was ratified by the Japanese parliament in December 1905, and it went into effect in February 1906. The treaty was a significant turning point in the history of Korea, as it marked the beginning of Japanese colonial rule and set the stage for the harsh repression and exploitation of the Korean people by the Japanese government.",
