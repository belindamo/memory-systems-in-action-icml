Here's what you need to do:\n\n**Step 1: Complete Form SS-5**\n\nYou've already updated your Social Security card, but you'll need to complete Form SS-5, \"Application for a Social Security Card,\" again to notify the IRS about your name change. You can download and print the form from the SSA website ([www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf](http://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)) or call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213 to request a form by mail.\n\n**Step 2: Attach required documents**\n\nAttach the following documents to Form SS-5:\n\n* A certified copy of your court order or decree changing your name.\n* Your updated Social Security card showing your new name.\n* A copy of your government-issued ID (driver's license, state ID, or passport) showing your new name.\n\n**Step 3: Mail the application**\n\nMail the completed Form SS-5 and supporting documents to:\n\nSocial Security Administration\nOffice of Central Operations\nP.O. Box 648009\nIndianapolis, IN 46206-8009\n\n**Step 4: Notify the IRS**\n\nOnce you've submitted Form SS-5, the SSA will notify the IRS about your name change. However, it's a good idea to also notify the IRS directly to ensure your tax records are updated correctly. You can do this by:\n\n* Calling the IRS at 1-800-829-1040 (individual taxpayers) or 1-800-829-4933 (business taxpayers).\n* Mailing a letter to the IRS with your old and new names, Social Security number, and a copy of your court order or decree changing your name. Address the letter to:\n\nInternal Revenue Service\nAttn: Name Change\n1111 Constitution Ave NW\nWashington, DC 20224-0002\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Update your name with your employer, as they'll need to report your income under your new name.\n* If you're self-employed, update your business name and records with the IRS and your state government.\n* Verify that your name change is reflected on your tax returns and any other tax-related documents.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that your tax records are accurate and up-to-date with the IRS.",
