  "content": "Russian warships were present in Korean waters during the period leading up to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 due to Russia's interest in expanding its influence in East Asia and securing access to warm-water ports on the Pacific coast.\n\nAt the time, Korea was a tributary state of China, and both Russia and Japan were interested in gaining influence over Korea and establishing their own protectorates there. Russia had been involved in previous conflicts over Korea, including the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, in which it supported Chinese efforts to maintain control over Korea.\n\nRussian warships were also present in Korean waters in the lead-up to the Russo-Japanese War as part of Russia's broader efforts to expand its power and influence in the region. Russia had been involved in a number of conflicts and diplomatic disputes in East Asia during this period, including with China and Japan, and was seeking to secure its interests and extend its influence throughout the region.\n\nWhile the presence of Russian warships in Korean waters may have been seen as a threat by Japan and other countries in the region, it was primarily driven by Russia's own strategic and economic interests in East Asia.",
