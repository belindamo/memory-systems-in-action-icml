  "content": "Yes, traditionally, the installation of solar panels can be expensive. The main cost comes from the photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. However, the cost of solar panels has been decreasing rapidly due to advancements in technology and increased market competition. In fact, the cost of solar panels has decreased by around 90% over the last decade. Despite the initial costs, solar energy is an excellent investment as it can offer significant long-term savings on electricity bills and contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions. Additionally, many governments offer state incentives, tax credits, and other measures to promote the adoption of solar energy as a renewable energy source. These incentives can help to offset the initial cost of installation and reduce payback times for solar panel investments.",
