It sounds like you're making some fantastic lifestyle changes to prioritize your self-care and well-being. \n\n**Yoga is an excellent choice** for reducing stress and improving flexibility. The physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation can help calm your mind and body. Regular yoga practice can also improve your overall mood, energy levels, and sleep quality. Keep up the great work and enjoy your Saturday morning classes!\n\n**Cooking at home and cutting back on processed foods** is a great way to take control of your nutrition and support your immune system. Processed foods often contain added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats that can weaken your immune system and increase inflammation. By cooking at home, you can choose whole, nutrient-dense ingredients and prepare meals that nourish your body. This can help boost your immune system and support your overall health.\n\nRemember, small changes can add up over time. By prioritizing self-care, exercise, and healthy eating, you're taking significant steps towards reducing stress and improving your overall well-being.\n\nHere are a few more suggestions to consider:\n\n* **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help your body and mind recharge.\n* **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help flush out toxins and support your immune system.\n* **Take breaks and practice mindfulness**: Take short breaks throughout the day to stretch, breathe deeply, and focus on the present moment.\n* **Connect with nature**: Spend time outdoors, whether it's walking, hiking, or simply sitting in a park or garden.\n\nRemember, self-care is not a one-time achievement; it's an ongoing process. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you continue to make progress.\n\nKeep up the great work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further guidance or support!",
