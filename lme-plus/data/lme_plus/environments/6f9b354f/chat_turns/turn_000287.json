  "content": "The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 was not fought primarily to show Korea that Russia was on its side, but rather as a result of tensions and conflicts between Russia and Japan over their respective interests in East Asia.\n\nRussia had long been interested in expanding its influence in the region, including in Korea, and had been involved in conflicts over Korea with Japan and other powers. Japan, however, was also interested in expanding its power and influence in the region and saw Korea as a potential ally in its efforts to counterbalance Russia's power.\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Japan over their interests in Korea and other parts of East Asia eventually led to the Russo-Japanese War, which was fought from 1904 to 1905. The war was a significant event in the history of both Russia and Japan, as it marked the first time an Asian country had defeated a major European power in a modern war.\n\nWhile Russia may have hoped to gain the support of Korea in its conflict with Japan, the war was primarily driven by tensions and conflicts between Russia and Japan, rather than by efforts to forge alliances or partnerships with other countries in the region.",
