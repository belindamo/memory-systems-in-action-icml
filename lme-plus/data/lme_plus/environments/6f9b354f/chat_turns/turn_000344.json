  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have the most recent data about the current unemployment rate in Vilnius. However, I know that Lithuania has generally had a declining rate of unemployment over the last few years. According to Eurostat, in 2019 the unemployment rate in Lithuania was 6.2%, which is below the EU average. Vilnius, being the largest city and the capital of Lithuania, may have a slightly lower unemployment rate than the national average due to its dynamic and diversified economy. The government's efforts to promote economic growth and attract investment may also have contributed to lower unemployment rates in the city.",
