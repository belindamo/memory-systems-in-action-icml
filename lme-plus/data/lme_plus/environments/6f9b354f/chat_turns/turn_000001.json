Improving flexibility can help increase range of motion, reduce stiffness, and even alleviate pain. Here are some gentle exercises you can do at home to improve your flexibility:\n\n**Warm-up (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. Light cardio: March in place, jumping jacks, or walk in place to get your blood flowing and warm up your muscles.\n2. Dynamic stretching: Leg swings (front and back), arm circles, and torso twists to loosen up your joints.\n\n**Flexibility Exercises (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Neck Stretch**: Slowly tilt your head to the side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.\n2. **Shoulder Rolls**: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n3. **Chest Stretch**: Stand in a doorway with your hands on the doorframe at shoulder height. Lean forward, stretching your chest. Hold for 30 seconds.\n4. **Quad Stretch**: Stand with one hand against a wall for balance. Bend one knee, keeping your foot behind you.

Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n\n**Cool-down (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. Static stretching: Hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds, focusing on the major muscle groups you worked on during the exercise routine.\n2. Deep breathing exercises: Take slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain or discomfort.\n* Start slow and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your exercises as you become more comfortable.\n* Consult with your healthcare provider or a fitness professional if you have any underlying health conditions or concerns.\n\nCongratulations on taking the first step towards improving your flexibility and getting back on track with your fitness routine!",
