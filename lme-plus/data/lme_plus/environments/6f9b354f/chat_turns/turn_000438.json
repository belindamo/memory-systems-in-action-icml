It's great that you're taking proactive steps to support Max's oral health. The frequency of dental chews depends on several factors, including Max's age, breed, and individual needs. Here are some general guidelines to consider:\n\n**Factors to consider:**\n\n1. **Age**: Puppies and senior dogs may require more frequent dental care, as their teeth are still developing or may be more prone to issues.\n2. **Breed**: Some breeds, like small breeds or breeds prone to dental issues (e.g., Bulldogs, Poodles), may require more frequent dental care.\n3. **Dental health**: If Max has existing dental issues, such as tartar buildup, gingivitis, or tooth decay, he may require more frequent dental care.\n4. **Dental chew type**: Different dental chews have varying levels of effectiveness and durability. Some may need to be given more frequently than others.\n\n**General guidelines:**\n\n* For healthy adult dogs, a dental chew every 2-3 days is a good starting point.\n* For dogs with existing dental issues or high-risk breeds, a dental chew every 1-2 days may be necessary.\n* For puppies, a dental chew every 1-2 days can help support healthy tooth development.\n\n**Consult with your vet:**\n\nIt's essential to consult with your vet to determine the best frequency for Max's dental chews. They can assess his individual needs and provide personalized recommendations based on his age, breed, and dental health.\n\nIn your case, giving Max a dental chew every other day seems like a good starting point. However, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult with your vet to ensure you're providing the best possible care for Max's teeth.\n\nRemember, dental chews are just one part of a comprehensive oral care routine. Be sure to also brush Max's teeth regularly and provide plenty of opportunities for him to chew on appropriate toys and objects to help keep his teeth clean and healthy.",
