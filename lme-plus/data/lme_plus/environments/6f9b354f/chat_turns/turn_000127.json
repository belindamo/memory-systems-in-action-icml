Engaging in a constructive conversation and presenting them with scientific facts and figures can help them understand the impact of their actions. It's important to approach the conversation with respect and understanding, taking into consideration that hunting and fishing are often cultural or traditional practices, as well as popular recreational activities.\n\nIn addition, you can inform them about sustainable hunting and fishing practices, such as catch-and-release fishing, and regulations on bag limits.
