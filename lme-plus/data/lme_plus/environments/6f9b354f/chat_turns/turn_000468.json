I think I'll create an Instagram Story with a \"Question\" sticker to ask them which watercolor techniques they'd like to see covered in my series. Additionally, I'll mention my YouTube channel and let them know that my most popular video, a tutorial on watercolor painting, has already gotten 2,500 views, so they can expect high-quality content from me.",
