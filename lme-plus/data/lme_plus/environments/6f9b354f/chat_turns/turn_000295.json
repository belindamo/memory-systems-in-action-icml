  "content": "At the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904-1905, Russia was not officially allied with China, although it had previously supported Chinese efforts to maintain control over Korea and had leased the strategic port of Port Arthur from China.\n\nIn fact, during the war, China remained officially neutral, although it did provide some support to Russia in the form of money and supplies. However, China was also wary of Russian expansionism in the region and had its own interests and concerns regarding the conflict between Russia and Japan over their respective interests in Korea and other parts of East Asia.\n\nWhile Russia and China had a complicated relationship during this period, with both cooperation and competition, Russia was primarily focused on securing its own strategic and economic interests in the region, rather than on forging alliances or partnerships with other countries.",
