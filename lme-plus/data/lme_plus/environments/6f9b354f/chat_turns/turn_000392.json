I'm happy to help you create a plan to make Monday mornings more manageable.\n\nConsidering you're not a morning person on weekends, we'll focus on creating a gentle transition to Monday mornings. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you ease into Monday mornings:\n\n**Weekend prep (Saturday and Sunday):**\n\n1. **Gradually adjust your sleep schedule**: Try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier each night on Saturday and Sunday. This will help your body adjust to an earlier wake-up time without feeling too abrupt.\n2. **Establish a relaxing bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. This will signal to your body that it's time to wind down.\n\n**Sunday evening:**\n\n1. **Prepare everything for Monday**: Lay out your clothes, pack your lunch, and prep anything else you need for the next day. This will save you time and mental energy in the morning.\n2. **Set a gentle alarm**: Set your alarm for 15-30 minutes earlier than your desired wake-up time on Monday. This will give you a gentle nudge to start getting ready.\n\n**Monday morning:**\n\n1. **Ease into wakefulness**: When your alarm goes off, take a few minutes to stretch, yawn, or meditate. Don't jump out of bed right away.\n2. **Create a morning routine**: Develop a consistent morning routine that works for you, such as:\n\t* Drinking a glass of water or a cup of coffee/tea\n\t* Doing some light stretching or yoga\n\t* Reading the news, a book, or a motivational quote\n\t* Writing in a journal or planning out your day\n3. **Get some natural light**: Exposure to natural light helps regulate your circadian rhythms. Open your curtains or take a short walk outside in the morning.\n4. **Reward yourself**: Give yourself a small treat or reward for making it through the morning, like a favorite breakfast or a short break from work.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Avoid screens before bed**: Try to avoid screens (phones, tablets, or laptops) for at least an hour before bedtime to improve sleep quality.\n2. **Make mornings enjoyable**: Find something you look forward to doing on Monday mornings, like listening to music, podcasts, or a favorite radio show.\n3. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it may take some time for your body to adjust to the new routine. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't see immediate results.\n\nBy following this plan, you'll be able to gradually adjust to waking up on Monday mornings without feeling too abrupt. Good luck, and I hope you start enjoying your Monday mornings!",
