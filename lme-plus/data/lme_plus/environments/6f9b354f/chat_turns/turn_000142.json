I've always wanted to explore the West Coast, and this could be the perfect opportunity. Since I've had such a great experience staying in a hostel in Brooklyn during my solo trip to New York City last December, I'm thinking of doing the same in San Francisco. Do you know of any good hostels in the city that you would recommend?",
