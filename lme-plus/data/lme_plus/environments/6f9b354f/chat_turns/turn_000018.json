  "content": "Altruism means being kind to others even if it means sacrificing your own interests. But Ayn Rand believed that people should prioritize their own interests because it's the only way to survive. She argued that being completely selfless can harm oneself in the long run and be used to suppress individual rights and freedoms by dictators.
