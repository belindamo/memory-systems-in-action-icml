Starting with a consistent time and adjusting as needed is a wonderful way to find what works best for you.\n\nDoing the gratitude practice right after waking up can be a powerful way to set a positive tone for the day. By focusing on what you're grateful for, you can:\n\n* Boost your mood and energy levels\n* Increase your sense of calm and clarity\n* Set a positive intention for the day ahead\n\nRemember, it's just 2-3 minutes of your day, and it can make a significant difference in how you feel.\n\nIf you find that you're not fully awake or alert, you can adjust the timing later on. You might try doing the gratitude practice after a short morning routine, like stretching or drinking a cup of coffee. Experiment and find what works best for you.\n\nTo make it even easier, you can prepare a gratitude journal or a note-taking app on your phone the night before. This way, you can quickly jot down your thoughts and reflections as soon as you wake up.\n\nHere's a simple template to get you started:\n\n**Gratitude Practice Template:**\n\n1. Write down three things you're grateful for today:\n\t* _______________________________________________________\n\t* _______________________________________________________\n\t* _______________________________________________________\n2. Reflect on why these things are important to you:\n\t* _______________________________________________________\n\t* _______________________________________________________\n\t* _______________________________________________________\n\nTake your time, and don't worry too much about grammar or spelling. Just focus on the feelings and thoughts that arise as you reflect on what you're grateful for.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you enjoy your gratitude practice!",
