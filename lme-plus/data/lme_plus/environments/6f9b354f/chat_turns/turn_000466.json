Do you think I could also use my Instagram audience to help me come up with ideas for the series? I've been getting a lot of engagement on my recent posts, especially the one featuring a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset, which got 127 likes and 12 comments. Maybe I could ask them for suggestions or feedback on the techniques I should cover.",
