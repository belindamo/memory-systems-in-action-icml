  "content": "I'm thinking of using a floating desk in the middle of the room, and adding some built-in shelving for storage. I've been browsing online for inspiration and ideas, and I'm considering a minimalist aesthetic with a lot of natural wood accents. I also want to incorporate some greenery, maybe a small herb garden or a vase with fresh flowers. Do you have any suggestions on how to choose the right lighting for the space?",
