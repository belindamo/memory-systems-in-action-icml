  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have the current knowledge to determine if there have been any collaborations between SWIFT and technology companies recently. However, it is worth mentioning that SWIFT has partnered with various technology companies in the past to provide new solutions and enhance its messaging network. \n\nFor example, in 2019, SWIFT partnered with R3, a blockchain technology provider, to integrate SWIFT gpi with Corda, R3's blockchain platform. This integration allows Corda users to initiate and track SWIFT gpi payments directly from their platform. \n\nIn another collaboration, SWIFT partnered with Microsoft Azure to launch SWIFT's Customer Security Programme (CSP) in the cloud. This collaboration ensures that SWIFT's CSP is available on a highly secure and reliable cloud platform.\n\nOverall, these collaborations demonstrate how SWIFT is leveraging technology companies to enhance its services and expand its capabilities.",
