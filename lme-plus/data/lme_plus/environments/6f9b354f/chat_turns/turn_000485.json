The bokeh effect is indeed a wonderful thing, and prime lenses are often great for capturing that creamy, blurred background.\n\nNow, let's get back to finding a replacement lens cap for your EF-S 18-55mm kit lens. Since you mentioned a 58mm diameter and a preference for a plastic snap-on cap, I've got some options for you:\n\n1. **Canon EW-58II Lens Cap**: This is the official Canon lens cap designed specifically for the EF-S 18-55mm lens. It's a plastic snap-on cap that fits snugly onto the 58mm thread. You can find it on Amazon or other online retailers for around $5-$10.\n2. **Generic 58mm Snap-On Lens Cap**: There are many third-party options available that are compatible with the Canon EF-S 18-55mm lens. These caps are often cheaper than the official Canon cap and still provide good quality. You can find them on Amazon or eBay for around $2-$5.\n3. **JJC 58mm Snap-On Lens Cap**: JJC is a well-known brand in the photography accessories market, and their lens caps are popular among photographers. Their 58mm snap-on cap is a great option that fits perfectly onto your kit lens.
