Regular brushing is essential for removing loose hair, reducing shedding, and distributing natural oils throughout the coat. The $30 brush was a great investment.\n\nNow, let's dive into nutrition and supplements to support Max's coat health:\n\n**Food:**\n\n1. **Omega-3 fatty acids**: These are essential for a healthy coat, skin, and overall well-being. Look for dog food that contains omega-3 rich ingredients like salmon, flaxseed oil, or fish oil.\n2. **Protein-rich diet**: A diet rich in protein from animal sources like chicken, beef, or lamb will help support healthy skin and coat growth.\n3. **Whole foods**: Feed a balanced, nutrient-rich dog food that includes whole ingredients like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n\n**Supplements:**\n\n1. **Fish oil supplements**: In addition to a balanced diet, adding a fish oil supplement can provide an extra boost of omega-3 fatty acids. Consult with your vet to determine the correct dosage.\n2. **Coat-specific supplements**: There are various supplements on the market that target coat health, such as biotin, vitamin E, or zinc-based supplements. However, always consult with your vet before adding any new supplements to Max's diet.\n3. **Probiotics**: A healthy gut microbiome is essential for overall health, including skin and coat health. Consider adding a probiotic supplement to Max's diet.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Hydration**: Ensure Max always has access to fresh, clean water to help keep his skin and coat healthy.\n2. **Regular grooming**: Continue regular brushing and grooming to remove dirt, debris, and distribute natural oils.\n3. **Skin and coat checks**: Regularly inspect Max's skin and coat for any signs of irritation, dryness, or skin issues.\n4. **Consult your vet**: If you notice any changes in Max's coat or skin, consult with your vet to rule out underlying health issues.\n\nRemember, every dog is different, so it may take some trial and error to find the right combination of food and supplements that work best for Max.
