  "content": "Modern scientists still use Linnaeus's system of classification, but they have made some adjustments and added more categories to reflect our evolving understanding of the relationships between organisms. Here are the seven basic categories used in modern classification:\n\n1. Kingdom: The highest level of classification, organisms are placed into one of six kingdoms based on their characteristics and cellular structure.\n\n2. Phylum: Organisms are divided into smaller groups called phyla based on their structural and developmental characteristics.\n\n3. Class: Organisms are divided into classes based on shared characteristics.\n\n4. Order: Organisms are placed into orders based on their shared characteristics.\n\n5. Family: Organisms are placed into families based on their similarities in anatomy and physiology.\n\n6. Genus: Organisms are placed into genera (plural of genus) based on their genetic makeup and evolutionary history.\n\n7. Species: The most specific level of classification, organisms are placed into species based on their unique physical and genetic characteristics. \n\nModern scientists also incorporate phylogenetics and molecular genetics in their classification system to determine evolutionary relationships between organisms. Overall, the system of classification used by modern scientists is a dynamic and constantly evolving process that seeks to capture the diversity and complexity of life on Earth.",
