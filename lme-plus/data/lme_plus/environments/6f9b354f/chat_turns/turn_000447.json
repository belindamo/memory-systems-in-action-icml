This usually includes personal identification documents for both the German and Egyptian individuals involved, as well as any specific documents related to the matter for which the Power of Attorney is being issued.\n2. Visit the embassy's website: Go to the official website of the Egyptian Embassy in Berlin (as of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, it was <https://www.egyptian-embassy.de/> - please verify the current website).
