To achieve this, we recommend the following strategy plan:\n\n1. Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\nTo measure the effectiveness of our in-store launch campaign, we will first define the key performance indicators (KPIs) that we will track.

Set a Baseline:\nTo measure the impact of the in-store launch campaign, we will need to establish a baseline measurement of sales, foot traffic, and engagement prior to the campaign. This will enable us to determine if the campaign had a positive impact on these metrics.\n2. Implement the In-Store Launch Campaign:\nOnce the baseline measurement is established, we will implement the in-store launch campaign.
