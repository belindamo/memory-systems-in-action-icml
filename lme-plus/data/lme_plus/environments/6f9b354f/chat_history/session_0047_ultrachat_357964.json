This has made it difficult for other industries, such as manufacturing and retail, to attract and retain workers.\n\n2.

This has made it challenging for businesses in other sectors to find and retain skilled employees.\n\n3.

This has inspired other industries in the area to adopt similar practices and try to foster a culture of innovation and experimentation in their own organizations.\n\n4.
