  "content": "There are several types of microchips available, and while they all serve the same purpose, they do have some differences. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Types of Microchips:**\n\n1. **ISO-compliant microchips**: These microchips conform to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, which ensures they operate at a frequency of 134.2 kHz. This is the most widely used frequency worldwide and is compatible with most scanners used by shelters and veterinarians.\n\t* Examples: HomeAgain, AVID, and Trovan microchips.\n2. **Non-ISO microchips**: These microchips operate at different frequencies, such as 125 kHz, 128 kHz, or 134.1 kHz. While they're still effective, they might not be compatible with all scanners.\n\t* Examples: Microchip IDs, 24PetWatch, and PetLink microchips.\n3. **Universal microchips**: These microchips can be read by scanners that operate at multiple frequencies, making them more versatile.\n\t* Examples: Datamars and PetChip microchips.\n4. **NFC (Near Field Communication) microchips**: These microchips use a different technology, allowing them to be read by smartphones and other NFC-enabled devices. They're not as widely used as traditional microchips, but they're gaining popularity.\n\t* Examples: PetPoint and Destron Fearing microchips.\n\n**Scanner Compatibility:**\n\nMost animal shelters and veterinarians use universal scanners that can read ISO-compliant microchips. However, it's essential to note that not all scanners can read non-ISO microchips. If a shelter or vet uses a scanner that only reads ISO-compliant microchips, they might not be able to detect a non-ISO microchip.\n\nTo ensure compatibility, it's recommended to:\n\n* Check with your veterinarian or local shelters to see what type of scanners they use.\n* Choose an ISO-compliant microchip, as they're the most widely recognized and compatible.\n* Register your pet's microchip with the manufacturer and keep your contact information up to date.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* Some microchip manufacturers offer additional features, such as GPS tracking or health monitoring, which may require a subscription or additional equipment.\n* Microchip registration and maintenance fees may vary between manufacturers.\n* It's crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions for microchip implantation, registration, and maintenance to ensure the microchip remains effective.\n\nWhen selecting a microchip for Luna, consider the type of microchip, scanner compatibility, and the manufacturer's reputation. It's always a good idea to consult with your veterinarian for guidance on the best microchip option for your pet.",
