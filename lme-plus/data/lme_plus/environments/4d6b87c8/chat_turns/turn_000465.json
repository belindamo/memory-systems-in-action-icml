This will make it easier to keep track of your titles and prioritize what you want to watch next.\n\nHere are some suggestions for categories:\n\n* Historical Dramas\n* Social Justice and Human Rights\n* Royal Dramas\n* Period Pieces\n* Biographical Dramas\n* Documentaries\n* Other (for anything that doesn't fit into the above categories)\n\nWe can also create subcategories within each category to further organize your list. For example, under Historical Dramas, we could have subcategories for:\n\n* World War II\n* Ancient Civilizations\n* American History\n* European History\n\nLet me know if any of these categories resonate with you, or if you have other ideas for how you'd like to organize your list. We can work together to create a system that works best for you!\n\nOnce we've categorized your list, we can also prioritize your titles based on your interests and preferences. Do you want to watch the most highly-rated titles first, or do you want to focus on a specific genre or theme?\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed, and we can get started on organizing your to-watch list!",
