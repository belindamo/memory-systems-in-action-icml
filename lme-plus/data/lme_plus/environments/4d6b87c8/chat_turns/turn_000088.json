  "content": "There are a few quotes that have been attributed to people involved in the Mad Gasser case, although it's worth noting that many of these are unverified and may not be entirely accurate. Here are a few examples:\n\n* \"It was the weirdest thing I ever heard of. It seemed like something out of a storybook.\" - Willamina \"Blackie\" Haisley, a resident of Mattoon who reported experiencing symptoms attributed to the Mad Gasser in 1944.\n* \"It was definitely gas, but not natural gas. It was something much stronger.\" - Harold A. Mangold, a gas company inspector who investigated the Mad Gasser incidents.\n* \"The Mad Gasser was probably the greatest individual menace to the health and life of the community in its history.\" - W.H. Harrison, editor of the Mattoon Daily Journal Gazette.\n\nAgain, it's worth noting that the accuracy of these quotes cannot be guaranteed, and they should be taken with a grain of salt. However, they do provide some insight into the experiences and perceptions of those involved in the Mad Gasser case at the time.",
