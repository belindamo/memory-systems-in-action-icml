  "content": "Luna took to the new litter box right away, no issues at all! She's always been a bit of a princess, so I think she appreciates the extra cleanliness and convenience. As for me, it's been amazing - I no longer have to scoop out the litter box daily, and the smell is almost non-existent. It's definitely been a huge time-saver, and I can focus on other things... like brushing her more frequently, haha!",
