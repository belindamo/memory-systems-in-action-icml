  "content": "The ease of implementing these measures may depend on factors such as the political system of the country, the level of technological infrastructure available, the willingness of politicians to enforce regulations, and the level of civic engagement of the population. Some of these measures may require significant investments of time, resources and effort to be put into practice. \n\nFor example, implementing a transparent electoral system that uses modern technologies such as electronic voting would require significant financial investments, while ensuring that citizens have equal opportunities to participate may require addressing social and economic inequalities that have existed for years. \n\nIn addition, there may be political and social resistance to implementing these measures if they are perceived as threatening the status quo or if they are viewed as being overly intrusive. \n\nUltimately, it is up to the government to take the necessary steps to implement these measures and improve the electoral process. However, it is important to recognize that achieving this may require a long-term commitment, cooperation from various stakeholders, and a willingness to address challenges as they arise.",
