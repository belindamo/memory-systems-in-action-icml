  "content": "Yes, many people in Northern Ireland still feel the effects of the Troubles today. The conflict lasted for over three decades and claimed the lives of more than 3,500 people, leaving many others injured or traumatized. The legacy of the conflict can be seen in ongoing sectarian divisions, political tensions, and economic disparities in Northern Ireland.\n\nMany families continue to mourn the loss of loved ones, while others struggle with physical and psychological injuries. There are also ongoing debates about how to acknowledge and address the past, including how to deal with the legacy of the conflict, such as addressing issues around justice, truth, and reconciliation.\n\nThe border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which was a significant issue during the conflict, became even more contentious with the recent Brexit negotiations. The debate over whether the border should remain open or not has reignited fears of a return to violence and tensions among the communities in Northern Ireland.\n\nOverall, while the Good Friday Agreement brought an end to the violence, the ongoing effects of the conflict mean that there is still work to be done to address the unresolved issues and to build a peaceful and inclusive society in Northern Ireland.",
