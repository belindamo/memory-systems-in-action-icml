  "content": "Climate change is a critical topic, and it's great that you're interested in learning more about it.\n\nFirstly, I'm happy to help you find reading materials on climate change. However, I need to clarify that The New Yorker is a weekly magazine, and it doesn't have a March 15th issue. The New Yorker publishes 47 issues a year, and each issue is dated with the week's cover date, not a specific day. If you remember the title of the article or the author, I'd be happy to help you find it.\n\nThat being said, here are some highly recommended reading materials on climate change:\n\n**Books:**\n\n1. **\"The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming\" by David Wallace-Wells**: A compelling and well-researched book that explores the potential consequences of climate change.\n2. **\"This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate\" by Naomi Klein**: A thought-provoking book that examines the relationship between capitalism and climate change.\n3. **\"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" by Elizabeth Kolbert**: A Pulitzer Prize-winning book that explores the impact of human activity on the natural world and the potential for a sixth mass extinction.\n4. **\"Coral Reefs and Climate Change\" by Stephen Palumbi**: A concise and accessible book that focuses on the impact of climate change on coral reefs.\n\n**Articles and Online Resources:**\n\n1. **The New Yorker's Climate Issue** (September 2019): A special issue dedicated to climate change, featuring in-depth articles and essays from various authors.\n2. **The New York Times' Climate Section**: A dedicated section on The New York Times' website, featuring news, articles, and analysis on climate change.\n3. **National Geographic's Climate Change Coverage**: National Geographic provides in-depth articles, videos, and photos on climate change and its impact on the environment.\n4. **IPCC Reports** (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change): The IPCC publishes comprehensive reports on climate change, including the causes, impacts, and potential solutions.\n\n**Documentaries and Videos:**\n\n1. **\"Before the Flood\" (2016)**: A National Geographic documentary featuring Leonardo DiCaprio as he explores the impacts of climate change around the world.\n2. **\"Chasing Coral\" (2017)**: A Netflix original documentary that highlights the decline of coral reefs and the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems.\n3. **\"Climate Change: The Facts\" (2019)**: A BBC documentary presented by Sir David Attenborough, exploring the science and consequences of climate change.\n\nI hope you find these resources helpful in your exploration of climate change.
