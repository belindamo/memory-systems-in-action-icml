Season 4 was the latest installment, and it was released on November 15, 2020. You can already stream all episodes of Season 4 on Netflix.\n\nIf you've only watched the first episode, you've got a lot of great content to look forward to! The fourth season covers the late 1970s and early 1980s, with a focus on the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, as well as Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister.\n\nIn case you're wondering, the next season of The Crown is already in production, but it won't be released until 2022. Season 5 will cover the 1990s, with Imelda Staunton taking over the role of Queen Elizabeth II from Olivia Colman.\n\nFeel free to binge-watch the rest of Season 4 at your own pace, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the season!",
