Specifically, his relationships with his father Baba and his friend Hassan undergo significant changes as a result of his growth.\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Amir is constantly seeking his father's approval and love but feels like he can never live up to his expectations. Baba sees Amir as weak and cowardly, which makes Amir feel insecure and worthless. However, as Amir grows and matures, he realizes that his father's expectations were misguided and that he had been wrong to see himself in such a negative light. He becomes more confident and assertive, and this newfound self-assurance allows him to confront his father and their misunderstandings more openly. Ultimately, their relationship becomes more honest, open, and loving.\n\nSimilarly, Amir's relationship with Hassan changes over the course of the novel.
