I'm glad I could help.\n\nYes, balance is key in any show, and it's great that you appreciate complex, atmospheric storytelling with a good balance of character development and plot progression. \"The Haunting of Hill House\" is an excellent choice for that, and I think you'll find it's well-crafted to deliver on both fronts.\n\nWhen you do get to \"The OA\", keep in mind that it's a show that rewards patience and attention. It's a slow burn, but the payoff is worth it. The show's creator, Brit Marling, has said that she aimed to create a show that would make viewers feel like they're \"dreaming\" while watching, and that sense of unease and uncertainty is a big part of the show's appeal.\n\nFeel free to come back and chat with me about \"The Haunting of Hill House\" or \"The OA\" whenever you'd like. I'm always here to discuss TV shows and offer recommendations!\n\nEnjoy your watch, and I hope you find \"The Haunting of Hill House\" to be a hauntingly good experience!",
