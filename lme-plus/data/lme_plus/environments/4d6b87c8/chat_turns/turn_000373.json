Rabbits need plenty of stimulation and exercise to stay happy and healthy, and toys play a crucial role in their enrichment. Here are some safe and durable toy recommendations for Benny:\n\n**Chewing Toys:**\n\n1. **Untreated Wood Toys**: Rabbits love to chew, and untreated wood toys are perfect for satisfying this instinct. Look for wooden toys made from safe woods like apple, willow, or birch.\n2. **Hay Balls**: Hay balls are a great way to provide Benny with a fun and healthy snack while keeping him occupied.\n3. **Cardboard Rolls**: Toilet paper or paper towel rolls are perfect for rabbits to chew on and destroy (in a good way!).\n\n**Interactive Toys:**\n\n1. **Tunnels and Tents**: Rabbits love to hide, play, and explore, making tunnels and tents an excellent choice.\n2. **Food Puzzle Toys**: Challenge Benny's problem-solving skills with food puzzle toys that dispense treats as he plays.\n3. **Bell Toys**: Rabbits love to play with noisy toys, and bell toys are a great way to encourage exercise and entertainment.\n\n**Safe Materials:**\n\n1. **Recycled Paper Products**: Paper-based toys, like paper bags or cardboard boxes, are safe and eco-friendly.\n2. **Natural Fibers**: Toys made from natural fibers like cotton, hemp, or sisal are great for rabbits to chew on.\n3. **Non-Toxic Plastics**: Look for toys made from non-toxic, BPA-free plastics that won't harm Benny if ingested.\n\n**Avoid:**\n\n1. **Toys with Small Parts**: Avoid toys with small parts that can be easily detached and ingested, like eyes, noses, or small beads.\n2. **Toys with Strings or Yarn**: Rabbits can easily get tangled or ingest strings or yarn, so it's best to avoid toys with these materials.\n3. **Toys with Toxic Materials**: Never give Benny toys made from toxic materials like lead, zinc, or PVC.\n\nSome great brands for rabbit toys include:\n\n* Kaytee\n* Oxbow\n* Pet Zone\n* Small Pet Select\n* Ware Manufacturing\n\nRemember to rotate Benny's toys regularly to keep him engaged and interested.
