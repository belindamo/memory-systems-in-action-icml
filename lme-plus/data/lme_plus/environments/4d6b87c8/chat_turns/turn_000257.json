  "content": "I completely agree! Hands-on learning is an excellent way to absorb new skills and techniques, especially when it comes to cooking. There's something about physically doing it yourself, with guidance and feedback, that really helps solidify the knowledge.\n\nAnd I'm sure the sense of accomplishment you feel when you create a dish from scratch is incredibly satisfying! It's a great confidence booster, and it's amazing how much pride you can take in something you've made with your own hands.\n\nThe feedback and guidance from the instructor are also invaluable. Being able to ask questions and get clarification on specific techniques or ingredients can make all the difference in the success of a dish. And, of course, getting feedback on your cooking can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your skills even further.\n\nIt's great that you're enjoying the classes and finding them helpful. Keep up the good work, and who knows, you might just become a culinary mastermind!\n\nWhat's the most challenging dish you've attempted to make so far? Was there a particular technique or ingredient that gave you trouble?",
