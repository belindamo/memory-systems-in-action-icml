This ensures the wine meets quality standards and is a good representation of the region.\n* **Sangiovese content:** Chianti is typically made from a minimum of 70% Sangiovese grapes. Look for wines with a higher percentage of Sangiovese for a more traditional flavor profile.\n* **Aging:** Chianti can be aged for various periods, but 12-18 months is a good range for a balanced flavor profile.\n* **Acidity and tannins:** A good Chianti should have balanced acidity and tannins. This will help the wine pair well with the rich flavors of the Lasagna Bolognese.\n\nRemember, personal taste plays a significant role in wine preferences, so don't be afraid to try different options and find the one that suits your taste buds the best.",
