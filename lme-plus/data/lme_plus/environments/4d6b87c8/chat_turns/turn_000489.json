  "content": "Yes, it is encouraging to see that the younger generation is playing a more positive role in building a society that is more inclusive and respectful of different cultures and traditions. Their relative lack of direct experience of the Troubles means that they are better placed to overcome the deep-seated divisions that still exist in Northern Ireland.\n\nHowever, there is still much work to do to create a truly integrated society and to address the challenges that Northern Ireland faces. It is important that young people are given the tools and skills they need to engage productively in the process of building peaceful and inclusive communities. This means providing education and training in conflict resolution, community development, and intercultural communication.\n\nImportantly, it is also vital that young people are given a voice and a meaningful role in shaping the future of their communities. By empowering young people to become leaders and change-makers, it is possible to create a stronger, more connected, and more positive Northern Ireland that is better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future, while building upon the progress already made.",
