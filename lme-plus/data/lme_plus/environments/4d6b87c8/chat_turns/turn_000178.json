  "content": "Yes, the apostrophe used to abbreviate the year as '82 is technically considered a \"smart quote\". Smart quotes are also known as \"curly quotes\" or \"typographer's quotes\", and they are designed to improve the appearance of text by providing curved quotation marks and apostrophes that resemble the shape of handwriting.\n\nIn contrast, \"straight quotes\" are the basic, vertical quotation marks and apostrophes found on most keyboards, which are often used in programming, plain text documents, or in situations where typography is not a significant concern.\n\nMost modern word processing software, including Microsoft Word and Google Docs, will automatically convert straight quotes to smart quotes by default, so the apostrophe used to abbreviate the year as '82 will likely be automatically converted to a smart quote when typing in these programs.",
