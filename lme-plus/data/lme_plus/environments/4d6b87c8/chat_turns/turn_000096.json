  "content": "During the Mad Gasser case in Mattoon, there were different theories about how the gas was distributed. Some people speculated that the gasser used a spray gun or a device to shoot the gas into the homes of the victims. Others believed that the gas was released through a vent or a hole in the walls of the victims' homes. Some witnesses reported seeing a \"flute-like\" object being used by the gasser to blow the gas into the homes.\n\nThe police and investigators who worked on the case did not come to a definite conclusion about how the gas was distributed. Some believed that the gasser was using a gas that was heavier than air, such as carbon disulfide, which could have pooled in low-lying areas of the victims' homes. Others thought that the gas may have been a form of tear gas, which can cause coughing and choking.\n\nDespite the various theories and investigations, the Mad Gasser of Mattoon was never caught, and the true identity of the perpetrator remains a mystery to this day.",
