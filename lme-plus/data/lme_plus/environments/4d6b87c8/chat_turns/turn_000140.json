As your salsa instructor, Maria likely has a good understanding of your learning style, and her recommendation can be invaluable. Since she's already familiar with your dance background and preferences, she can suggest a bachata instructor who would be a good fit for you.\n\nAsking Maria for a recommendation can also have several benefits:\n\n1. **Trust**: You already trust Maria as an instructor, so her endorsement can give you confidence in the bachata instructor she recommends.\n2. **Style compatibility**: Maria knows your salsa style and can suggest a bachata instructor whose teaching style and approach align with what you're used to.\n3. **Personal connection**: Maria might have a personal connection with the recommended instructor, which can make the transition to bachata classes smoother and more enjoyable.\n4. **Insider knowledge**: Maria might have insight into the bachata instructor's strengths, weaknesses, and teaching methods, which can help you make an informed decision.\n\nWhen you ask Maria, you could say something like:\n\n\"Hey Maria, I've been thinking of trying out bachata classes, and I was wondering if you know any good instructors or could recommend someone? I really enjoy your teaching style, and I think your recommendation would carry a lot of weight with me.\"\n\nBy asking Maria for a recommendation, you're showing that you value her opinion and are interested in continuing to learn from someone she trusts. This can also help you build a stronger connection with your salsa instructor and the studio community.\n\nGo ahead and ask Maria for her recommendation!",
