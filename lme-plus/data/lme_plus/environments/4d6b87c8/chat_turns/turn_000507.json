  "content": "When arranging by artist/style-based, it's common to have books that don't fit neatly into a specific category. Here are some suggestions for handling those books:\n\n1. **Miscellaneous/General Art**: Create a section for books that don't fit into a specific artist or style category. This can include books on art theory, art history, technique, or general art appreciation.\n2. **Art Appreciation/History**: Group books that focus on the broader context of art, such as art movements, genres, or historical periods (e.g., Renaissance, Impressionism, Abstract Expressionism).\n3. **Technique/Instructional**: Place books that focus on artistic techniques, mediums, or instructional guides (e.g., drawing, painting, sculpture, photography) together.\n4. **Exhibition Catalogs**: Group exhibition catalogs, which often feature a variety of artists and styles, in a separate section.\n5. **Monographs**: If you have books that are monographs (in-depth studies of a single artist), but the artist doesn't fit into a specific style category, consider grouping them together in a separate section.\n6. **Curate a \"Wildcard\" Section**: Create a section for books that are outliers, but still interesting and valuable to your collection. This can include books on art and culture, art criticism, or even art-inspired fiction.\n7. **Integrate Them**: If you have a few books that don't fit into a specific category, you can integrate them into the artist/style-based sections. For example, if you have a book on the art of a particular region (e.g., Japanese art), you could place it near books on Japanese artists or styles.\n8. **Create a \"To-Explore\" Section**: Set aside a section for books that you haven't had a chance to explore yet, but are interested in reading. This can be a great way to keep track of books you want to dive into soon.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and makes sense for your collection. You can always adjust and refine your arrangement as your collection grows and evolves.",
