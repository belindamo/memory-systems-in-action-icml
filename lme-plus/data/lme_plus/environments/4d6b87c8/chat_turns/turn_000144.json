In fact, many dance studios and instructors specialize in specific styles or genres, and they may offer a range of classes, workshops, and private lessons to cater to different levels, interests, and goals.\n\nPrivate lessons are often beneficial for:\n\n1. **Personalized attention**: You receive one-on-one instruction, allowing the instructor to focus on your specific needs, goals, and learning style.\n2. **Customized learning**: Private lessons can be tailored to your schedule, goals, and progress, ensuring you're working on the skills and techniques that matter most to you.\n3. **Faster progress**: With personalized attention, you can progress faster and more efficiently, as the instructor can correct any mistakes and provide targeted feedback.\n\nGroup classes, on the other hand, offer:\n\n1. **Social benefits**: You'll meet new people, make friends, and be part of a community that shares your passion for dance.\n2. **Energy and motivation**: Group classes can be more dynamic and energizing, as you feed off the energy of others and stay motivated by seeing others learning and improving.\n3. **Cost-effective**: Group classes are often more affordable than private lessons, making them a great option for those on a budget.\n\nMany dance instructors offer a combination of private lessons and group classes to cater to different learning styles and preferences. Some may also offer semi-private lessons, which are small group classes with a limited number of students, providing a balance between personalized attention and social benefits.\n\nIn your case, since you've been taking salsa classes with Maria, you might consider asking her about private lessons or semi-private classes specifically focused on bachata. This could help you accelerate your learning, work on specific techniques, or prepare for performances or events.\n\nRemember, it's essential to find an instructor who is a good fit for you, and who can provide the right balance of guidance, support, and motivation to help you achieve your dance goals.",
