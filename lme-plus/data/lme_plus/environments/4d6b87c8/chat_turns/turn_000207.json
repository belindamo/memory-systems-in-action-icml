  "content": "The Enigma I, also known as the Wehrmacht Enigma, used three or four rotors depending on the specific model and time period. The earliest models of the Enigma I used three rotors, while later models used four rotors.\n\nThe use of multiple rotors was a key feature of the Enigma I and other Enigma machines, as it increased the number of possible encryption settings and made the cipher more difficult to break. The rotors were interchangeable and could be set to different starting positions, adding even more complexity to the encryption process. The Enigma I also used a plugboard and a lamp board to further obscure the ciphertext and make it difficult to decipher without knowledge of the key settings.",
