  "content": "Here are five other examples of mass hysteria:\n\n1. Salem witch trials: In 1692, a series of trials were held in Salem, Massachusetts, in which more than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft. The trials resulted in the execution of 20 people and the imprisonment of many others. The hysteria surrounding the witch trials has been attributed to a combination of social, economic, and religious factors.\n2. Dancing mania: In the 14th and 15th centuries, outbreaks of dancing mania occurred throughout Europe. During these episodes, large groups of people would spontaneously begin dancing and could not stop for days or even weeks. The cause of the dancing mania is still not entirely understood, but it has been linked to mass hysteria, religious fervor, and other cultural factors.\n3. Satanic ritual abuse panic: In the 1980s and 1990s, a wave of hysteria swept through the United States and other countries in which people were accused of engaging in satanic rituals and abusing children. The allegations were often based on dubious or completely fabricated evidence, but they led to many wrongful convictions and destroyed the lives of many innocent people.\n4. The Tanganyika laughter epidemic: In 1962, an outbreak of contagious laughter occurred in a boarding school in Tanzania, spreading to hundreds of people in the surrounding area. The episode lasted for several months and disrupted daily life in the affected communities. The cause of the laughter epidemic is still not entirely clear, but it has been linked to mass hysteria and stress.\n5. The Pok\u00e9mon panic: In 1997, reports began to circulate in Japan that the popular children's game Pok\u00e9mon was causing seizures and other health problems in children. The reports were later debunked, but they led to a wave of panic and hysteria surrounding the game, with some schools and parents banning it outright.",
