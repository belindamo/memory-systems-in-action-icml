  "content": "Strava is an excellent resource for planning and discovering new running routes. Here are some ways Strava can help:\n\n1. **Route Building**: Strava's Route Builder tool allows you to create custom routes using a interactive map. You can draw a route, add waypoints, and adjust the distance and elevation to suit your needs.\n2. **Route Discovery**: Strava's Route Discovery feature suggests popular routes in your area, based on the activities of other Strava users. You can filter routes by distance, elevation gain, and surface type (e.g., road, trail, or track).\n3. **Segment Explorer**: The Segment Explorer feature allows you to search for popular segments in your area. Segments are specific sections of a route that Strava users have created and marked as challenging or notable. You can filter segments by distance, elevation gain, and other criteria.\n4. **Heatmaps**: Strava's Heatmaps display the most popular routes and trails in your area, based on the activities of other Strava users. Heatmaps can help you discover new routes and avoid busy or congested areas.\n5. **Club Routes**: If you're part of a Strava Club, you can access a library of routes created by other club members. This is a great way to discover new routes and connect with other runners in your community.\n6. ** Route Import**: Strava allows you to import routes from other platforms, such as GPX files or routes created on other websites. This makes it easy to bring your existing routes into Strava and track your progress.\n\nTo get started with route planning on Strava, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to your Strava account on the website or mobile app.\n2. Click on the \"Routes\" tab and select \"Create a Route\" or \"Explore Routes.\"\n3. Use the interactive map to draw a route, add waypoints, and adjust the distance and elevation as needed.\n4. Save your route and give it a name and description.\n5. Search for segments and routes in your area using the Segment Explorer and Route Discovery features.\n\nBy leveraging these features, you'll be able to discover new routes, plan your runs, and explore new areas with confidence. Happy route planning!",
