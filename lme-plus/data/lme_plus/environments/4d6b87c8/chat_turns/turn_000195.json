  "content": "Yes, it would make sense for a researcher working on modern ciphers to also study the principles and techniques used in older ciphers and cryptographic systems. While modern ciphers have evolved significantly from the older systems, many of the underlying principles and techniques used in those older systems are still relevant and applicable to modern cryptographic research.\n\nStudying older ciphers can provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different encryption techniques and help researchers to identify new approaches and strategies for improving the security and efficiency of modern cryptographic systems.\n\nIn addition, studying older ciphers and cryptographic systems can provide a historical context for understanding the evolution of cryptography and its role in various historical contexts, such as military conflicts or political upheavals.\n\nOverall, while modern cryptographic research is focused primarily on developing new and innovative approaches to encryption, it is also important to have a solid understanding of the principles and techniques used in older systems in order to build upon that knowledge and continue to advance the field of cryptography.",
