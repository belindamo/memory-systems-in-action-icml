To ensure they stay fresh and safe throughout the night market, follow these tips:\n\n**Fresh Flower Care:**\n\n1. **Choose hardy flowers**: Opt for flowers that are known to have a longer vase life, such as roses, carnations, or baby's breath. Avoid delicate flowers like orchids or poppies.\n2. **Prepare flowers beforehand**: Trim the stems at an angle, and remove any leaves that will be below the waterline. This helps prevent bacterial growth and promotes water uptake.\n3. **Use a floral preservative**: Many flower shops provide a packet of floral preservative with their bouquets. You can also make your own by mixing 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, and 1 quart of water.\n4. **Keep flowers hydrated**: Make sure the water level in the vase is below the base of the stems. Check the water level frequently, and refill as needed.\n5. **Monitor temperature**: Avoid placing flowers near direct sunlight, heaters, or air conditioning vents, which can cause them to wilt or dry out.\n\n**Display and Protection:**\n\n1. **Use a sturdy vase**: Choose a vase that won't tip over easily and has a wide enough mouth to accommodate the stems.\n2. **Add some greenery**: Incorporate some foliage like eucalyptus or ferns to add depth and texture to your arrangement. These can also help hide any wilting flowers.\n3. **Secure the arrangement**: Use floral wire or tape to keep the stems in place, preventing them from getting jostled or damaged.\n4. **Cover the arrangement**: Consider using a clear acrylic or glass cloche to protect the flowers from dust, wind, and curious fingers.\n5. **Keep the area clean**: Regularly tidy up your display to prevent debris and dust from accumulating around the flowers.\n\n**Logistical Tips:**\n\n1. **Prepare a backup**: Have a spare bouquet or a few extra flowers on hand in case some wilt or get damaged during the event.\n2. **Bring a water bottle**: Have a water bottle nearby to refill the vase as needed.\n3. **Assign a flower wrangler**: Designate someone to keep an eye on the flowers and make any necessary adjustments throughout the event.\n\n**Additional Ideas:**\n\n* Consider using silk or artificial flowers as a backup or to supplement your fresh arrangement. They can be just as beautiful and require minimal maintenance.\n* Use a flower crown or garland to add a touch of whimsy to your display.\n* Incorporate flowers into your packaging or branding elements, like a floral-patterned tablecloth or flower-adorned business cards.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy the beauty of fresh flowers in your display while minimizing the risk of wilting or damage. Good luck with your night market, and I hope your display is a stunning success!",
