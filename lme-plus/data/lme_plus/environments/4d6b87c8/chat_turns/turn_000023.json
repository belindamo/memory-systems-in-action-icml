  "content": "Irony is a common literary device used by writers to create tension, humor, or to convey a deeper meaning. It refers to the contrast between what is expected and what actually occurs, often resulting in a twist or surprise ending.\n\nOne type of irony is situational irony, in which an event or situation occurs that is unexpected and contrary to what is expected or intended. For example, the story of Oedipus or Sophocles is a classic example of situational irony, where the hero tries to avoid his fate of murdering his father and marrying his mother, but in the end, his actions lead him to fulfill the prophecy.\n\nAnother type of irony is dramatic irony, which occurs when the audience or reader knows something that a character in the story does not, resulting in a sense of tension or suspense. This can be seen in various works of literature, such as Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, where the audience knows that Juliet is not dead but Romeo does not, leading him to commit suicide.\n\nVerbal irony is also commonly used in literature, in which an individual says something but means the opposite. This can be used for humor, sarcasm, or to convey a deeper meaning. For example, in George Orwell's Animal Farm, the pigs declare \"All animals are equal\" but eventually change this to \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,\" displaying their hypocrisy and lust for power.\n\nIn conclusion, irony is a powerful tool that writers often use to create depth and meaning in their stories. By highlighting the disparity between what is expected and what actually occurs, irony can lead to memorable plot twists and thought-provoking conclusions.",
