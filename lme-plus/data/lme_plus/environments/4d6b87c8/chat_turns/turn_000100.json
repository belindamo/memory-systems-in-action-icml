  "content": "During the Mad Gasser case in Mattoon, several suspects were identified and investigated, but none were definitively linked to the gas attacks. Here are some of the main suspects:\n\n1. Farley Llewellyn: Llewellyn was a disgruntled former employee of the local war plant who had been fired for stealing chemicals. He became a prime suspect when witnesses reported seeing a car matching his description near some of the crime scenes. However, Llewellyn had an alibi for the night of the attacks and was eventually cleared of suspicion.\n2. Theodore Durrant: Durrant was a traveling salesman who was in Mattoon at the time of the gas attacks. He became a suspect when a witness reported seeing a car matching his description near one of the crime scenes. However, Durrant had an alibi for the night of the attacks and was eventually cleared of suspicion.\n3. A mentally ill man: Some people speculated that the gasser may have been a mentally ill person who was not fully aware of their actions. This theory was supported by reports of a man who was seen walking around Mattoon with a gas mask and a flashlight, but it was never proven.\n4. Pranksters and copycats: Some of the reported gas attacks may have been the work of pranksters or copycats who were trying to capitalize on the hysteria. However, it is unclear how many of the reported attacks were hoaxes and how many were genuine gas attacks.\n\nDespite extensive investigations and numerous suspects, the identity of the Mad Gasser of Mattoon remains a mystery to this day.",
