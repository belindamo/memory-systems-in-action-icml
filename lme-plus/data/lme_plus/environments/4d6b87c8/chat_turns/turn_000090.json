  "content": "There are many different types of gases and chemicals that could have potentially emanated from a war plant during the time period of World War II. Some of the most commonly used gases and chemicals during the war included:\n\n* Chlorine gas: Chlorine gas was used as a chemical weapon during World War I, but it was largely replaced by other chemical agents during World War II. However, it was still used in some cases, particularly by the Japanese.\n* Mustard gas: Mustard gas was a blistering agent that caused severe burns and blisters on the skin and in the lungs. It was used by both the Allies and Axis powers during the war.\n* Phosgene gas: Phosgene gas was another toxic gas that was used during World War I, but it continued to be used in smaller quantities during World War II.\n* Hydrogen cyanide: Hydrogen cyanide was used by the Germans in gas chambers during the Holocaust. It was also used as a pesticide and fumigant.\n* Ammonia: Ammonia was used as a refrigerant and in the production of explosives during the war.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not clear whether any of these specific gases or chemicals were involved in the Mad Gasser incidents, and there is still much debate and speculation about what type of gas or chemical could have caused the reported symptoms. However, it's possible that the war plant in Mattoon could have been involved in the production of some of these or other chemicals during the war, which could have potentially played a role in the Mad Gasser case.",
