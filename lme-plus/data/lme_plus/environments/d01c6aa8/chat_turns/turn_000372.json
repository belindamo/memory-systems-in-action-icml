  "content": "Hello,\n\nI work for a community college in Texas and am using Share GPT for professional development activities in the Distance Ed department, my own classes, and departmental discussions. I learned about your app through a webinar for the Hypothes.is social annotation tool.\n\nAs chair of an advisory committee, I want to use Share GPT to demonstrate its limitations and potential for fostering academic integrity. I plan to use Hypothes.is or ShareGPT's chat feature for annotation and discussion, and to create an assignment for faculty to generate threads and share links to promote the use of Share GPT in course design.\n\nIn my own classes, I am using Padlet to save Share GPT threads and want to promote its use in my department and other departments. I have some questions about using the chat feature in small group discussions but am unable to test them currently.\n\nThank you.",
