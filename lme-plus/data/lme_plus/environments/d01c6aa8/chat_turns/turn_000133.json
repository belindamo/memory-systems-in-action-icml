  "content": "Macadamia nuts and pecans will add a delicious flavor and texture to your Tropical Granola.\n\nFor the nut ratio, you can use a combination of both nuts to create a balanced flavor profile. Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Macadamia Nuts:**\n\n* 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts (about 2 ounces or 60g)\n\nMacadamia nuts have a rich, buttery flavor, so a smaller amount will go a long way. They're also quite dense, so they'll provide a nice crunchy texture to the granola.\n\n**Pecans:**\n\n* 1 cup chopped pecans (about 4 ounces or 120g)\n\nPecans have a slightly sweeter and more delicate flavor than macadamia nuts, so you can use a bit more of them to balance out the flavor. They'll also add a nice crunch and texture to the granola.\n\nFeel free to adjust the ratio of macadamia nuts to pecans to your liking. If you prefer a stronger macadamia flavor, you can use more of them and fewer pecans. If you prefer a milder flavor, you can use more pecans and fewer macadamia nuts.\n\nRemember to chop the nuts coarsely before adding them to the granola mixture so they're evenly distributed.\n\nNow that you have your nuts, it's time to assemble the Tropical Granola recipe!",
