Detox your armpits: Before switching to a natural deodorant, it is recommended to detox your armpits to get rid of any bacteria or toxins that may have accumulated over time. You can do this by using a natural bentonite clay mask, diluted apple cider vinegar or witch hazel, or by exfoliating regularly with a gentle scrub. 2. Give it time: The transition to a natural deodorant can take some time as your body adjusts to new ingredients. During this time, you may experience increased sweating, and even a slight odor. Stick with it for at least 2 or 3 weeks, and you will eventually notice a difference. 3. Reapply as needed: Natural deodorants are not as powerful as traditional ones, so you may need to reapply throughout the day. When starting, try applying it twice a day or as needed. 4. Avoid synthetic fabrics: Synthetic fabrics can trap sweat and bacteria, leading to bad odor. Stick to natural fabrics like cotton or bamboo, which allow your skin to breathe and prevent odor-causing bacteria. 5. Be patient: Remember, it can take some time to find the right natural deodorant that works for you. If the first one doesn't work, don't give up - try different brands or formulations until you find one that suits your needs. With some patience and perseverance, you can make the switch to natural deodorant and enjoy its benefits for both your body and the environment.",
