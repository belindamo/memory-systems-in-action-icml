  "content": "Garage sale etiquette is important to ensure a positive experience for both buyers and sellers. Here are some unspoken rules to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Respect the start time**: Try to arrive around the advertised start time or a bit later. Showing up extremely early can be frustrating for sellers who may still be setting up.\n2. **Be prepared**: Bring cash, as not all sellers may accept credit or debit cards. Having small bills and coins can be helpful for making change.\n3. **Inspect items carefully**: Before purchasing, inspect items for damage, stains, or missing parts. Don't assume something is in perfect condition just because it's priced low.\n4. **Be respectful of prices**: Make reasonable offers, especially if you're trying to negotiate. Lowball offers can be insulting, and sellers may be less likely to work with you.\n5. **Don't haggle excessively**: If you make an offer and the seller declines, don't push the issue. You can either accept their price or walk away.\n6. **Don't touch or handle items excessively**: Be gentle when handling items, and avoid touching or handling things you're not interested in buying.\n7. **Keep children under control**: If you bring kids, make sure they're well-behaved and not causing a disturbance.\n8. **Don't try to sneak in early**: If a seller is setting up and you arrive early, don't try to start shopping before they're ready. Wait until they give you the okay to start browsing.\n9. **Be honest and transparent**: If you accidentally break or damage an item, own up to it and offer to pay for it or replace it.\n10. **Say thank you and be courteous**: A simple \"thank you\" or \"have a great day\" can go a long way in building a positive relationship with the seller.\n11. **Don't park in a way that blocks traffic**: Be mindful of parking and don't block driveways or sidewalks.\n12. **Follow local rules and regulations**: Some neighborhoods or communities may have specific rules about garage sales, such as permits or restrictions on signage.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll likely have a more enjoyable and successful garage sale experience. Remember, it's all about being respectful, considerate, and honest!",
