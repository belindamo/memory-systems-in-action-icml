  "content": "While sitting on a cushion or foam roller can provide some cushioning and support to the buttocks, they do not replace exercise and physical activity. If you want to prevent your buttocks from losing their shape, you should try to incorporate some exercises that target your glutes.\n\nExamples of such exercises include squats, lunges, and hip thrusts. These can be performed at home, in a gym, or outdoors, and can help to strengthen and tone your buttocks.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider incorporating more physical activity into your daily routine, such as walking, cycling, or swimming. These activities not only engage the glutes but provide overall cardiovascular and health benefits.\n\nIn summary, sitting on a cushion or foam roller may provide some minor support, but regular exercise and physical activity are necessary to maintain the size and shape of your buttocks.",
