  "content": "An example of an objectified schema type could be a \"Person\" object type that contains information about a person, including their \"Address\" and \"PhoneNumber\" object types. The \"Address\" object type would contain information about the person's street address, city, state, and zip code, while the \"PhoneNumber\" object type would contain information about the person's phone number, including their phone number and whether it is a landline or mobile number. This objectified schema type allows for more organized and efficient storage of information about a person, as the related information about their address and phone number can be easily accessed and managed together.",
