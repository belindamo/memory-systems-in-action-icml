Some students and faculty have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the university's testing protocols and quarantine procedures, while others have criticized the communication and transparency of the university's response to the pandemic.\n\nFor example, in September 2020, Northeastern University received criticism for suspending 11 first-year students who allegedly violated the university's COVID-19 protocols. Some students and faculty members expressed concern that the punishment was too severe and questioned whether the university's policies were well communicated to students.\n\nAdditionally, some students and faculty have expressed concerns about the sufficiency of the university's campus cleaning procedures and the ability for students to adhere to social distancing guidelines in shared spaces such as dining halls and residence halls.\n\nOverall, while Northeastern University has implemented a number of safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been some concerns and criticisms raised about the university's response.
