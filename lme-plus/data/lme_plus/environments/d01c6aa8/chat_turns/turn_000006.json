I've been having trouble understanding some of the idioms and expressions that my colleague from Brazil uses, and I think this will help me better understand the differences between European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese. By the way, I've been code-switching a lot between English and Spanish when I'm talking to my bilingual friends, and I've been thinking about how our brains can switch between languages so seamlessly, but at the same time, it can also be a challenge to keep track of the grammar and vocabulary rules of each language.
