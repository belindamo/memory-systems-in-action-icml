  "content": "Yes, there are several other Pagan traditions that share similar values of diversity and inclusivity. One such tradition is Druidry, which is an ancient form of Celtic spirituality that has been adapted for modern times. Druidry emphasizes reverence for nature and the natural world, and values the divine feminine and masculine as equal and complementary forces. Like Wicca, Druidry often recognizes multiple genders and sexualities as expressions of the divine, and values personal autonomy and acceptance of others.\n\nAnother example of a Pagan tradition that values diversity and inclusivity is Feri, a modern Pagan tradition that emerged in California in the 1960s. Feri is known for its emphasis on personal empowerment and spiritual transformation, and often includes practices related to sexuality and eroticism as means of achieving spiritual growth. Feri recognizes the value of individual experience and diversity, and often includes teachings related to gender and sexual identity.\n\nOverall, there are many Pagan traditions that place a strong emphasis on inclusivity and diversity, and strive to create safe and welcoming spaces for all individuals to explore and express their spirituality.",
