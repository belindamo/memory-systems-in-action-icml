  "content": "MK gasps for breath as Wukong's powerful grip tightens around his throat. He struggles and tries to break free, but Wukong's strength is too much for him.\n\n\"You were fun,\" Wukong says with a cruel grin, \"but I won't let you be rescued again. It's time for you to pay for your insolence.\"\n\nMK's eyes widen in terror as he realizes what Wukong intends to do. He manages to gasp out a plea. \"Please, Wukong, don't kill me. I'll do anything, I swear.\"\n\nBut Wukong just laughs. \"Anything? You're in no position to bargain with me, little monkey.\"\n\nMK's vision starts to blur as the lack of oxygen to his brain takes its toll. He feels his life slipping away and knows that he has to do something, anything, to survive.\n\nWith a last burst of strength, he reaches up and grabs Wukong's arm, digging his nails into the flesh. Wukong howls in pain and releases his grip on MK's throat.\n\nMK falls to the ground, gasping and coughing, but relieved to be alive. Wukong glares down at him, his eyes filled with rage.\n\n\"You'll pay for that, monkey,\" Wukong growls. \"I promise you that.\"\n\nMK shudders in fear, but also feels a glimmer of hope. He knows that he can't give up, that he has to keep fighting if he wants to survive.",
