  "content": "Dried pineapple and mango will add natural sweetness and chewiness to your Tropical Granola.\n\nFor the dried fruit, you can use a combination of both pineapple and mango to create a delicious and fruity flavor profile. Here's a suggestion:\n\n**Dried Pineapple:**\n\n* 1/2 cup dried pineapple chunks (about 2 ounces or 60g)\n\nDried pineapple adds a sweet and tangy flavor to the granola. You can use chunks or strips, depending on your preference.\n\n**Dried Mango:**\n\n* 1/2 cup dried mango chunks (about 2 ounces or 60g)\n\nDried mango adds a sweet and slightly tropical flavor to the granola. Look for dried mango that's not too sweet or sulfured, as it can affect the flavor of the granola.\n\nYou can adjust the amount of dried fruit to your liking, but this ratio will provide a good balance of flavors and textures. If you prefer a stronger fruit flavor, you can add more dried fruit. If you prefer a milder flavor, you can use less.\n\nRemember to chop the dried fruit into bite-sized pieces before adding them to the granola mixture so they're evenly distributed.\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to choose unsweetened and unsulphured dried fruit to avoid added sugars and preservatives.\n* If you're using dried fruit that's too sticky or clumpy, you can try drying it in a low-temperature oven (150\u00b0F/65\u00b0C) for a few hours to dry it out a bit.\n\nNow that you have your nuts and dried fruit, you're ready to assemble the Tropical Granola recipe!",
