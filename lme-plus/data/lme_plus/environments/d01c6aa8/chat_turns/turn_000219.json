In this article, we'll show you how to make gluten-free and low-carb baked meatballs in marinara sauce. This recipe is perfect for an easy dinner, meal prep, or freezing for future meals.\n\nCreating Moisture in Meatballs\n\nMany people inaccurately think that eggs help add moisture to meatballs, but too many eggs can make them more dense. In today's recipe, we will only use one egg as a binder. Chopped onions help to make meatballs moist when you're not using a panade of breadcrumbs and milk. The chopped onion, along with a few other ingredients like freshly chopped herbs, also helps to prevent the meatballs from becoming too dense.\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the Meatballs:\n\n* 1 and 1/2 pounds of ground meat\n* 1 large egg\n* 1/3 cup of finely chopped onion\n* 1/4 cup of almond flour\n* 1/4 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese\n* 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley\n* 3 garlic cloves\n* 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning\n* 1 teaspoon of kosher salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper\n\nFor the Marinara Sauce:\n\n* 1 small onion\n* 2 (28-ounce) cans of crushed tomatoes\n* 6 sprigs of fresh thyme\n* Several basil leaves\n* 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the meatball ingredients and mix with your hands until just combined. Do not overmix.\n3. Use a medium cookie scoop to portion out the meat mixture, and then roll each portion into a ball between your hands. You should end up with around 30 meatballs.\n4. Place the meatballs onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and bake for 18-20 minutes or until lightly browned on the outside and cooked through.\n5. While the meatballs are baking, start making the marinara sauce. Finely chop the small onion and saut\u00e9 it in a large skillet over medium-high heat until softened, about 5 minutes.\n6. Add the crushed tomatoes, thyme sprigs, and kosher salt to the skillet, and stir to combine.\n7. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes or until the sauce has thickened slightly.\n8. When the meatballs are done, add them to the marinara sauce, and simmer for another 5-10 minutes until the meatballs are fully coated in the sauce.\n9. Serve the meatballs hot, garnished with basil leaves.\n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\nCook Time: 35 minutes\nTotal Time: 55 minutes\n\nMeta Description: Learn how to make gluten-free and low-carb baked meatballs in marinara sauce that are perfect for an easy dinner, meal prep, or freezing for future meals.",
