  "content": "W: Set constraints are used to express relationships between different sets of predicators in a population. There are three types of set constraints: subset, equal, and exclusion.\n\nSubset constraint: A subset constraint specifies that one set of predicators (\u03c3) is a subset of another set of predicators (\u03c4) in the population, with a matching (\u03c6) between the two sets. This is denoted as: Pop |= subset\u03c6(\u03c3, \u03c4).\n\nEqual constraint: An equal constraint specifies that one set of predicators (\u03c3) is equal to another set of predicators (\u03c4) in the population, with a matching (\u03c6) between the two sets. This is denoted as: Pop |= equal\u03c6(\u03c3, \u03c4).\n\nExclusion constraint: An exclusion constraint specifies that one set of predicators (\u03c3) is disjoint from another set of predicators (\u03c4) in the population, with a matching (\u03c6) between the two sets. This is denoted as: Pop |= exclusion\u03c6(\u03c3, \u03c4).\n\nA matching (\u03c6) is a bijection between two sets of predicators (\u03c3 and \u03c4) where each element in the set (\u03c6(x)) is type related with the corresponding element in the other set (x).\n\nSet constraints are useful for expressing complex relationships between different sets of predicators in a population, but they can be difficult to understand and implement due to the need for a matching between the sets. Additionally, the matching may not always be clear from the context, which can lead to confusion.",
