Research shows that dogs motivate their human companions to be more active and, in return, both pet and owner share a pleasurable experience that increases their happiness.

Studies suggest that pets offer many benefits to health and happiness, as they not only provide companionship, but also reduce cases of depression and anxiety, helping to increase our levels of happiness and self-esteem. The main ingredients for happiness, what the research boils down to, are connections and social activities - both of the mind and body. And finding a flow of life through our daily habits and intentions can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life.\n\nPlease write in Portuguese language.",
