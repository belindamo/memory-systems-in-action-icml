What type of cuisine are you thinking of serving? Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.) that you need to accommodate?\n\nAlso, what's the occasion for the dinner party? Is it a special celebration or just a casual gathering with friends?\n\nAs for your experience helping your mom with grocery shopping, that's great! You must have learned some valuable tips and tricks. Feel free to share any insights or ideas you have, and I can build upon those to help you plan an even more successful dinner party.\n\nLet's get started!",
