Let's see... my sister-in-law just had a baby boy named Ethan on February 12th, and I visited them at the hospital. My college friend Rachel adopted a baby girl from China, Emily, and I'm planning to visit her soon. My high school friend Mike's wife is pregnant and due in late July. I also attended a baby shower for my coworker's wife, who's having a boy named Lucas. Oh, and my cousin's wife is due to give birth to their third child in early April.
