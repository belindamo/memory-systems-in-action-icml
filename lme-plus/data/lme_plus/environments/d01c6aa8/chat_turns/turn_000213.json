  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to current information on whether there have been any COVID-19 cases on Northeastern University's campus despite their safety measures. However, it's important to note that even with strict safety protocols in place, there is always a risk of COVID-19 transmission on a college campus. How effectively the university can prevent the spread of the virus will depend on a variety of factors, such as the size of the campus, the number of students, and the availability of testing and other medical resources. It's also possible that Northeastern University has had cases of COVID-19 on campus despite their efforts to prevent it, but the specific details of these cases would likely be protected under privacy laws.",
