Maybe it's getting up early to watch the sun rise, spending the weekend with family and friends or taking a dip in the sea. But what does science say about the habits of happy people? We know that happy people tend to have strong relationships, good physical health, and regularly contribute to their communities. I have experimented over the last seven years with a series of practices related to happiness and well-being in an attempt to improve my own mental health and to understand how best to help others. Some strategies were successful while others didn't work for me. But here's what I learned along the way. The truth is, there will be times when we manage to develop happiness-related habits and feel positive. But there will be times when life sneaks up on us and our happiness suffers. The good news is that we can all improve our levels of happiness with daily practice. 1. MOVE YOUR BODY My body needs to move regularly throughout the day. Sitting for long periods of time doesn't make my body or mind happy. At a minimum, I walk at a brisk pace for an hour every day. I also like to swim, dance and do yoga. Physical activity and regular exercise are at the top of the list for achieving happiness. Studies consistently show a relationship between being physically active and increasing subjective well-being, otherwise known as happiness. Research suggests that walking for 30 minutes a day can improve your health. But happiness studies show that people benefit most from moderate to high-intensity exercise, which raises your heart rate. Moderate exercise is any activity that leaves you slightly breathless - you can still talk, but you probably wouldn't be able to sing a song.2. PRIORITIZE CONNECTION The latest happiness research shows that our social connections matter in terms of overall well-being and life satisfaction. In fact, making time to talk, listen, share and have fun with friends and family is a habit that I try to prioritize. But a recent study found that we generally interact with friends and family more when we're feeling unhappy \u2014 and less when we're happy. This can happen because we naturally seek comfort and support to feel happier, and we look for other activities when our happiness is stable. It seems to be a question of balance, a lot of time alone can lead to negative emotions, so looking for other people is a natural way to alleviate this feeling and improve our mood. On the other hand, when we feel positive and happy, we are more inclined to support others and lend a helping hand. However, spending time with friends and family provides both short- and long-term happiness gains.3. PRACTICE GRATITUDE Our outlook on life and how we evaluate things also play an important role in our levels of happiness. Studies show that having a more optimistic mindset and practicing a sense of gratitude can protect against negative emotions and increase happiness. Practicing daily gratitude, such as counting my blessings or listing the things I'm grateful for throughout the day, helps me to think more positively and feel happier. You can do this in many ways - through, for example, a gratitude journal, which can be handwritten or written on your cell phone. The three good things exercise is a quick and easy habit to adopt to increase optimism. You simply write down three things that went well that day and reflect on what was good about them. There are many apps now that can send you notifications and monitor your gratitude. Others let you create a visualization wall and positive affirmations for your days. While some may seem gimmicky, this is a gentle push towards positivity backed by science. Or to put it another way, practicing and cultivating an attitude of gratitude and appreciation often works and helps you feel more positive about your life. Gratitude also helps you see the big picture and become more resilient in the face of adversity. You can also practice gratitude more naturally by giving thanks - telling someone what you're grateful for that day or sending them thank you messages. It may sound trite, but it's important, as research shows that daily feelings of gratitude are associated with higher levels of positive emotions and better social well-being. 4.
