  "content": "I'd like to ask about sleep habits. Since I've been trying to establish a consistent wake-up time, I've realized that my sleep schedule is heavily influenced by the amount of sleep I get. If I get at least 7-8 hours of sleep, I usually wake up feeling refreshed and energized. However, if I get less than 7 hours of sleep, I tend to wake up groggy and disoriented. Do you have any tips on how to improve my sleep quality and get those extra hours of sleep?",
