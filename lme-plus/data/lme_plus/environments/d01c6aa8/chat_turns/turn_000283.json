Purge and Categorize:**\n Begin by taking everything out of the cabinet and sorting items into categories, such as:\n\t* Food and treats\n\t* Toys and chews\n\t* Grooming supplies (shampoos, brushes, etc.)\n\t* Medications and supplements\n\t* Flea and tick prevention\n\t* Miscellaneous (collars, leashes, etc.)\n\n**2. Assign a Home:**\n Once you've categorized your supplies, assign a specific shelf or section of the cabinet to each group. This will help maintain organization and make it easier to find what you need.\n\n**3. Use Storage Containers:**\n Utilize bins, baskets, or containers to store small items like toys, treats, or grooming supplies. Label each container so you can easily identify what's inside.\n\n**4. Maximize Vertical Space:**\n Make the most of your cabinet's vertical space by using stackable shelves or baskets. This will help keep items off the floor and prevent clutter from building up.\n\n**5. Keep Frequently Used Items Accessible:**\n Store frequently used items in easy-to-reach locations, such as the top shelf or in a convenient basket near the front of the cabinet.\n\n**6. Label and Sign:**\n Label each shelf or section with its contents, and consider adding a sign to the cabinet door indicating what's stored inside. This will help you and others quickly find what they need.\n\n**7. Keep it Clean:**\n Set aside some time each month to tidy up the cabinet and remove any expired or unused items. This will prevent clutter from building up again.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Consider using a turntable or lazy Susan to make it easy to access items in the back of the cabinet.\n* Store heavy items, like pet food, on the bottom shelf to prevent them from falling and causing a mess.\n* Keep a donation bin or bag in the cabinet to collect items you no longer need or use, and donate them to a local animal shelter or pet rescue organization.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a more organized, clutter-free space that makes it easy to find what you need for Max and Luna. Happy organizing!",
