Here are some specific tips to help you control your speed during high-speed turns:\n\n1. **Brake before the turn**: Learn to brake smoothly and gradually before entering a turn. This will help you shed speed and transfer weight to the front wheels, making the car more stable and responsive.\n2. **Use the correct braking technique**: Practice using the \"brake, release, and turn\" technique. Brake gently before the turn, release the brakes as you turn in, and then apply gentle throttle to maintain speed.\n3. **Feather the throttle**: Instead of mashing the gas pedal, learn to feather the throttle to control your speed. This will help you maintain a consistent speed and avoid sudden acceleration that can upset the car's balance.\n4. **Use the correct gear**: Make sure you're in the correct gear for the turn. Shifting into a lower gear can help you lose speed and maintain control, while shifting into a higher gear can help you carry more speed through the turn.\n5. **Look for reference points**: Identify reference points on the track or parking lot, such as cones or markings, to help you gauge your speed and distance from the turn. This will help you adjust your speed accordingly.\n6. **Feel the car's weight transfer**: As you enter a turn, pay attention to the car's weight transfer. When the weight shifts to the rear wheels, it's a sign that you're carrying too much speed. Adjust your throttle input to control the weight transfer and maintain balance.\n7. **Practice different turn-in speeds**: Experiment with different turn-in speeds to find the optimal speed for each turn. This will help you develop a sense of how much speed you can carry through a turn without losing control.\n8. **Use your peripheral vision**: Instead of focusing directly on the turn, use your peripheral vision to gauge your speed and distance from the turn. This will help you stay aware of your surroundings and make adjustments as needed.\n9. **Slow in, fast out**: A good rule of thumb is to slow down before the turn and accelerate out of it. This will help you maintain control and carry more speed through the turn.\n10. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more you'll develop a sense of speed and control. Start with slower speeds and gradually increase your pace as you become more comfortable.\n\nRemember, speed management is all about finding the right balance between carrying speed and maintaining control. With practice and patience, you'll develop the skills and instincts to navigate high-speed turns with confidence.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about these tips or any other aspects of speed management?",
