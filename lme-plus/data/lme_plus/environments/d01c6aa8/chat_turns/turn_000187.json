However, I have to correct you - you didn't visit those attractions last month because you're asking for recommendations now. Plus, the Statue of Liberty is not in Brooklyn, it's on Liberty Island, and Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are in Manhattan, not Brooklyn.\n\nBut let's focus on finding you a great hostel in Brooklyn! Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Brooklyn Hostel**: A social hostel with a rooftop lounge and a game room, located in the trendy Bushwick neighborhood.\n2. **NY Moore Hostel**: A modern hostel with private rooms and dorms, situated in the heart of Williamsburg, close to many bars, restaurants, and music venues.\n3. **Q4 Hotel**: A stylish hostel with a rooftop garden and a game room, located in the Long Island City neighborhood, just a short subway ride from Manhattan.\n4. **The Brooklyn Riviera**: A boutique hostel with private rooms and dorms, situated in the trendy Williamsburg neighborhood, close to the waterfront and many restaurants and bars.\n5. **International Student Residence**: A budget-friendly hostel with private rooms and dorms, located in the Clinton Hill neighborhood, close to Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Museum.\n\nMake sure to research each hostel, read reviews, and check their policies and prices before making a decision.
