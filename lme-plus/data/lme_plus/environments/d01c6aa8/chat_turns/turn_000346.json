  "content": "I'd like to ask about the Turbocharged Weekend event. I participated in the amateur drift competition and managed to complete three laps without any major mistakes, although I did spin out on the second lap. My car, a 2015 Nissan GT-R, performed well despite the worn-out rear tires, and I'm glad I had replaced the brake pads just a week prior to the event. Do you think I should focus on upgrading my tires or brakes next?",
