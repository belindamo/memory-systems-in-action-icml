  "content": "As a green card applicant from India, you'll need to meet the vaccination requirements set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). While the standard vaccination requirements apply to all green card applicants, there are some additional considerations for individuals from certain countries, including India.\n\n**Country-specific vaccination requirements:**\n\nThe CDC recommends that individuals from India, as well as other high-risk countries, receive additional vaccinations or provide proof of immunity against certain diseases. These include:\n\n1. **Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine**: If you're from a rural area in India or have spent significant time in rural areas, you may be recommended to receive the JE vaccine.\n2. **Hepatitis B vaccine**: While Hepatitis B vaccine is already a standard requirement, individuals from India may be at higher risk due to the prevalence of Hepatitis B in the country.\n\n**TB testing:**\n\nAs an individual from India, you may be required to undergo TB testing, regardless of your age. This is because India is considered a high-burden country for TB. The civil surgeon may recommend a TB skin test (Mantoux) or a blood test (IGRA) to detect TB infection.\n\n**Other health risks:**\n\nIndia is also considered a high-risk country for other diseases, such as:\n\n1. **Malaria**: While not a vaccination requirement, you may be advised to take precautions against malaria if you plan to travel to areas where malaria is common.\n2. **Typhoid fever**: While there is no vaccination requirement, you may be advised to take precautions against typhoid fever, which is prevalent in India.\n\n**What to do:**\n\nTo ensure you meet all the vaccination requirements, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Consult with your healthcare provider**: Discuss your vaccination history and any concerns with your healthcare provider, especially if you're unsure about your vaccination status.\n2. **Check your vaccination records**: Review your vaccination records to ensure you've received all the required vaccinations.\n3. **Bring vaccination records to the medical examination**: Make sure to bring your vaccination records to the medical examination to avoid delays in your green card application.\n4. **Follow the civil surgeon's guidance**: The civil surgeon may provide additional guidance on vaccinations or testing specific to your country of origin or individual circumstances.\n\nBy understanding the country-specific vaccination requirements and taking the necessary steps, you'll be well-prepared for your medical examination and green card application.",
