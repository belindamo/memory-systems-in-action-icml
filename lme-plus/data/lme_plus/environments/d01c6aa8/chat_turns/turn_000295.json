Open Google Calendar and click on the \"+\" button to create a new calendar.\n2. Name the calendar something like \"Birthdays\" or \"Special Days\".\n3. Click on the new calendar to open it.\n4. Click on the date February 12th and create a new event.\n5. Enter \"Ethan's Birthday\" as the event title.\n6. Set the start and end times to the same time (e.g., 12:00 AM - 12:00 AM) to mark the entire day.\n7. Click on the \"Reminders\" button and set a reminder for February 12th. You can choose a notification time that works for you, such as 1 week, 1 day, or 1 hour before the birthday.\n8. Click \"Save\" to save the event.\n\n**Alternative:**\n\nIf you prefer to use a different calendar app, you can follow similar steps to create a new event for Ethan's birthday. Make sure to set the event to repeat annually, so it will automatically appear on your calendar every year on February 12th.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Consider setting reminders for a few days before the birthday, so you have time to prepare a gift or card.\n* You can also add a note to the event with gift ideas or other important details.\n* If you want to send a birthday message or gift, you can set a reminder for a specific time on the birthday, such as 9:00 AM, to ensure you don't forget.\n\nNow you've got Ethan's birthday marked on your special calendar! As you add more birthdays, you'll be able to see all the upcoming celebrations at a glance.",
