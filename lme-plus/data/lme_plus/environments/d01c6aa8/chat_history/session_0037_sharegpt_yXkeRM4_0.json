      "content": "Please help make this email more concise while retaining key details: Yes, of course. I work for a community college in Texas in the US. I am using Share GPT for a number of things: professional development activities for the Distance Ed department, use in my own classes (forthcoming), and for use in departmental discussions or professional development activities. I am an English instructor, but I am often asked to do things for or with Distance Ed and Educational Technology Departments. I learned about your app while attending a webinar for the Hypothes.is social annotation tool and got it that same day. \n\nI am chair of an advisory committee gathering resources and making suggestions for Instructional Designers to consider as they revise our Online Teaching Certification Course for cohorts of recently hired faculty. All faculty have to take a series of classes and trainings prior to teaching online courses.\n\n\u2022 I specifically want to use Share GPT to share threads that show not just the limitations of Chat GPT, to take some of the fear of what it might mean for academic integrity, but also to explore how it can be used to foster academic integrity and spark a genuine interest in learning and using it as a tool to facilitate that, not circumvent it. This will be used in both \u201clessons\u201d for faculty as well as activities.\n\u2022 I plan to use either Hypothes.is, which is a social annotation tool, to collaboratively annotate and discuss certain threads or the chat feature within ShareGPT itself. I have currently used ShareGPT to annotate some threads before placing them in the course. \n\u2022 I would also like to create an assignment for faculty taking the course to generate threads and share links to them using Chat GPT so they can think about the things they want to show students in their discipline-specific courses to start thinking how they can design projects and activities in their courses that allow sanctioned use of Chat GPT, ShareGPT, and other technologies to facilitate learning and promote integrity by design. \n\nOn a personal, or individual instructor level, I am exploring the possibilities for how I can use Chat GPT effectively effectively in my own classes, and Share GPT is a big part of that vision. I want to use it in similar ways described above, including having my own students generate threads, that they save and potentially turn in or \u201cdisclose\u201d as part of their work flow process. I am using Padlet, which is a popular tool used by teachers, to save a lot of my Share GPT threads. It is a GREAT way to do this. It\u2019s kind of like a digital bulletin board that makes it easy to find Share GPT links to conversations. I don\u2019t have all conversations stored there, but as I generate and save more through Share GPT, I will save and organize them for easy reference and retrieval. \n\nI am also interested in using Share GPT to promote discussion and similar aims in my own department and get the word out to other departments. I teach English and my husband teaches math at the same college. We both see much potential in the use of various technologies, and Share GPT is a great way have meaningful discussions and to present ready-made examples of threads to use in lessons and in professional development activities. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you can make your app any better. It\u2019s already quite excellent. I have some questions to explore regarding the chat feature in Share GPT, especially as it pertains to possibly using share links in small group online asynchronous discussions. I currently can\u2019t test those out to ask proper questions because the chat feature is not currently showing up on the share links I\u2019ve saved. They were there earlier but not now. I\u2019ll check to see later, though."

As an English instructor, I'm often asked to work with Distance Ed and Educational Technology Departments, and I learned about Share GPT while attending a webinar for the Hypothes.is social annotation tool.\n\nI'm using Share GPT in multiple ways, including for professional development activities, in my own classes, and in departmental discussions. I've found it to be a great tool for fostering academic integrity and sparking a genuine interest in learning.

I'm looking forward to exploring this feature further once it's available.\n\nThank you for creating such an excellent tool. I'm excited to see how Share GPT can continue to support innovative teaching and learning practices.\n\nBest regards, [Your name]"
