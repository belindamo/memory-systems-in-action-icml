While the standard vaccination requirements apply to all green card applicants, there are some additional considerations for individuals from certain countries, including India.\n\n**Country-specific vaccination requirements:**\n\nThe CDC recommends that individuals from India, as well as other high-risk countries, receive additional vaccinations or provide proof of immunity against certain diseases. These include:\n\n1. **Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine**: If you're from a rural area in India or have spent significant time in rural areas, you may be recommended to receive the JE vaccine.\n2. **Hepatitis B vaccine**: While Hepatitis B vaccine is already a standard requirement, individuals from India may be at higher risk due to the prevalence of Hepatitis B in the country.\n\n**TB testing:**\n\nAs an individual from India, you may be required to undergo TB testing, regardless of your age. This is because India is considered a high-burden country for TB. The civil surgeon may recommend a TB skin test (Mantoux) or a blood test (IGRA) to detect TB infection.\n\n**Other health risks:**\n\nIndia is also considered a high-risk country for other diseases, such as:\n\n1. **Malaria**: While not a vaccination requirement, you may be advised to take precautions against malaria if you plan to travel to areas where malaria is common.\n2. **Typhoid fever**: While there is no vaccination requirement, you may be advised to take precautions against typhoid fever, which is prevalent in India.\n\n**What to do:**\n\nTo ensure you meet all the vaccination requirements, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Consult with your healthcare provider**: Discuss your vaccination history and any concerns with your healthcare provider, especially if you're unsure about your vaccination status.\n2. **Check your vaccination records**: Review your vaccination records to ensure you've received all the required vaccinations.\n3. **Bring vaccination records to the medical examination**: Make sure to bring your vaccination records to the medical examination to avoid delays in your green card application.\n4. **Follow the civil surgeon's guidance**: The civil surgeon may provide additional guidance on vaccinations or testing specific to your country of origin or individual circumstances.\n\nBy understanding the country-specific vaccination requirements and taking the necessary steps, you'll be well-prepared for your medical examination and green card application.",
