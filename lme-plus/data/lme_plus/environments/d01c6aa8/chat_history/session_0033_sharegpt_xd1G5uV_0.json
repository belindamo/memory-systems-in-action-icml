      "content": "Write a letter to my childhood friend, Barbara, whose nickname was Barbie. My name is Scott. We see each other a few times a year. Tell her we'd love to see them soon! We loved to skateboard in elementary school. She love alternative music. I played tennis. She was like a sister to me. We've known each other our entire lives. She got married about 10 years ago. They adopted a boy named Jed with her wife, Nancy. She lives near a mutual childhood friend, Abby. I live a farm in Indiana. She lives in Brooklyn."

      "content": "Dear Barbie,\n\nIt feels like it's been ages since we last saw each other! I hope this letter finds you and your beautiful family in good health and spirits.\n\nDo you remember the good old days when we used to skateboard down the block and listen to your alternative music on your boombox? Those were the best times, and I'm so grateful to have had you as a childhood friend. You were more like a sister to me, and I cherish the memories we've shared together.\n\nI can't believe it's been over ten years since you got married and adopted Jed with Nancy. It seems like just yesterday we were hanging out on the playground during recess. I'm so happy for you and your family, and I hope Jed is doing well.\n\nI'd love to catch up and hear all about what's been happening in your life. I live on a farm in Indiana now, and while life is a bit slower-paced here, I love it. I'm sure you're keeping busy in Brooklyn, too, with Abby living nearby.\n\nLet's make plans to get together soon! It would be wonderful to see you and your family again. Until then, take care and stay in touch.\n\nYour friend always,\n\nScott"
