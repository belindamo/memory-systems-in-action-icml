      "content": "The Classic Vanilla Cake with a light powdered sugar glaze is a timeless choice that's sure to impress.\n\n**Powdered Sugar Glaze:**\n\n1. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 cup powdered sugar and 2-3 tablespoons milk or heavy cream until smooth.\n2. Adjust the consistency by adding more powdered sugar for a thicker glaze or more milk for a thinner glaze.\n3. Whisk until the glaze is smooth and lump-free.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a high-quality powdered sugar that's fresh and not lumpy.\n* If you're using a store-bought powdered sugar, sift it before whisking to remove any lumps.\n* You can flavor the glaze with a teaspoon of vanilla extract or a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor.\n\n**Writing the \"50\":**\n\n1. **Chocolate Ganache:** Melt 1-2 tablespoons of chocolate chips (white, milk, or dark) in a double boiler or in the microwave in 10-second increments, stirring between each interval until smooth. Let cool slightly to thicken.\n2. **Piping Bag:** Use a piping bag with a small round tip (e.g., #1 or #2) to write the \"50\" on top of the cake. You can also use a plastic bag with a corner cut off.\n3. **Writing:** Hold the piping bag at a 90-degree angle to the cake and squeeze out a small amount of ganache. Write the \"50\" in a steady, smooth motion. If you're not comfortable free-handing, you can practice on a piece of parchment paper first.\n\n**Alternative Methods:**\n\n1. **Edible Markers:** Use edible markers or cake decorating pens to write the \"50\" on top of the cake. These markers come in various colors and are easy to use.\n2. **Fondant:** Roll out fondant to a thin sheet, cut out a \"50\" shape, and place it on top of the cake. You can also use store-bought fondant decorations.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure the cake is completely cooled before glazing and writing the \"50\".\n* If using chocolate ganache, work quickly, as it can set fast.\n* Don't worry if your handwriting isn't perfect \u2013 it's the thought that counts!\n\nI hope these tips help you create a beautiful and delicious anniversary cake for your grandparents!"
