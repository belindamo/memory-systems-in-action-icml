Now, let's get to those protein-rich snack balls!\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**No-Bake Energy Balls Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups rolled oats\n* 1 cup nut butter (peanut butter, almond butter, or cashew butter)\n* 1/2 cup honey or natural sweetener (like maple syrup)\n* 1/4 cup chopped nuts (almonds, walnuts, or pecans)\n* 1/4 cup chia seeds\n* 1/4 cup shredded coconut (optional)\n* Pinch of salt\n* Vanilla extract (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, nut butter, and honey or natural sweetener. Mix until well combined.\n2. Stir in the chopped nuts, chia seeds, and shredded coconut (if using).\n3. Add a pinch of salt and a dash of vanilla extract (if using).\n4. Mix everything together until you get a dough-like consistency. If it's too sticky, add a bit more oats. If it's too dry, add a bit more nut butter.\n5. Use your hands to shape the mixture into small balls, about 1-inch in diameter. You should end up with around 12-15 energy balls.\n6. Place the energy balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set.\n7. Store the energy balls in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\nTips:\n\n* You can customize the recipe by using different nut butters, seeds, or adding in dried fruits like cranberries or raisins.\n* If you find the mixture too sticky, try adding a bit more oats or chia seeds. If it's too dry, add a bit more nut butter.\n* These energy balls are perfect for snacking on the go, and they're also a great post-workout snack.\n\nNow, go ahead and give these energy balls a try!
