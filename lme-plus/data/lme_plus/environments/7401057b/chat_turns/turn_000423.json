Here are some recommendations for good quality guitar cables that won't break the bank:\n\n1. **Mogami Gold Instrument Cable**: Mogami is a well-respected brand in the music industry, and their gold cables are a popular choice among guitarists.

They offer a variety of lengths and gauges, and you can find a good quality 10-foot cable for around $15-$25.\n3. **Planet Waves Classic Series**: Planet Waves is a popular choice among guitarists, and their Classic Series cables offer a great balance of tone and price. They're made with high-quality materials and are built to withstand the rigors of touring. A 10-foot cable will cost you around $15-$25.\n4. **D'Addario Planet Waves American Stage**: If you're looking for a more premium option, the American Stage series from Planet Waves is a great choice. These cables are made with high-quality materials and offer a clear, detailed tone. You can find a 10-foot cable for around $30-$40.\n\nWhen choosing a guitar cable, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Length**: How long do you need the cable to be? If you're playing live, you may want a longer cable to give you more freedom to move around.\n* **Gauge**: A thicker gauge (e.g., 10 AWG) will provide a clearer signal, but it may be stiffer and less flexible. A thinner gauge (e.g., 18 AWG) will be more flexible, but may introduce more noise into the signal.\n* **Material**: Look for cables made with high-quality materials, such as oxygen-free copper or silver-plated conductors.\n* **Connectors**: Make sure the connectors are high-quality and securely attached to the cable.\n\nRemember, a good quality guitar cable is an investment in your tone and your playing experience. While it's tempting to go for the cheapest option, a better cable can make a noticeable difference in your sound.\n\nNow, get back to gathering that info about your Pearl Export drum set, and I'll be happy to help you determine its value!",
