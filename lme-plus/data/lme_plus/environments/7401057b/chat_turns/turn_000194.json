  "content": "Yes, Toyota has made several significant changes in its vehicles based on customer feedback in the past. For instance, in the early 2000s, some Toyota vehicles experienced unintended acceleration, which led to significant safety concerns among customers. In response, Toyota initiated a large-scale recall and implemented several changes to its production processes to address the issue, including installing brake override systems in its vehicles.\n\nToyota has also made changes to its vehicles based on feedback regarding comfort and convenience. For example, based on customer feedback that the Prius had limited rear visibility, Toyota added a rearview camera as a standard feature starting in 2010. Similarly, based on customer feedback regarding the air conditioning systems in its vehicles, Toyota developed an automatic climate control system that is now available in many of its vehicles.\n\nOverall, Toyota's commitment to listening to and addressing customer feedback has helped the company to continuously improve its vehicles and maintain a high level of customer satisfaction.",
