  "content": "If you\u2019re a picky eater, there are a few things that you may want to be aware of when it comes to Sicilian cuisine:\n\n1) Seafood: Sicilian cuisine is heavily influenced by the sea, and many dishes incorporate seafood. If you don't like seafood or are allergic to shellfish or other types of fish, you may want to look for alternative options when dining out.\n\n2) Spices: Sicilian dishes tend to be highly seasoned, so if you are sensitive to spices or strong flavors, you may want to look for more mild options.\n\n3) Offal-based dishes: Some traditional Sicilian dishes, like tripe or spleen sandwiches, are made with offal. If you are not accustomed to eating these types of dishes, you may want to avoid them.\n\n4) Raw meat dishes: Some Sicilian dishes are made with raw meats, like carpaccio or beef tartare. If you are not comfortable eating raw meat, you may want to avoid these dishes.\n\n5) Bread products: Many Sicilian dishes, like arancini or panelle, are made with bread crumbs, so if you have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, you may want to ask about alternatives or be careful when ordering. \n\nIt's always recommended to tell your waiter or chef about your dietary restrictions or preferences so they can recommend dishes that suit your taste. You can also research the restaurants you want to visit online to get an idea of their menu offerings.",
