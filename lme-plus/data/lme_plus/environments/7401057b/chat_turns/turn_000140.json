  "content": "Yes, there are many interesting facts about the Cheers set. Here are a few:\n\n1. The \"Cheers\" sign that hung outside the bar was actually a real sign from a neighborhood bar in Boston.\n\n2. The iconic Cheers bar was built on a soundstage in Hollywood, not in Boston.\n\n3. The bar was designed after a real Boston bar, the Bull & Finch Pub, which still exists today.\n\n4. The set included a replica of the famous Cheers pool table, which was designed to look like a pool table from the 1890s.\n\n5. The bar set was so accurate that fans would often write letters to the fictional Cheers bar, thinking it was a real place.\n\n6. The front door of the bar was intentionally squeaky, to allow for comedic timing during the show's dialogue.\n\n7. The set designers created a \"walk-and-talk\" section of the bar so that characters could move through the set while talking, which became a signature feature of the show.\n\n8. The studio audience set was built above the main set, allowing for a bird's-eye view of the action.\n\n9. Some of the props on the set, such as the beer mugs and bar stools, were actually purchased from local Boston bars and restaurants.\n\n10. The Cheers set was so beloved by the cast and crew that it was preserved after the show ended and is now part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour in Hollywood.",
