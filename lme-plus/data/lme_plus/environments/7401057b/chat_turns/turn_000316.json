By the way, I'm moving to Vancouver for university, and I've booked a one-way ticket from my hometown to Vancouver International Airport on August 15th, which gives me about 2 weeks to settle in before classes start. Do you have any tips on how to get to my accommodation from the airport, and what to expect in terms of transportation options in Vancouver?",
