Bald Blast: This attack would involve the protagonist charging up energy in his bald head and releasing a powerful blast of energy that damages enemies in its path.\n3. Reflect: The protagonist could use his shiny bald head to reflect projectiles back at enemies, allowing him to turn their attacks against them.\n4. Razor Head: The protagonist could grow sharp, razor-like hairs on his bald head that he can use to slash at enemies.\n5. Bald Shield: The protagonist could create a protective shield around himself made out of his baldness, deflecting attacks and protecting himself from damage.\n6. Spin Attack: The protagonist could spin rapidly on his bald head, creating a whirlwind that damages nearby enemies.\n7. Comb Over: The protagonist could use his baldness to his advantage by flipping over his hairless head and using his comb-over as a makeshift whip to attack enemies.\n\nThese are just a few ideas, but the possibilities are endless!
