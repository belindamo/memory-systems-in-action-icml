Here's an idea:\n\n**Post idea:**\n\nCreate a post with a bold, eye-catching graphic or a photo that stands out. You can use a countdown timer or a clock to emphasize the limited time left.\n\n**Caption ideas:**\n\n* \"IT'S TIME! \u23f0 Only 1 hour to go until my live Reels session! \ud83d\udcf9 Don't miss out! Set a reminder and join me at [time]! \u23f0 #ReelsLive #FinalCountdown\"\n* \"LAST CHANCE! \u23f0 Only 1 hour left until I go live on Reels! \ud83d\udcf9 Set a reminder and don't miss out on the fun!

Good luck! \ud83d\udcf9",
