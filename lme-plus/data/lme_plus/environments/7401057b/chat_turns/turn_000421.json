Is it a 5-piece set (bass drum, snare, two rack toms, and a floor tom) or a smaller setup? Are there any additional drums or hardware included?\n3. **Shell sizes and material**: What are the sizes of the drums, and are they made of wood, steel, or another material?\n4. **Finish and condition**: What's the finish of the drums (e.g., lacquer, wrap, metallic)? Are there any scratches, dents, or fading?
