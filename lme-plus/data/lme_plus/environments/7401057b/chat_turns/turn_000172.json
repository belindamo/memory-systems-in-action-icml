Losing a beloved mug can be a tragedy, but it's a great excuse to get a new one!\n\nI'd be happy to help you find a durable and easy-to-clean coffee mug. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Ceramic Mugs**: Ceramic mugs are a great option because they're durable, non-porous, and easy to clean. Look for ones with a glaze that's resistant to chipping and cracking.\n2. **Stainless Steel Mugs**: Stainless steel mugs are another great option. They're durable, resistant to scratches and corrosion, and easy to clean. They can also keep your coffee hot for hours.\n3. **Silicone Mugs**: Silicone mugs are flexible, lightweight, and easy to clean. They're also dishwasher and microwave safe. However, they might not be as durable as ceramic or stainless steel mugs.\n\nWhen it comes to ease of cleaning, look for mugs with the following features:\n\n* **Wide Mouth**: A wide mouth makes it easy to clean the inside of the mug with a sponge or brush.\n* **Smooth Interior**: A smooth interior surface makes it easy to wipe down and prevents bacteria and stains from building up.\n* **Dishwasher Safe**: If you want to make cleaning even easier, look for mugs that are dishwasher safe.\n\nSome popular brands that make durable and easy-to-clean coffee mugs include:\n\n* **Yeti**: Known for their durable and insulated stainless steel mugs.\n* **Zojila**: Offers a range of ceramic and stainless steel mugs that are easy to clean and durable.\n* **RTIC**: Makes affordable and durable stainless steel mugs that are easy to clean.\n* **Anker**: Offers a range of ceramic and silicone mugs that are easy to clean and affordable.\n\nDo you have any specific preferences for your new coffee mug (e.g., size, material, design)? I'd be happy to provide more tailored recommendations!",
