Here are some tips to help you fit in some exercise in the morning, even if you're not a morning person:\n\n1. **Start with a manageable duration**: Begin with a short, achievable exercise session, like 10-15 minutes. This will help you build confidence and make it easier to commit to a morning routine.\n2. **Choose a low-intensity activity**: Opt for a gentle, low-impact exercise that doesn't require a lot of energy or motivation. Examples include:\n\t* Light stretching or yoga\n\t* Short walks or gentle jogging in place\n\t* Bodyweight exercises (e.g., push-ups, squats, lunges)\n\t* Gentle cycling or using a stationary bike\n3. **Schedule it immediately after waking up**: Try to exercise as soon as you wake up, before checking your phone or getting bogged down in morning routines. This will help you establish a consistent habit and make exercise a non-negotiable part of your morning.\n4. **Find an exercise you enjoy**: Pick an activity that brings you joy or relaxation, making it easier to stick to your routine. If you hate running, don't force yourself to do it. Instead, try something that makes you feel good, like yoga or dancing.\n5. **Make it convenient**: Eliminate excuses by preparing everything you need the night before. Lay out your exercise clothes, prep your breakfast, and have your exercise equipment ready to go.\n6. **Gradually increase intensity and duration**: As you become more comfortable with your morning exercise routine, you can gradually increase the intensity and duration. Start with small increments (e.g., 5-10 minutes) and adjust as needed.\n7. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to have off days. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Instead, focus on getting back on track as soon as possible.\n8. **Use positive self-talk**: Encourage yourself with positive affirmations, such as \"I can do this\" or \"I'm taking care of my body.\" This will help you build motivation and make exercise a more enjoyable experience.\n9. **Get some accountability**: Share your exercise goals with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can provide an added motivation to stick to your routine.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your small victories, even if it's just a 10-minute stretching session. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue your morning exercise routine.\n\nSome examples of short, gentle morning exercises include:\n\n* 10-minute yoga routine ( YouTube has plenty of videos to follow)\n* 10-15 minutes of bodyweight exercises (e.g., 3 sets of 10 reps of push-ups, squats, and lunges)\n* 10-minute walk around the block or a short jog in place\n* 10-minute gentle cycling on a stationary bike or a short ride around the neighborhood\n\nRemember, the goal is to establish a consistent habit, not to exhaust yourself. Start small, be patient, and celebrate your progress.",
