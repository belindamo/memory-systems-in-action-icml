Congratulations on making a difference!\n\nI'd be happy to help you find upcoming charity walks or runs in your area. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location.

That way, I can provide you with more tailored suggestions.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few ways you can find charity walks or runs in your area:\n\n1. **Check online event calendars**: Websites like Active.com, Eventbrite, or CharityWalks.org often list charity walks and runs in various locations.\n2. **Search social media**: Follow local charities, running clubs, or community organizations on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
