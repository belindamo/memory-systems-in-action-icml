  "content": "A new coffee maker is a great addition to your kitchen renovation! I'm happy to help you find a good one that's easy to clean.\n\nFirst, I have to say that a leaking coffee maker can be a real nuisance, so it's great that you're looking to replace it. When it comes to ease of cleaning, there are a few features to look for in a coffee maker:\n\n1. **Removable parts**: Look for a coffee maker with removable parts like the water reservoir, brew basket, and grinds container. This makes it easy to wash and dry them separately.\n2. **Dishwasher-safe parts**: If possible, opt for a coffee maker with parts that are dishwasher safe. This can save you time and effort in the long run.\n3. **Smooth, flat surfaces**: A coffee maker with smooth, flat surfaces is easier to wipe down and clean than one with lots of nooks and crannies.\n4. **Descale indicator**: A descale indicator can alert you when it's time to descale your coffee maker, which can help prevent mineral buildup and make cleaning easier.\n\nBased on these criteria, here are some coffee maker recommendations that are easy to clean:\n\n1. **Breville BDC600**: This coffee maker has a sleek design and removable parts that are dishwasher safe. It also has a descale indicator and a smooth, flat surface that's easy to wipe down.\n2. **Cuisinart DCC-3200**: This coffee maker has a removable water reservoir and brew basket, making it easy to clean. It also has a dishwasher-safe grinds container and a smooth, flat surface.\n3. **Ninja Coffee Bar**: This coffee maker has a removable water reservoir and brew basket, as well as a dishwasher-safe grinds container. It also has a descale indicator and a sleek, modern design.\n4. **Keurig K-Elite**: If you prefer a single-serve coffee maker, the Keurig K-Elite is a great option. It has a removable water reservoir and a descale indicator, and its smooth, flat surface is easy to wipe down.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many other great coffee makers on the market that are easy to clean. Be sure to read reviews and do your research to find the one that best fits your needs and preferences.\n\nDo you have any specific features in mind for your new coffee maker (e.g., single-serve, programmable, thermal carafe)? I'd be happy to provide more tailored recommendations!",
