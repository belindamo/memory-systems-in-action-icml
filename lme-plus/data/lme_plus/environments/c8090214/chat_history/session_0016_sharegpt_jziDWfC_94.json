Live database, read-only.\n\nThis type of access allows the researcher to access the necessary data for their analysis without being able to make changes or modify the data in any way. It also ensures the integrity of the data and prevents accidental or intentional alteration. File system access and system administrator access would provide too much access and control, while shadow access only provides a replica of the data without the ability to interact with the original source."

She designs tests\nbased on what the software is supposed to do, according to the project requirements. One characteristic\nof this type of testing is:\na. It is a form of static testing.\nb. It is composed of code reviews and structural assessment.\nc. Testers generally do not have to have technical knowledge of the relevant programming\nlanguages.\nd. Tests usually involve small code fragments, such as a module or a class."

Testers generally do not have to have technical knowledge of the relevant programming languages.\n\nThis type of testing is called black box testing, where testers evaluate the software's functionality and behavior based on its input and output without knowledge of its internal workings. This type of testing focuses on the software's external behavior, and testers do not require knowledge of the programming language or the software's internal structure."

They are not responsible for maintaining passwords and access levels or setting up interfaces with other clinical systems, although they may help to attenuate security concerns by monitoring user activity and reporting suspicious behavior to system administrators."

      "content": "Answer: c. Mediation\n\nExplanation:\n\nMediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution where a neutral third party, called a mediator, helps the parties in a dispute reach a mutually acceptable agreement. The mediator's role is to facilitate communication and negotiation between the parties, but ultimately the decision-making power rests with the parties themselves. Unlike arbitration, where the arbitrator makes a decision that is binding on the parties, mediation results in a non-binding agreement that the parties can either accept or reject. Unlike litigation, where a judge or jury imposes a decision on the parties, mediation allows the parties to craft their own solution to the dispute. Therefore, mediation requires the least intervention from parties not involved in the conflict."

The other options listed - comprehensive auditing facility, updated medical knowledge repository, and usability testing - are all critical in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of CDS systems."
