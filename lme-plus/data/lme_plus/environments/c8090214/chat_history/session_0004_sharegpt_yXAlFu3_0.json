After some short break, we will need to find a restaurant for dinner, presumably with local Japanese foods, since this is our first time to Japan. Then we need to find place to see night views in Tokyo, ideally close to the hotel. After 5 days, we will depart Tokyo from Narita international airport again at 13:30. Please give me an itinerary, including how to get from the Narita airport to hotel and vice versa, what tourism attractions that we should visit, at what time should we eat which restaurant near the tourism attraction. We also want to shop in the Ginza Tokyo and Omotesand\u014d to buy some fashion apparels and accessories. Given it's the cherry blossom season in Tokyo, we also want to see those.
