Slacks. If I put the round red scarf thing\u2014I mean, \u201csnood\u201d on top of that and wore my red socks, my easy Hinami-style outfit would be complete. The black-and-white elements tied the whole thing together, but the splash of red at the top and bottom made me seem stylish enough that you\u2019d never guess I was a born-and-bred gamer. I\u2019d worn that very outfit on multiple occasions and personally experienced its effectiveness.\nBut\u2026\n\u201cThree times could be pushing it\u2026\u201d\nYeah. This outfit Hinami chose for me is my trump card for going out in street clothes in winter, and I\u2019ve played it eagerly every time I had a chance this winter break. If this was a Hydro Pump, I\u2019d have just two PP left.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her to think I have only one outfit\u2026\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t fun to imagine. I\u2019d seen Kikuchi-san twice over break so far, and both times, I\u2019d thrown down that trump card without hesitating. I might be able to get away with wearing the same clothes twice, but I bet even Kikuchi-san would have some questions if I wore them a third time.\nShe might even change her opinion about me. I could see her now, trying\n\nnot to hurt my feelings.\nIn my mind, she struggled to find the words, then finally said\u2014\n\nTomozaki-kun\u2026have you ever washed that?\n\n\u201cAhhhhhhh!!\u201d\nI leaped away from the mirror, stung by her imaginary voice. This time, it was just an emotional wound, but if Kikuchi-san said that to me in real life, I\u2019d instantaneously turn into a blade of grass or something. Considering that I\u2019d managed to advance from a completely unsophisticated nerd to a somewhat sophisticated nerd, it would suck if I turned into a plant and lost all that progress.\n\u201c\u2026So maybe this one, then?\u201d\nI put on the down jacket in my left hand. I\u2019d bought this without any help from Hinami.\nAfter wearing my \u201cmannequin clothes\u201d enough times, I\u2019d gotten both a logical and an instinctive sense for how they\u2019re different from what I used to wear before. Lately, I\u2019d also been looking at the outfits posted by stylish people on a fashion app that Hinami told me about, then trying to see what they all had in common.\nStrangely enough, that\u2019s allowed me to start seeing things that I used to filter out because I thought stylish people lived in another world\u2014and now I kinda have something resembling a personal preference.\nI mean, this down jacket is the first item of clothing I ever bought because I liked it. Well, to be more accurate, I actually stole the idea from an outfit I liked on that app. Come to think of it, it\u2019s basically the online version of buying the whole mannequin.\nKikuchi-san had never seen it before. Even if I wore it with the same slacks, the overall look should be different enough that she wouldn\u2019t think I had only one outfit.\nWithout giving it much thought, I put the down jacket on over the white sweater I\u2019d worn with the Chesterfield coat.\n\u201c\u2026Nice!\u201d\nThe white sleeves were sticking out from the sleeves of the jacket, which were surprisingly short given its bulky width. I\u2019d figured that with the pants,\n\nI\u2019d be all black, but the white at my wrists made for a nice contrast that seemed fairly intentional. Since the jacket\u2019s sleeves were so short, you\u2019d be able to see the sweater from behind, too.\n\u201cAha!\u201d\nSuddenly, inspiration struck, and I pulled off the red socks I\u2019d had on to match the snood and replaced them with a white pair.\nI checked myself in the mirror again. \u201c\u2026Oooh!\u201d\nThe reflection staring back at me had on a black down jacket, a white sweater, black slacks, and white socks, which ended up giving me a black- and-white stripe vibe. It would probably sound better if I knew a more style- savvy word than stripes, but I don\u2019t\u2014point is, I looked like one of those guys on the app.\n\u201cIt works!!\u201d I shouted, spinning around.\nI was excited about this kinda-almost-stylish version of myself in the mirror. If my mind wasn\u2019t playing tricks on me, I might have just discovered a new outfit.\nThen I realized something. I\u2019d always been either cribbing off the mannequin or basing off the ones that Hinami had designed for me\u2014which would make this my very first original outfit, right?\n\u201cYooooooooo!\u201d\nI was getting all wound up now as I struck various poses in the outfit I\u2019d created for myself. I was, again, taking inspiration from the app, since the models didn\u2019t usually take their pictures just standing there like a statue. I thought I looked pretty good, which got me even more excited.\n\u201cI did it!!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!!\u201d\nSuddenly, the door banged open.\nI froze in my model stance, face-to-face with my little sister, who was very annoyed.\n\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d \u201cUm\u2026\u201d\nShe looked extremely dubious\u2014scornful, even. I looked back at her, my weight still on my right foot and my right hand resting on my right shoulder. Uh.\nVery gradually, I unfolded myself and straightened my body. Slowly, ever\n\nso slowly. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t notice anything had happened.\nOnce I was standing upright again, I took a breath and said solemnly, \u201cSorry for being so loud.\u201d\n\u201cI saw you, y\u2019know.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d\nThe attempted cover-up was a bust, and my sister was having none of it. \u201c\u2026You\u2019re such a weirdo.\u201d\nWith that, she shut the door in my face. \u201cH-hey, wait\u2026!\u201d\nBut she didn\u2019t hear me, and I was left alone in my room. She was a year younger than me, but her words hit like a punch to the face.\n\u201cOof.\u201d\nI was dying of embarrassment\u2014but at the same time, the nuance of the word felt slightly different from when she\u2019d called me a weirdo in the past. The phrase when she\u2019d called me a weirdo in the past is very sad, but anyway, the point is that I noticed a difference.\nI used to feel powerless when she said that, or even a sense of failure, like I was lower than her\u2014I still did, a little\u2014but it wasn\u2019t as strong as before.\nI checked myself again in the mirror. \u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201d\nYeah, a few months ago, I couldn\u2019t have even imagined myself looking like this.\nMy hair, which I\u2019d styled this morning, was decently neat. The smile I\u2019d worked so hard to master was fairly natural. My newly invented outfit was pretty stylish.\nAll that gave me\u2014the character Fumiya Tomozaki, who\u2019s living this life\n\u2014a kind of confidence in my ability to raise my stats.\nAnd best of all\u2014I was on my way to meet someone I wanted to see in a place I wanted to go.\nI was familiar with this feeling; nanashi would never think he was a weak player just because he lost one game.\nThe results of the work I\u2019d put in bit by bit was showing on both the inside and the outside. That was my winrate in life, and getting caught in an embarrassing moment by my sister didn\u2019t make me a loser.\nAnd now I could see it myself.\nSo I stepped confidently in front of the mirror one more time.\n\nI struck a pose. The door banged open again. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it again? Weirdo.\u201d\nThe door slammed shut, and for the second time in several minutes, I was plunged into shame. Okay, this was different. Two times in a row was rough. Seriously, though, what\u2019s with her? At least knock. I dived onto my bed.\n\u201cGahhhhhhhh!!\u201d\nEven for me, being called a weirdo twice in five minutes sent my confidence right into the red. I buried my face in my pillow, hoping to purge some of the embarrassment by screaming it out. It was hopeless. I\u2019m an embarrassment to society.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nAt a few minutes to ten in the morning, I was standing in front of the Bean Tree sculpture at Omiya Station.\nIn my new outfit, I awaited her arrival.\nNormally, Omiya Station is packed with all kinds of people, from students and drunks to talent scouts and girls in crazy outfits. It has a kind of messy feeling. But today, everyone walking through the station seemed to share the same feeling\u2014probably because today was New Year\u2019s Day.\nEveryone had put down the baggage of the previous year and was getting ready to take in fresh experiences and emotions. We were all drawing a line between past and present and putting an end to certain intangible things in our lives. There was something ritualistic about it. Not exactly the most logical thing in the world, but I like the way this day of the year feels.\nIt\u2019s a chance to end some things neatly, to free up a little bit of your limited capacity so you have room for something special and new. Like when your inventory is full and you find mini medals\u2014 Okay, sorry, I know this is getting old, but comparing this stuff to games is just a habit of mine by now.\nI smiled wryly at myself, and then I noticed the person I\u2019d been waiting for was walking toward the ticket gate.\n\u201cTomozaki-kun.\u201d\nKikuchi-san walked toward me from the station\u2019s east exit, wearing a green coat. It was long and had a fancy-looking, slightly furry texture that suited her perfectly. I\u2019m fairly sure the fluffy sky-blue scarf she had on was a\n\nblend of wool and angel feathers. \u201cMorning, Kikuchi-san.\u201d \u201cGood morning.\u201d\nAfter our greeting, which hadn\u2019t changed one bit from before, she stepped alongside me. I loved how easy and natural that movement was. She wasn\u2019t unsure anymore whether she was in the right place.\n\u201cShould we get going?\u201d \u201cYes, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nWe set off, walking very close to each other\u2014which was a huge change from before.\n\nIt all started at the school festival; the play we put on as a class was the catalyst for me and Kikuchi-san to start dating.\nAs individuals, we were basically the same people, but our relationship had changed drastically. I was her first boyfriend, and she was my first girlfriend.\nWe walked down the stairs outside the east exit and cut in front of the bronze statue of Toto-chan the squirrel. A little boy was leaning over the banister next to the statue, battering Toto-chan with his hand warmer like it was a beanbag. He stared curiously at us. I can\u2019t see Kikuchi-san\u2019s holy aura anymore, but I bet for an innocent child, it\u2019s clear as could be. Kikuchi-san must have felt him looking at her, because she looked back and smiled quietly at him. He waved at us happily.\n\u201c\u2026He\u2019s so cute,\u201d she said, shifting her gentle gaze from him to me. She seemed to be enjoying the moment.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nYou\u2019re the cute one, I thought, but even the words were so corny that I told myself not to say them. Man, her priceless smile and those warm feelings are good omens for the year. They\u2019ve gotta be right up there with seeing the sunrise on January 1. This really is a happy New Year. No complaints.\nKikuchi-san waved daintily at the little boy, then continued past the front of the station with me. Hikawa Shrine, where we were headed, was actually closer to Kita-Omiya Station, but the route was simpler from Omiya. But really, I thought walking through the Omiya neighborhood together like this would give a different feel to a familiar place, so I chose that station as our\n\nmeeting spot.\nGood choice, I think.\nSomehow, the mood was lively and calm all at once. The time drifted by pleasantly, with no positive or negative expectations. It reminded me of when we went to see the fireworks. We were just walking along together, our hearts full of warmth.\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d We reached a corner, and Kikuchi-san seemed unsure where to go next.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this way.\u201d I pointed and kept walking calmly ahead. She smiled, reassured, and strolled alongside me like she was putting herself in my hands. She was dressed for the weather, and her breath as she spoke was a misty white.\n\u201cThink all these people are going to the shrine for their New Year\u2019s visit?\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d she said, giggling a little. \u201cHa-ha, yeah.\u201d\nThe crowd swelled more as we neared Hikawa Shrine. The flow of people naturally pushed us closer together, but I didn\u2019t totally freak out. The cold January air cooled my very slightly flushed cheeks.\nThe long road was paved with cement blocks. We passed rows of beauty salons and vintage shops until we came to the end of Ichinomiya Road and took the crosswalk. Then we passed under the shrine gate, looking at the big rocks on either side. We were now on the road leading to the main building at Hikawa Shrine, which was arrow straight and probably a few hundred meters long, with three paths running parallel between rows of trees. When you think about it, this lengthy, wide triple road that goes right through a residential neighborhood is fairly strange. I bet you wouldn\u2019t see it anywhere else.\nThe crowd was even thicker now that we were near the shrine, and Kikuchi-san and I were so close that our shoulders kept bumping. Suddenly, out of sight, my fingers brushed hers.\nBut it was fine. I mean, this was naturally what should happen between us\u2026right? Yeah, no.\n\u201c\u2026Oh!\u201d\n\u201cUh, s-sorry! Ah-ha-ha!\u201d\nOverreacting to Kikuchi-san\u2019s very quiet gasp of surprise, I withdrew my\n\nhand. Strange. We\u2019d full-on held hands during the school festival, but I guess now that we were back to everyday life, we weren\u2019t up to it."

You are considering two different options and are weighing the pros and cons of each one. You want to make a good impression and don't want to repeat the same outfit too many times. You also mention that you have been trying to improve your fashion sense by looking at outfits on a fashion app and trying to understand what makes them stylish. Ultimately, you decide on a down jacket with white sleeves and white socks to add some contrast to the black pants and jacket. You seem to be happy with your choice and feel that it is a good balance between being stylish and not repeating the same outfit too many times."
