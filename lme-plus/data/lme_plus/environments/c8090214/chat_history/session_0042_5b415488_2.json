      "content": "The Social is a fantastic spot for a casual celebration.\n\nEstimating the cost of food and drinks for 20-25 guests can vary depending on individual appetites and drink preferences. However, I can provide you with a rough estimate based on The Social's menu prices to give you an idea of what to expect.\n\n**Food:**\n\n* Appetizers (assuming 2-3 per person): $10-$15 per person x 20-25 guests = $200-$375\n* Entrees (assuming 1 per person): $15-$20 per person x 20-25 guests = $300-$500\n\nTotal food estimate: $500-$875\n\n**Drinks:**\n\n* Soft drinks and juice: $3-$5 per person x 20-25 guests = $60-$125\n* Beer and wine: $5-$7 per person x 20-25 guests = $100-$175\n* Cocktails: $8-$10 per person x 20-25 guests = $160-$250\n\nTotal drink estimate: $320-$550\n\n**Total estimate:**\n\nFood and drinks: $820-$1,425\n\nThis estimate should cover a good range of options for your guests, but feel free to adjust based on your group's preferences and drinking habits.\n\nTo stay within your budget of $500, you could consider the following:\n\n* Limit the number of entrees or opt for smaller plates to reduce food costs.\n* Offer a selection of appetizers and snacks instead of full entrees.\n* Choose lower-priced drink options, such as soft drinks and beer, or consider a limited drink selection.\n* Consider a happy hour or early evening celebration when prices might be lower.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the final cost may vary depending on your specific needs and preferences. I recommend contacting The Social directly to discuss your event and get a more accurate quote.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your celebration!"
