I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I couldn't have been present at a party or know the city where it took place.\n\nIf you could provide me with the actual city or location where you're looking for brunch spots, I'd be more than happy to help you with some recommendations!"

There are many cities with trendy bars and cafes, and \"downtown\" is a fairly generic term that could apply to any urban area.\n\nCould you please provide more specific information about the city you're looking for? For example, is it:\n\n* A specific city in the United States, such as New York City, Los Angeles, or Chicago?\n* A city in another country, such as Toronto, London, or Sydney?\n* A particular region or neighborhood, such as the West Village, Silverlake, or Shoreditch?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of the location, I'd be happy to provide you with some popular brunch spot recommendations!"
