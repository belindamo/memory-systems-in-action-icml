  "content": "Harlequin rasboras are an active, schooling fish that thrive in larger schools, so they do require a decent amount of space to swim and exercise.\n\n**Ideal Tank Size for Harlequin Rasboras:**\n\n* A minimum tank size of 29 gallons is recommended for a school of 6-10 harlequin rasboras. This will provide them with enough space to swim and exercise, and reduce territorial behavior.\n* A 20-gallon tank can be a bit small for a school of harlequin rasboras, especially if you're planning to keep them with other fish. They might feel cramped and stressed, which can lead to health issues and fin nipping.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to make some adjustments and provide a suitable environment, you can still keep a small school of harlequin rasboras in a 20-gallon tank.\n\n**Tips for Keeping Harlequin Rasboras in a 20-Gallon Tank:**\n\n* Keep a small school of 6-8 harlequin rasboras to reduce competition and territorial behavior.\n* Provide plenty of open swimming space by avoiding overcrowding and using plants or decorations to create hiding places and visual barriers.\n* Use a gentle water flow and avoid strong currents, as harlequin rasboras prefer calm waters.\n* Maintain a peaceful community by avoiding aggressive or fin-nipping fish.\n* Perform regular water changes (25-50% every 1-2 weeks) to maintain good water quality and reduce stress.\n\nIf you're willing to make these adjustments, you can still keep harlequin rasboras in a 20-gallon tank. However, keep in mind that a larger tank would be more ideal for these active, schooling fish.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and provide a larger environment for your fish to thrive.
