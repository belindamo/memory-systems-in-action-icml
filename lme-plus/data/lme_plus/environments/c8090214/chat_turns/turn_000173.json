  "content": "I think there may be some confusion here! The NBA playoffs typically don't have games starting at 10 am, as they usually take place in the evening. But I'm happy to help you with your fantasy basketball team nonetheless!\n\nChoosing the right players for your fantasy team can be a challenging but exciting task. Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Know your league's scoring system**: Understand how your league scores points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals, and other categories. This will help you prioritize players who excel in areas that are heavily weighted in your league.\n2. **Focus on consistent performers**: Target players who consistently produce solid numbers throughout the season, rather than those who have one or two big games and then fade away.\n3. **Injury concerns**: Be cautious when selecting players with a history of injuries or those who are currently nursing an injury. You don't want to waste a pick on someone who might miss significant time.\n4. **Team performance**: Consider the overall strength of a player's team and their role within that team. Players on strong teams with a good offense or defense tend to perform better.\n5. **Position scarcity**: Pay attention to the depth at each position in your league. For example, if there are few quality centers available, you may want to prioritize a reliable center over a flashy guard.\n6. **Upside and breakout candidates**: Identify players who are poised for a breakout season or have shown significant improvement in their game. These players can provide great value if they meet their potential.\n7. **ADP (Average Draft Position)**: Check the average draft position of players to ensure you're not reaching for someone too early or waiting too long to select a valuable player.\n8. **Depth and bench**: Don't forget to build a well-rounded roster with a strong bench. This will help you weather injuries and matchups that don't favor your starters.\n9. **Stay up-to-date with news and trends**: Follow NBA news, injuries, and trends to stay informed about the players you're considering.\n10. **Trust your instincts**: Ultimately, trust your own research and instincts. If you have a gut feeling about a player, don't be afraid to take a chance on them.\n\nAs for specific players, I'd be happy to provide recommendations based on your league's settings and your team's needs. Feel free to share more details about your league and the players you're considering, and I'll do my best to assist you!",
