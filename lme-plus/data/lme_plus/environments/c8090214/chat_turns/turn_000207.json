It's great that you're motivated to tackle it, and finding your old bike is a great reason to get started.\n\nBefore you begin, take a deep breath and remember that it's a process. Break it down into smaller tasks, and focus on one area at a time. You might want to start by:\n\n1. **Clearing the floor**: Get everything off the floor and sort items into categories (e.g., tools, sports equipment, storage bins).\n2. **Purging items**: Be ruthless \u2013 if you haven't used it in a year, it's probably safe to get rid of it. Consider donating or selling items that are still in good condition.\n3. **Organizing categories**: Once you've purged your items, organize them into logical groups. For example, you could have a section for tools, another for sports equipment, and so on.\n4. **Assigning a home**: Once you've organized your categories, assign a home for each item. This will make it easier to find things in the future and prevent clutter from building up again.\n5. **Installing storage solutions**: Consider investing in shelving, bins, or hooks to help keep items off the floor and organized.\n\nAs for your bike, it's great that you're motivated to get it tuned up! You might want to consider taking it to a local bike shop or watching some online tutorials to get it back in working order.\n\nRemember, decluttering and organizing can be a process, but it's worth it in the end. You'll feel a sense of accomplishment, and your garage (and bike) will thank you!\n\nHow's your bike tune-up going? Do you have any fun plans for when it's ready to ride again?",
