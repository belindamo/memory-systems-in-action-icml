  "content": "Fin nipping can be a real issue in community tanks!\n\nAdding new tankmates to distract fin-nippers can be a good strategy, but it's essential to choose species that are compatible with your existing fish and won't exacerbate the problem. Both harlequin rasboras and lemon tetras can be good choices, but let's consider a few factors before making a decision:\n\n**Harlequin Rasboras:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Schooling fish that can help distract fin-nippers\n\t+ Peaceful and gentle, won't harass your neon tetras\n\t+ Active swimmers that can add visual interest to the middle and top levels of the tank\n* Cons:\n\t+ Rasboras are a bit larger than neon tetras, so might compete for food\n\t+ They might not be as effective at distracting fin-nippers if they're not in a large enough school (6-10 individuals)\n\n**Lemon Tetras:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Small, peaceful fish that can be a good match for your neon tetras\n\t+ Schooling fish that can help distract fin-nippers\n\t+ Active swimmers that can add visual interest to the middle and top levels of the tank\n* Cons:\n\t+ Lemon tetras are also small and might be seen as a snack by your platies\n\t+ They have similar swimming patterns and habits to neon tetras, so might not be as effective at distracting fin-nippers\n\nConsidering your tank's current situation, I would recommend the harlequin rasboras. They're a bit larger and more active than lemon tetras, which might make them more effective at distracting your platies. Additionally, rasboras are generally more tolerant of changes in water conditions and are easy to care for.\n\nHowever, before adding new fish, make sure to:\n\n1. **Address the root cause**: Fin nipping can be caused by stress, boredom, or overcrowding. Ensure your tank is not overcrowded, and provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers for your fish.\n2. **Monitor your platies' behavior**: Observe your platies' behavior and try to identify any triggers for their fin nipping. Are they competing for food or resources? Are they stressed or bored?\n3. **Provide plenty of food**: Make sure your fish are well-fed and not competing for food. You can try feeding them more frequently or adding more hiding places to reduce competition.\n4. **Introduce the new fish slowly and in small groups**: When introducing the new fish, do it slowly and in small groups to avoid stressing your existing fish.\n\nYour new plants, java moss and hornwort, will help create a more natural environment and provide hiding places for your fish. Just remember to keep an eye on the plants' growth and trim them regularly to maintain good water circulation and visibility.\n\nGood luck, and I hope this helps!",
