  "content": "That's fine too, it's important that you feel comfortable with the direction of your story. Having Chris and Anna grow uneasy with Edgar and Rachel's bubbly personalities and their weird fascination with Indy can also create conflicts and tension in the story. It can also serve as a mirror for the main characters, making them question their own behavior and how they are coping with their grief.\n\nYou could explore how Chris and Anna's discomfort with Edgar and Rachel's behavior can lead to a falling out, and how this falling out can lead to a climax where the young couple tries to leave the bed and breakfast. This conflict can be a turning point for the main characters and make them realize that they need to confront their grief and move on with their lives.\n\nIt's also important to remember that the story's primary focus should be the main characters, their struggles and their growth. The conflicts and tensions that arise from their interactions with other characters should be used to serve that main focus and help the main characters to progress in their journey.",
