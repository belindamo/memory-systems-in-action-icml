  "content": "Answer: c. Mediation\n\nExplanation:\n\nMediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution where a neutral third party, called a mediator, helps the parties in a dispute reach a mutually acceptable agreement. The mediator's role is to facilitate communication and negotiation between the parties, but ultimately the decision-making power rests with the parties themselves. Unlike arbitration, where the arbitrator makes a decision that is binding on the parties, mediation results in a non-binding agreement that the parties can either accept or reject. Unlike litigation, where a judge or jury imposes a decision on the parties, mediation allows the parties to craft their own solution to the dispute. Therefore, mediation requires the least intervention from parties not involved in the conflict.",
