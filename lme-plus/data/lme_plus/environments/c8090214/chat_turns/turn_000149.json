  "content": "This problem requires the use of Bayes' theorem. Let's assume we have 1000 people in the population, and 10% of them have lupus, which means 100 people have lupus.\n\nOf these 100 people with lupus, the test will correctly identify 90% of them as positive, so 90 people will test positive.\n\nOf the 900 people without lupus, the test will incorrectly identify 10% of them as positive, which means 90 people without lupus will test positive.\n\nTherefore, out of the 180 people who test positive (90 true positives + 90 false positives), only 90 actually have lupus.\n\nSo the approximate likelihood that a patient with a positive test result has lupus is 90/180 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is c. 50%.",
