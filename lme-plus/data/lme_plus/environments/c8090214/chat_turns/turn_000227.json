By the way, I've been thinking about my own experiences with TV shows and movies lately. I recently watched the play \"Hamilton\" on Disney+ and loved it, and before that, I binge-watched all six seasons of Schitt's Creek on Netflix in two weeks. It's been a great few weeks for media consumption! Do you think Ted Lasso would be a good fit for someone who enjoys musicals and TV shows with great characters?",
