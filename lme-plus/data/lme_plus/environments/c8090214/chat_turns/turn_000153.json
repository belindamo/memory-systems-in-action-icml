  "content": "The relative risk reduction (RRR) can be calculated as follows:\n\nRRR = (risk in the control group - risk in the treatment group) / risk in the control group\n\nThe risk of palpitations in the control group is 6/10 = 0.6, and the risk in the treatment group is 5/10 = 0.5. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\nRRR = (0.6 - 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.17 or 17%\n\nTherefore, the relative risk reduction associated with the therapy is 17%. Answer: (b)",
