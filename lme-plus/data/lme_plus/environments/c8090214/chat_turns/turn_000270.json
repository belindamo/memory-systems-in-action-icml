  "content": "Marriage and civil unions are similar in many ways, as they both provide legal recognition and rights to couples in a committed relationship. However, there are some key differences between the two.\n\nMarriage is a legally recognized union between two people, typically recognized at the federal level in the United States and most other countries. Marriage grants couples a wide range of legal rights and benefits, including inheritance rights, tax benefits, and the ability to make medical decisions for one another. Marriage can be performed by a religious official or by a government official.\n\nA civil union, on the other hand, is a legally recognized relationship that grants couples some, but not all, of the rights and benefits of marriage. Civil unions are typically created at the state level and are not recognized by the federal government. Civil unions may not provide the same level of legal rights as marriage, such as Social Security benefits, immigration rights, or the ability to file joint tax returns.\n\nIt's also important to note that while some states or countries may offer civil unions as an alternative to marriage for same-sex couples, others may only offer civil unions and not allow same-sex marriage.",
