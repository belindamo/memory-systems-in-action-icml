  "content": "I'm glad you liked those ideas!\n\nRegarding a restaurant or bar for your celebration, I'd be happy to help. However, I need a bit more information from you. Could you please provide me with the city or location where you're planning to host the party? That way, I can give you some personalized recommendations.\n\nIf you're open to it, you can also consider the following factors to narrow down your options:\n\n1. **Cuisine**: Do you have a preferred type of cuisine or dietary restrictions in mind?\n2. **Ambiance**: Are you looking for a formal, upscale setting or a more casual, relaxed atmosphere?\n3. **Budget**: Are you looking to splurge or keep costs relatively low?\n4. **Location**: Is there a specific area of the city you'd prefer, such as downtown or a trendy neighborhood?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your preferences, I can suggest some suitable options for you.\n\n(And, by the way, it's great that you're planning to invite your CEO, Emma, to the celebration!)",
