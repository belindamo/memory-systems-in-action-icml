The person making wudhu should face the qiblah and sit on an elevated place so that the water does not splash on him.\n\n2. When commencing wudhu, Bismillahir Rahm\u00e2nir Raheem should be recited.\n\n3. First of all, the hands should be washed up to the wrists three times.\n\n4. Thereafter, rinse the mouth three times and use a misw\u00e2k.\n\n38\n\n5. If there is no misw\u00e2k, a thick cloth or even the fore-finger could be used so that all the dirt is removed.\n\n6. If the person is not fasting, he should gargle the mouth thoroughly. However, if he is fasting, he should not gargle thoroughly because there is a possibility that water will go down the throat.\n\n7. Thereafter, rinse the nose three times and clean it with the left hand. However, the fasting person should not allow the water to go beyond the soft-bone of the nose.\n\n8. Wash the face three times: from the hair-line till below the chin, and from one ear-lobe to the other. Water must reach all these places. Water must also reach below the eye brows - no place should remain dry.\n\n9. Wash the right hand up to and including the elbows.\n\n10. Thereafter wash the left hand up to and including the elbows.\n\n11. Make khil\u00e2l of the fingers. That is, pass the fingers of one hand through the fingers of the other hand.\n\n12. If there is a ring or any such jewellery on the fingers, it should be removed so that no part is left dry.\n\n13. Thereafter make masah of the head (passing wet hands over the head).\n\n14. Make masah of the ears by inserting the forefingers into the ears and making masah of the back of the ear-lobes with the thumb of each hand.\n\n15. Make masah of the neck with the back of the fingers of both hands. However, masah of the fore-neck/throat should not be made as this is prohibited.\n\n16. Fresh water need not be used for making masah of the ears. Whatever water is left over after making masah of the head will be sufficient.\n\n17. Thereafter wash the right foot up to and including the ankles. Do the same for the left foot.\n\nMake khil\u00e2l of the toes of the feet with the little finger of the left hand. When making khil\u00e2l, commence with the little toe of the right foot and end with the little toe of the left foot.\n\nThis is the correct method of performing wudhu. However, there are certain acts, which if even a part is left out or not completed, then the wudhu will be regarded as incomplete. In fact, it will be as if wudhu was not performed at all. Such acts are called fardh. There are other acts, which if left out, the wudhu will be regarded as complete. Carrying out these acts will entail reward (thaw\u00e2b) and these have been emphasised in the Shariah. It is a sin to leave out such acts unnecessarily. Such acts are called Sunnats. There are other acts, which if carried out entail reward, and if left out, entail no sin. Neither have they been emphasised in the Shariah. Such acts are called mustahab.\n\nFardh (compulsory) acts of wudhu\n\nThere are four fardh acts in wudhu:-\n\n1. To wash the entire face once.\n\n2. To wash both hands up to and including the elbows once.\n\n3. To make masah of one-quarter of the head once.\n\n4. To wash both feet up to and including the ankles once.\n\n39\n\nThese are the fardh acts of wudhu. Even if one of these acts is left out, or even if a place equal to a hair's breadth is left dry, wudhu will not be complete.\n\nSunnah acts of wudhu\n\n1. To say Bismillahir Rahm\u00e2nir Raheem.\n\n2. To wash both hands up to the wrists.\n\n3. To rinse the mouth.\n\n4. To wash the nose.\n\n5. To use misw\u00e2k.\n\n6. To make masah of the entire head.\n\n7. To wash each part three times.\n\n8. To make masah of the ears.\n\n9. To make khil\u00e2l of the fingers and toes.\n\nApart from this, the balance of the acts are mustahab.\n\n1. Once the four fardh acts of wudhu are carried out, wudhu will be regarded as complete, irrespective of whether one intended to make wudhu or not, eg.: (a) at the time of bathing, one pours water on the entire body, or (b) falls into a well, or river , or (c) stands in the rain. In all these conditions, if the limbs of wudhu get wet, wudhu will be regarded as complete.\n\nHowever, one will not obtain the reward (thaw\u00e2b) of wudhu.\n\n2. Sunnah is to make wudhu exactly as has been mentioned above. But if anyone alters or reverses the procedure of wudhu, eg. by washing the feet first, then making masah, and then washing the hands, and thereafter washing the face, or alters the procedure in any other way -\n\nthen wudhu will still be regarded as complete. However, it will not be considered to be in accordance with the sunnah, and there is always the fear of having sinned.\n\n3. Similarly, if the left hand or the left foot is washed first, wudhu will be completed, but it will be contrary to being mustahab.\n\n4. After washing one part, one should not delay in washing the next part to such an extent that the first part gets dry. Instead, he should wash the next part as quickly as possible. If, after washing the second part, the first part gets dry, then wudhu will be regarded as complete, but it will be contrary to the sunnah.\n\n5. It is also sunnah to pass the hand on the part that is being washed so that no place is left dry.\n\n6. It is better and mustahab to prepare for wudhu and sal\u00e2t well before the time.\n\n7. As long as there is no genuine excuse, one should perform wudhu with one's very own hands and should not seek assistance from someone else.\n\n8. While making wudhu, worldly talk should be avoided. Instead, Bismillah and the kalimah should be read on washing each and every part.\n\n9. No matter how freely water may be available, it should not be wasted. Even if one is at the sea-shore, one should not use more than necessary. At the same time, one should not use so little water that one has problems in washing the parts thoroughly.\n\n10. The parts should not be washed more than three times.\n\n40\n\n11. . When washing the face, water should not be splashed with great force, nor should one splash water by making hissing sounds.\n\n12. One should not close one's eyes and mouth very tightly. All these things are makruh and prohibited. The reason for this is that if the mouth and eyes are shut so tightly to the extent that the lips or eye lashes remain dry, then the wudhu will not be regarded as complete.\n\n13. If rings, bangles, bracelets, etc. are so loose that water will reach under them without having to remove them, it will still be mustahab to remove them. If they are so tight that there is a possibility of water not reaching under them, then it will be necessary and wajib to remove them. A similar rule applies to the nose ring: that is, if it is loose, then it will be mustahab to move it, and if it is tight, then while one is washing the face it will be wajib to move it around so that water reaches everywhere.\n\n14. If some dough or similar substance got stuck under the nails and got dried, and water did not reach there, the wudhu will not be complete. If one sees the flour and realizes that water did not reach there, then water should be poured over it. However, if sal\u00e2t was performed prior to pouring the water, it will be necessary to repeat the sal\u00e2t.\n\n15. If one has applied tinsel or some other decorative paint on the forehead and does not wash it thoroughly, but just pours water over it, then wudhu will not be completed. It should be removed before washing the face.\n\n16. After having performed the wudhu, Surah al-Qadr should be recited.\n\nThereafter the following dua should be recited:\n\n[\"O Allah! Make me of the repentants, and make me of the purified, and include me among Your pious servants.\"]\n\n17. After having performed the wudhu, it is preferable to read two rak\u00e2ts of nafl sal\u00e2t. This sal\u00e2t is called Tahiyyatul wudhu. Great reward and merit has been mentioned in the Hadith in regard to this sal\u00e2t.\n\n18. If one had made wudhu for a particular sal\u00e2t, and thereafter the next sal\u00e2t time entered without the wudhu having broken, then it will be permissible to read sal\u00e2t with that same wudhu.\n\nHowever, if the person repeats the wudhu, he will be greatly rewarded.\n\n19. Once wudhu has been made and has not broken as yet, then as long as no act of worship (ib\u00e2dat) has been performed with that wudhu, it will be makruh to make a new wudhu. Based on this, if a person makes wudhu while bathing, then he should read his sal\u00e2t with that same wudhu. Without that wudhu breaking, he should not make a new wudhu. However, if a person has read even just two rak\u00e2ts of sal\u00e2t with that first wudhu, then there will be no problem in making a second wudhu. In fact, there is reward in making a second wudhu.\n\n20. If someone's hands or feet are cracked and he filled them with wax, an ointment, or some other medicine (and he fears some harm by removing it) then his wudhu will be regarded as complete if he just poured water over it without having removed the medicine.\n\n21. If water did not reach the heels or some other place while making wudhu, and only after completing the wudhu one realized that a particular place is dry, it will not be sufficient to merely pass the hand over that place. Instead, water will have to be poured over it.\n\n22. If there is a sore or some other wound on the hands, feet, etc. and one fears that it would be harmful to pour water over it, then water should not be poured. Instead, the wet hand should 41\n\nbe passed over the wound. This is called masah. If this is harmful, masah should not be made and that place should be left out.\n\n23. If a wound has been bandaged and it will be harmful to open the bandage and make masah over the wound, or it will be difficult and painful to open the bandage, then in both cases it will be permissible to make masah on the bandage. But if this is not the case, the bandage will have to be removed and masah will have to be made on the wound.\n\n24. If the wound is not under the entire bandage, then after opening the bandage, that portion which is not wounded should be washed if possible. However, if it is not possible to open the bandage, masah should be made on both the portions- the wounded and the unwounded portions.\n\n25. In case of a fracture where splints and pads are applied, the above directions will apply. That is, as long as the splints cannot be opened, it will be sufficient to make masah over it. The same rule will apply to plasters - that is, if masah cannot be made on the wound, the plaster should be removed and masah should be made on the gauze. But if there is no one to help in opening and closing the plaster, then it will be sufficient to make masah on the plaster itself.\n\n26. In the case of bandages, splints, plasters, etc. it is preferable to make masah on the entire covering. If this is not possible, then it will be permissible to make masah on more than half of the covering. However, it is not permissible to suffice with masah on half or less of the covering.\n\n27. If after performing masah, the bandage, plaster, etc., opens up and one sees that the wound has not healed as yet, then it should be re-tied and the previous masah will suffice. However, if the wound has healed and there is no need to bandage it again, then the masah will be broken. That portion should be washed and sal\u00e2t performed. There is no need to repeat the entire wudhu.\n\n28. Khil\u00e2l [passing of wet fingers] of the beard should be made three times after having washed the face. Khil\u00e2l should not be made more than three times.\n\n29. It is fardh to wash the chin as long as there is no hair of the beard on it, or if there is, it is so little that the skin can be seen.\n\n30. It is fardh to wash that part of the lips which can be seen after the lips are closed.\n\n31. If the hair of the beard, moustache and eyebrows is so thick that the skin cannot be seen, then it is not fardh to wash that skin which is hidden. That hair is actually in place of the skin. To pour water over it is sufficient.\n\n32. If the hair of the eyebrows, beard, or moustache is so thick that the skin cannot be seen, then in such a case it is wajib to wash that hair which falls within the boundaries of the face. It is not wajib to wash the hair that is beyond the boundaries of the face.\n\n33. If a person's piles come out, his wudhu will break irrespective of whether it went back inside on its own, or by pushing it back with a stick, a cloth, or his hand.\n\n34. If semen comes out without any desire, wudhu will break. For example, a person carried a very heavy weight, or jumped from an elevated place and due to this shock semen came out without any desire.\n\n35. If there is some defect in one's senses, but this defect does not reach the stage of insanity or unconsciousness, his wudhu will not break.\n\n36. If a person sleeps away and laughs (in his sleep) while in sal\u00e2t, his wudhu will not break.\n\n37. By laughing in a janaza sal\u00e2t or in a sajdah til\u00e2wat wudhu will not break irrespective of whether the person is mature or immature.",
