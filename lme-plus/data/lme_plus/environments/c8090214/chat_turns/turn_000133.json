  "content": "The sources and estimates used to determine the number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust come from various historical records, documentation, and research by scholars and historians.\n\nOne of the most important sources is the extensive documentation kept by the Nazi regime itself, including administrative records, transport lists, and other official documents that provide information about the number of Jews who were deported to concentration and extermination camps. Other sources include eyewitness testimony from survivors, memoirs, diaries, and other first-hand accounts from people who lived through the Holocaust.\n\nIn addition to these primary sources, historians and researchers have also used statistical and demographic methods to estimate the number of Jewish victims. For example, they have used pre-war population figures, census data, and other demographic information to estimate the number of Jews living in Europe before the Holocaust and compare it to post-war estimates. They have also used a variety of other sources and methods to estimate the number of Jews who were killed in non-camp settings or in areas where documentation is scarce.\n\nOverall, the figure of six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust is widely accepted by scholars and historians based on a broad range of sources and estimates.",
