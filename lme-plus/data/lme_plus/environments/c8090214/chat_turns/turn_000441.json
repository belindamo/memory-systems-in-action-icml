  "content": "Sure, here are the key points of the optimal solution discussed by the stakeholders in a table format with bulleted points:\n\n| Key Points |\n| --- |\n| Noise complaints should be directed to the local council. |\n| The council should investigate the noise and provide guidance to the neighbors on how to resolve the issue. |\n| The landlord should be involved in the resolution process and encourage tenants to work together to resolve the issue. |\n| The Nurse at No. 10 should be informed of the situation and advised to speak with the patient and their family about the noise level. |\n| The ASB Officer should be involved in the resolution process and mediate discussions between the neighbors. |\n| A community mediator should be engaged to facilitate discussions between the neighbors and help them reach a mutually agreeable solution. |\n| The neighbors should work together to come up with a solution that is fair to both parties. Possible solutions may include setting noise boundaries, changing the location of the patient's room, or soundproofing the floor. |\n| If a solution cannot be reached, legal action may need to be taken. A lawyer specializing in neighbor disputes should be consulted to provide legal guidance. |\n| The police should be involved if the noise becomes a public disturbance or if there is a threat to the safety of the neighbors. |\n\nNote: These key points are based on the discussion and may not be a complete list of all possible solutions.",
