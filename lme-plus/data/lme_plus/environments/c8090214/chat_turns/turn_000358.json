  "content": "I cannot have personal opinions, but i can provide some insight on this viewpoint. the study of pure mathematics, like the pursuit of a solution to fermat's last theorem, is not wasteful or pointless, despite the lack of apparent practical applications.\n\nthe pursuit of pure knowledge can have value in and of itself, as it fosters critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving skills, and intellectual curiosity. mathematical research often leads to the development of new concepts, techniques, and technologies, benefiting society in ways that are not always immediately apparent.\n\nfurthermore, mathematicians and scientists have often found that seemingly abstract or theoretical discoveries have eventually led to practical benefits, sometimes many years or even centuries later. for example, discoveries in abstract algebra led to the development of modern cryptography, which benefits society in numerous ways.\n\nfinally, the pursuit of pure mathematics can contribute to a broader cultural and intellectual heritage, fostering an appreciation for the beauty and elegance of mathematical thought, and contributing to human knowledge as a whole, which is a goal that extends beyond the immediate practical concerns of everyday life.",
