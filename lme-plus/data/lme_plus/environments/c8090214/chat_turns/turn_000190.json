  "content": "I'm particularly interested in conceptual photography, especially after seeing some of the works on display at the \"Women in Art\" exhibition at the Modern Art Museum. I was drawn to Frida Kahlo's artwork, and I remember taking a photo of my favorite piece, \"The Broken Column\", to share on social media. Can you recommend some conceptual photographers or projects that explore themes of identity, femininity, and the human condition?",
