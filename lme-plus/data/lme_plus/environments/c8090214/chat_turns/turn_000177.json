  "content": "Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert are both fantastic players who can be cornerstone pieces for your fantasy team.\n\nAs for the TV schedule, the NBA typically releases its broadcast schedule in late summer or early fall, just before the start of the regular season. The schedule usually includes a mix of national TV games on networks like ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV, as well as local broadcasts on regional sports networks.\n\nHowever, I have some bad news: the NBA playoffs are already over, and the new season hasn't started yet. The playoffs usually take place in April, May, and June, and the regular season typically runs from October to April. So, you won't be able to watch any NBA games, including playoff games, until the new season begins.\n\nBut don't worry! You can stay up-to-date with the latest news, rumors, and analysis on NBA websites, social media, and fantasy sports platforms. These resources will help you prepare for the upcoming season and stay informed about your fantasy players' performances.\n\nIn the meantime, you can focus on preparing for your fantasy draft and setting your lineup for the upcoming season. Make sure to stay active on your fantasy platform, and adjust your roster as needed based on player injuries, trades, and other developments.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to stay flexible and adapt to changes throughout the season. Good luck with your fantasy team, and I hope you have a successful season!",
