  "content": "All of the options listed are important in promoting safety of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems. However, if one has to be chosen as the least important, it would be downtime procedures. While downtime procedures are important in ensuring that CDS systems can be restored in case of a system failure or unexpected downtime, they do not directly contribute to the safety of the system when it is operational.
