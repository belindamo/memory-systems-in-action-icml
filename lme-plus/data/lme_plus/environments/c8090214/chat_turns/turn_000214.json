  "content": "Yes, that could work well. Having the secret have something to do with Indy, their daughter, could add depth and complexity to the story and create an emotional connection between the characters. Here are a few examples of how Indy could be related to the secret that Chris and Anna are hiding:\n\n* Indy is not their biological child, and they are afraid of losing her or someone finding out. This secret could be the reason why they are so protective of her and why they are so uncomfortable around Edgar and Rachel, who have lost their own daughter.\n* Indy is immune to the zombie, and they are hiding this information from others. They fear that if someone else knows this, they will take her away from them.\n* Indy has a medical condition that makes her more vulnerable to the zombies, and they are hiding this information to protect her.\n* Indy is the only surviving member of their family, and they are afraid of losing her, this can be the reason why they become overprotective and paranoid about her safety, and this could put them in conflict with Edgar and Rachel.\n* They have had to do some terrible things to survive, and they are afraid that if someone finds out, they will be rejected or worse. This could be a reason why they are always in a hurry to leave and why they are unwilling to share their resources, especially with Indy.\n\nIn any case, having the secret be related to Indy will give the story more emotional depth and create a stronger connection between the characters, as well as conflicts and tensions that will drive the story forward.",
