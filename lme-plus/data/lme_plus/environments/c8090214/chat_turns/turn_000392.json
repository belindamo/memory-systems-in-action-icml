It's best to check directly with the museum's website or contact them to find out what exhibitions are currently on display. However, the State Art Museum of Novosibirsk has a permanent collection of more than 12,000 works, so even if there are no special exhibitions on display, you will still be able to enjoy a large and impressive collection of art. Enjoy your visit!",
