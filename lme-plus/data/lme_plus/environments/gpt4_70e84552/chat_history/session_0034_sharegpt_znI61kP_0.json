It's a simple act that can help us stay healthy and prevent the spread of germs and diseases.\n\n[Cut to a shot of someone washing their hands under running water]\n\nHost (voiceover): So, let's start with the basics. When should we wash our hands?\n\n[Cut back to the host]\n\nHost: You should wash your hands:\n\n* After using the bathroom\n* Before and after preparing food\n* After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing\n* After touching animals, their food or waste\n* After touching garbage\n* After touching something that may have germs on it\n* And of course, after being in contact with someone who is sick.\n\n[Cut to a shot of soap and water]\n\nHost (voiceover): Now that we know when to wash our hands, let's talk about how to wash them properly.\n\n[Cut back to the host]\n\nHost: First, wet your hands with warm water. Then, apply enough soap to cover your hands. Rub your hands together to create a lather, making sure to get the soap in between your fingers, under your nails, and on the backs of your hands. Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice to help you remember.\n\n[Cut to a shot of running water]\n\nHost (voiceover): Next, rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.\n\n[Cut back to the host]\n\nHost: Finally, dry your hands completely with a clean towel or air dryer.\n\n[Cut to a shot of clean, dry hands]\n\nHost (voiceover): And that's it! Simple, right?\n\n[Cut back to the host]\n\nHost: Handwashing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs and diseases. By washing our hands regularly and properly, we can keep ourselves and our loved ones healthy.\n\n[Outro music plays and the host appears on screen with a friendly smile]\n\nHost: Thanks for watching!
