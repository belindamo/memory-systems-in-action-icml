A fun design or quirky quote can add a playful touch to your overall look.\n\nA bright colored graphic tee can work well with the distressed denim jeans and the gold necklace, but it depends on the specific design and color of the tee. Here are a few tips to consider:\n\n1. **Choose a bold, yet not overwhelming design**: A simple, bold graphic or a quirky quote can add a fun touch to your outfit. Avoid tees with too many colors or busy designs, as they might clash with the distressed denim jeans.\n2. **Consider a tee with a lighter color background**: A light-colored background will help the gold necklace stand out and create a nice contrast with the darker denim jeans.\n3. **Balance the look with neutral accessories**: Since the graphic tee will be the focal point of your outfit, keep the rest of your accessories simple and neutral. A pair of white sneakers or sandals, and a simple clutch or crossbody bag will complete the look.\n\nSome color options that might work well with the distressed denim jeans and gold necklace include:\n\n* **Bright Coral**: A bright coral graphic tee will add a fun and playful touch to your outfit. The warm tone of the coral will complement the gold necklace nicely.\n* **Mint Green**: A mint green graphic tee will add a fresh and youthful vibe to your outfit. The soft, pastel tone will create a nice contrast with the distressed denim jeans.\n* **Yellow**: A bright yellow graphic tee will add a bold and cheerful touch to your outfit. The warm tone of the yellow will complement the gold necklace nicely.\n\nSome fun design ideas for a graphic tee include:\n\n* A simple, bold logo or graphic\n* A quirky quote or phrase\n* A fun illustration, like a cartoon character or a minimalist design\n* A playful take on a classic design, like a distressed or vintage-inspired graphic\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and express your personal style!

Speaking of which, I got a bunch of new dresses and tops from them about two weeks ago, including a really cute flowy maxi dress that I wore to brunch last weekend.

      "content": "ASOS is a great choice! Their shipping is indeed super fast, and they have a wonderful selection of clothing.\n\nNow, let's get back to the graphic tee dilemma! Both bright yellow and coral would look great with the distressed denim jeans and gold necklace, but it ultimately depends on your personal style and the overall vibe you're going for.\n\n**Bright Yellow:**\n\n* A bright yellow graphic tee would add a bold and cheerful touch to your outfit.\n* It would create a nice contrast with the cool tone of the gold necklace and the distressed denim jeans.\n* If you want to make a statement and stand out, bright yellow might be the way to go!\n\n**Coral:**\n\n* A coral graphic tee would add a warm and playful touch to your outfit.\n* It would complement the gold necklace nicely, as both colors have a warm, sunny tone.\n* Coral is a bit more subtle than bright yellow, so it might be a good choice if you want to add some color to your outfit without going too bold.\n\nConsider your skin tone, hair color, and personal style when making your decision. If you have a cool skin tone (pale with pink undertones), bright yellow might look great on you. If you have a warm skin tone (olive or golden), coral might be a better choice.\n\nYou could also think about the overall vibe you want to create with your outfit. If you want to feel bright and cheerful, go for the yellow. If you want to feel playful and feminine, coral might be the way to go.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you and your personal style! You could even try pairing both options with the distressed denim jeans and gold necklace to see which one you like better."
