      "content": "B. Air Handling Unit (AHU)\n\n1. The two possible heat exchangers that can be used in the AHU are:\n* Plate heat exchanger: This type of heat exchanger uses a series of thin plates to separate the two fluids and provide a large surface area for heat transfer.\n* Spiral heat exchanger: This type of heat exchanger uses a spiral-shaped tube to separate the two fluids and provide a large surface area for heat transfer.\n\nIf the chilled water supply (CWS) is fixed at 100 liters per minute, the profile on the variations of the chilled water return (CWR) and exit air temperatures of both heat exchangers when the air flow rate is constant at 1000 liters per minute and the inlet air temperature to the heat exchanger varies between 20oC to 30oC can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394T1 = (T1 - T2) / (1 + (U x A x NTU))\n\nwhere \u0394T1 is the temperature change of the chilled water return, T1 is the chilled water supply temperature, T2 is the chilled water return temperature, U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, A is the heat transfer area, and NTU is the number of transfer units.\n\nThe maximum limit of the NTU for all selected heat exchangers is 3.\n\nThe effect of heat exchanger types to the exit air temperature that is to be returned to the lecture halls is that the Plate heat exchanger will provide a lower temperature change of the chilled water return and exit air temperature than the Spiral heat exchanger.\n\n2. For the better heat exchanger in the case above, the temperature change to the exit air temperature will be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394T2 = \u0394T1 x Cp x m\n\nwhere \u0394T2 is the temperature change of the exit air, Cp is the specific heat capacity of air, and m is the mass flow rate of air. The temperature change to the exit air temperature is directly proportional to the CWS temperature increase, if the CWS temperature increases by 1oC and the other parameters remains constant, the temperature change to the exit air temperature will also increase by 1oC."

      "content": "C. Chiller System\n\n1. Two working refrigerants that can be used for the chiller system are R410A and R407C. R410A is a blend of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and has a higher cooling capacity and a lower pressure than R134a. R407C is a blend of HFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and is similar to R22 in terms of thermodynamic properties, but it has a lower global warming potential. Both refrigerants are considered safe and have been widely used in air-conditioning and refrigeration systems.\n2. If the refrigerant exits the evaporator as saturated vapor, the suitable operating pressures for the chiller can be determined using the pressure-enthalpy diagram for the refrigerant. The low-pressure side of the chiller, which is the evaporator, should operate at a pressure that is below the saturation pressure at the desired chilled water temperature (2oC) for R410A, and the high-pressure side of the chiller, which is the condenser, should operate at a pressure that is above the saturation pressure at the cooling water temperature (26oC) for R410A.\n\nFor R407C, the low-pressure side of the chiller, which is the evaporator, should operate at a pressure that is below the saturation pressure at the desired chilled water temperature (2oC) and the high-pressure side of the chiller, which is the condenser, should operate at a pressure that is above the saturation pressure at the cooling water temperature (26oC)\n\nThe COP (coefficient of performance) of the chiller system can be calculated using the formula:\n\nCOP = (Qc / Wc)\n\nwhere Qc is the cooling capacity and Wc is the compressor work input. A higher COP indicates a more efficient system. Comparing the COP of the chiller system for both coolants assuming a compressor efficiency of 90% would indicate that R410A would have a higher COP than R407C\n\n3. The estimated cost for running the chiller system for a 30 days, 24 hour operation schedule can be calculated by multiplying the compressor work input by the electrical cost for the specific coolant used. The cost for R410A would be higher than the cost for R407C based on the compressor work input, because R410A has a higher compressor work input. The cost calculation should be done according to the Malaysian daylight electrical tariff."

Wet Cooling Tower\nThe wet cooling tower supplies cooling water to the condenser of the chiller system at a rate of 200\nliters/min. The cooling water absorbs the thermal load from the condenser and returns to the cooling\ntower at 34oC. Air enters the cooling tower at 1 atm and 28oC and leaves saturated at 34oC.\n1. Plot the variations in cooling water supply temperature to the condenser and the heat\nabsorption rate at the condenser when the relative humidity of the inlet air varies from 50%\nto 100%RH. Assume the air flow rate is constant at 60 liters per minute. (CO3)\n2. Explain the reasons why cooling towers are a necessary sub-system in district cooling airconditioning systems. (CO1)"

      "content": "D. Wet Cooling Tower\n\n1. The variations in cooling water supply temperature to the condenser and the heat absorption rate at the condenser can be plotted using the following equations:\n\nCooling water supply temperature (Tcw):\nTcw = Tcw\\_inlet + Q / (m\\_cw x Cp\\_cw)\n\nHeat absorption rate (Q):\nQ = m\\_cw x Cp\\_cw x (Tcw\\_outlet - Tcw\\_inlet)\n\nWhere Tcw\\_inlet is the inlet cooling water temperature, Tcw\\_outlet is the outlet cooling water temperature, Q is the heat absorption rate, m\\_cw is the mass flow rate of cooling water, and Cp\\_cw is the specific heat capacity of cooling water.\n\nThe relative humidity of the inlet air can be used to calculate the wet-bulb temperature, which is a measure of the amount of moisture in the air. The wet-bulb temperature can then be used to calculate the heat absorbed by the cooling water in the tower. As the relative humidity of the inlet air increases, the wet-bulb temperature will also increase, resulting in an increase in the heat absorbed by the cooling water and a decrease in the cooling water supply temperature to the condenser.\n\n2. Cooling towers are a necessary sub-system in district cooling air-conditioning systems because they help to remove the heat that is rejected by the condenser. The condenser in the chiller system rejects heat to the cooling water, which is then circulated through the cooling tower. The cooling tower uses evaporation to remove the heat from the cooling water. This process cools the water, so it can be recirculated back to the condenser to absorb more heat. Cooling towers are also used to control the temperature and chemistry of the recirculated water to prevent corrosion and scaling in the system."
