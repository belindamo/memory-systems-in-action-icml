On my last trip to visit my family for Easter, I realized I overpacked and only ended up wearing half of the clothes I brought. I packed 10 shirts, 7 pairs of pants, and 5 dresses, but only wore 3 of the shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 2 dresses."

So, why not pack accordingly?\n\nConsidering your previous experience, I'd recommend paring down your clothing items even further. Here's a revised list:\n\n**Clothing:**\n\n* 2-3 tops or blouses (pick your absolute favorites that can be mixed and matched)\n* 2 pairs of pants or shorts (choose versatile, comfortable options that can be dressed up or down)\n* 1 dress or skirt (optional, but a great option for a casual dinner or sightseeing)\n* 1 light jacket or sweater (for cooler mornings and evenings)\n\nRemember, you can always do a quick load of laundry or find a laundry service if needed. And, if you're staying in a hotel, they often provide laundry facilities or can recommend a nearby service.\n\nBy packing fewer clothes, you'll:\n\n* Save space in your luggage\n* Reduce decision fatigue when getting dressed\n* Avoid overpacking and lugging around unnecessary items\n* Focus on the essentials and enjoy your trip more\n\nOf course, if you're still unsure, you can always pack a few extra undergarments and socks, just in case. But try to resist the urge to overpack, and see how it goes!\n\nHow does this revised list sound to you?"
