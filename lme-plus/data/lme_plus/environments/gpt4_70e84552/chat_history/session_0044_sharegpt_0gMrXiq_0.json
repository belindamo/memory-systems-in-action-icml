      "content": "Yes, pet foods require pre-market authorization in Europe before they can be sold to consumers. This is a requirement under Regulation (EC) No. 767/2009 on the placing on the market and use of feed.\n\nPet food manufacturers must submit an application for authorization of their products to the competent authority in the EU member state where they intend to market the product. The application must include information about the product's composition, labeling, and intended use, as well as data demonstrating that the product is safe and nutritious for the target species.\n\nThe competent authority will review the application and may request additional information or testing before granting or denying authorization. Once a product is authorized, it can be marketed and sold throughout the EU.\n\nIn addition to pre-market authorization, pet food manufacturers in Europe must also comply with ongoing requirements for labeling, traceability, and safety. These requirements are enforced by national authorities and can include inspections of manufacturing facilities and product samples."
