      "content": "UPS drivers follow a routing strategy that minimizes the number of left turns they have to make in order to save time and fuel. This strategy, known as \"left-hand routing,\" involves making as many right turns as possible, rather than left turns, which can be more time-consuming and fuel-intensive.\n\nThe idea behind this strategy is that right turns are generally faster and more efficient than left turns, which often require drivers to wait for oncoming traffic to clear before turning. By avoiding left turns as much as possible, UPS drivers can save time and fuel, and also reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nIn addition to left-hand routing, UPS also employs a number of other strategies to save fuel, including the use of hybrid and electric vehicles, optimized driving techniques, and the use of advanced technology to improve routing and reduce fuel consumption."
