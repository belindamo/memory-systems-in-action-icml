  "content": "I'm glad you found the open-ended and real-life scenario questions useful. Here are a few more objective-style questions that are a bit more innovative:\n\n1. In a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is 13 and one of the legs is 12. If the triangle is dilated by a scale factor of 2, what is the length of the hypotenuse of the dilated triangle?\n2. In a right triangle, one leg measures 15 and the hypotenuse measures 17. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the area of the triangle.\n3. In a right triangle, the length of one leg is x and the hypotenuse is y. If x = 8 and y = 10, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg in terms of trigonometric functions.\n4. A ladder placed against a wall makes a angle of 75 degrees with the ground. If the foot of the ladder is 4 meters away from the wall, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the ladder.\n5. A point is located at a distance of 10 from the origin in a cartesian plane, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the coordinates of the point if the point is on the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle.\n6. A right triangle has legs of length 8 and 15. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse and the area of the triangle in terms of radical numbers.\n\nI hope these questions are more innovative and align with what you are looking for. Let me know if you need further help or have any other specifications.",
