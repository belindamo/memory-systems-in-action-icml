A fun design or quirky quote can add a playful touch to your overall look.\n\nA bright colored graphic tee can work well with the distressed denim jeans and the gold necklace, but it depends on the specific design and color of the tee. Here are a few tips to consider:\n\n1. **Choose a bold, yet not overwhelming design**: A simple, bold graphic or a quirky quote can add a fun touch to your outfit. Avoid tees with too many colors or busy designs, as they might clash with the distressed denim jeans.\n2. **Consider a tee with a lighter color background**: A light-colored background will help the gold necklace stand out and create a nice contrast with the darker denim jeans.\n3. **Balance the look with neutral accessories**: Since the graphic tee will be the focal point of your outfit, keep the rest of your accessories simple and neutral. A pair of white sneakers or sandals, and a simple clutch or crossbody bag will complete the look.\n\nSome color options that might work well with the distressed denim jeans and gold necklace include:\n\n* **Bright Coral**: A bright coral graphic tee will add a fun and playful touch to your outfit.

The soft, pastel tone will create a nice contrast with the distressed denim jeans.\n* **Yellow**: A bright yellow graphic tee will add a bold and cheerful touch to your outfit. The warm tone of the yellow will complement the gold necklace nicely.\n\nSome fun design ideas for a graphic tee include:\n\n* A simple, bold logo or graphic\n* A quirky quote or phrase\n* A fun illustration, like a cartoon character or a minimalist design\n* A playful take on a classic design, like a distressed or vintage-inspired graphic\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and express your personal style! Choose a tee that makes you happy and feels like you, and you'll be sure to rock the look!",
