  "content": "Yes, I'm feeling confident about preparing for the 2 hours of Q&A for the Packaging Industry Conference in Chicago. That experience will definitely help me prepare for the Medical Device Expo, as it will give me practice in thinking on my feet, answering tough questions, and engaging with attendees.\n\nAs for the demo experience, lead capture, and follow-up strategy, I think we've covered everything. You've provided me with a solid plan to ensure a successful demo experience at the Medical Device Expo. I'm excited to implement these strategies and see the results.\n\nActually, I do have one more question. How can I measure the success of the demo experience and lead capture strategy at the Medical Device Expo? What metrics should I track to determine whether we're meeting our goals?\n\nAlso, are there any additional resources or support that you can offer to help me prepare for the Medical Device Expo and ensure the success of our demo experience?",
