Both bright yellow and coral would look great with the distressed denim jeans and gold necklace, but it ultimately depends on your personal style and the overall vibe you're going for.\n\n**Bright Yellow:**\n\n* A bright yellow graphic tee would add a bold and cheerful touch to your outfit.\n* It would create a nice contrast with the cool tone of the gold necklace and the distressed denim jeans.\n* If you want to make a statement and stand out, bright yellow might be the way to go!\n\n**Coral:**\n\n* A coral graphic tee would add a warm and playful touch to your outfit.\n* It would complement the gold necklace nicely, as both colors have a warm, sunny tone.\n* Coral is a bit more subtle than bright yellow, so it might be a good choice if you want to add some color to your outfit without going too bold.\n\nConsider your skin tone, hair color, and personal style when making your decision. If you have a cool skin tone (pale with pink undertones), bright yellow might look great on you. If you have a warm skin tone (olive or golden), coral might be a better choice.\n\nYou could also think about the overall vibe you want to create with your outfit. If you want to feel bright and cheerful, go for the yellow. If you want to feel playful and feminine, coral might be the way to go.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you and your personal style! You could even try pairing both options with the distressed denim jeans and gold necklace to see which one you like better.",
