American Robins are indeed known for their distinctive reddish-orange breasts, and it's great that you're familiar with their appearance.\n\nIt sounds like you had a fantastic birding trip, spotting 15 species in total! Sparrows and finches can be a bit tricky to identify, but it's great that you were able to observe them. Did you notice any interesting behaviors or interactions between the birds?\n\nWhen you upload your sightings to eBird, be sure to include as much detail as possible, such as the number of individuals, any notable behaviors, and the habitat in which you observed them. This will help contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of bird populations and behaviors.\n\nFeel free to share more about your birding adventure, and I'd be happy to help with any questions or identification tips if you need them!",
