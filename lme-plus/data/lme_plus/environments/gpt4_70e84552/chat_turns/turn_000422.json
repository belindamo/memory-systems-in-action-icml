  "content": "It sounds like you've been keeping up with some regular bathroom maintenance, which is great! However, it's possible that the showerhead might be the culprit behind the weak water pressure.\n\nThree weeks is a good amount of time to notice a significant decrease in water pressure, and it's likely that mineral buildup or lime scale has accumulated on the showerhead, reducing its performance. Replacing the showerhead should help restore the water pressure to its original state.\n\nBefore we dive into showerhead recommendations, I have a few quick questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n1. Do you live in an area with hard water? Hard water can cause mineral buildup faster, which might affect showerhead performance.\n2. What type of showerhead do you currently have? Is it a fixed, handheld, or rain showerhead?\n3. Are you looking for a specific feature in your new showerhead, such as multiple settings, massage jets, or a pause function?\n4. Would you prefer a showerhead with a specific material, like stainless steel, brass, or plastic?\n5. Are you open to spending a bit more money on a high-quality showerhead, or are you on a tighter budget?\n\nAnswering these questions will help me provide you with more tailored recommendations for a new showerhead that suits your needs and preferences.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to consider removing and cleaning your current showerhead to see if that improves the water pressure. Sometimes, a good cleaning can help restore performance. However, if the showerhead is old or heavily mineralized, it might be time to replace it altogether.",
