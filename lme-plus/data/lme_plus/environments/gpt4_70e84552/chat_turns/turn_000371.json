Here are some additional tips to consider when selecting brushes and paper:\n\n**Brushes:**\n\n1. **Natural vs. Synthetic:** Decide whether you prefer natural hair brushes (e.g., sable, mongoose) or synthetic brushes. Natural hair brushes are often more expensive, but they hold a lot of water and pigment. Synthetic brushes are more affordable and easier to clean.\n2. **Brush Shapes and Sizes:** Consider the types of strokes and effects you want to achieve in your paintings. Round brushes are great for detail work, while flat brushes are ideal for broad strokes and washes.\n3. **Brush Quality:** Look for brushes with sturdy ferrules (the metal band that holds the bristles in place) and comfortable handles. High-quality brushes will last longer and perform better.\n\n**Cold Press Paper:**\n\n1. **Weight:** Cold press paper comes in various weights, measured in grams per square meter (gsm). A heavier weight (e.g., 300gsm) will provide more texture and durability, while a lighter weight (e.g., 140gsm) will be more prone to buckling.\n2. **Texture:** Cold press paper has a rough, textured surface that allows for expressive brushstrokes. Look for paper with a consistent texture and minimal imperfections.\n3. **Brand and Quality:** Research different brands and read reviews to find a high-quality cold press paper that suits your needs and budget.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Ask for Advice:** Don't hesitate to ask the staff at the art supply store for recommendations or advice on specific products. They often have valuable insights and can help you make informed decisions.\n2. **Test and Experiment:** Don't be afraid to test different brushes and paper types before committing to a purchase. Many art supply stores offer sample sheets or brushes for testing.\n3. **Budget and Prioritize:** Set a budget for your purchases and prioritize the items you need most. You can always come back for additional supplies later.\n\nHave fun shopping, and I hope you find some amazing new tools to enhance your watercolor journey!",
