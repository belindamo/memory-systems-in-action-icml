  "content": "While it is possible that some tours in Dublin may allow pets or animals, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to bring your pet goat along on a food or drink tour. These tours are often held in indoor spaces such as pubs, restaurants or distilleries, and may have strict health and safety regulations to prevent the spread of disease and ensure the comfort and safety of all participants. Even well-behaved animals may not be allowed on such tours. \n\nIt's always a good idea to check with the tour operator directly to see if they have any rules about bringing animals on tours, but in general it's safe to assume that food and drink tours in Dublin are not suitable for pets, especially if the tour involves sampling food or drink products.",
