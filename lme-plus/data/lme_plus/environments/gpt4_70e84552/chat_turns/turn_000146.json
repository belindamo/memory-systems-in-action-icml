Here's what to consider:\n\n**Morning:** As I mentioned earlier, Tulsi tea is a great morning pick-me-up due to its adaptogenic properties. It can help increase energy, focus, and vitality, making it an excellent way to start your day.\n\n**Afternoon:** Having Tulsi tea at 3:30 PM can be beneficial as well. The tea's adaptogenic properties can help:\n\n1. **Combat afternoon slump:** Tulsi tea can help counteract the natural dip in energy levels that often occurs in the afternoon.\n2. **Improve focus:** The tea's cognitive-enhancing properties can help you stay focused and productive during the latter part of your workday.\n3. **Reduce stress:** Tulsi tea's calming effects can help mitigate any stress or anxiety that may build up during the day.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that:\n\n1. **Caffeine sensitivity:** If you're sensitive to caffeine, you might want to avoid consuming Tulsi tea too close to bedtime, as it may interfere with your sleep. While Tulsi tea doesn't contain caffeine, it can still stimulate your body and mind.\n2. **Interactions with medications:** If you're taking any medications, especially those for blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid conditions, consult with your healthcare provider before consuming Tulsi tea regularly, especially in the afternoon.\n\nIn general, Tulsi tea is safe to consume at any time of day, but it's essential to listen to your body and adjust your consumption based on how you feel. If you find that the tea affects your sleep or interacts with your medications, consider adjusting your timing or consulting with a healthcare professional.\n\nEnjoy your Tulsi tea at 3:30 PM, and see how your body responds!",
