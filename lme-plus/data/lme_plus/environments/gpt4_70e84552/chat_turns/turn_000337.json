I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries.\n\nHowever, I'm happy to provide you with information on popular cleaning products and tools that people swear by! Many people prefer eco-friendly and sustainable options, such as Seventh Generation, Ecover, or Method. Others prefer strong and effective products like Clorox, Lysol, or OxiClean.\n\nAs for tools, microfiber cloths, scrub brushes, and all-purpose cleaning caddies are often praised for their effectiveness and convenience. Some people also swear by steam cleaners, vacuum cleaners, or mops with built-in cleaning solutions.\n\nWhat about you? Do you have any favorite cleaning products or tools that make your cleaning routine easier or more efficient?",
