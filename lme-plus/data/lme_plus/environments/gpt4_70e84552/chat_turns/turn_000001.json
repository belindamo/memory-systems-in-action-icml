  "content": "The two major political parties in India are the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and both employ different strategies to garner support from farmers.\n\nThe Congress party has traditionally been seen as a party that favors farmers' interests. The Congress focuses on loan waivers, minimum support prices, and subsidies as a means of helping farmers. They argue that farmers need these benefits because they suffer from low prices for their crops, heavy debt burdens, and a lack of access to credit. Congress tends to announce loan waivers for farmers during elections as a strategy to gain support from them.\n\nThe BJP, on the other hand, focuses on agriculture reforms that are aimed at improving the condition of farmers. They believe that farmers would benefit more from measures that improve their productivity and facilitate access to markets. BJP has implemented reforms, including the increase in Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), establishment of e-NAM, and increasing the coverage of crop insurance schemes. The party has also introduced the PM Kisan scheme, providing financial assistance of Rs 6,000 per year to farmers. These initiatives have largely been seen by farmers as beneficial, and thus, BJP has been able to gain support from farmers.\n\nIn conclusion, the Congress and BJP approaches differ fundamentally, with Congress by and large focusing on benefits rather than reform, and the BJP focused on agricultural reform rather than benefits. The approach used by these two parties depends on what they feel would be beneficial for the farmer population in the near future.",
