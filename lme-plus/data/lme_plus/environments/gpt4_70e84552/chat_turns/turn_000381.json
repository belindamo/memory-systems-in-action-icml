  "content": "Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a powerful tool that allows you to manage and deploy tracking and marketing tags (snippets of code or tracking pixels) on your website without requiring IT support. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up GTM for a basic website and track events:\n\n**Step 1: Create a Google Tag Manager account**\n\n1. Go to the Google Tag Manager website ([tagmanager.google.com](http://tagmanager.google.com)) and sign in with your Google account.\n2. Click on the \"Create\" button to create a new account.\n3. Enter your account name, container name (e.g., your website's name), and time zone.\n4. Agree to the terms of service and click \"Create.\"\n\n**Step 2: Install the Google Tag Manager container**\n\n1. In your GTM account, click on the \"Install Google Tag Manager\" button.\n2. You'll receive a container code, which is a snippet of JavaScript code that you'll need to add to your website.\n3. Copy the container code and paste it into the <head> section of your website's HTML, ideally just after the opening <head> tag.\n\n**Step 3: Set up your data layer (optional but recommended)**\n\nA data layer is a JavaScript object that contains information about your website's pages, such as page names, categories, and product details. This step is optional, but it's highly recommended to set up a data layer to easily track events and variables.\n\n1. Create a JavaScript object in your website's HTML, typically in the <head> section, with the following format:\n```javascript\ndataLayer = [\n  {\n    'pageCategory': 'Home',\n    'pageName': 'Homepage'\n  }\n];\n```\n**Step 4: Create a trigger**\n\nTriggers define when a tag should be fired. In this example, we'll create a trigger for page views.\n\n1. In GTM, go to the \"Triggers\" tab and click \"New.\"\n2. Select \"Page View\" as the trigger type.\n3. Set up the trigger to fire on \"All Pages\" or specify a specific page or URL.\n4. Click \"Save.\"\n\n**Step 5: Create a tag**\n\nTags are the actual tracking codes or pixels that are fired by triggers.\n\n1. In GTM, go to the \"Tags\" tab and click \"New.\"\n2. Select \"Google Analytics\" as the tag type.\n3. Enter your Google Analytics tracking ID (UA-XXXXX-X).\n4. Select the trigger you created in Step 4 as the firing trigger.\n5. Click \"Save.\"\n\n**Step 6: Track events using GTM**\n\nEvents are user interactions that you want to track, such as button clicks, form submissions, or video plays.\n\n**Example: Track a button click**\n\n1. Create a new trigger:\n\t* Go to the \"Triggers\" tab and click \"New.\"\n\t* Select \"Click\" as the trigger type.\n\t* Set up the trigger to fire on a specific element (e.g., a button with a specific ID or class).\n\t* Click \"Save.\"\n2. Create a new tag:\n\t* Go to the \"Tags\" tab and click \"New.\"\n\t* Select \"Google Analytics\" as the tag type.\n\t* Enter your Google Analytics tracking ID (UA-XXXXX-X).\n\t* Select the trigger you created in step 1 as the firing trigger.\n\t* In the \"Track Type\" field, select \"Event.\"\n\t* Enter the event category, action, and label (e.g., \"Button Click,\" \"Submit,\" and \"Contact Form\").\n\t* Click \"Save.\"\n\n**Step 7: Publish and test**\n\n1. Click the \"Publish\" button in the top-right corner of the GTM interface.\n2. Test your setup by clicking the button you set up to track and verifying",
