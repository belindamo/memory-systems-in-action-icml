Bill of Rights: The agreement included a commitment to the creation of a Northern Ireland Bill of Rights that would protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of their background.\n\n4. Policing: The agreement established a new policing system, with independent oversight of the police in Northern Ireland.\n\n5. Citizenship: The agreement recognized the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify as Irish or British or both, and established reciprocal arrangements for citizenship of both nations.\n\n6. Reconciliation: The agreement supported efforts towards reconciliation, including the establishment of a North-South Ministerial Council and an East-West Ministerial Council, to promote better relations between the communities in Northern Ireland and between the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nOverall, the key provisions of the Good Friday Agreement were aimed at providing a framework for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, through the establishment of a power-sharing government, the decommissioning of weapons, the protection of human rights, and the promotion of closer relations between Northern Ireland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.",
