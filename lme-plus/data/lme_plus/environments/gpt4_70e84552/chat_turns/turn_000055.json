  "content": "I understand that you are looking for more innovative questions. One way to make the question more innovative is by making the problem more open-ended and allowing students to explore different problem-solving methods. Here is an example of an open-ended question that uses the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\n\"A right triangle has a hypotenuse with length 20 and one leg with length x. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, create an equation that relates x to the length of the other leg. Then, use the equation to find the possible lengths of the other leg and explain the reasoning behind your answers.\"\n\nAnother way to make the question more innovative is by giving a real-life scenario that relates to the Pythagorean theorem. For example:\n\n\"A person is standing at the top of a hill and wants to determine the distance to the base of the hill. The person knows that the angle of elevation to the top of the hill is 35 degrees and the angle of depression",
