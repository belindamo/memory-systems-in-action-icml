  "content": "D. Wet Cooling Tower\n\n1. The variations in cooling water supply temperature to the condenser and the heat absorption rate at the condenser can be plotted using the following equations:\n\nCooling water supply temperature (Tcw):\nTcw = Tcw\\_inlet + Q / (m\\_cw x Cp\\_cw)\n\nHeat absorption rate (Q):\nQ = m\\_cw x Cp\\_cw x (Tcw\\_outlet - Tcw\\_inlet)\n\nWhere Tcw\\_inlet is the inlet cooling water temperature, Tcw\\_outlet is the outlet cooling water temperature, Q is the heat absorption rate, m\\_cw is the mass flow rate of cooling water, and Cp\\_cw is the specific heat capacity of cooling water.\n\nThe relative humidity of the inlet air can be used to calculate the wet-bulb temperature, which is a measure of the amount of moisture in the air. The wet-bulb temperature can then be used to calculate the heat absorbed by the cooling water in the tower. As the relative humidity of the inlet air increases, the wet-bulb temperature will also increase, resulting in an increase in the heat absorbed by the cooling water and a decrease in the cooling water supply temperature to the condenser.\n\n2. Cooling towers are a necessary sub-system in district cooling air-conditioning systems because they help to remove the heat that is rejected by the condenser. The condenser in the chiller system rejects heat to the cooling water, which is then circulated through the cooling tower. The cooling tower uses evaporation to remove the heat from the cooling water. This process cools the water, so it can be recirculated back to the condenser to absorb more heat. Cooling towers are also used to control the temperature and chemistry of the recirculated water to prevent corrosion and scaling in the system.",
