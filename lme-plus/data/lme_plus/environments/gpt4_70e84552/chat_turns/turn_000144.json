  "content": "Tulsi tea is a wonderful morning pick-me-up.\n\nAdding milk to Tulsi tea is perfectly fine, but it's worth noting that it can affect the flavor and benefits of the tea. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Flavor:** Tulsi tea has a slightly spicy, earthy flavor, which can be masked by adding milk. If you prefer a milder flavor, adding milk can be a good option.\n2. **Bioavailability:** Some of the active compounds in Tulsi tea, like ursolic acid, may not be as easily absorbed by the body when consumed with milk. This is because casein, a protein in milk, can bind to these compounds and reduce their bioavailability.\n3. **Tradition:** In Ayurvedic tradition, Tulsi tea is often consumed without milk or sugar, as it's believed to allow the body to absorb the herb's benefits more effectively.\n\nThat being said, if you prefer your tea with milk, you can definitely add a splash! Here are some tips:\n\n* Use a small amount of milk: Add a small amount of milk to your tea, rather than making it a milky brew. This will help preserve the flavor and benefits of the Tulsi.\n* Choose a non-dairy milk: If you're concerned about the bioavailability of the active compounds, you can try using a non-dairy milk like almond, coconut, or oat milk. These milks may not affect the absorption of the herb's benefits as much as dairy milk.\n* Experiment with spices: Instead of adding milk, you can try adding spices like ginger, cinnamon, or cardamom to your Tulsi tea. These spices can enhance the flavor and benefits of the tea without affecting its bioavailability.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to enjoy your tea in a way that feels comfortable and enjoyable to you!",
