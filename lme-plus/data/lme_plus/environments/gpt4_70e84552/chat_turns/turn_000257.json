  "content": "The \"Groupby and Aggregate\" exercise on LeetCode is a great way to practice your groupby skills. Here's a hint to help you approach the exercise:\n\n**Exercise Description:**\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df` with columns `id`, `category`, and `value`. Write a pandas function to group the data by `category` and compute the following aggregate values:\n\n* `sum` of `value`\n* `mean` of `value`\n* `count` of `id`\n\n**Hint:**\n\nTo approach this exercise, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Read the problem statement carefully**: Make sure you understand what aggregate values you need to compute and how to group the data.\n2. **Import the necessary libraries**: You'll need to import pandas and create a sample DataFrame `df` to work with.\n3. **Use the `groupby` method**: Group the data by the `category` column using the `groupby` method.\n4. **Apply aggregate functions**: Use the `agg` method to apply the required aggregate functions to the grouped data. You can pass a dictionary with the column names as keys and the aggregate functions as values.\n5. **Assign the result to a new DataFrame**: Assign the result of the aggregation to a new DataFrame, e.g., `result_df`.\n\n**Example Code:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n    'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'C'],\n    'value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]\n})\n\n# Group by category and compute aggregate values\nresult_df = df.groupby('category').agg({\n    'value': ['sum', 'mean', 'count'],\n    'id': 'count'\n})\n\nprint(result_df)\n```\n**Expected Output:**\n```\n         value       id\n         sum       mean  count  count\ncategory                \nA        40.0  20.000000      2      2\nB        60.0  30.000000      2      2\nC       110.0  55.000000      2      2\n```\nRemember to read the problem statement carefully and adjust the code accordingly. Good luck, and have fun!",
