I am able to prioritize competing priorities to ensure successful outcomes, and have excellent verbal and written communication skills to effectively articulate ideas and opinions that involve research, interpretation, and assessment. I enjoy being presented with problems or issues and working with a team to find innovative solutions, and am curious and enjoy working in a team to visualize and design a possible new product or service and to assess the market, business and technical merits of that concept.\n\nFurthermore, I have experience in data analytics, and have the technical skills to review and evaluate data to find innovative opportunities and share with partners. I am proficient in the MS Office and other tools required to study and present my findings.
