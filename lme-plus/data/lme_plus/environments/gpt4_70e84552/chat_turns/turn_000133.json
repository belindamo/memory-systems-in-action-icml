  "content": "I've been sticking to traditional Korean chili flakes, but I'm definitely open to experimenting with other types of chili peppers or spice blends. I've heard of people using habanero or ghost peppers to add an extra kick to their kimchi, but I haven't tried it myself yet. I'm curious about Szechuan peppercorns, though - I've had them in Chinese dishes before, but I've never thought to use them in kimchi. How would you recommend using them?",
