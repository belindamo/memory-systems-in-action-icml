  "content": "McVitie's Digestives are a classic choice for afternoon tea! They're a popular pairing for a reason - the sweet, malty flavor and crunchy texture of the biscuits complement the tea perfectly. The Digestives will provide a nice contrast to the earthy, herbal flavors of the Tulsi tea, and their sweetness will balance out the tea's slightly bitter notes.\n\nMcVitie's Digestives are also a great choice because they're a traditional British biscuit that's specifically designed to be dunked in tea. The biscuit's texture is sturdy enough to hold up to being dunked, and the flavors will meld together beautifully.\n\nIf you're looking for a comforting, familiar pairing, McVitie's Digestives are an excellent choice. They're a timeless classic that will provide a lovely accompaniment to your afternoon Tulsi tea.\n\nSo, go ahead and grab that packet of McVitie's Digestives - I'm sure you'll enjoy them with your tea!",
