Indonesia followed closely with US$10.2 billion, while Malaysia ranked third with US$2.2 billion. Thailand and the Philippines were in fourth and fifth place, with US$1.9 billion and US$818 million, respectively.\n\nLooking at the trends in furniture exports for these countries, we can see that there has been a steady increase in export values over the years, with some fluctuations due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are differences in the reasons for the rise or decline in export statistics among the countries.\n\nFor example, Vietnam's furniture industry has experienced significant growth due to its competitive labor costs and skilled workforce, which have attracted foreign investment and increased export volumes. In contrast, Malaysia's furniture exports declined in 2020 due to the pandemic's impact on supply chains and reduced demand from key export markets.\n\nIndonesia's furniture exports, on the other hand, have been steadily increasing due to the government's support for the industry, such as the implementation of export incentives and trade promotion activities. Thailand's furniture industry has also been supported by the government's initiatives, including the establishment of a furniture industry cluster and participation in international trade shows.\n\nThe Philippines' furniture export industry, as mentioned earlier, has also been affected by the pandemic. However, the government's efforts to support the sector and the potential for growth in the future remain promising.\n\nIn conclusion, while the furniture export statistics of ASEAN countries have been generally positive, there are differences in the reasons for the rise or decline in the industry's performance among the countries. Understanding these factors can help countries implement effective policies and initiatives to support their furniture industry and remain competitive in the global market.\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
