I'd be happy to help you with a simple recipe that serves 8-10 people.\n\nHere's a traditional recipe for latkes that yields about 20-25 latkes:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4 large potatoes, peeled\n* 1 large onion, finely chopped\n* 2 eggs\n* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1/4 teaspoon paprika\n* Vegetable oil for frying\n* Applesauce or sour cream for serving (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Grate the potatoes and onion using a food processor or a box grater.\n2. In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes, onion, eggs, flour, salt, pepper, and paprika. Mix well.\n3. Heat about 1/2 inch (1 cm) of vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.\n4. Using a tablespoon, scoop up a small amount of the potato mixture and shape into a pancake. Place the latke in the hot oil and flatten slightly.\n5. Fry the latkes for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they're golden brown and crispy.\n6. Remove the latkes from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n7. Serve the latkes hot with applesauce or sour cream, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* To prevent the grated potatoes from turning brown, soak them in cold water for about 30 minutes before making the latkes. Drain and squeeze out as much water as possible before mixing with the other ingredients.\n* Use a thermometer to ensure the oil reaches 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for crispy latkes.\n* Don't overcrowd the pan; fry the latkes in batches if necessary.\n* Keep the latkes warm in a low oven (200\u00b0F/90\u00b0C) while frying the remaining batches.\n\nI'm so glad you enjoyed the candlelight vigil at the synagogue! The Hebrew hymns must have added a beautiful touch to the ceremony.\n\nDo you have any questions about the recipe, or would you like some variations on the traditional latke recipe?",
