The warm tone of the coral will create a nice contrast with the cool tone of the gold necklace.\n2. **Yellow Off-the-Shoulder Top**: A bright yellow off-the-shoulder top will add a fun and playful touch to your outfit. The soft, feminine style of the top will balance out the edginess of the distressed denim jeans.\n3. **Mint Green Peplum Top**: A mint green peplum top will add a fresh and youthful vibe to your outfit. The ruffled hem of the peplum top will create a nice movement and add some visual interest.\n4. **Orange Cropped Sweater**: A bright orange cropped sweater will add a bold and playful touch to your outfit. You can wear it over a white tank top or a lightweight tee to add some layering.\n5. **Pink Bell-Sleeve Top**: A pink bell-sleeve top will add a romantic and feminine touch to your outfit.
