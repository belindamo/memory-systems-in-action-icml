  "content": "Here are a few difficult questions for 10th grade students that focus on using the Pythagorean Theorem with one side given:\n\n1. In a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is 13 and one of the legs is 12. What is the length of the other leg?\n2. In a right triangle, one leg measures 15 and the hypotenuse measures 17. What is the length of the other leg?\n3. In a right triangle, the length of one leg is x and the hypotenuse is y. If x^2 + (y-5)^2 = y^2, what is the value of x in terms of y?\n4. In a right triangle, if the length of one leg is 8 and the hypotenuse is 10, what is the length of the other leg in terms of radicals?\n5. A ladder placed against a wall makes a angle of 75 degrees with the ground. If the foot of the ladder is 4 meters away from the wall, how long is the ladder?\n6. A point is located at a distance of 10 from the origin in a cartesian plane , find the coordinates of the point if the point is on the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle?\n\nI hope these questions are helpful and innovative for your needs. Let me know if you have any other specifications.",
