Combining the Dewey Decimal System with subject-based categories will help you maintain a logical structure while keeping related books together.\n\nFor bookshelves and storage units, here are some recommendations to consider:\n\n1. **Adjustable Bookshelves**: Look for bookshelves with adjustable shelves, which will allow you to customize the height and spacing to fit books of different sizes. This will help you maximize your storage space and keep your books organized.\n2. **Bookcases with Drawers or Cabinets**: Consider bookcases with drawers or cabinets to store smaller items like paperbacks, journals, or book-related accessories. This will help keep your shelves clutter-free and make it easier to find what you need.\n3. **Stackable Bookshelves**: If you have limited floor space, stackable bookshelves can be a great option. They're often compact, easy to assemble, and can be configured to fit your needs.\n4. **Bookshelf Dividers**: Use bookshelf dividers to separate your non-fiction books into categories. You can find dividers in various materials, such as wood, metal, or plastic, and they come in different styles to fit your decor.\n5. **Label Holders**: Add label holders to your bookshelves to identify each section or category. This will make it easy to find specific books and maintain your organizational system.\n\nSome popular brands and options to consider:\n\n* IKEA ( Billy bookcase, Kallax shelving unit)\n* Amazon (Amazon Basics bookshelves, Amazon-branded storage units)\n* The Container Store (Elfa shelving system, bookshelf dividers)\n* Wayfair (various bookshelves and storage units from different brands)\n* Crate & Barrel (modern bookshelves and storage units with a stylish twist)\n\nWhen selecting a bookshelf or storage unit, consider the following factors:\n\n* Space constraints: Measure your available space to ensure the bookshelf fits comfortably.\n* Durability: Choose a sturdy, well-built bookshelf that can hold the weight of your books.\n* Style: Select a bookshelf that fits your home decor and personal style.\n* Budget: Set a budget and stick to it to avoid overspending.\n\nBy combining a hybrid organizational system with a well-designed bookshelf or storage unit, you'll be able to keep your non-fiction books organized, easily accessible, and beautifully displayed.\n\nRemember to have fun with the process, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance or recommendations!",
