  "content": "That's a great choice! Baking latkes is a fantastic way to make them healthier while still enjoying the delicious flavor and texture. You'll find that baking them brings out a slightly sweeter flavor from the potatoes, and they'll be crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.\n\nIt's wonderful to hear about the sense of community at the candlelight vigil! Hanukkah is a time for celebration and connection with others, and it sounds like you experienced that firsthand. It's great that you got to catch up with your coworker Rachel and meet her Rabbi too!\n\nBaking latkes is a relatively easy process, and you can expect them to turn out beautifully. Just keep an eye on them while they're baking to ensure they don't overcook. You can also experiment with different seasonings and toppings to give them an extra boost of flavor.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further guidance while baking your latkes, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you and your guests enjoy the fruits of your labor!\n\nBy the way, did Rachel's Rabbi share any interesting insights or stories during the vigil, or was there a particular moment that stood out to you?",
