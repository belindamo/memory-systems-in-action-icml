The Facebook group can be a great way to share and discuss the photos, and the Google Drive folder can serve as a centralized repository for storing and organizing the digitized photos. I'll make sure to create a clear guide and designate a point person to help with uploading and organizing the photos. Thanks for the suggestions! I'll also ask my aunt to help me spread the word about the project to the rest of the family.",
