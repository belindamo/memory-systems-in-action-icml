  "content": "Zuni Cafe is a San Francisco classic.\n\nHowever, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know your exact location or address. I can provide you with general directions or estimates, but I won't be able to give you a precise estimate of how long it'll take to get to Zuni Cafe from your specific location.\n\nIf you're in the downtown area, you can try using a mapping app like Google Maps or Waze to get an estimate of the driving time and traffic conditions. You can enter your starting location and the destination (Zuni Cafe, 1658 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94102) to get the most accurate estimate.\n\nAlternatively, you can also consider taking public transportation, such as Muni or BART, to get to Zuni Cafe. You can use the SFMTA website or a transit app like Transit or Moovit to plan your route.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll enjoy your brunch at Zuni Cafe!",
