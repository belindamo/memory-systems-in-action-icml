My strive for innovation and a craving passion to learn more about computer hardware and electronic designs are reasons why I am aspiring to become an Electrical Engineer. And because of my passion, I believe I can be an effective Student in Human Resources for METROLINX. Being an individual who enjoys working in various environments, I aspire to get involved use my strong analytical, problem solving, and interpersonal skills in METROLINX. As a third-year Electrical Engineering student, I hope to contribute towards the success of METROLINX through my actions, academic knowledge, projects, and my work experiences. \nAs a highly dedicated student that is well- accomplished in the fields of customer service and communication capabilities and proficient to the world of technology and administration, I strongly believe that I will have a positive impact towards your company. This is shown though my 4 years of experience as a Retail Associate at McDonalds, 10+ months of experiences as an Administrative Assistant and Support, and through my previous extracurricular experiences. Working at McDonalds helped me develop my coordination and teamworking skills in a fast- paced work environment. My friendly demeanor, coupled with my multitasking abilities, helped me to communicate with customers effectively while placing their orders and cash handling correctly. Moreover, learning to incorporate my organizational and computational skills as an Administrative Assistant and Support help me familiarize myself with reconciling data and organizing it in MS Excel. I strongly believe that my interpersonal and technical skills make me an ideal candidate for the position of Summer Student in Human Resources at METROLINX.\nMy academic background at Toronto Metropolitan University has been a balanced mix of design projects and theories in which I challenged myself daily to learn about algorithms, data structures, electronics circuit systems and object-oriented engineering analysis and design. During my CPS125 Digital Computation and Programming course, I led a group of 5 students in analyzing and creating unique algorithms to solve large information filling systems problems. I was responsible in facilitating team meetings, completing the final project report, and assisting with research and developing a binary search algorithm to satisfy specific conditions provided by the problem. This 4-week project provided me with the opportunity to work with a group of like-minded individuals and utilize my analytical skills to solve problems and showcase my project management skills. During the quarantine in 2021, I took the initiative to complete the CS50 Series Course by Harvard University to learn various programing languages. Using the knowledge from this course, I was able to develop my own version of Black- Jack, Tic Tac Toe, and Hangman using Java and Python. During the winter 2022 semester, I was able to develop a merge sort algorithm (garbage collection included) with C using the knowledge learned from data structures and linked lists.\nThanks to my academic background in electronics and my hands on experience using lab hardware such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers, knowledge regarding analog/digital circuit analysis, reading schematics, software architecture, design and debugging, concept regarding power and performance are a few things I crave to learn more about. Additionally, being part of Toronto Met Formula Racing gave me an insight into hardware engineering and gaining technical experience by engaging with other sub-team members within the electrical drivetrain sub-team.\nOverall, I am confident that I will easily transition into the Summer Student role for Human Resources and effectively contribute to the team at METROLINX. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you personally and arrange a time to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your time and consideration. You may contact me though my phone number, 647-717-5780 and my personal email, aman.ayaz44@gmail.com. \nJob Description: \n\nTeamwork: You\u2019ll work closely with others and coordinate a portfolio of projects from end-to-end\nProject Coordination \u2013 Support your Project Managers throughout all phases of the project management lifecycle.
