  "content": "In recent years, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been more effective in garnering support from farmers in India. Their focus on agriculture reforms, including the increase in Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), establishment of e-NAM, and increasing the coverage of crop insurance schemes, and the introduction of the PM Kisan scheme, providing financial assistance of Rs 6,000 per year to farmers have been successful in gaining support from farmers.\n\nIn addition, the BJP's focus on increasing agricultural productivity through its policies has been seen as a positive move by many farmers. Recently, in response to the farmer protests, the government proposed several agricultural reforms aimed at empowering farmers and increasing their bargaining power.\n\nOn the other hand, the Indian National Congress (INC) has been largely unsuccessful in garnering support from farmers in recent years. Their traditional focus on loan waivers, minimum support prices, and subsidies has not been seen as a comprehensive solution to the problems faced by farmers. Though loan waivers are popular among farmers, they are not seen as a long-term solution.\n\nIn conclusion, the BJP's focus on agricultural reforms and productivity has been more effective in gaining support from farmers in recent years as it is seen as a more holistic solution to the problems faced by them.",
