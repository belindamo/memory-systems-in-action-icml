This will help them understand its features and benefits better.\n3. **Storytelling**: Create a narrative around your product demo, using a clear and concise script to communicate its value proposition, features, and benefits. This will help attendees connect emotionally with your product.\n4. **Visuals and graphics**: Use high-quality visuals, such as videos, animations, or 3D models, to showcase your product's features and benefits. This will help attendees quickly understand complex information.\n5. **Product positioning**: Position your product in a way that showcases its key features and benefits. Consider using pedestals, risers, or shelves to create a visually appealing display.\n6. **Comfortable seating**: Provide comfortable seating or standing areas for attendees to relax and engage with your product demo.
