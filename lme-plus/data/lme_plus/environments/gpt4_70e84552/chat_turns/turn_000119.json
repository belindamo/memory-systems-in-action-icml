  "content": "Thanks for the advice! I was thinking of getting a Brown Swiss or a Jersey, as I've heard they're both great for dairy production. I've also been doing some research online and talking to other farmers in the area, and I think I might be ready to make the investment soon. By the way, speaking of my farm, I've also been trying to trim their hooves more regularly, and I've gotten much better at it with practice. The last time I did it was about two weeks ago, and I was proud of myself for not making a mess of it.",
