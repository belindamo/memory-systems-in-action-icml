  "content": "I like the idea of having a hands-on station, where attendees can interact with our new product. We've had success with this format in the past, such as at the Tech Expo in San Francisco, where I gave demos to attendees every hour. It's a great way to showcase the product's features and benefits. For the Medical Device Expo, I'm thinking of having a few stations, each focusing on a specific aspect of the product. Do you have any suggestions on how to effectively train our staff to handle the demos and engage with attendees?",
