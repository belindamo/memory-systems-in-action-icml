  "content": "From the same objective and problem statement,\nD. Wet Cooling Tower\nThe wet cooling tower supplies cooling water to the condenser of the chiller system at a rate of 200\nliters/min. The cooling water absorbs the thermal load from the condenser and returns to the cooling\ntower at 34oC. Air enters the cooling tower at 1 atm and 28oC and leaves saturated at 34oC.\n1. Plot the variations in cooling water supply temperature to the condenser and the heat\nabsorption rate at the condenser when the relative humidity of the inlet air varies from 50%\nto 100%RH. Assume the air flow rate is constant at 60 liters per minute. (CO3)\n2. Explain the reasons why cooling towers are a necessary sub-system in district cooling airconditioning systems. (CO1)",
