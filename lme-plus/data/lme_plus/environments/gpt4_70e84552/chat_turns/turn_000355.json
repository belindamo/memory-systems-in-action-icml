What time of year are you planning your trip (spring, summer, fall, or winter)?\n2. What is your location or the location of the nature center you're planning to visit (city, state, or region)?\n3. What type of habitat does the nature center have (e.g., forest, wetlands, grasslands, coastal area)?\n\nWith this information, I can give you a better idea of what bird species you might see during your visit.",
