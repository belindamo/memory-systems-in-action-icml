This will give us enough time to cover all the material and make any necessary adjustments before the Medical Device Expo. I'll send out a calendar invite to the team with the schedule and make sure everyone is available.\n\nAlso, I'd like to discuss the lead capture process and follow-up procedures in more detail. Can you provide some insights on how we can effectively capture leads and follow up with attendees after the event?",
