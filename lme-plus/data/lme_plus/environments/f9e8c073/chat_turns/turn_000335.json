Here's some general information on average property taxes and insurance costs in the suburbs:\n\n**Property Taxes:**\n\n* The average property tax rate in the United States is around 1.1% of the home's value per year.\n* However, property tax rates vary significantly depending on the state, county, and even city.\n* In the suburbs, property tax rates tend to be lower than in urban areas, but can still range from 0.5% to 2.5% of the home's value.\n* For example:\n\t+ In Illinois, the average property tax rate is around 1.73% (source: Illinois Policy Institute).\n\t+ In California, the average property tax rate is around 0.79% (source: California State Board of Equalization).\n\t+ In Texas, the average property tax rate is around 1.86% (source: Texas Comptroller's Office).\n\nTo give you a better idea, here's an example of how property taxes might impact your mortgage payments:\n\n* Assume you're looking at a $250,000 home with a 1.5% property tax rate.\n* Your annual property taxes would be $3,750 ($250,000 x 0.015).\n* Divide that by 12 to get your monthly property tax payment: $312.50.\n\n**Homeowners Insurance:**\n\n* The average annual homeowners insurance premium in the United States is around $1,200 (source: Insurance Information Institute).\n* However, insurance costs vary depending on factors like location, home value, construction type, and natural disaster risk.\n* In the suburbs, homeowners insurance premiums tend to be lower than in urban areas, but can still range from $800 to $2,000 per year.\n* For example:\n\t+ In Florida, the average annual homeowners insurance premium is around $1,900 (source: Insurance Information Institute).\n\t+ In Colorado, the average annual homeowners insurance premium is around $1,400 (source: Insurance Information Institute).\n\t+ In Oregon, the average annual homeowners insurance premium is around $800 (source: Insurance Information Institute).\n\nTo give you a better idea, here's an example of how homeowners insurance might impact your mortgage payments:\n\n* Assume you're looking at a $250,000 home with an annual insurance premium of $1,200.\n* Divide that by 12 to get your monthly insurance payment: $100.\n\n**Total Costs:**\n\n* When calculating your total costs, remember to factor in both property taxes and insurance premiums.\n* Using the examples above, your total monthly costs would be:\n\t+ Mortgage payment (assuming a $200,000 loan at 4% interest): $955\n\t+ Property taxes: $312.50\n\t+ Homeowners insurance: $100\n\t+ Total monthly costs: $1,367.50\n\nKeep in mind that these are just examples, and your actual costs may vary depending on your location, loan terms, and other factors. Be sure to research the specific property taxes and insurance costs for the areas you're interested in to get a more accurate estimate.\n\nI hope this helps you better understand the total costs involved in homeownership!",
