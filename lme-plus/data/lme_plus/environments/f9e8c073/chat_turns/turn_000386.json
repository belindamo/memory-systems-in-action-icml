I've had some experience with fundraising before, like when I organized a bake sale for a children's hospital and raised $300. And just last weekend, I participated in a charity dog walk and managed to raise $50 in sponsorships on June 5th. I'm hoping to build on that momentum for this charity cycling event.",
