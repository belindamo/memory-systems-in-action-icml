  "content": "Gonzo was a master of river fishing. When he wasn't in the mood for blacksmithing during the summer, he'd get lost in his fishing adventures. One day, while fishing for river trout, he caught enough to fill a bamboo basket! As he walked back home along a mountain road, he saw a tiny, monk-like ghost near a stone marker. Curious, he stared at it, but the little ghost grew bigger and bigger, becoming a huge monster reaching the clouds. Poor Gonzo was so frightened that he sprinted all the way home!\n\nTetsuzo from Tsuchibuchi village said that many strange things happened near Taimagura Pond on Mt. Hayachine. A man from Shimomura went fishing for trout and spotted a red-faced old man and a young girl, both dressed oddly, in the shadows of a mountain cave. In Taimagura, there were ancient rock dwellings by a stream. People once lived in those small, circular homes with tiny entrances. Tetsuzo, who shared this tale, said he could still hear a rooster crowing nearby when he listened closely while fishing. This story is about ten years old.\n\nA hairy-faced man with odd-colored eyes visited Yamada Bay in Shimohei from Sekiguchi valley to buy things during market days. The locals doubted he was human, so they killed him and buried him on the \"larger island\" in the bay. But ever since then, there have been fewer fish in the bay. The island was also known as \"Dutch Island\" because a Dutch ship called the Breskens landed there in 1643, searching for food and water. They were welcomed but later arrested and imprisoned for four months. European ships often visited the area, looking for Japanese gold mines. Old man Tora from Tsuchibuchi village shared this story.\n\nA hunter named Kikuchi Eisaku was hunting in the mountains of Oide near Mt. Hayachine when he stumbled upon a man with round, defensive eyes. Confused, he asked the man where he was going, and the man said he was heading to a hut in the pastureland. The man hurried away through the thick brush. It was unlikely anyone would be in that hut during winter, and it was hard to see the man's face in the dim light. But he was tall, wore a common coat, and carried a bag made from wisteria vines. This happened in the winter of 1913.\n\nIn the early 1920s, a child from Komaki in Matsuzaki village saw a large man on Mt. Nishinai. It was around noon during the time when people collected bush clover for their horses. Peeking from behind some bushes, the child saw the man wearing a common coat and carrying a wisteria vine bag full of wriggling snakes! The frightened child hid in the bushes, and the man hurried past. Relieved, the child raced back to the village. The story was shared during a night of New Year's games.\n\nThe wife of a cloth dyer went to check on her sick relative in Shimokumi-cho. As she approached Shimoyoko-cho around nine in the evening, she saw a giant, priest-like monster standing there. Scared, she ran, with the monster chasing her and flapping its coat sleeves like wings. She finally stopped, thinking she had lost it, but the monster was right behind her, even taller than a three-story building! She ran again, reaching her relative's house, but her legs swelled from the effort and never returned to normal. This story is from the 1870s.",
