Gathering reference images and doing quick sketches will definitely help you get a sense of the composition and colors of Monet's garden.\n\nCapturing the soft, dreamy quality of Monet's watercolors can be a challenge, but with some tips and techniques, you can achieve that ethereal feel in your piece. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Use soft, gentle brushstrokes**: Monet was known for his loose, expressive brushstrokes. Try using soft, gentle strokes to create a sense of movement and softness in your painting.\n2. **Layer your washes**: Monet often built up layers of transparent washes to achieve his signature soft, dreamy quality. Experiment with layering washes to create a sense of depth and luminosity.\n3. **Choose the right paper**: Look for paper with a soft, absorbent texture that will allow your washes to blend and merge easily. Cold press or rough paper can help create a more textured, organic look.\n4. **Use wet-on-wet technique**: Monet often used the wet-on-wet technique, where he added wet paint to wet paper. This technique can help create soft, blended edges and a sense of movement.\n5. **Experiment with glazing**: Glazing involves layering multiple transparent washes over a base color to achieve a deep, rich color. This technique can help create a sense of depth and luminosity in your painting.\n6. **Pay attention to color temperature**: Monet often used warm, cool, and neutral colors to create a sense of atmosphere and mood. Experiment with color temperature to evoke the right mood in your piece.\n7. **Don't overwork it**: Monet's watercolors often have a sense of spontaneity and freshness. Don't overwork your piece \u2013 sometimes, less is more when it comes to capturing that soft, dreamy quality.\n\nRemember, the key to capturing Monet's soft, dreamy quality is to experiment and have fun! Don't be afraid to try new techniques and take risks in your painting.\n\nGood luck, and I hope these tips help you achieve the ethereal feel you're looking for in your piece!",
