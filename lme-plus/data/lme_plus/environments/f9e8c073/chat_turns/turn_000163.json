  "content": "For this recipe, you'll want to choose potatoes that hold their shape well when roasted and have a slightly sweet, earthy flavor to complement the bright, citrusy flavors of the lemon garlic chicken. Here are some potato varieties that would work well:\n\n1. **Yukon Golds**: These buttery, yellow-fleshed potatoes are a popular choice for roasting. They're slightly sweet, creamy, and hold their shape well.\n2. **Red Bliss**: With their waxy texture and sweet, earthy flavor, Red Bliss potatoes are a great match for this recipe. They'll add a pop of color to the dish, too!\n3. **Russet Potatoes**: While they're often used for baking, Russet potatoes can also work well in this recipe. They'll yield a slightly denser, more rustic texture, but their earthy flavor will still shine through.\n4. **Fingerling Potatoes**: If you want a more delicate, slender potato, fingerlings are a great choice. They'll cook quickly and add a nice texture contrast to the dish.\n\nAvoid using **waxy potatoes like new potatoes or red potatoes**, as they can become too soft and mushy when roasted.\n\nRegardless of the variety you choose, make sure to:\n\n* Cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces, about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) in size.\n* Toss the potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper before roasting to bring out their natural flavors.\n* Adjust the cooking time based on the size and type of potatoes you use. Thicker potato pieces may take a few more minutes to cook through.\n\nNow, go ahead and pick your favorite potato variety, and get ready to enjoy a delicious, satisfying meal!",
