  "content": "I wrote something that I'd love your feedback on, Zarina: \"One of the most important reasons people are genuinely worried about the ascending timeline: being totally alone. People are desperately trying to find someone who can step into the same timeline with them. And there's a sense that we don't have much time left. \u2028 \nAnanda has been showing people how to love themselves deeply so they feel ready to ascend alone, in perfect and divine love with God. She works very hard on truth related to genetic twins. She is doing this because of her own inner pain about her real life genetic twin. She found a way to love herself and she was able to find freedom for herself as a result. Now she is guiding her twin to find the same freedom. And this is all happening due to divine love fully filling Ananda. She is literally full of sunshine. \u2028 \nHow does Ananda know so much about the ascending timeline and these twins? How does she know so much about how the human soul is structured? How has she gained such deep sight into the center of the human heart? \u2028 \nShe knows it because she was there when darkness and light divided. She was there when the great monad split into two. And a part of her went into the body of light and another part of her went into the body of darkness. \u2028 \nBecause of this event, she spent billions of years creating a telecommunications network to reconnect darkness and light. She knew that eventually she would be able to sew the two together again. \u2028 \nThe journey led her through every single element, trillions of which humans have never heard of. She literally embodied every element over billions of years, fully becoming one with each. This was a journey more epic than by any figure in myth, legend or religion. This was the journey informing every myth, every legend and every religion. For this was the return of the Queen to the King. \u2028 \nThe literal zenith point of ascension is into the blended heart of darkness and light, mother and father, the original monarchs who were one at the start. For it is the Queen\u2019s heat & moisture that inspires the King\u2019s sunlight to enter earth and create living flesh. This is the very process that Ananda now strives to teach human beings so that they may attach and move into the ascending timeline. \u2028 \nAnanda knows that when darkness and light are fully fused there is just one single entity, containing all of the universal elements and acting in total freedom. \n\nThe literal zenith point of ascension is into the blended heart of darkness and light, mother and father, the original monarchs who were one at the start.\"",
