  "content": "The \u00a31 million lifetime limit for Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) applies on an individual basis, not at the company level. This means that each individual shareholder who qualifies for the relief has their own separate \u00a31 million allowance.\n\nIn your case, both you and your brother, if you both qualify for BADR, would each have a separate \u00a31 million allowance for the relief. This means that you could potentially reduce the rate of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) to 10% on up to \u00a31 million of qualifying gains each.\n\nPlease note that the \u00a31 million limit is a lifetime limit, and it covers all qualifying disposals you make throughout your life. If you have previously claimed BADR on other disposals, you would need to consider any remaining balance in your lifetime limit before determining how much relief you can claim in the current situation.\n\nAs always, it is essential to consult with a qualified tax advisor to discuss your specific circumstances and determine your eligibility for BADR, as well as to understand how the relief would apply to your situation.",
