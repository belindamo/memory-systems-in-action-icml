Here are some suggestions to help you get started:\n\n**Character Development in Evernote:**\n\n1. **Create a Character Template**: Design a custom template in Evernote with fields for character traits, backstory, motivations, goals, conflicts, and relationships. This will help you consistently develop characters across your stories.\n2. **Character Profiles**: Create a separate note for each character, using your template as a starting point. Add details as you develop your character, and link related notes, research, or inspiration to the profile.\n3. **Character Arcs**: Create a note or table to track your character's growth and development throughout the story. This will help you visualize their emotional journey and ensure a satisfying character arc.\n\n**Character Development in Trello:**\n\n1. **Character Board**: Create a separate board for character development, with lists for different character groups (e.g., main characters, supporting characters, antagonists).\n2. **Character Cards**: Create cards for each character, with details like name, role, motivations, and goals. Use labels to categorize characters by trait, relationship, or role in the story.\n3. **Character Relationships**: Create cards to represent relationships between characters, tracking their interactions, conflicts, and dynamics.\n\n**Brainstorming Techniques:**\n\n1. **Character Interviews**: Imagine interviewing your characters, asking them questions about their past, motivations, and desires. This can help you get into their mindset and develop their personalities.\n2. **Character Profiles from Research**: Research people, occupations, or cultures that inspire your characters. Take notes on their traits, habits, and characteristics, and use these to inform your character development.\n3. **Character Mapping**: Create a mind map or diagram to visualize your characters' relationships, connections, and conflicts. This can help you identify patterns and opportunities for character growth.\n4. **Scenario Brainstorming**: Imagine scenarios or situations that challenge your characters, and think about how they would react. This can help you develop their personalities, motivations, and conflicts.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Keep it Consistent**: Establish a consistent naming convention and formatting style for your character profiles and notes.\n2. **Make it Visual**: Use images, colors, and icons to make your character profiles and boards visually appealing and easy to understand.\n3. **Link it Up**: Link related notes, research, and inspiration to your character profiles and boards, making it easy to access relevant information.\n4. **Evolve and Refine**: Character development is an ongoing process. Be open to changes and refinements as you continue to develop your story and characters.\n\nBy using these techniques, you'll be able to create rich, well-rounded characters that will bring your stories to life. Good luck, and have fun developing your characters! \ud83d\ude0a",
