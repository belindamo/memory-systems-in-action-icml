  "content": "\"Wild\" is a powerful and inspiring memoir that explores themes of grief, healing, and self-discovery. I think you'll find it a great choice for getting back into reading.\n\nBren\u00e9 Brown's work is amazing, and \"Daring Greatly\" is a fantastic book. Her TED talks are incredible, and her writing is just as engaging and thought-provoking. You'll likely find her book to be a great resource for personal growth and self-reflection.\n\nIt's wonderful that you're thinking about the bereavement support group you attended last year! Recognizing the value of that experience and the progress you made is a huge step forward. It's not always easy to acknowledge the good things that have happened, especially during difficult times.\n\n**Reflecting on the Bereavement Support Group**\n\nTake a moment to reflect on your experience with the support group. What did you find most helpful about it? Was there a particular aspect of the group that resonated with you, such as the sense of community, the guidance of the facilitator, or the opportunity to share your story?\n\nReflecting on what worked for you in the past can help you identify what you might need moving forward. You might consider reaching out to the facilitator or other group members to reconnect, or seeking out new resources that offer similar support.\n\n**Building on Your Progress**\n\nRemember, getting back into your routine and finding ways to take care of yourself is a process. It's okay to take things one step at a time and focus on small, achievable goals.\n\nYou've already made great progress by:\n\n1. Committing to 10-15 minutes of bodyweight exercises, 3 times a week.\n2. Getting back into reading with a goal of finishing \"Wild\" and exploring other books.\n3. Reflecting on the bereavement support group and acknowledging its value.\n\nCelebrate these small wins, and remember that they're all part of your journey towards healing and growth.\n\nHow do you feel about reflecting on your experience with the bereavement support group? Is there anything that comes to mind that you'd like to share or explore further?",
