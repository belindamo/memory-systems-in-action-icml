The relief applies to individual shareholders who meet the qualifying conditions, and the disposal of shares does not require the business to cease trading for the shareholder to be eligible.\n\nTo qualify for BADR, the individual shareholder must meet the following conditions:\n\n1. The company must be a trading company or the holding company of a trading group.\n2. The shareholder must hold at least 5% of the ordinary shares and voting rights in the company for at least 24 months before the disposal.\n3. The shareholder must be an officer or employee of the company or a member of its trading group for at least 24 months before the disposal.\n\nAs long as these conditions are met, the individual shareholder may be eligible for BADR on the disposal of their shares, even if the business continues to operate. However, it's essential to consult with a qualified tax advisor to discuss your specific circumstances and ensure that you meet all the conditions for BADR.",
