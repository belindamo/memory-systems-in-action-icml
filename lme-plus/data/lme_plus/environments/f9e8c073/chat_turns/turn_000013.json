  "content": "The Op/Tech USA Rain Cover is a popular and highly-rated option.\n\nAccording to Op/Tech USA's website, the Rain Cover is designed to fit a variety of camera bodies and lenses. The cover is adjustable, so it can accommodate different camera and lens combinations.\n\nTo confirm whether the Op/Tech USA Rain Cover can fit your Canon EOS camera body and the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS III USM lens, I've checked the dimensions of both:\n\n**Canon EOS Camera Body:**\n\n* Height: approximately 4.6 inches (116.8mm)\n* Width: approximately 5.7 inches (144.5mm)\n* Depth: approximately 3.5 inches (88.9mm)\n\n**Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS III USM Lens:**\n\n* Length: approximately 7.8 inches (199mm)\n* Diameter: approximately 3.5 inches (89mm)\n\nThe Op/Tech USA Rain Cover has the following dimensions:\n\n* Height: adjustable from 5.5 inches (140mm) to 7.5 inches (191mm)\n* Width: adjustable from 6.5 inches (165mm) to 8.5 inches (216mm)\n* Depth: adjustable from 4 inches (102mm) to 6 inches (152mm)\n\nBased on these dimensions, the Op/Tech USA Rain Cover should be able to fit your Canon EOS camera body and the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS III USM lens. However, to ensure a proper fit, I recommend checking the following:\n\n1. **Adjust the cover's dimensions**: Make sure to adjust the cover's dimensions to fit your camera body and lens snugly.\n2. **Check the lens hood**: If you plan to use a lens hood, ensure it fits within the rain cover's dimensions.\n3. **Try it out**: If possible, try fitting your camera and lens into the rain cover before heading out to shoot.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to double-check the fit and adjust the rain cover accordingly to ensure your gear is well-protected from the elements.",
