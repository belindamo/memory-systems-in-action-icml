The company must be a trading company or the holding company of a trading group.\n2. The shareholder must hold at least 5% of the ordinary shares and voting rights in the company for at least 24 months before the disposal.\n3. The shareholder must be an officer or employee of the company or a member of its trading group for at least 24 months before the disposal.\n\nAs a company secretary, you would typically satisfy the third condition as an officer of the company, assuming you meet the other qualifying conditions.
