Here are some suggestions to help you get started:\n\n**Plot Development in Evernote:**\n\n1. **Create a Plot Template**: Design a custom template in Evernote with fields for plot points, character arcs, conflicts, themes, and setting. This will help you consistently develop plots across your stories.\n2. **Plot Outlines**: Create a separate note for each story, using your template as a starting point. Add details as you develop your plot, and link related notes, research, or inspiration to the outline.\n3. **Scene Lists**: Create a table or list to break down your story into individual scenes, including setting, characters involved, and plot points.\n\n**Plot Development in Trello:**\n\n1. **Plot Board**: Create a separate board for plot development, with lists for different stages of the story (e.g., exposition, rising action, climax, resolution).\n2. **Plot Cards**: Create cards for each plot point, scene, or chapter, with details like setting, characters involved, and plot developments. Use labels to categorize cards by theme, character arc, or plot twist.\n3. **Plot Twists and Turns**: Create cards to represent plot twists, surprises, or reveals, and use labels to track how they fit into the overall story.\n\n**Structuring Your Story:**\n\n1. **Three-Act Structure**: Divide your story into three acts, with clear goals and conflicts for each act. This will help you create a clear narrative arc.\n2. **Character-Driven Plot**: Focus on how your characters' goals, motivations, and conflicts drive the plot forward.\n3. **Scene and Chapter Structure**: Use a consistent structure for your scenes and chapters, including a clear purpose, conflict, and resolution.\n4. **Pacing and Tension**: Use cards or notes to track the pacing and tension in your story, ensuring that it ebbs and flows to keep the reader engaged.\n\n**Brainstorming Techniques:**\n\n1. **Mind Mapping**: Create a mind map or diagram to visualize your story's plot, characters, and themes. This can help you identify connections and opportunities for plot development.\n2. **What-If Questions**: Ask yourself \"what-if\" questions about your story, characters, and plot, and use the answers to develop new ideas and twists.\n3. **Scene Brainstorming**: Imagine different scenarios or scenes that could occur in your story, and think about how they would affect the plot and characters.\n4. **Reverse Outlining**: Write a brief summary of your story, then break it down into individual scenes and plot points. This can help you identify gaps and opportunities for development.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Keep it Flexible**: Be open to changes and refinements as you continue to develop your plot and structure.\n2. **Make it Visual**: Use images, colors, and icons to make your plot boards and notes visually appealing and easy to understand.\n3. **Link it Up**: Link related notes, research, and inspiration to your plot outlines and boards, making it easy to access relevant information.\n4. **Evolve and Refine**: Plot and structure development is an ongoing process. Be open to feedback and revisions as you continue to refine your story.\n\nBy using these techniques, you'll be able to develop a compelling plot and structure for your stories. Good luck, and have fun building your narrative! \ud83d\ude0a",
