In the summer, when he was not in the mood \nfor blacksmithing, he became absorbed with fishing. One time, when he went \nfishing for river trout (iwana), he caught enough fish to fill a bamboo basket.\nHe was returning on a mountain road when he came to a stone marker desig\u0002nating the entrance to the village. There was a small Buddhist monk\u2013like ghost \nfigure with a shaven head standing in the grass. Wondering who it might be, \nhe looked, and the figure became larger and larger, becoming a huge monster \n(norikoshi) seeming to penetrate the clouds. Shocked, Gonzo is said to have run \nall the way home. (163-171)\nO\nAccording to Tetsuzo of Tsuchibuchi village, there are many strange things \nthat happen in the Taimagura Pond across from Oguni village on Mt. Haya\u0002chine. A man from Shimomura went fishing for iwana and came across a red\u0002faced old man (tengu) and a young girl in the shadow of a rocky cavern deep \nin the mountains. They were dressed rather strangely. In the Taimagura area, \nthere are several spots where there were ancient rock dwellings on both sides of \na stream. The dwellings were almost circular, only about three meters wide, and \nthe open entrance was one meter high. It is said that at one time people lived \nthere. Even now, it seems that someone is there. Tetsuzo, who told this story, \nsays that if he listens carefully while he is fishing, he can hear a cock crow nearby. \nThis story is from about ten years ago. (164-121)\nO\nThere was a man who came to Yamada Bay in Shimohei from Sekiguchi \nvalley to buy things on market days. His face was hairy, and the color of his \neyes was unusual. The locals doubted that he was a normal human being, so \nthey killed him and then buried him on the \u201clarger island\u201d in Yamada Bay. \nKilling him was one thing, but since then the number of fish being caught in \nthe bay has declined.\nThe larger island in Yamada Bay was also known as the \u201cDutch Island\u201d \nbecause the Dutch ship, the Breskens, landed there on June 10, 1643, in search \nof food and water supplies. The ship\u2019s crew was welcomed by the people of \nYamada, but on July 28, the crew was arrested and taken to the military shogun, \nTokugawa Iemitsu, in the national capital of Edo. The Dutch were imprisoned \n15\\_161-Morse.indb 75 5\\_161-Morse.indb 75 5/12/15 1:02 PM /12/15 1:02 PM\n76 FOLK LEGENDS FROM TONO\nfor four months. Around this time, European ships came to the area in search of \nJapanese gold mines.\nThis story was told by old man Tora of Tsuchibuchi village, who, when he \nwas young, would transport packhorses over to Yamada. (165-107)\nO\nThere was a hunter named Kikuchi Eisaku from Wano in Tochinai. He spent \na day hunting in the mountains of Oide near Mt. Hayachine. He was relying on \nthe soft evening light coming through the trees to find his way to a small hut \nwhen, all of a sudden, he came upon another man. The man\u2019s round eyes glared \ndefensively as he passed. Thinking it strange, the hunter asked him where he \nwas going. The man replied that he was going to a hut in the pastureland. The \nman pushed aside the dense brush and scurried off.\nSasaki Kizen was a friend of this hunter, and the story was heard directly from \nhim. It was unlikely that there would be anyone in the hut in the pasture in win\u0002ter. It was also hard to discern the man\u2019s features in the dim evening light, but he \nwore a fairly common tight-sleeved, rough linen coat and had a bag-like object \nmade from wisteria vines hanging from his shoulder. He was about two meters \ntall and about the same age as the hunter. This was in the winter of 1913. At that \ntime, the hunter was a youthful twenty-five or twenty-six years old. (166-106)\nO\nThis story is from around 1920. A child from Komaki in Matsuzaki village \nencountered a large man on Mt. Nishinai. It was just past noon one day during \nSeptember or October when people gather bush clover (hagi) to be used as feed \nfor their horses. The child peeked out from behind the bushes and saw a large man \nwearing a common tight-sleeved, rough cotton coat. He had a bag-like object made \nfrom wisteria vines hanging from his shoulder, and the bag had a number of snakes \nsquirming around inside. Frightened, the child crouched down in the bushes, and \nthe man passed right in front of him in great haste. Feeling relieved that he was \nalive, he took off running back to the village. I heard this story from some young \npeople one night in January when children play New Year\u2019s games. (167-105)\nO\nThe wife of a cloth dyer in Shinmachi went to see how her sick relative in \nShimokumi-cho was feeling. Around nine o\u2019clock in the evening, she came to \n15\\_161-Morse.indb 76 5\\_161-Morse.indb 76 5/12/15 1:02 PM /12/15 1:02 PM\n S U RV I VA L O N T H E E D G E 7 7\nthe corner of Shimoyoko-cho, and there was a priest-like monster (dainyudo)\nabout three meters tall standing there. Terrified, she ran off, chased by the mon\u0002ster flapping its coat sleeves like wings to frighten her.\nWhen she got to the front of the Ayabun house in Muika-machi, completely \nout of breath from running, she noticed that the sound of the flapping sleeves \nhad stopped. She thought she was safe and turned around to take a look. The \nmonster was standing directly behind her and was taller than the three-story \nroof on the Ayabun house. She took off running again with all her might until \nshe got to her relative\u2019s house. Having run so hard, her legs swelled, never to \nreturn to normal. This story is from the 1870s. (168-172",
