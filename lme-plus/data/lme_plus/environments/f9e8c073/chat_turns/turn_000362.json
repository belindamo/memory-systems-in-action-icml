  "content": "I think it's great to reflect on the bereavement support group. It was really helpful in processing my emotions and feeling less alone in my grief. I remember the facilitator was very kind and understanding, and the other group members were all going through similar experiences. It was nice to have a space to share my story and listen to others without fear of judgment. I think what worked well was the sense of community and the guidance of the facilitator. It was a safe space to express my emotions and work through my feelings.",
