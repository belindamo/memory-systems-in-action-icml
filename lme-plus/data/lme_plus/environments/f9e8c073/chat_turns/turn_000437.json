  "content": "Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA in 1977 to study the outer Solar System and beyond. After more than 44 years in space, Voyager 1 is now located in the interstellar medium, the region of space outside the Solar System that is filled with gas and dust from other stars.\n\nVoyager 1 generates power using three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which convert the heat generated by the decay of radioactive isotopes into electrical energy. The RTGs use a type of radioactive material called plutonium-238, which has a half-life of about 87.7 years, meaning that it takes this amount of time for half of the radioactive material to decay.\n\nEach RTG contains about 24 pounds (11 kilograms) of plutonium-238 and has a total power output of about 470 watts at the time of launch. The power output has decreased over time due to the decay of the plutonium-238, but the generators still provide enough power to operate the spacecraft's systems and communicate with Earth.\n\nVoyager 1's power system has been remarkably reliable over the years, providing continuous power for more than four decades. The RTGs are designed to last for many years, and NASA engineers have carefully monitored the power output of the generators to ensure that they continue to operate within safe limits.\n\nOverall, Voyager 1's power system is a remarkable example of how advanced technology and careful engineering can allow a spacecraft to continue operating for many years, even in the harsh conditions of deep space.",
