  "content": "The Voyager 1 spacecraft is powered by three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which use the heat generated by the natural radioactive decay of plutonium-238 to produce electricity.\n\nAt the time of launch in 1977, each RTG produced about 470 watts of power, but due to the natural decay of plutonium-238, the power output has declined over time. As of 2023, each RTG produces about 157 watts of power.\n\nBased on the rate of decay of the plutonium-238 and the current power output of the RTGs, NASA scientists estimate that the generators will produce enough power to keep the spacecraft's instruments and communication systems operational until about 2025, when the power output is expected to drop below the minimum required to keep the transmitter functioning.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that these are estimates based on current knowledge, and the RTGs could potentially last longer than expected. NASA engineers and scientists continue to monitor the power output of the RTGs and the overall health of the Voyager 1 spacecraft, and will do their best to keep the spacecraft operational for as long as possible.",
