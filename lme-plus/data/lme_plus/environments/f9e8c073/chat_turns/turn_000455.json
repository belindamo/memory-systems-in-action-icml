And what a great motivator hosting Thanksgiving dinner was for you! Sometimes, having a goal or event can help us stay on track with our self-care routines.\n\nI completely understand the feeling of looking forward to getting back into your routine after the holiday season. It can be challenging to maintain our usual habits during the holidays, but it's great that you're committed to getting back on track.\n\nAs you mentioned, the longer days of spring will be a welcome change, and it's a great time to reassess your skin care routine and make any necessary adjustments. You might consider lightening up on the moisturizer as the weather warms up, and incorporating some brighter, lighter products into your routine.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself and your skin throughout the year. It's okay to indulge every now and then, and it's all about finding a balance that works for you. Keep up the great work, and I'm sure your skin will continue to thrive!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you a wonderful winter and a happy, healthy new year!",
