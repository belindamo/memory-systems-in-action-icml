  "content": "R.C. Sproul is discussing the three key concepts of the authority of scripture, which include inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. Inspiration refers to the origin of the content of scripture and how it was divinely revealed through human authors. Inerrancy has been a controversial term and has often been associated with backwoods fundamentalism, but Sproul explains that in classical Christian theology, it refers to the accuracy and truth of scripture without error in any of its parts. The International Council on Biblical Inerrancy was formed to study the matter and published a document of affirmations and denials to clearly define the concept. Sproul recommends his book, \"Explaining Inerrancy\" for those looking to understand the intricacies of the debate.",
