However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time information about specific art supply stores or their locations. I was providing general suggestions and ideas to help you explore your city's art scene.\n\nSince you've heard about the art supply store on 5th Street, I recommend checking their website, social media, or giving them a call to confirm their hours, location, and availability of supplies. You can also ask about any upcoming events, workshops, or classes they might be hosting.\n\nWho knows, you might indeed run into some local artists or writers at the store, and it could be a great opportunity to network, learn about their projects, and get inspired. Don't hesitate to strike up a conversation and ask about their experiences in the city's art scene.\n\nRemember to enjoy your visit, and I hope you find some great art supplies and inspiration for your own creative projects!",
