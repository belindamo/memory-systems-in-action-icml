Reusable containers can hold your food without the need for single-use plastics.\n\n2. Look for local restaurants or cafes that use eco-friendly packaging. Many cafes and restaurants now offer takeout containers made from eco-friendly materials like biodegradable paper or bamboo.\n\n3. If you are not able to bring your container, choose to take out instead of getting delivery. This not only reduces the packaging used but also helps support local businesses.\n\n4.
