  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data and statistics. However, I can provide some general information on the ethnic diversity of Kedah's population. \n\nKedah is a state located in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia with a population of approximately 2 million people. The majority of the population are Malay, followed by Chinese, Indians, and other ethnic groups such as the Orang Asli, Siamese, and others.\n\nIt is worth noting that the ethnic diversity of Kedah's population, as well as the rest of Malaysia, is heavily influenced by the country's historical and political background, as well as its cultural and religious diversity. Over the years, Malaysia's population has been shaped by immigration and intermarriage, resulting in a unique blend of cultures and traditions.\n\nRegarding the changes in Kedah's ethnic diversity over the past 10 years, I am unable to provide specific information without the latest data and statistics. It would be best to refer to reliable sources or consult with a local authority for more accurate and up-to-date information.",
