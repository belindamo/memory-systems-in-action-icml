  "content": "I like the idea of creating a memory box. I have a few items that belonged to my grandmother, like her locket and a handwritten recipe book. I think it would be nice to gather those items and add some photos and other mementos to create a special box that I can reflect on whenever I want to remember her. Do you have any suggestions on how to organize the items in the box or any specific types of items that I should include?",
