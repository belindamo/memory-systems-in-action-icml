  "content": "I think I'll start with \"Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail\" by Cheryl Strayed. I've heard great things about it and I've always been interested in memoirs. I'm also curious about the self-help books you mentioned, especially \"Daring Greatly\" by Bren\u00e9 Brown. I've heard her TED talks and found them really inspiring. I'll probably check out her book as well. By the way, I was thinking about the bereavement support group I attended last year. I remember attending five sessions and finding it really helpful in processing my emotions.",
