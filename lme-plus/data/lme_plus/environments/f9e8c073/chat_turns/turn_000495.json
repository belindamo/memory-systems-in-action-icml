Woody and floral: Layer a woody fragrance like sandalwood or cedar with a floral scent like rose or jasmine. 2. Fresh and citrusy: Combine a fresh scent like mint or eucalyptus with a citrusy scent like lemon or grapefruit. 3. Spicy and sweet: Mix a spicy scent like cinnamon or clove with a sweet scent like vanilla or caramel. 4. Fruity and floral: Combine a fruity scent like peach or strawberry with a floral scent like lavender or ylang-ylang. 5. Musk and marine: Pair a musky scent such as patchouli or musk with a fresh marine scent that reminds you of the ocean. Remember that these are just suggestions, and there are no hard and fast rules when mixing fragrances. Experiment until you find the perfect combination that suits your personal taste.",
