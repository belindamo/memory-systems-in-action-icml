In the summer, when he was not in the mood \nfor blacksmithing, he became absorbed with fishing. One time, when he went \nfishing for river trout (iwana), he caught enough fish to fill a bamboo basket.\nHe was returning on a mountain road when he came to a stone marker desig\u0002nating the entrance to the village. There was a small Buddhist monk\u2013like ghost \nfigure with a shaven head standing in the grass. Wondering who it might be, \nhe looked, and the figure became larger and larger, becoming a huge monster \n(norikoshi) seeming to penetrate the clouds. Shocked, Gonzo is said to have run \nall the way home. (163-171)\nO\nAccording to Tetsuzo of Tsuchibuchi village, there are many strange things \nthat happen in the Taimagura Pond across from Oguni village on Mt. Haya\u0002chine. A man from Shimomura went fishing for iwana and came across a red\u0002faced old man (tengu) and a young girl in the shadow of a rocky cavern deep \nin the mountains. They were dressed rather strangely. In the Taimagura area, \nthere are several spots where there were ancient rock dwellings on both sides of \na stream. The dwellings were almost circular, only about three meters wide, and \nthe open entrance was one meter high. It is said that at one time people lived \nthere. Even now, it seems that someone is there. Tetsuzo, who told this story, \nsays that if he listens carefully while he is fishing, he can hear a cock crow nearby. \nThis story is from about ten years ago. (164-121)\nO\nThere was a man who came to Yamada Bay in Shimohei from Sekiguchi \nvalley to buy things on market days. His face was hairy, and the color of his \neyes was unusual. The locals doubted that he was a normal human being, so \nthey killed him and then buried him on the \u201clarger island\u201d in Yamada Bay. \nKilling him was one thing, but since then the number of fish being caught in \nthe bay has declined.\nThe larger island in Yamada Bay was also known as the \u201cDutch Island\u201d \nbecause the Dutch ship, the Breskens, landed there on June 10, 1643, in search \nof food and water supplies. The ship\u2019s crew was welcomed by the people of \nYamada, but on July 28, the crew was arrested and taken to the military shogun, \nTokugawa Iemitsu, in the national capital of Edo. The Dutch were imprisoned \n15\\_161-Morse.indb 75 5\\_161-Morse.indb 75 5/12/15 1:02 PM /12/15 1:02 PM\n76 FOLK LEGENDS FROM TONO\nfor four months. Around this time, European ships came to the area in search of \nJapanese gold mines.\nThis story was told by old man Tora of Tsuchibuchi village, who, when he \nwas young, would transport packhorses over to Yamada. (165-107)\nO\nThere was a hunter named Kikuchi Eisaku from Wano in Tochinai. He spent \na day hunting in the mountains of Oide near Mt. Hayachine. He was relying on \nthe soft evening light coming through the trees to find his way to a small hut \nwhen, all of a sudden, he came upon another man. The man\u2019s round eyes glared \ndefensively as he passed. Thinking it strange, the hunter asked him where he \nwas going. The man replied that he was going to a hut in the pastureland. The \nman pushed aside the dense brush and scurried off.\nSasaki Kizen was a friend of this hunter, and the story was heard directly from \nhim. It was unlikely that there would be anyone in the hut in the pasture in win\u0002ter. It was also hard to discern the man\u2019s features in the dim evening light, but he \nwore a fairly common tight-sleeved, rough linen coat and had a bag-like object \nmade from wisteria vines hanging from his shoulder. He was about two meters \ntall and about the same age as the hunter. This was in the winter of 1913. At that \ntime, the hunter was a youthful twenty-five or twenty-six years old. (166-106)\nO\nThis story is from around 1920. A child from Komaki in Matsuzaki village \nencountered a large man on Mt. Nishinai. It was just past noon one day during \nSeptember or October when people gather bush clover (hagi) to be used as feed \nfor their horses. The child peeked out from behind the bushes and saw a large man \nwearing a common tight-sleeved, rough cotton coat. He had a bag-like object made \nfrom wisteria vines hanging from his shoulder, and the bag had a number of snakes \nsquirming around inside. Frightened, the child crouched down in the bushes, and \nthe man passed right in front of him in great haste. Feeling relieved that he was \nalive, he took off running back to the village. I heard this story from some young \npeople one night in January when children play New Year\u2019s games. (167-105)\nO\nThe wife of a cloth dyer in Shinmachi went to see how her sick relative in \nShimokumi-cho was feeling. Around nine o\u2019clock in the evening, she came to \n15\\_161-Morse.indb 76 5\\_161-Morse.indb 76 5/12/15 1:02 PM /12/15 1:02 PM\n S U RV I VA L O N T H E E D G E 7 7\nthe corner of Shimoyoko-cho, and there was a priest-like monster (dainyudo)\nabout three meters tall standing there. Terrified, she ran off, chased by the mon\u0002ster flapping its coat sleeves like wings to frighten her.\nWhen she got to the front of the Ayabun house in Muika-machi, completely \nout of breath from running, she noticed that the sound of the flapping sleeves \nhad stopped. She thought she was safe and turned around to take a look. The \nmonster was standing directly behind her and was taller than the three-story \nroof on the Ayabun house. She took off running again with all her might until \nshe got to her relative\u2019s house. Having run so hard, her legs swelled, never to \nreturn to normal. This story is from the 1870s. (168-172"

      "content": "Gonzo was a master of river fishing. When he wasn't in the mood for blacksmithing during the summer, he'd get lost in his fishing adventures. One day, while fishing for river trout, he caught enough to fill a bamboo basket! As he walked back home along a mountain road, he saw a tiny, monk-like ghost near a stone marker. Curious, he stared at it, but the little ghost grew bigger and bigger, becoming a huge monster reaching the clouds. Poor Gonzo was so frightened that he sprinted all the way home!\n\nTetsuzo from Tsuchibuchi village said that many strange things happened near Taimagura Pond on Mt. Hayachine. A man from Shimomura went fishing for trout and spotted a red-faced old man and a young girl, both dressed oddly, in the shadows of a mountain cave. In Taimagura, there were ancient rock dwellings by a stream. People once lived in those small, circular homes with tiny entrances. Tetsuzo, who shared this tale, said he could still hear a rooster crowing nearby when he listened closely while fishing. This story is about ten years old.\n\nA hairy-faced man with odd-colored eyes visited Yamada Bay in Shimohei from Sekiguchi valley to buy things during market days. The locals doubted he was human, so they killed him and buried him on the \"larger island\" in the bay. But ever since then, there have been fewer fish in the bay. The island was also known as \"Dutch Island\" because a Dutch ship called the Breskens landed there in 1643, searching for food and water. They were welcomed but later arrested and imprisoned for four months. European ships often visited the area, looking for Japanese gold mines. Old man Tora from Tsuchibuchi village shared this story.\n\nA hunter named Kikuchi Eisaku was hunting in the mountains of Oide near Mt. Hayachine when he stumbled upon a man with round, defensive eyes. Confused, he asked the man where he was going, and the man said he was heading to a hut in the pastureland. The man hurried away through the thick brush. It was unlikely anyone would be in that hut during winter, and it was hard to see the man's face in the dim light. But he was tall, wore a common coat, and carried a bag made from wisteria vines. This happened in the winter of 1913.\n\nIn the early 1920s, a child from Komaki in Matsuzaki village saw a large man on Mt. Nishinai. It was around noon during the time when people collected bush clover for their horses. Peeking from behind some bushes, the child saw the man wearing a common coat and carrying a wisteria vine bag full of wriggling snakes! The frightened child hid in the bushes, and the man hurried past. Relieved, the child raced back to the village. The story was shared during a night of New Year's games.\n\nThe wife of a cloth dyer went to check on her sick relative in Shimokumi-cho. As she approached Shimoyoko-cho around nine in the evening, she saw a giant, priest-like monster standing there. Scared, she ran, with the monster chasing her and flapping its coat sleeves like wings. She finally stopped, thinking she had lost it, but the monster was right behind her, even taller than a three-story building! She ran again, reaching her relative's house, but her legs swelled from the effort and never returned to normal. This story is from the 1870s."
