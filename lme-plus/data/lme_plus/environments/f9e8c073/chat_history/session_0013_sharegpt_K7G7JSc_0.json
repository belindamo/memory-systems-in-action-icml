      "content": "rewrite: Our aims for this project are to characterize and understand the optimal geometry of Supervised Contrastive Loss (SCL) first proposed by Khosla et. al (2020) to train classification neural networks. Primarily, our interests lie in the neural collapse (NC) phenomena (Papyan et. al 2020) where the last layer representations (embeddings) and the weights of the classification head align and form an equiangular tight frame (ETF) structure. The NC phenomena was first characterized and analyzed for neural networks optimized with Cross-Entropy (CE) Loss. However, recent work has shown that the ETF structure is the optimal geometry for SCL (Graf et al. 2021). Our hope is to fill in the gaps by approaching the problem from an optimization perspective. With this, we see potential in characterizing the geometry once again as an ETF but in addition we will analyze the data-imbalanced setting akin to what was recently accomplished for CE (Thrampoulidis et al. 2022). This approach has a few advantages: (a) we would be able to apply an established optimization framework in order to further understand SCL; (b) it offers the potential to explore modified geometries due to added constraints, such as those imposed by some modern neural networks. Modern deep learning has been moving towards larger models like Transformers trained via unsupervised means, furthermore, recent works have suggested an increased robustness to distributional imbalances in this setting. This work provides a stepping stone in understanding the implicit geometry of unsupervised settings through understanding self-similarity metrics like SCL which are at the core of unsupervised learning."

Our goal is to characterize and analyze the ETF structure in the data-imbalanced setting, similar to recent work accomplished for CE (Thrampoulidis et al., 2022). This approach has several advantages. First, we can apply an established optimization framework to gain further insights into SCL.

      "content": "In recent years, similarity metrics have gained significant traction in the field of machine learning. One such metric that has shown promising results is Supervised Contrastive Loss (SCL). SCL is a similarity metric that has been used to train neural networks for various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and speech recognition.\n\nThe motivation behind SCL lies in its ability to learn a representation space where similar examples are closer together and dissimilar examples are farther apart. This is achieved by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs (samples that belong to the same class) and minimizing the similarity between negative pairs (samples that belong to different classes). By doing so, SCL encourages the neural network to learn a discriminative feature space that can accurately classify unseen examples.\n\nThe success of SCL in various machine learning tasks has led to its increased use in practical applications. As a result, understanding the optimal geometry of SCL has become an important research direction. By characterizing the optimal geometry of SCL, we can gain insights into how to design more efficient and effective neural networks that can accurately classify unseen examples."
