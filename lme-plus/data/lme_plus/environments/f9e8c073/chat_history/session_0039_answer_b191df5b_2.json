This will help you focus on progress rather than feeling overwhelmed.\n2. **Create a routine**: Establish a consistent workout schedule, even if it's just 10-15 minutes a day. Consistency is key to developing habits.\n3. **Track progress**: Use a fitness app, journal, or take progress photos. Seeing your progress can be a great motivator.\n4. **Find an accountability partner**: Share your goals with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can be a great way to stay motivated.\n5. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for reaching milestones or completing a certain number of workouts. Choose something that brings you joy, like a relaxing bath, a favorite meal, or a fun activity.\n6. **Focus on how you feel**: Remember that exercise is not just about physical appearance; it can also improve your mental health and energy levels. Focus on how regular exercise makes you feel, rather than how you look.\n7. **Be kind to yourself**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a workout or don't see immediate results.

Try new exercises, or change the order of your routine.\n4. **Make it a habit**: Incorporate bodyweight exercises into your daily routine, like right after waking up or during commercial breaks while watching TV.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to find a routine that works for you and that you enjoy. Exercise should be a positive experience that makes you feel good, both physically and mentally.\n\nHow do you feel about starting with bodyweight exercises?
