Water quality: According to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), water quality in the River Clyde has improved over the past decade. There has been a reduction in organic pollution, which has helped to improve the health of the river's ecosystem.\n\n2. Fish populations: The fish populations in the River Clyde have been relatively stable in recent years, indicating that the river's ecological health is being maintained.\n\n3. Riverbank restoration: Several riverbank restoration projects have been completed, which have improved the habitats for aquatic life.\n\n4. Community involvement: Community involvement in environmental programs and initiatives has increased in recent years. This has helped to raise awareness about the importance of maintaining the health of River Clyde's ecosystems and encouraged people to play an active role in preserving these ecosystems.\n\nThese improvements are promising signs that the steps being taken to ensure the health of River Clyde's ecosystems are working. However, more work needs to be done to sustain these improvements and ensure the long-term health of the river and its ecosystems.",
