  "content": "Yes, cooperation among countries is crucial for addressing climate change as it is a global issue that affects everyone regardless of their location or socio-economic status. The transition to a low-carbon economy requires collective efforts, and the support of developed countries to developing nations in this regard is particularly important to ensure that they are not left behind. The international community has recognized the need for joint action, and countries are increasingly committing to reducing their emissions and promoting clean energy as part of their climate change action plans. Let's hope that more countries will continue to join in the efforts to combat climate change and support developing nations in their transition to clean energy, so that we can work towards a sustainable future.",
