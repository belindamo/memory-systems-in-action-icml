  "content": "I'm trying to find some new music to listen to. I've been to a lot of great concerts lately, like the Billie Eilish show in Philly. But in between those big events, I've also really enjoyed some smaller local music nights, like a jazz night at a local bar today, enjoying live music in a more intimate setting. Do you have any recommendations for new artists or albums I might like?",
