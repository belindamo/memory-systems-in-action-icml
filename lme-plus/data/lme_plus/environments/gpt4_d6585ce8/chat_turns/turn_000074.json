  "content": "Yes, absolutely! Golden Milk Latte is a great recipe to use with non-dairy milk alternatives like almond milk, coconut milk, or soy milk. In fact, many people prefer to use non-dairy milk as it can offer additional health benefits and complement the spices in the recipe. Simply substitute your favorite non-dairy milk in place of the dairy milk in the recipe and follow the same instructions. Hope you enjoy your dairy-free Golden Milk Latte!",
