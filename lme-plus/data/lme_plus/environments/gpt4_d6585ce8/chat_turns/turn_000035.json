  "content": "There are different types of nanomaterials and their applications are as follows:\n\n1. Nanoparticles- They are tiny particles with a size range of 1-100 nanometers. These are used in drug delivery, cosmetics, electronics, and optics.\n\n2. Nanotubes- These are cylindrical structures made up of carbon atoms. They are used in nanoelectronics, batteries, and fuel cells.\n\n3. Nanowires- These are thin wires with a diameter of a few nanometers. These are used in nanoelectronics, energy storage devices, and sensors.\n\n4. Quantum Dots- These are tiny semiconductor particles with a size range of 2-10 nanometers. These are used in biological imaging, displays, and lighting.\n\n5. Carbon Nanotubes- These are tubular structures made of carbon atoms. These are used in nanoelectronics, composites, and sensors.\n\n6. Graphene- These are flat sheets of single-layer carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. These are used in sensors, batteries, and energy storage devices.\n\n7. Nanoceramics- These are ceramics with a grain size of a few nanometers. These are used in coatings, catalysts, and biomedical implants.\n\n8. Dendrimers- These are highly branched molecules with a size range of 1-20 nanometers. These are used in drug delivery, catalysts, and biomedical imaging.\n\n9. Nanoporous Materials- These are materials with tiny pores in their structure. These are used in catalysis, gas separation, and water purification.",
