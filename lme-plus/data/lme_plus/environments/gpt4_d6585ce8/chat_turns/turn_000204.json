Congratulations on racking up those loyalty points!\n\nNew York City has plenty of amazing hotels to choose from, and I'd be happy to help you narrow down some options. The Westin is a great choice, but let's explore some other possibilities based on your recent travels and preferences.\n\nSince you've been to Chicago, San Francisco, and Miami, I'll assume you're familiar with urban landscapes and might appreciate hotels with a similar vibe. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **The Westin New York at Times Square**: As you mentioned, this is a great option, especially if you want to be in the heart of the action. Its convenient location, modern amenities, and comfortable rooms make it a popular choice.\n2. **The Hyatt Centric Times Square**: If you're looking for a similar location to The Westin, but with a more boutique-hotel feel, consider The Hyatt Centric. It offers stylish rooms, a rooftop bar, and a great fitness center.\n3. **The Renaissance New York Times Square Hotel**: This Marriott property is another great option in the Times Square area. It boasts a rooftop lounge with stunning views, a fitness center, and a convenient location for exploring the city.\n4. **The Kimpton Hotel Eventi**: If you're looking for a more boutique-hotel experience, The Kimpton Eventi is a great choice. It's located in the NoMad neighborhood, which offers a more laid-back atmosphere while still being close to major attractions.\n5. **The Langham, New York, Fifth Avenue**: For a more luxurious experience, consider The Langham. This upscale hotel is located on Fifth Avenue, offering easy access to Central Park, the Met, and other iconic landmarks.\n\nSince you've been accumulating loyalty points, you might want to consider hotels within your loyalty program or ones that offer reciprocal benefits. For example, if you have points with Marriott or Hyatt, you might want to prioritize their properties.\n\nWhat's your priority for this trip? Are you looking for a specific location, a certain level of luxury, or a particular amenity (e.g., rooftop bar, fitness center, or free breakfast)?",
