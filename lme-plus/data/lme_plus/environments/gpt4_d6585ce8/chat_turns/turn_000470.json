Roast in the oven until crispy.\n2. **Vegan Energy Balls**: Mix rolled oats, nut butter (e.g., peanut butter, almond butter), and honey or maple syrup in a bowl. Add chocolate chips or cocoa powder for an extra treat. Roll into bite-sized balls and refrigerate until firm.\n3. **Kale Chips**: Massage kale leaves with olive oil, salt, and your favorite seasonings. Bake in the oven until crispy, or use a dehydrator for a healthier, crisper snack.\n4. **Trail Mix**: Combine nuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, walnuts), seeds (e.g., pumpkin, sunflower), and dried fruit (e.g., cranberries, raisins).
