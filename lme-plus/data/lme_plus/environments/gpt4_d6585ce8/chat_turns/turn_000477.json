  "content": "I didn't think you'd know the specific restaurant, but I thought I'd ask anyway! The restaurant is actually new in town, and it's been a game-changer for me as a vegan. I've been trying to cut down on my sugary snack intake, so it's nice to have a reliable spot for comfort food that's still vegan-friendly.\n\nAs for modifications, I've been thinking of trying to recreate their mac and cheese recipe at home, but I haven't had a chance to experiment yet. I might try adding some steamed broccoli or bell peppers to give it an extra nutritional boost.\n\nSpeaking of nutrition, do you have any tips on how to ensure I'm getting enough protein on a vegan diet? I've been relying on tofu and legumes a lot, but I want to make sure I'm covering all my bases.",
