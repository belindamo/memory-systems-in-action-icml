Here's one that's sure to impress:\n\n**Lemon Tart Recipe**\n\n**Crust:**\n\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 3 large egg yolks\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 2-3 lemons)\n* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted\n* 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest\n* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n**Assembly and Baking:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. **Make the crust:** In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt. Add the cold butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work it into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Press the mixture into a 9-inch (23cm) tart pan with a removable bottom. Trim the edges and prick the bottom with a fork. Chill for 15 minutes.\n3. **Bake the crust:** Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and pie weights or beans, and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until lightly golden. Let cool completely.\n4. **Make the filling:** In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until pale yellow. Add the lemon juice, melted butter, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth.\n5. **Assemble and bake the tart:** Pour the lemon filling into the cooled tart crust. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set and the edges are lightly puffed.\n6. **Chill and serve:** Let the tart cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Serve chilled, garnished with whipped cream or a sprinkle of confectioners' sugar, if desired.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use high-quality, fresh lemons for the best flavor.\n* Don't overmix the filling, as it can become too thick and scrambled.\n* For a more golden crust, brush it with a little beaten egg before baking.\n* Consider adding a layer of frangipane (almond paste) or a sprinkle of powdered sugar to the tart for added flavor and texture.\n* Make individual mini tarts for a fun dessert or party favor.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!
