I'd be happy to help you find a good deal on a Marriott hotel.\n\nFirst, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal travel history or previous bookings. However, I can still provide you with some general information and tips to help you find a good deal on a Marriott hotel in San Francisco.\n\nMarriott has several properties in San Francisco, each with its own unique features and price points. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Marriott Marquis San Francisco**: This is a popular hotel located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, near Union Square. It's a 4-star hotel with modern amenities and comfortable rooms.\n2. **Courtyard by Marriott San Francisco Downtown**: This 3-star hotel is also located in the downtown area, within walking distance to Chinatown and the Financial District. It's a great option for those looking for a more affordable rate without sacrificing comfort.\n3. **JW Marriott San Francisco Union Square**: If you're looking for a luxurious experience, this 5-star hotel is located in the heart of Union Square, with upscale amenities and stunning views of the city.\n\nTo find deals on Marriott hotels in San Francisco, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Check the Marriott website**: Visit Marriott's official website and look for their \"Deals & Packages\" section, where you can find discounted rates, special offers, and package deals.\n2. **Use travel booking websites**: Websites like Expedia, Booking.com, and Hotels.com often have competitive rates and discounts on Marriott hotels.\n3. **Look for AAA or AARP discounts**: If you're a member of AAA or AARP, you may be eligible for exclusive discounts on Marriott hotels.\n4. **Consider off-peak travel**: Prices for hotels in San Francisco tend to be lower during the off-season (usually November to March).\n5. **Use travel apps**: Apps like Hotel Tonight or Last Minute Travel offer last-minute deals on unsold rooms, which can be a great way to score a discount.\n\nAs for your previous stay at the Marriott Hotel in San Francisco, I'm happy to hear that you had a good experience! Unfortunately, I don't have access to your booking history, so I can't replicate the exact deal you got. However, I hope these tips will help you find a similar or even better deal for your next stay.\n\nRemember to always compare prices across different websites and book in advance to secure the best rates.
