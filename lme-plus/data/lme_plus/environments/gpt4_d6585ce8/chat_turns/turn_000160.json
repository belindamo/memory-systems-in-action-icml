  "content": "I'm currently 5'8\" and 170 pounds. My workout routine is pretty consistent - I go to the gym three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 7 am. On Mondays, I do cardio exercises like treadmill running and elliptical training for 30 minutes, followed by weightlifting focusing on my upper body. On Wednesdays, I take a yoga class at 8 am, and on Fridays, I do weightlifting focusing on my legs. I'm looking to focus on a combination of both weightlifting and cardio to reach my goal. I don't have any physical limitations or injuries, and I'm willing to commit to working out three days a week.",
