Here's a simple way to estimate your 1RM:\n\n1. Think about the heaviest weight you've lifted for a given exercise in the past week or two. This is your \"current working weight.\"\n2. Multiply your current working weight by 0.9 (90%) to estimate your 1RM. This is a rough estimate, but it'll give you a good starting point.\n\nFor example, let's say your current working weight for squats is 100 pounds. Your estimated 1RM would be:\n\n100 pounds x 0.9 = 90 pounds\n\n**Calculating the Warm-up Weight:**\n\nTo calculate the warm-up weight, which is 10-15% lighter than your estimated 1RM, you can use the following formula:\n\nWarm-up weight = Estimated 1RM x 0.85 (or 0.80 for a more conservative estimate)\n\nUsing the previous example:\n\nWarm-up weight = 90 pounds x 0.85 = 76.5 pounds\n\nSo, your warm-up set for squats would be 1 set of 8-10 reps with 76.5 pounds.\n\n**Tracking Your Progress:**\n\nAs you get stronger, you'll need to adjust your estimated 1RM and warm-up weights accordingly. You can do this by:\n\n1. Periodically re-testing your 1RM for each exercise.\n2. Keeping track of your workout logs and noting the weights you're lifting.\n3. Adjusting your warm-up weights based on your progress.\n\nRemember, the goal is to challenge yourself and make progress over time. If you're unsure about your 1RM or warm-up weights, it's always better to err on the side of caution and start with a lighter weight. You can always increase the weight as you get stronger.\n\nDoes this help clarify things?",
