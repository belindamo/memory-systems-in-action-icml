I've had a good experience with Marriott hotels in the past, actually, I stayed at the Marriott Hotel in San Francisco a few weeks before my Chicago trip, from March 28th to 31st, and got a discounted rate of $120 per night through their website. Do you have any recommendations or deals for Marriott hotels in San Francisco?",
