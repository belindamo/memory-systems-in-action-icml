This system required managers to rank employees into three categories (top performers, average performers, and bottom performers) and then eliminate the bottom 10% of employees each year. While controversial, this evaluation system forced managers to identify and address performance issues, leading to increased productivity and profitability at GE.\n\n2) Google: Google has a performance evaluation system called \"Objectives and Key Results\" (OKRs) which sets specific goals and metrics for each employee to achieve. This evaluation system encourages employees to focus on measurable outcomes and align their work with the company's overall objectives. By using OKRs, Google has been able to improve employee performance and achieve significant growth.\n\n3) Procter & Gamble (P&G): P&G introduced a performance evaluation system called \"Leadership Blueprint\" which focused on developing leadership skills in its employees. The system provided employees with a self-assessment tool and a development plan to help them improve their skills and advance their careers within the company. By investing in its employees' development, P&G was able to create a more skilled and engaged workforce.\n\n4) Toyota: Toyota uses a performance evaluation system called \"Hoshin Kanri\" which translates to \"strategic goal deployment.\" This evaluation system involves setting overarching strategic goals for the company and then cascading those goals down to each department and individual employee. By aligning everyone's work with the company's strategic goals, Toyota has been able to improve efficiency and productivity while maintaining high levels of quality.",
