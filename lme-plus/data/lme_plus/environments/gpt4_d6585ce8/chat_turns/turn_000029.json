  "content": "George Washington did not free all of his slaves when he died because at the time, it was a common practice among slave-owning plantation owners to keep slaves as property and pass them down to their heirs. Additionally, Washington was also concerned about the economic loss that would result from freeing all of his slaves, as they were a significant source of labor on his estate.\n\nHe did not free all of his slaves, but he did free some of them. He freed his slaves in his will, and his will also provided for the emancipation of any enslaved person who had served him for at least 30 years or who was above the age of 60. However, in his will, he made it clear that the slaves he freed were to be \"bound to service\" until the age of 26 for males, and the age of 24 for females.\n\nHe also left 123 slaves in the custody of his wife Martha and instructed her to provide for them, but not to free them. After his death, his wife Martha freed some of the slaves and kept others as inherited property.",
