However, there are other transportation options available:\n\n1. **Taxi or Ride-hailing**: You can easily hail a taxi or use ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft to get to and from the hotel.\n2. **Public Transportation**: The hotel is within walking distance to several public transportation options, including the F-line streetcar, which runs along the Embarcadero and connects to other parts of the city. You can also take the Muni Metro (T-line) at the Embarcadero Station, which is about a 10-minute walk from the hotel.\n3. **Walking or Biking**: If you're feeling energetic, you can walk or bike to many attractions in the Fisherman's Wharf area. The hotel offers bike rentals if you're interested.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Courtyard by Marriott San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf is located in a busy tourist area, and parking can be limited. If you're planning to drive, be prepared for narrow streets and potential parking challenges.\n\nRegarding your previous stay at the Marriott Hotel in San Francisco, I'm not aware of any specific shuttle service they offered to a wedding venue. It's possible that it was a one-time arrangement or a special service for a specific event. If you have any more questions about that, feel free to ask!\n\nI hope this information helps, and I'm here if you have any more questions about your upcoming stay!",
