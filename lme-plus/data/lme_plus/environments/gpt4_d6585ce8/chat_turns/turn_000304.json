  "content": "Fisherman's Wharf is a great area to stay in San Francisco, with plenty of seafood restaurants, street performers, and stunning views of the Bay Bridge and Alcatraz.\n\nMarriott has a few properties near Fisherman's Wharf, but I'll highlight two options for you:\n\n1. **Courtyard by Marriott San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf**: This 3-star hotel is located just a block away from the waterfront and offers comfortable rooms with modern amenities. You'll be within walking distance to Pier 39, Ghirardelli Square, and the famous Fisherman's Wharf seafood restaurants.\n2. **Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf**: This 3-star hotel is another great option in the area, offering spacious rooms and suites with kitchenettes. It's about a 5-minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf and has a rooftop deck with great views of the Bay Bridge.\n\nBoth of these hotels offer a convenient location and comfortable accommodations, but keep in mind that they may not be directly on the waterfront. If you're looking for a waterfront hotel, you might consider other brands or properties in the area.\n\nTo find deals on these hotels, I recommend checking the Marriott website, as well as travel booking websites like Expedia, Booking.com, or Hotels.com. You can also try using travel apps like Hotel Tonight or Last Minute Travel for last-minute deals.\n\nRemember to compare prices and amenities across different websites to find the best fit for your needs and budget.",
