The density is a common characteristic of gluten-free baked goods, but it's awesome that it was still delicious.\n\nNow, let's talk about low-carb baking! I'm more than happy to help you with tips and recipes for low-carb cheesecakes.\n\n**Low-Carb Cheesecake Tips:**\n\n1. **Choose the right sweetener:** Sugar substitutes like stevia, erythritol, or monk fruit sweetener can help reduce the carb count. You can also use a combination of sweeteners to achieve the right flavor.\n2. **Use a nut-based crust:** Almond flour or pecan crusts are great alternatives to traditional graham cracker crusts. They're lower in carbs and add a delicious nutty flavor.\n3. **Select a low-carb cream cheese:** Some cream cheese brands have fewer carbs than others. Look for brands with fewer than 5g of carbs per ounce.\n4. **Eggs are your friend:** Eggs provide structure and moisture to the cheesecake. They're also relatively low in carbs.\n5. **Don't overmix:** Overmixing can lead to a dense, tough cheesecake. Mix the ingredients just until they're combined.\n\n**Low-Carb Cheesecake Recipe:**\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups almond flour\n* 1/4 cup granulated sweetener (like Swerve or Erythritol)\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted\n* 2 pounds cream cheese (low-carb brand)\n* 4 large eggs\n* 1/2 cup sour cream\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C).\n2. Prepare the crust by mixing the almond flour and granulated sweetener in a bowl. Add the melted butter and mix until the crust comes together. Press into a 9-inch springform pan.\n3. In a blender or food processor, blend the cream cheese, eggs, sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon zest until smooth.\n4. Pour the cheesecake batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.\n5. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly.\n6. Let the cheesecake cool completely before refrigerating for at least 4 hours.\n\n**Macro breakdown:**\n\nPer serving (1 slice, 1/12 of the cheesecake):\n\n* Calories: 320\n* Protein: 24g\n* Fat: 26g\n* Carbohydrates: 5g\n* Fiber: 2g\n* Net Carbs: 3g\n\nFeel free to experiment with different sweeteners, flavorings, and crusts to find your perfect low-carb cheesecake recipe!",
