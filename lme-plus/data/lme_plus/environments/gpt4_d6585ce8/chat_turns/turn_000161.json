Based on your current workout routine and goals, I'll create a structured plan to help you reach your goal of losing 10 pounds in two months.\n\n**Workout Plan:**\n\nTo achieve your goal, we'll focus on a combination of weightlifting and cardio exercises, with an emphasis on progressive overload (increasing weight or reps over time) to build muscle mass and boost metabolism. We'll also incorporate High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) cardio to enhance fat loss.\n\n**Monday (Chest and Triceps):**\n\n1. Warm-up: 5-minute cardio (treadmill or elliptical)\n2. Weightlifting:\n\t* Barbell Bench Press (3 sets of 8-12 reps)\n\t* Incline Dumbbell Press (3 sets of 10-15 reps)\n\t* Tricep Pushdown (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n\t* Tricep Dips (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n3. HIIT Cardio: 20-30 minutes, alternating between 30 seconds of high-intensity exercise and 30 seconds of rest. Examples:\n\t* Sprints on the treadmill\n\t* Burpees\n\t* Jump squats\n\t* Mountain climbers\n4. Cool-down: 5-minute stretching\n\n**Wednesday (Yoga Day):**\n\n1. Attend your usual yoga class at 8 am. This will help with flexibility, balance, and recovery.\n\n**Friday (Legs and Shoulders):**\n\n1. Warm-up: 5-minute cardio (treadmill or elliptical)\n2. Weightlifting:\n\t* Squats (3 sets of 8-12 reps)\n\t* Leg Press (3 sets of 10-12 reps)\n\t* Standing Military Press (3 sets of 8-12 reps)\n\t* Lateral Raises (3 sets of 12-15 reps)\n3. HIIT Cardio: 20-30 minutes, following the same format as Monday\n4. Cool-down: 5-minute stretching\n\n**Progressive Overload:**\n\n* Increase the weight you lift by 2.5-5 pounds every two weeks, or as soon as you feel you can handle more.\n* Aim to increase the number of reps by 1-2 every week.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to warm up properly before each workout, and cool down afterwards to prevent injuries.\n* Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets, and 120-180 seconds between exercises.\n* Focus on proper form and technique throughout each exercise.\n* Incorporate different grip or stance variations to keep your workouts interesting and prevent plateaus.\n\n**Nutrition:**\n\nTo support your weight loss goal, aim to create a calorie deficit of 500-750 calories per day through a combination of diet and exercise. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* Eat protein-rich foods: 1.6-2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (so, around 120-140 grams for you)\n* Include complex carbohydrates: whole grains, fruits, and vegetables\n* Healthy fats: nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil\n* Drink plenty of water: at least 8-10 glasses per day\n* Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated fats\n\n**Monitoring Progress:**\n\n* Weigh yourself once a week, on the same day and time.\n* Take body measurements and progress photos every two weeks.\n* Track your workouts, including the weights, reps, and sets you complete.\n\nBy following this plan, you'll be well on your way to reaching your goal of losing 10 pounds in two months.
