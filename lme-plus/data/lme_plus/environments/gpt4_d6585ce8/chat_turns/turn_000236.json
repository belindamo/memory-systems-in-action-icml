But don't worry, I'm here to help you troubleshoot and provide some tips to ensure your next lemon tart is a success!\n\n**Soggy Crust:**\n\n1. **Overworking the dough:** You're right on the money! Overworking the dough can cause the gluten to develop, leading to a tough, soggy crust. To avoid this, try to mix the dough just until the ingredients come together in a ball. Stop mixing as soon as you see the dough start to form. Let it rest for a few minutes before rolling it out.\n2. **Incorrect ratio of ingredients:** Double-check your recipe to ensure you're using the right ratio of flour to fat (butter or shortening). A crust that's too rich in fat can be prone to sogginess.\n3. **Insufficient chilling:** Make sure you're chilling the dough long enough. This will help the gluten relax, making the dough easier to roll out and reducing the likelihood of a soggy crust.\n4. **Incorrect baking temperature:** If your oven is running too hot or too cold, it can affect the crust's texture. Invest in an oven thermometer to ensure your oven is at the correct temperature.\n\n**Too Sour Filling:**\n\n1. **Too much lemon juice:** Yeah, it's easy to get carried away with the lemon juice, but it's essential to taste as you go and adjust the acidity level to your taste. Start with a smaller amount of lemon juice and add more to taste.\n2. **Unbalanced flavors:** Lemon tart filling should be a delicate balance of sweet and sour. If your filling is too sour, it might be due to an imbalance of sugar and lemon juice. Adjust the amount of sugar to balance out the acidity.\n3. **Over-reduction:** If you're reducing the lemon juice to intensify the flavor, be careful not to overdo it. This can concentrate the acidity and make the filling too sour.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Use high-quality ingredients:** Fresh, high-quality lemons and real butter will make a huge difference in the flavor and texture of your tart.\n2. **Don't overmix:** Whether it's the dough or the filling, overmixing can lead to a tough, dense, or separated texture.\n3. **Taste as you go:** Taste the filling and crust as you go to adjust the seasoning and texture.\n4. **Practice makes perfect:** Don't be discouraged if your first attempt doesn't turn out perfectly. Keep trying, and you'll soon develop the skills and intuition to create a stunning lemon tart!\n\nNow, are you ready to give it another try?",
