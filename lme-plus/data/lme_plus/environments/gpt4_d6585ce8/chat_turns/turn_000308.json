  "content": "A room with a bay view sounds like a wonderful idea!\n\nThe Courtyard by Marriott San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf does offer some rooms with partial views of the San Francisco Bay, but I must clarify a few things:\n\n1. **Bay views are limited**: While the hotel is located near Fisherman's Wharf, not all rooms have a direct view of the bay. However, some rooms on higher floors (around 5-7) and on the north side of the building might offer partial views of the bay, including the Bay Bridge or Alcatraz Island.\n2. **Request a bay-view room**: If you want a room with a bay view, I recommend requesting it when you book your room or at check-in. Keep in mind that room assignments are subject to availability, and the hotel cannot guarantee a bay-view room.\n3. **Upgrade to a bay-view room**: If you're willing to splurge, you can consider upgrading to a room with a guaranteed bay view. The hotel might offer rooms with a \"Bay View\" or \"Water View\" designation, which typically come with a higher price tag.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a room with a bay view, I suggest:\n\n* Booking a room on a higher floor (5-7)\n* Requesting a north-facing room\n* Upgrading to a room with a guaranteed bay view (if available)\n* Being flexible with your travel dates and booking during the off-season (when possible)\n\nRemember to check the hotel's website or contact them directly for more information on room options and availability.",
