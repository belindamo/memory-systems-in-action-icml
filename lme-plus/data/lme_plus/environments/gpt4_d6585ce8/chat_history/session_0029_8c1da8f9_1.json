      "content": "Chicken fajitas are a classic Tex-Mex dish that's easy to make and packed with flavor. I'd be happy to guide you through the process and offer some tips on incorporating sumac and paprika into your recipe.\n\n**Basic Chicken Fajita Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into thin strips\n* 1/2 cup lime juice\n* 1/4 cup olive oil\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1/4 teaspoon paprika (smoked or sweet, your choice)\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 1 large onion, sliced\n* 2 large bell peppers (any color), sliced\n* 8 small flour tortillas\n* Optional toppings: avocado, sour cream, salsa, shredded cheese, cilantro, sumac\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine lime juice, olive oil, garlic, oregano, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.\n2. Add the chicken to the marinade, seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off.\n4. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.\n5. In the same skillet, add the sliced onions and bell peppers. Cook until they're tender and lightly charred, about 5-7 minutes.\n6. Add the cooked chicken back into the skillet and stir to combine with the vegetables.\n7. Warm the tortillas by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20-30 seconds.\n8. Assemble the fajitas by placing a portion of the chicken and vegetable mixture onto a tortilla and adding your desired toppings.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Sumac:** Add a pinch of sumac to the marinade or sprinkle it over the chicken and vegetables during cooking. Sumac adds a tangy, slightly sour flavor and a beautiful red color.\n* **Paprika:** Use smoked paprika for a deeper, smokier flavor or sweet paprika for a milder taste. You can also add a pinch of paprika to the vegetables while they're cooking for extra flavor.\n* **Spice it up:** Add diced jalape\u00f1os or serrano peppers to the skillet with the onions and bell peppers for an extra kick.\n* **Cumin and coriander:** Add a pinch of ground cumin and coriander to the marinade or sprinkle over the chicken and vegetables for added depth of flavor.\n* **Lime crema:** Mix together sour cream, lime juice, and a pinch of salt for a tangy and refreshing topping.\n* **Avocado salsa:** Mash ripe avocados with lime juice, salt, and a pinch of red pepper flakes for a creamy and spicy topping.\n\nFeel free to experiment with these tips and variations to make the recipe your own! If you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to ask."
