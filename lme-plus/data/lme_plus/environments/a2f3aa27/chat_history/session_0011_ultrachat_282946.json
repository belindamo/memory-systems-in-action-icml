This will help you save time and prevent any inconvenience. 2. Consider alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or taking a bus if they are available and safe. 3. Be aware of your surroundings, especially if you're walking or using public transportation at night. Avoid dangerous or poorly-lit areas. 4. Keep your valuables close and avoid flashing money or expensive items. Theft and pickpocketing can occur in any city, so it's important to be cautious. 5. When using a taxi or ride-sharing service, make sure to share your trip details and location with someone you trust. Keep your phone charged and readily available in case you need to make an emergency call. 6. Finally, be respectful of local customs and laws. Make an effort to learn a little bit about the culture of Harare before you visit, and be mindful of any potential social or cultural faux pas."
