      "content": "The Peshwas' system of taxation and revenue collection was primarily based on the land revenue and customs dues. The Peshwas levied taxes mainly on agriculture and trades while the artisan goods were mostly exempt from these taxes.\n\nThe land revenue was the most important source of revenue for the Peshwas. In this system, the land from which crops were grown was considered to be revenue-yielding, and the cultivators who cultivated that land were liable to pay taxes. The land revenue was divided into two categories, i.e., dry land and wetland. The tax rates for dry land were lower as compared to wetland, for example, the tax rate for dry land was three-fourth of the produce, and for wetland, it was half of the produce.\n\nApart from the land revenue, the Peshwas also levied taxes on mines, trade routes, tolls, and customs. The customs dues were paid by different merchants who had to pay taxes at the entrance of each port or city.\n\nThe taxes were collected by the revenue officials appointed by the Peshwas, and they were responsible for the overall collection of revenue. The Peshwas encouraged the officials to collect taxes efficiently and quickly. The revenue officials were paid a salary for the collection and handling of taxes.\n\nIn conclusion, the Peshwas' system of taxation and revenue collection was based on the land revenue and customs dues. The taxes were collected efficiently by the appointed officials. The land revenue was the most important source of revenue for the Peshwas, and the tax rates were different for dry land and wetland."

      "content": "Yes, there were penalties for the cultivators who failed to pay taxes on time. If a cultivator failed to pay the taxes on time, he had to pay a penalty, which was usually a fine. The amount of the penalty varied depending on the amount of the unpaid taxes and the period of delay.\n\nThe Peshwas also had provisions for confiscating the land of those who failed to pay taxes continually. In case of non-payment, the land was auctioned, and the defaulter was barred from participating in the auction. Moreover, cultivators who didn't pay taxes on time could also be imprisoned, and their property could be confiscated to recover the unpaid taxes.\n\nIn addition to this, the revenue officials who were appointed to collect taxes had to ensure that the taxes were collected on time. If the taxes were not collected on time, the revenue officials were penalized, and their salaries could be deducted.\n\nOverall, the penalties for failing to pay taxes were severe. The Peshwas' system was designed to ensure that taxes were collected on time, and any delay or non-compliance was dealt with severely."

      "content": "Yes, the Peshwas had several methods to encourage cultivators to pay their taxes on time. One of the most important methods was to provide incentives to the cultivators. The Peshwas often gave rewards in the form of tax exemptions to those who paid their taxes on time or in advance. This helped to create a sense of competition among cultivators to pay their taxes early and avoid the penalties.\n\nAnother method that the Peshwas used was to provide loans to the cultivators who couldn't pay their taxes on time. These loans were given at a low-interest rate and were designed to help the cultivators avoid the penalties that they would otherwise have to pay.\n\nThe Peshwas also employed revenue officials who were responsible for collecting taxes. These officials were trained to handle cultivators carefully and to make sure that they understood the importance of paying taxes on time. The officials would often visit the villages and explain the benefits of paying taxes on time to the cultivators.\n\nMoreover, the Peshwas implemented a system of rewards for revenue officials who collected taxes efficiently and quickly. The officials were given bonuses and promotions for their good work, and this incentivized them to collect taxes as efficiently as possible.\n\nOverall, the Peshwas' administration implemented several methods to encourage cultivators to pay their taxes on time to ensure that the revenue collection system worked efficiently. These methods included incentives, loans, training of revenue officials, and rewards for good work, all of which helped to ensure that taxes were collected on time."
