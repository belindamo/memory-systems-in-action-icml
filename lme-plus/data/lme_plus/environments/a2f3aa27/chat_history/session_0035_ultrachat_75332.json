      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences. However, as per technical specifications, if someone plans on multitasking frequently, it is recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM in their laptop. This would allow for smooth and efficient multitasking without any lag or slowdown. If the user plans on using more demanding applications such as video editing or high-end gaming, 16GB or more may be necessary."
