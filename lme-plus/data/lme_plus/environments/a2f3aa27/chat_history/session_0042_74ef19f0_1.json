      "content": "The Sonos Beam with Wireless Subwoofer is a fantastic combination for an immersive audio experience.\n\nThe Sonos Wireless Subwoofer (also known as the Sonos Sub) is a compact, wireless subwoofer designed to add deep bass and depth to your music and movie experience. Here are some key features and benefits:\n\n**Connection:** The Sonos Sub connects wirelessly to the Sonos Beam (or any other Sonos speaker) using Sonos' proprietary wireless technology.

The Sonos app will guide you through a simple calibration process to optimize the Sub's performance.\n\n**Performance:** The Sonos Sub is designed to produce deep, rumbling bass that complements the Beam's sound. It's capable of producing frequencies as low as 25 Hz, which is impressive for a wireless subwoofer of its size.

      "content": "The Sonos app is primarily designed to control and customize your Sonos speakers, including the Beam and Sub. However, Sonos has introduced some TV control features in recent years, but they are limited and dependent on your TV's compatibility.\n\n**TV Control through Sonos App:**\n\nSonos has partnered with certain TV manufacturers to allow for basic TV control through the Sonos app. This feature is called \"TV Control\" or \"TV Audio Control.\" With compatible TVs, you can use the Sonos app to:\n\n1. Adjust the TV's volume: You can control the TV's volume using the Sonos app, which is convenient if you're using the Beam as your TV's sound system.\n2. Mute or unmute the TV: You can mute or unmute the TV's audio using the Sonos app.\n\nHowever, this TV control feature is limited to specific TV brands and models. Currently, Sonos supports TV control for:\n\n* Samsung TVs (2019 or later models)\n* LG TVs (2019 or later models)\n* Sony TVs (2020 or later models)\n\nCheck Sonos' website for the most up-to-date list of compatible TVs.\n\n**TV Remote Control:**\n\nIf your TV is not compatible with Sonos' TV Control feature, you can still use the Sonos app to control your TV's volume and mute functions using the TV's remote control. This is done through a feature called \"IR Control\" or \"TV Remote Control.\" The Sonos Beam can learn the TV's remote control commands and allow you to control the TV's volume and mute functions using the Sonos app.\n\n**Other TV Control Options:**\n\nIf you want more comprehensive TV control, you might consider using your TV's remote control app or a universal remote control app like Logitech Harmony. These apps often offer more extensive control over your TV's settings and features.\n\nIn summary, the Sonos app can control your Sonos speakers and, to some extent, your TV's volume and mute functions, but the TV control features are limited and dependent on your TV's compatibility."

      "content": "The Sonos app does not currently allow you to switch the audio input on your TV, such as from HDMI 1 to HDMI 2. This is still a function that you'll need to perform on your TV itself.\n\nThe Sonos app is primarily designed to control your Sonos speakers and their settings, as well as provide a convenient way to play music and audio content. While it can control the TV's volume and mute functions on compatible TVs, it does not have the capability to switch the TV's input sources.\n\nTo switch the audio input on your TV, you'll need to use your TV's remote control and navigate to the input selection menu. This is usually done by pressing the \"Input\" or \"Source\" button on your TV's remote, and then selecting the desired input source (e.g., HDMI 1, HDMI 2, etc.).\n\nHowever, there is a potential workaround if you have a smart TV with HDMI-CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) support. HDMI-CEC allows devices connected to your TV to control each other's functions, including switching inputs. Some Sonos devices, like the Beam, support HDMI-CEC, but it's not a guarantee that it will work with your specific TV model.\n\nIf you have a compatible TV and Sonos device, you might be able to use the Sonos app to switch the TV's input source using HDMI-CEC. However, this would require specific setup and configuration on both your TV and Sonos device, and it's not a standard feature across all Sonos devices or TVs.\n\nIn general, it's best to use your TV's remote control to switch input sources, as it's a more reliable and straightforward method."
