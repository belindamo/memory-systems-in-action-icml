  "content": "I've got your Walgreens Balance Rewards program tracked:\n\n* Program: Walgreens Balance Rewards\n* Reward type: Points\n* Current balance: unknown (let's track your future earnings!)\n* Last redemption: 5,000 points for a $5 reward (last week)\n\nTo help you track your points, I'll need to know how many points you earn per dollar spent at Walgreens. According to Walgreens' website, you typically earn 10 points per $1 spent on most purchases. Is that correct?\n\nOnce we establish your earning rate, you can report your Walgreens purchases to me, and I'll update your points balance. We can also discuss strategies to maximize your points earnings and redeem them for rewards.\n\nRemember, Walgreens points expire 3 years from the date they're earned, so we don't need to worry about expiration dates for now.\n\nHow's that sound? Are there any other loyalty programs or rewards you'd like to track?",
