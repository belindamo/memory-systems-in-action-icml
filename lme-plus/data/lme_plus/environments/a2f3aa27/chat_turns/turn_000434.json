  "content": "The Sonos app is primarily designed to control and customize your Sonos speakers, including the Beam and Sub. However, Sonos has introduced some TV control features in recent years, but they are limited and dependent on your TV's compatibility.\n\n**TV Control through Sonos App:**\n\nSonos has partnered with certain TV manufacturers to allow for basic TV control through the Sonos app. This feature is called \"TV Control\" or \"TV Audio Control.\" With compatible TVs, you can use the Sonos app to:\n\n1. Adjust the TV's volume: You can control the TV's volume using the Sonos app, which is convenient if you're using the Beam as your TV's sound system.\n2. Mute or unmute the TV: You can mute or unmute the TV's audio using the Sonos app.\n\nHowever, this TV control feature is limited to specific TV brands and models. Currently, Sonos supports TV control for:\n\n* Samsung TVs (2019 or later models)\n* LG TVs (2019 or later models)\n* Sony TVs (2020 or later models)\n\nCheck Sonos' website for the most up-to-date list of compatible TVs.\n\n**TV Remote Control:**\n\nIf your TV is not compatible with Sonos' TV Control feature, you can still use the Sonos app to control your TV's volume and mute functions using the TV's remote control. This is done through a feature called \"IR Control\" or \"TV Remote Control.\" The Sonos Beam can learn the TV's remote control commands and allow you to control the TV's volume and mute functions using the Sonos app.\n\n**Other TV Control Options:**\n\nIf you want more comprehensive TV control, you might consider using your TV's remote control app or a universal remote control app like Logitech Harmony. These apps often offer more extensive control over your TV's settings and features.\n\nIn summary, the Sonos app can control your Sonos speakers and, to some extent, your TV's volume and mute functions, but the TV control features are limited and dependent on your TV's compatibility.",
