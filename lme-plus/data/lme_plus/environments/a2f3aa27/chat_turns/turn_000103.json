  "content": "I'm interested in The All Souls Trilogy, especially since it has a historical fantasy romance aspect. I've been enjoying fantasy novels with romance lately, and I've already read two fantasy novels by Sarah J. Maas. Speaking of which, I've also been reading a lot on my new e-reader, which I got for my birthday in March. I've already finished 7 books on it, including the two Sarah J. Maas books.",
