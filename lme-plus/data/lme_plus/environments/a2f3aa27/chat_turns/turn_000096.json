Start your day with a cup of green tea - Green tea is full of antioxidants and caffeine, which can help jumpstart your day.\n\n2. Swap your afternoon coffee for black tea - Like coffee, black tea contains caffeine but is less likely to cause jitters or disrupt sleep.\n\n3. Drink herbal tea before bed - Herbal teas like chamomile or lavender can have a calming effect on the body, making them great for sipping on before bedtime.\n\n4. Use tea as a flavoring agent - Brew stronger tea or even tea leaves and incorporate them into cooking or baking. For example, make green tea ice cream or chai-flavored oatmeal.\n\n5. Experiment with tea blending - Combining different types of tea and herbs can create unique and flavorful blends that cater to your specific tastes and needs.\n\nUltimately, incorporating tea into your daily routine is about finding what works best for you. Consider experimenting with different types of tea, brewing temperatures, and steeping times to find your perfect cup.",
