The partnership brings together governments, businesses, and NGOs to create transformative strategies that can help reduce plastic waste. \n\n3. The Plastic Leak Project:\nThe Plastic Leak Project is a coalition between organizations and companies working towards identifying plastic waste and leakage points to prevent plastic waste leakage into the environment. It maps out hotspots of plastic leakage and works with companies to reduce plastic use through circular economy solutions.\n\n4. Multi-Stakeholder Platforms:\nThere are several multi-stakeholder platforms that work to reduce plastic waste.
