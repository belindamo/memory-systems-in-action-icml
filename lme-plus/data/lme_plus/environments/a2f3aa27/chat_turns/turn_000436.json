  "content": "The Sonos app does not currently allow you to switch the audio input on your TV, such as from HDMI 1 to HDMI 2. This is still a function that you'll need to perform on your TV itself.\n\nThe Sonos app is primarily designed to control your Sonos speakers and their settings, as well as provide a convenient way to play music and audio content. While it can control the TV's volume and mute functions on compatible TVs, it does not have the capability to switch the TV's input sources.\n\nTo switch the audio input on your TV, you'll need to use your TV's remote control and navigate to the input selection menu. This is usually done by pressing the \"Input\" or \"Source\" button on your TV's remote, and then selecting the desired input source (e.g., HDMI 1, HDMI 2, etc.).\n\nHowever, there is a potential workaround if you have a smart TV with HDMI-CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) support. HDMI-CEC allows devices connected to your TV to control each other's functions, including switching inputs. Some Sonos devices, like the Beam, support HDMI-CEC, but it's not a guarantee that it will work with your specific TV model.\n\nIf you have a compatible TV and Sonos device, you might be able to use the Sonos app to switch the TV's input source using HDMI-CEC. However, this would require specific setup and configuration on both your TV and Sonos device, and it's not a standard feature across all Sonos devices or TVs.\n\nIn general, it's best to use your TV's remote control to switch input sources, as it's a more reliable and straightforward method.",
