Here are some tips to help you stay organized:\n\n1. **Create a spreadsheet**: Make a spreadsheet with columns for:\n\t* Order date\n\t* Website/store\n\t* Order number\n\t* Item(s) purchased\n\t* Expected delivery date\n\t* Status (e.g., \"shipped,\" \"delivered,\" \"cancelled\")\n\t* Any notes (e.g., tracking numbers, customer service interactions)\n2. **Use a package tracking app**: Consider using an app like:\n\t* Package Guard (iOS, Android)\n\t* ShipStation (iOS, Android)\n\t* Track packages (iOS, Android)\n\t* Slice (iOS, Android)\n\t* These apps allow you to track multiple packages from various retailers in one place.\n3. **Designate an email folder**: Create a folder in your email inbox specifically for online shopping receipts and order updates. This will help you keep all your order confirmations and tracking updates in one place.\n4. **Use a password manager**: Consider using a password manager like LastPass, 1Password, or Dashlane to store your login credentials for each website. This will help you avoid having to remember multiple usernames and passwords.\n5. **Set up order notifications**: Many retailers offer the option to receive email or text notifications when your order ships or is delivered. Take advantage of these notifications to stay informed about your packages.\n6. **Keep a physical notebook**: If you prefer a more analog approach, keep a dedicated notebook to jot down order details, tracking numbers, and expected delivery dates.\n7. **Prioritize and categorize**: If you're making frequent purchases, consider categorizing your orders by type (e.g., clothing, electronics, home goods) or priority (e.g., urgent, non-essential). This will help you quickly identify which orders need attention.\n8. **Check your accounts regularly**: Regularly log in to your accounts on each website to ensure you haven't missed any important updates or notifications.\n9. **Consider a virtual assistant**: If you're really struggling to keep track of your orders, consider using a virtual assistant like Google Assistant, Siri, or Alexa to set reminders and keep you informed about your packages.\n10. **Review and adjust**: At the end of each month, review your spreadsheet or notebook to ensure everything is up-to-date. Adjust your system as needed to make it more efficient and effective for you.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you'll be better equipped to manage your online shopping and stay on top of your orders and packages. Happy shopping!",
