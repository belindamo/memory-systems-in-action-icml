Focus on exercises that target your core, glutes, and legs, as these are the primary muscles used in running. Here are some exercises and tips to get you started:\n\n**Core Exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise targets your entire core, including your abs, obliques, and lower back.\n2. **Russian twists**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Twist your torso to left and right, touching your hands to the ground each time. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n3. **Leg raises**: Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Leg Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hands by your sides. Lower your body down into a squat, keeping your back straight and knees behind your toes. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n2. **Lunges**: Stand with your feet together and take a large step forward with one foot. Lower your body down into a lunge, keeping your front knee behind your toes and back knee almost touching the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps per leg.\n3. **Calf raises**: Stand on a step or platform with your heels hanging off the edge. Raise up onto your tiptoes and then lower back down. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n\n**Tips to Fit Strength Training into Your Running Schedule:**\n\n1. **Start with 1-2 strength training sessions per week**: Begin with one or two strength training sessions per week and gradually increase the frequency as your body adapts.\n2. **Do strength training on non-consecutive days**: Avoid doing strength training on consecutive days, as this can lead to fatigue and impact your running performance.\n3. **Focus on lower-intensity strength training**: As a runner, you don't need to focus on heavy weightlifting. Instead, aim for lower-intensity exercises with higher reps (12-15) to improve muscular endurance.\n4. **Keep strength training sessions short and sweet**: Aim for 20-30 minute strength training sessions, including warm-up and cool-down.\n5. **Prioritize your running schedule**: Remember, running is your primary focus. If you need to miss a strength training session, prioritize your running schedule and adjust your strength training accordingly.\n6. **Incorporate strength training during your rest days**: Use your rest days or easy run days to fit in strength training. This can help you stay active while still allowing your body to recover from running.\n7. **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to your body and adjust your strength training routine as needed. If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop the exercise and consult with a healthcare professional.\n\nHere's an example of how you can incorporate strength training into your running schedule:\n\nMonday: Easy 3-mile run\nTuesday: Strength training (core and legs)\nWednesday: 5-mile run with hills\nThursday: Rest day or easy 3-mile run\nFriday: Strength training (core and legs)\nSaturday: Long run (8-10 miles)\nSunday: Rest day or easy 3-mile run\n\nRemember to warm up before each strength training session with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching. Cool down with static stretches after each session to help with recovery. Happy strength training!",
