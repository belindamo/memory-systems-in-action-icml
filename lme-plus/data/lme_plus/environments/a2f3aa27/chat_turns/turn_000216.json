Targeting your glutes and legs is a great place to start, as these muscles are essential for running. Here are some exercises that can help:\n\n**Glute Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend your knees and lower your body down until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n2. **Deadlifts**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend down and grab a weight or barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart, and lift the weight up to hip level. Lower the weight back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n3. **Glute bridges**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, then lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top. Lower your hips back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n4. **Lunges**: Stand with your feet together, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower your body down until your back knee almost touches the ground. Push back up to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps per leg.\n\n**Leg Exercises:**\n\n1. **Calf raises**: Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto your tiptoes, and then lower back down. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n2. **Leg press**: Sit in a leg press machine and push the platform away from you with your feet, extending your legs. Lower the platform back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n3. **Leg extensions**: Sit in a leg extension machine and lift the weight up with your legs, then lower it back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps.\n4. **Step-ups**: Stand in front of a step or platform, raise one foot up onto the step, and then bring the other foot up to meet it. Step back down to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps per leg.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Start with lighter weights and progress gradually**: Begin with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you build strength and endurance.\n2. **Focus on proper form and technique**: Make sure to maintain proper form and technique throughout each exercise to avoid injury and get the most out of your strength training.\n3. **Incorporate strength training into your routine 2-3 times a week**: Aim to do strength training 2-3 times a week, ideally on non-consecutive days, to allow for adequate recovery time.\n4. **Listen to your body and rest when needed**: Pay attention to your body and take rest days as needed. It's better to err on the side of caution and recover than to risk injury.\n\nRemember to always warm up before strength training and cool down afterwards to reduce the risk of injury. It's also essential to incorporate strength training into your routine consistently to see improvements in your running performance. Happy strength training!",
