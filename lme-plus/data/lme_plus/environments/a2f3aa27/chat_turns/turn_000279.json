  "content": "The continents formed billions of years ago through a process known as continental drift. The Earth's outermost layer or lithosphere is made up of several large plates that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. These plates continuously move and interact, causing seismic activity, earthquakes, and mountain-forming processes.\n\nPlate tectonics is the scientific theory that explains the movement and interaction of these large plates. It explains the formation of landmasses, mountain ranges, and oceanic basins. The theory suggests that the Earth's lithosphere is broken up into several large tectonic plates that float on top of the underlying molten mantle. These plates move around the Earth's surface driven by convection currents in the mantle. The movement of these plates leads to the formation of new crust or the breakup and collision of landmasses, leading to the eventual formation of continents. \n\nThe movement and interaction of these plates also contribute to natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Plate tectonics have had a profound effect on the Earth's geological, biological, and atmospheric processes and are crucial to understanding the planet's evolution.",
