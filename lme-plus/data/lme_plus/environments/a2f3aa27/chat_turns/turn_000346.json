  "content": "The Peshwas' system of taxation and revenue collection was primarily based on the land revenue and customs dues. The Peshwas levied taxes mainly on agriculture and trades while the artisan goods were mostly exempt from these taxes.\n\nThe land revenue was the most important source of revenue for the Peshwas. In this system, the land from which crops were grown was considered to be revenue-yielding, and the cultivators who cultivated that land were liable to pay taxes. The land revenue was divided into two categories, i.e., dry land and wetland. The tax rates for dry land were lower as compared to wetland, for example, the tax rate for dry land was three-fourth of the produce, and for wetland, it was half of the produce.\n\nApart from the land revenue, the Peshwas also levied taxes on mines, trade routes, tolls, and customs. The customs dues were paid by different merchants who had to pay taxes at the entrance of each port or city.\n\nThe taxes were collected by the revenue officials appointed by the Peshwas, and they were responsible for the overall collection of revenue. The Peshwas encouraged the officials to collect taxes efficiently and quickly. The revenue officials were paid a salary for the collection and handling of taxes.\n\nIn conclusion, the Peshwas' system of taxation and revenue collection was based on the land revenue and customs dues. The taxes were collected efficiently by the appointed officials. The land revenue was the most important source of revenue for the Peshwas, and the tax rates were different for dry land and wetland.",
