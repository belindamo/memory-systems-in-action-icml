I'm glad you found some inspiration for your meal planning.\n\n**Storing Leftover Chili:**\n\nTo keep your leftover chili fresh for the rest of the week, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Cool it down**: Let the chili cool completely to room temperature before refrigerating or freezing. This helps prevent bacterial growth and keeps the flavors from becoming dull.\n2. **Airtight containers**: Store the cooled chili in airtight, shallow containers (e.g., glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids). This prevents air from reaching the chili and causing it to dry out.\n3. **Refrigerate**: Store the containers in the refrigerator at 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below. Cooked chili can be safely stored in the fridge for 3 to 5 days.\n4. **Freeze for longer storage**: If you don't plan to use the chili within 5 days, consider freezing it. Transfer the cooled chili to airtight, freezer-safe containers or freezer bags, making sure to remove as much air as possible before sealing. Frozen chili can be stored for 3 to 6 months.\n5. **Label and date containers**: Be sure to label the containers with the date and contents, so you can easily keep track of how long it's been stored.\n6. **Reheat safely**: When reheating the chili, make sure it reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your slow cooker chili throughout the week while maintaining its flavor and safety.\n\n**Croutons for Tomato Soup:**\n\nCroutons are a great addition to tomato soup! You can make them from scratch by cubing bread, tossing it with olive oil, salt, and your choice of seasonings, and then baking until crispy. Some options for seasonings include dried herbs (e.g., thyme, rosemary), grated cheese, or a sprinkle of paprika.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
