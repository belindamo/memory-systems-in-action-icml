  "content": "That sounds interesting. I've been reading more fantasy novels with romance lately, and I think I'd enjoy the Night Huntress series. I've already read 2 fantasy novels by Sarah J. Maas, and I just re-read 3-4 books in her \"A Court of Thorns and Roses\" series last month, reading about 1-2 books per week. I'm looking forward to diving into a new series.",
