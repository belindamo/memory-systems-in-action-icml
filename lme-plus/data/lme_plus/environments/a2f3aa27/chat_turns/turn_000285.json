  "content": "Yes, it's challenging to fathom how people used to deal with natural disasters before modern technology. People had to rely on their instincts and knowledge about the environment to prepare for natural disasters. For example, early civilizations living in areas prone to earthquakes built their homes using materials that were more resistant to seismic activity. \n\nIn some instances, people may have had prior experience with natural disasters, which could help guide future responses. However, without early warning systems, they may have had little time to react and evacuate before a disaster hit.\n\nToday, technology has allowed for better communication, monitoring, and forecasting of natural disasters. This, in turn, has allowed for better disaster preparedness and response. Emergency services can respond more quickly and effectively and keep people informed about what's happening and what actions to take. \n\nHowever, despite advances in technology, disasters can still be deadly and destructive, and it's critical that people continue to be prepared and informed about the risks in their area.",
