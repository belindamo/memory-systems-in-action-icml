I've got your CVS ExtraCare rewards tracked:\n\n* Program: CVS ExtraCare\n* Reward type: Cashback (rewards dollars)\n* Current balance: $2\n* Expiration date: April 15th\n\nI'll make sure to remind you when the rewards are about to expire, so you can use them before they disappear.\n\nTo help you track your purchases and earn your next reward, I can simulate a virtual \"purchasing tracker\" for you. Here's how it works:\n\n1. You can report your CVS purchases to me whenever you make one.\n2. I'll keep a running total of your purchases and let you know how close you are to earning your next reward.\n3. CVS typically offers 2% cashback on most purchases, so we can estimate your progress towards your next reward.\n\nPlease feel free to report your CVS purchases to me anytime, and I'll update your tracker. You can share the date, amount spent, and any relevant details about the purchase (e.g., if it's a special promotion or sale).\n\nNext, are there any other loyalty programs you'd like to track or rewards you'd like to monitor?",
