  "content": "Yes, there were penalties for the cultivators who failed to pay taxes on time. If a cultivator failed to pay the taxes on time, he had to pay a penalty, which was usually a fine. The amount of the penalty varied depending on the amount of the unpaid taxes and the period of delay.\n\nThe Peshwas also had provisions for confiscating the land of those who failed to pay taxes continually. In case of non-payment, the land was auctioned, and the defaulter was barred from participating in the auction. Moreover, cultivators who didn't pay taxes on time could also be imprisoned, and their property could be confiscated to recover the unpaid taxes.\n\nIn addition to this, the revenue officials who were appointed to collect taxes had to ensure that the taxes were collected on time. If the taxes were not collected on time, the revenue officials were penalized, and their salaries could be deducted.\n\nOverall, the penalties for failing to pay taxes were severe. The Peshwas' system was designed to ensure that taxes were collected on time, and any delay or non-compliance was dealt with severely.",
