I've been enjoying the fantasy romance genre a lot lately, and I'm excited to dive into a new series. By the way, have you heard of Taylor Jenkins Reid? I just discovered her \"Maybe in Another Life\" series and devoured it in 4 days. I loved her writing style so much that I even pre-ordered her new book, which comes out in August.",
