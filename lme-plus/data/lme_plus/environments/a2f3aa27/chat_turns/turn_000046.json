You can report your purchases to me, and I'll keep a running total of your savings.\n\n**Fetch Rewards:**\n\n* Program: Fetch Rewards\n* Reward type: Points\n* Current balance: unknown (let's start tracking your points from now on!)\n\nTo track your Fetch Rewards points, I'll need to know when you earn points from purchasing participating brands or submitting receipts. You can report your Fetch Rewards earnings to me, and I'll update your points balance.\n\nHere's how you can report your earnings:\n\n* For Target RedCard, simply tell me the date and amount of your purchase at Target using your RedCard.\n* For Fetch Rewards, share the date, points earned, and any relevant details about the purchase (e.g., which brands or products you bought).\n\nI'll keep track of your rewards and provide reminders when you're close to earning a new reward or when your points are about to expire.\n\nNow, you have three loyalty programs tracked:\n\n1. CVS ExtraCare\n2. Walgreens Balance Rewards\n3. Target RedCard\n4. Fetch Rewards\n\nFeel free to add more programs or rewards anytime you'd like!\n\nRemember, the more you report your earnings and purchases, the better I can assist you in maximizing your rewards and savings.",
