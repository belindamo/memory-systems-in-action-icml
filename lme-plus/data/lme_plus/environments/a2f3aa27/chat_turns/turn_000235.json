  "content": "That's really helpful! I like the idea of using the leftover chili for different meals throughout the week. I'm not really a fan of Mexican Street Corn Salad, so I think I'll skip that one. But the Chili Mac and Garlic Bread sound like a great combo for Tuesday. For Wednesday, I think I'll go with the Roasted Vegetables instead of the baked potatoes. And on Friday, I might try making some croutons to go with the Tomato Soup. Thanks for the suggestions! Do you have any tips on how to store the leftover chili to keep it fresh for the rest of the week?",
