  "content": "The All Souls Trilogy is a great choice! Deborah Harkness's writing is lush and immersive, and the historical fantasy romance aspect is woven beautifully throughout the series. You'll likely enjoy the blend of magic, history, and romance.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been enjoying fantasy novels with romance lately! Sarah J. Maas is an excellent author in that genre, and it's wonderful that you've already devoured some of her books.\n\nCongratulations on your new e-reader, by the way! It's amazing that you've already finished 7 books on it, including the two Sarah J. Maas books. E-readers can be so convenient and addictive, don't you think?\n\nSince you mentioned you're enjoying fantasy novels with romance, I thought I'd recommend a few more authors who write in that genre:\n\n1. **Kristen Ashley** - She's known for her fantasy romance novels, often featuring alpha males and strong female protagonists. Try her **Fantasyland** series or **The Will**.\n2. **Jeaniene Frost** - Her **Night Huntress** series is a great example of fantasy romance, with a half-vampire heroine and a range of supernatural creatures.\n3. **Nalini Singh** - While she's also known for her contemporary romance, her **Guild Hunter** series is a fantastic example of fantasy romance, featuring angels, vampires, and other supernatural beings.\n4. **Patricia Briggs** - Her **Mercy Thompson** series is a great blend of urban fantasy and romance, set in a world where supernatural creatures are part of everyday life.\n\nThese authors all have a strong focus on character development, world-building, and romance, which might appeal to you if you've enjoyed Sarah J. Maas's work.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific questions about The All Souls Trilogy or any other books!",
