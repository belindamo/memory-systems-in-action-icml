Jeaniene Frost's writing is engaging, and Cat and Bones' story is addicting.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been enjoying your e-reader! Seven books in a short span is impressive, especially considering you've been devouring fantasy novels like Sarah J. Maas's books. E-readers can be so convenient and comfortable to use, don't you think?\n\nUsing an e-reader can be a great way to discover new authors and series, too. You can easily download samples, check out reviews, and explore different genres without having to physically visit a bookstore. Plus, it's always exciting to get new book recommendations and add them to your digital shelf!\n\nNow, I'm curious - what do you think about the e-reading experience compared to physical books? Do you prefer one over the other, or do you enjoy both for different reasons?\n\nLet me know, and happy reading with Halfway to the Grave!",
