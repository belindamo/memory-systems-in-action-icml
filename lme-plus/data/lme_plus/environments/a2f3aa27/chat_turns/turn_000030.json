If she's a bit older (5-12) and loves Mickey Mouse and adventure, Mickey's Tales of Adventure might be more suitable.\n* Character interactions: Both experiences offer character interactions, but Goofy's Kitchen tends to have more characters visiting tables, while Mickey's Tales of Adventure focuses on Mickey and his friends.\n* Menu options: Both buffets offer a variety of options, but Mickey's Tales of Adventure has more themed dishes that might appeal to kids.\n\nUltimately, both experiences are fun and memorable, so you can't go wrong either way! If you're still unsure, you could consider asking your niece which characters she'd most like to meet or what type of food she enjoys.\n\nWhichever option you choose, I'm sure your niece will have a magical birthday celebration at the Disneyland Resort!",
