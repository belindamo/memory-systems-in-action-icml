  "content": "I'd be happy to help you keep track of your loyalty programs and rewards.\n\nLet's start with the CVS rewards. Can you please tell me more about the rewards you've earned? How much is the reward amount, and when do they expire? Additionally, do you have a CVS ExtraCare card or are these rewards from a specific promotion?\n\nOnce we get the CVS rewards sorted out, we can move on to other loyalty programs you're a part of. You can share the details of each program, such as:\n\n1. Program name (e.g., airline, hotel, credit card, store loyalty program)\n2. Reward type (e.g., points, miles, cashback, discounts)\n3. Current balance or available rewards\n4. Expiration dates (if applicable)\n\nI can help you create a virtual \"wallet\" to keep track of your rewards and remind you when they're about to expire. We can also discuss strategies to maximize your rewards and make the most of your loyalty programs.\n\nLet's get started!",
