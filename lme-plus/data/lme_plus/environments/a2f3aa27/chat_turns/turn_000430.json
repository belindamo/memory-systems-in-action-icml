  "content": "With a budget of $300-$400 and a focus on good sound quality and a wireless subwoofer, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Sonos Beam with Wireless Subwoofer**: The Sonos Beam is a compact soundbar that's known for its excellent sound quality, and when paired with the Sonos Wireless Subwoofer, it becomes a powerful system. The Beam itself is $399, and the subwoofer is $699, but you can get both together for around $350-$400 during sales or discounts.\n2. **Samsung HW-Q60R**: This soundbar is a step up from the HW-Q50R and offers better sound quality and a more immersive experience. It has a wireless subwoofer and supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. It's usually priced around $350-$400.\n3. **Yamaha YAS-209BL**: This soundbar is a popular choice in this price range, offering good sound quality, a wireless subwoofer, and built-in Alexa support. It's usually priced around $300-$350.\n4. **Polk Command Bar**: This soundbar is a great option if you want a system with a wireless subwoofer and good sound quality. It also has built-in Alexa support and is usually priced around $300-$350.\n5. **JBL Bar 3.1**: This soundbar offers good sound quality, a wireless subwoofer, and a sleek design. It's usually priced around $300-$350.\n\nAll of these options should provide good sound quality and a wireless subwoofer, which should enhance your movie-watching experience. Since you mentioned your room is medium-sized, any of these options should be able to fill the space with sound.\n\nIf you're looking for the best overall sound quality, I'd recommend the Sonos Beam with Wireless Subwoofer or the Samsung HW-Q60R. If you're looking for a more affordable option with good sound quality, the Yamaha YAS-209BL or JBL Bar 3.1 might be the way to go.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more information on any of these options!",
