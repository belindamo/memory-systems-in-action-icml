  "content": "You're referring to Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance! It's an amazing experience, and I'm sure you'll love it.\n\nWait times for Rise of the Resistance can vary greatly depending on the day, time, and season. Since you visited a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, you might have gotten lucky with a shorter wait. However, it's not uncommon for wait times to be shorter during the early morning or late evening hours.\n\nThat being said, wait times for Rise of the Resistance have been trending higher lately, especially on weekends and during peak seasons. Here are some general guidelines to help you plan your day:\n\n* Average wait times: 60-90 minutes\n* Peak wait times: 120-180 minutes (or more) on weekends, holidays, and during peak seasons like summer and holidays\n* Best times to visit: Early morning (right after park opening) or late evening (around 6-8 pm)\n\nTo minimize your wait, consider using the Disneyland app to reserve a boarding pass for Rise of the Resistance. This can help you avoid waiting in line for an extended period. Make sure to check the app frequently, as boarding passes often become available at random times throughout the day.\n\nAdditionally, consider visiting during off-peak days, such as weekdays during the school year, when crowds tend to be smaller.\n\nRemember to also plan for other Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge experiences, like Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run, which often has shorter wait times. You might want to fit that in while you're waiting for your boarding pass or after you've experienced Rise of the Resistance.\n\nMay the Force be with you, and I hope you have a fantastic time exploring Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge!",
