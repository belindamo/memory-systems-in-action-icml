  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have opinions nor beliefs, but I can tell you that there are a few ways to ensure that governments and industries follow through on the strategies to reduce plastic waste in oceans:\n\n1. Establish clear targets: Setting clear, measureable targets for reducing plastic waste pollution, and making these targets public can hold governments and industries accountable for their actions.\n\n2. Regulations and policies: Governments can put in place regulations and policies that mandate and enforce businesses to operate under certain environmental conditions. \n\n3. Public pressure: Generally, when there is a continual public push for action on reducing plastic waste, governments and industries tend to respond. By organizing campaigns, signing petitions, and using social media to continually press for action, governments and industries could become motivated to take action.\n\n4. Incentive and penalties: Introducing incentives (such as tax incentives for businesses) to encourage environmentally sustainable behavior, or penalties (like heavy fines) for those who fail to meet prescribed targets. \n\n5. Collaboration: Collaboration and partnerships between governments, industries, and stakeholders can boost joint ownership of tackling plastic waste pollution, ultimately increasing the likelihood of follow-through on these strategies.",
