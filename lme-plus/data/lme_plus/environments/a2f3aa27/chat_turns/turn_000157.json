  "content": "I'm also considering getting a bike for my daily commute to work. I test-rode a few models at the local bike shop on February 12th. I'm still undecided between the Trek FX 2 and the Specialized Sirrus, both of which are priced around $800. By the way, speaking of maintenance, I got my car serviced on February 2nd, including an oil change, tire rotation, and brake pad replacement, which totaled $350. And, I replaced my car's floor mats on January 10th, which cost me $120 from the dealership.",
