  "content": "Yes, there have been several major tectonic events in recent years. One of the most notable events was the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in 2011. It was a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the coast of Honshu that resulted in a devastating tsunami, causing significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and loss of life. \n\nAnother significant earthquake was the one that hit Nepal in 2015. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8, killing over 8,000 people and injuring more than 21,000. \n\nIn addition to these catastrophic events, there have also been several lesser-known earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that have occurred around the world. Thanks to the advancements in technology, scientists are better able to monitor and detect seismic activity, allowing them to provide early warnings to people, saving lives, and minimizing the damage caused by these natural disasters.",
