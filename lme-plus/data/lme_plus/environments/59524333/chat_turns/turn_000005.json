While dried herbs are more commonly used in baking, fresh herbs can definitely be used, but with some considerations.\n\n**Using fresh herbs:**\n\n* Fresh herbs have a more delicate flavor and aroma compared to dried herbs, so you may need to use more of them to achieve the desired flavor.\n* Fresh herbs can be more potent, so start with a smaller amount and taste as you go to avoid overpowering the other ingredients.\n* Fresh herbs can add moisture to the dough, which may affect the texture of the cookies. This is especially true for herbs with high water content, like basil or mint.\n* Fresh herbs can be more prone to browning or discoloration during baking, which may affect the appearance of the cookies.\n\n**Converting dried herb amounts to fresh:**\n\n* A general rule of thumb is to use 3-4 times more fresh herbs than dried herbs. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of dried thyme, you could use 3-4 teaspoons of fresh thyme leaves.\n* However, this ratio may vary depending on the herb and its potency. Start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste.\n\n**Tips for using fresh herbs in cookies:**\n\n* Choose fresh herbs with a milder flavor, like mint, basil, or lemongrass, for a more subtle flavor.\n* Use a combination of fresh and dried herbs to balance the flavors.\n* Add fresh herbs towards the end of the mixing process to preserve their flavor and aroma.\n* Consider using herbs with a higher oil content, like rosemary or thyme, in smaller amounts to avoid overpowering the cookies.\n* Fresh herbs can be chopped or bruised to release their oils and flavors. Be gentle when handling delicate herbs like mint or basil to avoid bruising the leaves.\n\n**Some popular fresh herbs for cookies:**\n\n* Mint: pairs well with chocolate, citrus, or nuts\n* Basil: pairs well with lemon, garlic, or cheese\n* Thyme: pairs well with lemon, honey, or nuts\n* Rosemary: pairs well with olive oil, garlic, or pine nuts\n* Lemon balm: pairs well with lemon, honey, or poppy seeds\n\n**Example recipe:**\n\n**Lemon Rosemary Shortbread Cookies**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened\n* 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 tablespoons freshly chopped rosemary leaves\n* 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* Salt to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n2. Whisk together the flour and confectioners' sugar.\n3. Cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.\n4. Add the chopped rosemary and lemon juice to the butter mixture. Mix until well combined.\n5. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture until a dough forms.\n6. Roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes.\n7. Place on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 18-20 minutes or until lightly golden.\n\nRemember to taste and adjust as you go, and don't be afraid to experiment with different herb combinations to create unique flavors!",
