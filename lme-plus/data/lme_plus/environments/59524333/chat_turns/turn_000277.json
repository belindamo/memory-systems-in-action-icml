  "content": "I just inherited a vintage 1960s Omega Seamaster watch and I'm looking to get it appraised and insured. Can you recommend any reputable appraisers or insurance companies that specialize in rare watches? By the way, I've had a good experience with antique dealers lately - I recently bought a rare 18th-century Chinese vase at an antique fair for $500, and I'm hopeful it'll turn out to be a valuable find.",
