They sought to capture the modernity and immediacy of contemporary life, just like photography.\n2. **Light and atmosphere**: Photography's ability to capture the effects of light and atmosphere influenced Impressionist artists to focus on these aspects in their own work. They experimented with capturing the fleeting effects of natural light and atmosphere in their paintings.\n3. **Sense of spontaneity**: Photography's ability to capture quick, candid moments inspired Impressionist artists to create more spontaneous and expressive works. They sought to convey a sense of immediacy and urgency in their paintings.\n\n**Impressionist art's influence on photography:**\n\n1. **Pictorialism**: The Impressionist movement's emphasis on capturing light, atmosphere, and everyday life influenced the development of Pictorialism, a photographic movement that emerged in the late 19th century.

They began to experiment with different printing processes, toning, and other techniques to create unique and expressive images.\n\nSome notable photographers who were influenced by Impressionist art include:\n\n1. **Alfred Stieglitz**: An American photographer and founder of the Photo-Secession movement, Stieglitz was heavily influenced by Impressionist art. He sought to create photographs that were more artistic and expressive, often using techniques like soft focus and impressionistic printing.\n2. **Edward Steichen**: A Luxembourgish-American photographer, Steichen was influenced by Impressionist art and sought to create photographs that were more evocative and expressive.

While Impressionist artists were influenced by photography's ability to capture everyday life and fleeting moments, photographers were inspired by Impressionist art's emphasis on light, atmosphere, and emotional expression. The cross-pollination of ideas and techniques between the two mediums led to the development of new and innovative approaches in both art and photography.",
