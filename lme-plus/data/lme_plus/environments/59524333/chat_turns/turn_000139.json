  "content": "It's not necessarily about punishing the other person for mentioning OFA, but rather finding a consequence that motivates both you and Francis to respect each other's boundaries and avoid bringing up the topic. The consequence should be agreed upon by both of you, and it should be something that you both find meaningful and appropriate.\n\nFor example, the consequence could be something like:\n\n* Each time one of you mentions OFA, you have to put a dollar in a jar that you've designated specifically for this purpose. Once the jar is full, you could donate the money to a charity or use it for a fun activity that you both enjoy.\n* The person who mentions OFA has to do an extra chore or task around the house.\n* The person who mentions OFA has to treat the other person to a special meal or activity.\n\nRemember, the consequence should be something that is motivating and meaningful to both of you, and it should be viewed as a positive way to reinforce the new behavior you're trying to establish.",
