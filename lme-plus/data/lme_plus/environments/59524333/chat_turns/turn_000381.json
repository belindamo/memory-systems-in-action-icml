There are different perspectives on why Mark's Gospel emphasizes the urgency of Jesus' ministry more than the other synoptic Gospels. One possibility is that it reflects the author's personality or literary style. Some scholars have argued that Mark was a concise, dynamic writer who preferred narratives with a sense of urgency and drama. For instance, Mark condenses Jesus' ministry into a relatively short period of time, emphasizing the rapid pace of his healings, exorcisms, and teachings.\n\nAnother explanation is that the urgency theme reflects the historical context in which Mark's Gospel was written. Some scholars suggest that Mark wrote his Gospel in the aftermath of the Jewish war (66-70 AD) or during a period of persecution and crisis in the early Christian community. The urgency theme may have served to encourage beleaguered Christians to persevere in their faith despite persecution or to prepare for the imminent return of Christ. In this sense, Mark's Gospel could be seen as a pastoral document that addresses the immediate needs of a particular community.",
