It's a good idea to schedule the meeting with a buffer before your gym session, so you can wrap up any remaining discussion and still have time to get ready for your workout.\n\nTo make the most of your meeting, I'd recommend the following:\n\n* Plan to keep the meeting to 60 minutes or less, assuming it's an initial meeting or a casual discussion. This will give you both a chance to chat and get to know each other without feeling rushed.\n* Prepare an agenda or a list of topics you'd like to discuss, so you can stay focused and ensure you cover all the important points.\n* Consider sending a brief summary or overview of the meeting to the potential client beforehand, so they know what to expect and can prepare accordingly.\n\nBy scheduling the meeting at 2:00 pm, you'll have a nice chunk of time to discuss the important stuff, and still have plenty of time to get to the gym by 6:00 pm.\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to consider or prepare before the meeting?",
