  "content": "Sending files to the potential client before the meeting can help them prepare and make the most of your time together. There are a few ways to share files, depending on the type and size of the files, as well as your personal preference. Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Email attachments**: If the files are small (e.g., Word documents, PDFs), you can attach them to an email. However, be mindful of email attachment size limits (usually around 10-20 MB).\n2. **Cloud storage links**: Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or Microsoft OneDrive allow you to upload files and share links with others. This is a great option for larger files or if you need to share multiple files.\n3. **File-sharing platforms**: Tools like WeTransfer, SendSpace, or pCloud let you upload files and share them via a link. These services often have a larger file size limit than email attachments.\n4. **Project management or collaboration tools**: If you're already using a tool like Trello, Asana, or Basecamp for project management, you can share files and collaborate with the potential client within the platform.\n\nBefore sharing the files, consider the following:\n\n* **Security and confidentiality**: If the files contain sensitive or confidential information, ensure you're using a secure method to share them. You may want to use encryption or password-protect the files.\n* **File format**: Make sure the files are in a format that the potential client can easily open and view. You may want to convert files to PDFs or use a universal file format like Microsoft Word (.docx).\n* **Organization**: Organize the files in a logical structure, such as a folder with clear labels, to make it easy for the potential client to navigate.\n\nOnce you've chosen a method, you can include a brief note or introduction in the email or file-sharing message, such as:\n\n\"Hi [Potential Client], I've attached/shared the following files for your review before our meeting on Tuesday: [list the files]. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Looking forward to discussing them with you then!\"\n\nWhich method do you think you'll use to share the files?",
