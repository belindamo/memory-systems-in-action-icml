  "content": "Todoist and Trello are both powerful productivity tools that can help you stay organized and focused. Both apps have excellent integrations with Google Calendar, which can help you streamline your workflow and save time. Here's how they integrate:\n\n**Todoist and Google Calendar Integration**\n\nTodoist's integration with Google Calendar allows you to:\n\n1. **Sync tasks with Google Calendar events**: You can connect your Todoist account to Google Calendar, and tasks with due dates will be automatically synced as events on your calendar. This ensures that your tasks are visible on your calendar, and you can easily schedule them.\n2. **Create tasks from Google Calendar events**: When you create an event on Google Calendar, you can quickly turn it into a Todoist task by clicking on the \"Create task\" button. This helps you break down larger events into smaller, actionable tasks.\n3. **Use natural language input**: Todoist's integration with Google Calendar allows you to use natural language input to create tasks. For example, you can type \"Meet with John at 2 PM on Friday\" in Google Calendar, and Todoist will automatically create a task with the correct due date and time.\n4. **View tasks in Google Calendar**: You can view your Todoist tasks directly in Google Calendar, which helps you visualize your schedule and plan your day more effectively.\n\nTo set up the integration, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Todoist's Integrations page and click on \"Google Calendar\".\n2. Click on \"Connect\" and follow the prompts to authorize Todoist to access your Google Calendar.\n3. Choose the calendar you want to integrate with Todoist (e.g., your personal calendar or a shared calendar).\n\n**Trello and Google Calendar Integration**\n\nTrello's integration with Google Calendar allows you to:\n\n1. **Sync Trello cards with Google Calendar events**: You can connect your Trello board to Google Calendar, and cards with due dates will be automatically synced as events on your calendar.\n2. **Create Trello cards from Google Calendar events**: When you create an event on Google Calendar, you can quickly turn it into a Trello card by clicking on the \"Create card\" button.\n3. **Use Trello's Power-Ups**: Trello's Power-Ups are integrations that add extra functionality to your boards. The Google Calendar Power-Up allows you to view your calendar events directly on your Trello board, and create cards from events.\n4. **View Trello cards in Google Calendar**: You can view your Trello cards directly in Google Calendar, which helps you visualize your schedule and plan your day more effectively.\n\nTo set up the integration, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Trello's Power-Ups page and click on \"Google Calendar\".\n2. Click on \"Enable\" and follow the prompts to authorize Trello to access your Google Calendar.\n3. Choose the calendar you want to integrate with Trello (e.g., your personal calendar or a shared calendar).\n\nIn both cases, the integration is relatively seamless, and you can customize the settings to fit your workflow. By integrating Todoist or Trello with Google Calendar, you can create a powerful productivity system that helps you stay organized and focused.",
