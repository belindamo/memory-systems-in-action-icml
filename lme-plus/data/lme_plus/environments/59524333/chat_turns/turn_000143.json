Is it a sensitive or emotional topic for one or both of you?\n2. How often do slip-ups occur, and do they tend to happen more frequently for one person than the other?\n3. Have you considered seeking the help of a mediator or therapist to work through this issue?\n4. Are there any other topics or areas of conversation that you and Francis have successfully navigated in the past, despite any disagreements or differences of opinion?",
