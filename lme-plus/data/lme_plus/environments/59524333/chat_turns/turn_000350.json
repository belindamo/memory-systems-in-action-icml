  "content": "The Tom Bihn Cache sleeve is an investment, and there are other great options available.\n\nRegarding your question, a sleeve can provide some protection against coffee spills, but it's not a foolproof solution. Here's what you can expect:\n\n* A sleeve can help **absorb some of the impact**: If you accidentally spill coffee on your laptop, a sleeve can help absorb some of the liquid and reduce the impact of the spill. This might prevent some of the liquid from seeping into the laptop's openings or affecting the internal components.\n* A sleeve can **delay the damage**: By providing an extra layer of protection, a sleeve can delay the damage caused by the coffee spill. This might give you a bit more time to react and take action to minimize the damage.\n* However, a sleeve is **not a waterproof solution**: Most sleeves, including the ones I mentioned, are not designed to be waterproof. If you spill a significant amount of coffee on your laptop, the liquid can still seep through the sleeve and damage your device.\n\nTo minimize the risk of damage from coffee spills, it's still important to:\n\n* Be careful when handling hot beverages near your laptop\n* Keep your laptop in a safe and stable position\n* Have a backup plan in place, such as a waterproof laptop skin or a laptop bag with water-resistant material\n\nIf you're concerned about coffee spills, you might consider a sleeve with water-resistant material, such as the Ugreen Sleeve or the Inateck Sleeve. These sleeves are designed to provide some protection against water and other liquids, but they're not foolproof solutions.\n\nRemember, a sleeve is just one part of a comprehensive protection strategy. It's still important to be mindful of your laptop's safety and take steps to prevent accidents from happening in the first place.",
