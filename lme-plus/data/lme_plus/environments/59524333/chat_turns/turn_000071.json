  "content": "1. Introduction of the Deutsche Mark: West Berlin introduced the Deutsche Mark as its currency in 1948. This move, backed by the United States, infuriated the Soviet Union, as it saw this as an attempt to undermine their economic influence in the country. The Soviet Union responded by blockading all land and water access to West Berlin, leading to the Berlin Airlift.\n\n2. The Berlin Airlift: In response to the Soviet blockade, the United States and its allies, including Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, launched the Berlin Airlift. Food, fuel, and other basic supplies were airlifted to West Berlin for almost a full year, ensuring that the city did not fall under Soviet control.\n\n3. Formation of NATO: In 1949, the United States and its allies formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which included West Germany. NATO was formed as a means of collective defense against potential Soviet aggression in Europe.\n\n4. Admitting West Germany into the United Nations: In 1973, West Germany was admitted into the United Nations, which was a significant move as it signaled the country's acceptance into the international community.\n\n5. Economic cooperation with Western nations: West Berlin and West Germany formed close economic ties with Western nations, such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, in order to counter the Soviet Union's economic influence.\n\n6. Support of dissident movements: The West provided support to opposition movements within the Soviet Union, such as the Solidarity movement in Poland, as a means of undermining Soviet control and expanding Western influence.\n\n7. Maintenance of military presence: The United States maintained a large military presence in West Germany, which acted as a deterrent against Soviet aggression.",
