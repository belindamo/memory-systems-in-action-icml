Many streaming services have invested heavily in producing exclusive content that viewers can only access through their platform. This can range from award-winning TV shows and movies to documentaries, reality shows, and more.\n\nSome of the most popular original programming from streaming services include \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Crown\" from Netflix, \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Little Fires Everywhere\" from Hulu, and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\" from Amazon Prime Video, among others.\n\nThe availability of exclusive content is one of the main reasons why many viewers choose to subscribe to multiple streaming services. By doing so, they can access a wider range of content that is not available through traditional cable TV providers.\n\nOf course, the quality and popularity of original programming can vary from platform to platform, but generally speaking, streaming services have produced some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful shows and movies of recent years.",
