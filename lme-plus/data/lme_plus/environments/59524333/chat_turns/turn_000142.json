Filming would take too mich time and be too complicated.\n\n\"The person who mentions OFA has to donate a small amount of money to a charity or cause that the other person supports.\"\n\nThat will not work because we are too poor.\n\n\"The person who mentions OFA has to go without their favorite snack or treat for a certain amount of time.\"\n\nThat will not work because we can't just start monitoring eachother that close.\n\nAsk me 3-4 questions in order to gather information about the situation.
