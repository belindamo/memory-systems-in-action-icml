Since you're already doing yoga on Mondays and Wednesdays, you can modify your sessions to focus on lower body and core exercises that will benefit your tennis and biking performance.\n\n**Modify Your Yoga Sessions:**\n\n1. **Add Strength Exercises**: Incorporate strength exercises that target your lower body, glutes, and core muscles. Examples include:\n\t* Squats, lunges, and leg press to strengthen your legs and glutes.\n\t* Calf raises to improve ankle strength and stability.\n\t* Planks, side planks, and bird dogs to engage your core and improve overall stability.\n\t* Glute bridges and hip thrusts to target your glutes and hamstrings.\n2. **Incorporate Resistance Bands or Weights**: Use resistance bands or light weights to add an extra challenge to your strength exercises. This will help improve your power and endurance.\n3. **Focus on Functional Movements**: Incorporate functional movements that mimic the actions you perform on the tennis court or bike. For example:\n\t* Single-leg squats or balance exercises to improve balance and stability.\n\t* Lateral movements, such as side lunges or shuffles, to mimic tennis footwork.\n\t* Leg swings and hip circles to improve hip mobility and power.\n4. **Maintain Yoga Principles**: Remember to maintain proper yoga principles, such as breathing, alignment, and control, even when incorporating strength exercises.\n5. **Start with Lower Intensity**: Begin with lower intensity exercises and gradually increase the difficulty as you build strength and endurance.\n\n**Sample Modified Yoga Session:**\n\n**Warm-up (5-10 minutes)**:\n\n* Light cardio, such as jogging or jumping jacks\n* Dynamic stretching, like leg swings and arm circles\n\n**Strength Exercises (20-30 minutes)**:\n\n* Squats (3 sets of 10 reps)\n* Calf raises (3 sets of 15 reps)\n* Plank (3 sets of 30-second hold)\n* Glute bridges (3 sets of 12 reps)\n* Lateral lunges (3 sets of 10 reps per leg)\n\n**Yoga Flow (20-30 minutes)**:\n\n* Focus on lower body and core-strengthening poses, such as:\n\t+ Warrior II and I\n\t+ Triangle pose\n\t+ Tree pose\n\t+ Seated forward fold\n\t+ Boat pose\n\n**Cool-down (5-10 minutes)**:\n\n* Static stretching, focusing on the lower body and glutes\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n1. **Listen to Your Body**: If you're new to strength training or have any injuries, start slowly and modify exercises as needed.\n2. **Focus on Form**: Prioritize proper form and technique over the number of reps or weight used.\n3. **Breathe and Engage**: Remember to engage your core and breathe correctly throughout the exercises.\n4. **Make it a Habit**: Consistency is key. Aim to incorporate strength training into your yoga sessions at least twice a week.\n\nBy modifying your yoga sessions to include strength training, you'll improve your overall fitness, enhance your tennis and biking performance, and reduce the risk of injuries. Happy training!",
