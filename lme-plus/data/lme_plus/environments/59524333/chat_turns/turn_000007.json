  "content": "Lemon rosemary shortbread cookies are a great choice. Proper storage is crucial to maintaining their freshness and flavor. Here are some tips to help you store them for a longer period:\n\n**Short-term storage (up to 5 days):**\n\n1. **Cool cookies completely:** Before storing, make sure the cookies are completely cool to prevent moisture from building up and causing them to become soft or soggy.\n2. **Store in an airtight container:** Place the cookies in an airtight container, such as a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. This will help keep the cookies fresh by preventing air, moisture, and other contaminants from entering the container.\n3. **Room temperature:** Store the cookies at room temperature (around 68\u00b0F to 72\u00b0F or 20\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C) for up to 5 days.\n\n**Long-term storage (up to 2 weeks):**\n\n1. **Layer cookies with parchment paper:** To prevent cookies from sticking together, place a layer of parchment paper between each layer of cookies in the container.\n2. **Store in the refrigerator:** Place the container in the refrigerator to slow down the staling process. The cookies will keep for up to 2 weeks in the fridge.\n3. **Freeze for longer storage:** If you want to keep the cookies for longer than 2 weeks, consider freezing them. Place the cookies in a single layer on a baking sheet, then transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or airtight container. Frozen cookies can be stored for up to 3 months.\n\n**Thawing frozen cookies:**\n\n1. **Room temperature:** Remove the desired number of cookies from the freezer bag or container and place them at room temperature for a few hours to thaw.\n2. **Refrigerate overnight:** Alternatively, you can place the frozen cookies in the refrigerator overnight to thaw.\n\n**Tips for maintaining freshness:**\n\n1. **Use high-quality ingredients:** Using fresh and high-quality ingredients will result in a better-tasting cookie that will stay fresh longer.\n2. **Avoid humid environments:** Store cookies in a dry, cool place to prevent moisture from affecting their texture and flavor.\n3. **Keep them away from strong-smelling foods:** Cookies can absorb odors from nearby foods, so store them away from strong-smelling ingredients like onions, garlic, or fish.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you'll be able to enjoy your delicious lemon rosemary shortbread cookies for a longer period while maintaining their flavor and texture.",
