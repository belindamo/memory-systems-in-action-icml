The team lead, Rachel, has presented her idea, and now it's open for discussion. You have a different approach that you think could be more effective, but you're hesitant to share it because Rachel tends to dominate the conversation and can be quite persuasive.\n\n**Your Goal:**\n\nExpress your idea confidently and assertively, ensuring that it's heard and considered by the team.\n\n**Let's Start:**\n\nWe'll begin with the meeting scenario. I'll play the role of Rachel, the team lead. I'll start by summarizing her idea and then turn to you to ask for your thoughts.\n\n\"Alright, so to summarize, my idea is to launch a social media campaign to promote our new product. We'll create a series of ads and influencer partnerships to reach a wider audience. What do you all think? Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas to add?\"\n\nNow it's your turn! Go ahead and express your idea. Remember to be clear, concise, and confident. I'll respond as Rachel, and we can continue the role-play from there.",
