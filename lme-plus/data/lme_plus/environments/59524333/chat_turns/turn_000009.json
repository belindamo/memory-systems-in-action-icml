This combination will create a beautiful balance of sweet and savory.\n3. **Basil and Lemon Zest:** Take the lemon flavor to the next level by adding some bright, citrusy basil and extra lemon zest. This combination will transport you to the Mediterranean coast!\n4. **Ginger and Cranberry:** Add some warmth with crystallized ginger and dried cranberries. This combination will create a lovely sweet and spicy flavor profile.\n5. **Espresso and Chocolate Chips:** Add a mocha twist with instant espresso powder and dark chocolate chips. This combination will create a rich, decadent cookie.\n6. **Orange and Cardamom:** Introduce a new citrus dimension with orange zest and ground cardamom.
