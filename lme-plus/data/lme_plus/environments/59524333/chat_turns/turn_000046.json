Here are some recommendations for you:\n\n**Things to consider before choosing a brush set:**\n\n1. **Natural or Synthetic Hair:** Natural hair brushes (e.g., sable, squirrel, mongoose) are ideal for watercolor, as they hold a lot of water and pigment. Synthetic brushes are more affordable and still perform well, but may not hold as much water.\n2. **Brush Size and Shape:** A variety of brush sizes and shapes will allow you to achieve different effects. Look for a set that includes round, flat, and mop brushes.\n3. **Quality of Construction:** A well-made brush will last longer and perform better. Look for brushes with sturdy ferrules (the metal band that holds the hair in place) and comfortable handles.\n\n**Recommended Watercolor Brush Sets:**\n\n1. **Winsor & Newton Cotman Watercolor Brush Set:** A popular, affordable option with a range of synthetic and natural hair brushes. ($20-$50)\n2. **Daniel Smith Watercolor Brush Set:** A high-quality set with a mix of natural and synthetic hair brushes, ideal for beginners and experienced artists.

($50-$100)\n4. **Escoda Watercolor Brush Set:** A Spanish-made set with natural and synthetic hair brushes, offering a range of sizes and shapes. ($50-$150)\n5. **Schmincke Horadam Watercolor Brush Set:** A high-end set with natural hair brushes, ideal for experienced artists looking for exceptional quality. ($100-$250)\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Start with a smaller set:** A smaller set (5-10 brushes) can be a good starting point, as it will allow you to get familiar with different brushes without breaking the bank.\n2. **Invest in a few high-quality brushes:** If you can't afford a full set, consider investing in a few high-quality brushes that you'll use frequently.\n3. **Take care of your brushes:** Clean and store your brushes properly to extend their lifespan.\n4. **Practice makes perfect:** Remember, the quality of your brushes is only one aspect of watercolor painting.
