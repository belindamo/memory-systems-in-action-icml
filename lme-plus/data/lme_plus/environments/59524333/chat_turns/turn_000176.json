  "content": "One way to improve readability would be to extract the code that sets up the button event listeners into a separate function and then call that function for each button.\nAnother option would be to use a more descriptive variable name for the telEvents array, for example telInputEvents or telInputEventListeners.\nYou can also consider grouping the related events and actions together in a single object for each input, for example like this:\n```\nconst telInput = {\n  element: document.querySelector('input[type=tel]'),\n  events: {\n    keydown: e => {\n      if (e.key === \" \" || e.key === \"Enter\") telInput.classList.add(\"ativa\")\n    },\n    keyup: () => telInput.classList.remove(\"ativa\"),\n  }\n};\n```\nThis way it's more clear and easy to understand the relation between the input element and the events it listens to.\n\nAnother way could be creating a class for your phone input, which will help in modularizing and managing the code, also making it more readable and maintainable.\n\nYou can also use libraries to make the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nNote that readability is a subjective concept and what works for one developer may not work for another. But these are some of the common ways to make the code more readable.",
