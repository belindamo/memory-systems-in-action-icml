Setting a consistent bedtime, dimming the lights, and avoiding screens before bed will help signal to your brain that it's time to sleep. Winding down with reading or calming music will help relax your mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep.\n\nWriting down your to-do list for the next day is a great habit to get into. It can help clear your mind and reduce stress, making it easier to fall asleep. Plus, it'll help you feel more organized and prepared for the next day.\n\nRemember, the key is to start small and be consistent. Don't try to change everything at once. Start with these habits and see how they work for you. You can always add or adjust them as needed.\n\nAlso, don't forget to be kind to yourself if you don't see immediate results. It can take some time for your body to adjust to a new bedtime routine. But with consistent effort, you'll start to notice improvements in your sleep quality and overall well-being.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, good luck with your new bedtime routine, and I hope you start sleeping better soon!",
