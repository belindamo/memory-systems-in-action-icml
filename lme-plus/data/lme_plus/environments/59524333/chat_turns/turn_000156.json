Here's the description of that page:\n\n* Once the user selects the branch from the Browser page, the user will be directed to the home page of Semesters.\n* This page will have all the semester buttons on the left side, with the 5th semester being the home page.\n* The center of the page will contain the subjects of the 5th semester.\n* Clicking on a subject will lead the user to a page containing all the notes related to that subject.\n* Each note will have a brief description, author name, upload date, and a download button.\n* At the bottom of the page, there will be a button to go back to the home page of Semesters.\n* The top navbar will have options to go back to the previous page, browse notes, and access the Q&A forum, courses, and job info page.",
