By creating a folder and sharing the link, you can ensure that the potential client has access to all the necessary files in one place.\n\nHere are a few additional tips to make the file-sharing process smooth:\n\n1. **Create a clear and descriptive folder name**: Use a name that clearly indicates the contents of the folder, such as \"Meeting Materials - [Project/Client Name]\".\n2. **Organize the files within the folder**: Use subfolders or clear file names to help the potential client quickly find the information they need.\n3. **Set the correct permissions**: Make sure to set the permissions to \"Editor\" or \"Viewer\" depending on whether you want the potential client to be able to edit or only view the files.\n4. **Include a brief note or instructions**: In the email, include a brief note explaining what the files contain and what you'd like the potential client to review before the meeting.\n5. **Test the link**: Before sending the email, test the link to ensure it works properly and the files are accessible.\n\nExample email:\n\n\"Hi [Potential Client],\n\nI've shared a folder containing the necessary files for our meeting on Tuesday. You can access the folder via this link: [insert link]. Please take a few minutes to review the materials before our call.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me. I'm looking forward to discussing the project with you on Tuesday.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\"\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to share the files efficiently and ensure a productive meeting with the potential client.",
