Here are some tips to help you set up and use them effectively:\n\n**Todoist:**\n\n1. **Start with a clean slate**: Create a new project and add all your tasks, big and small. This will help you get a sense of what you need to accomplish.\n2. **Create a task hierarchy**: Organize your tasks using labels, filters, and priorities. This will help you focus on the most important tasks first.\n3. **Use natural language input**: Todoist allows you to create tasks using natural language. For example, \"Write a report by Friday\" will automatically set the due date and task name.\n4. **Set deadlines and reminders**: Set realistic deadlines and reminders to ensure you stay on track. You can also set recurring tasks for regular activities.\n5. **Use the \"Today\" view**: The \"Today\" view shows you all the tasks due today. This will help you stay focused on what needs to be done immediately.\n6. **Prioritize your tasks**: Use the priority levels (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to indicate the importance of each task. This will help you tackle the most critical tasks first.\n7. **Integrate with other apps**: Todoist integrates with many apps, including Google Calendar, Slack, and Gmail. Take advantage of these integrations to streamline your workflow.\n\n**Evernote:**\n\n1. **Create a note-taking system**: Set up a consistent note-taking system using notebooks, tags, and stacks. This will help you quickly find the information you need.\n2. **Use the \"Inbox\" notebook**: The \"Inbox\" notebook is a default notebook in Evernote. Use it to capture quick notes, ideas, and tasks that come up throughout the day.\n3. **Create a \"Someday\" notebook**: Create a notebook for tasks or ideas that don't have a deadline. This will help you keep track of long-term goals and projects.\n4. **Use tags and note links**: Use tags to categorize your notes and create links between related notes. This will help you connect ideas and tasks.\n5. **Take advantage of templates**: Evernote offers templates for common tasks, such as meeting notes and to-do lists. Use these templates to streamline your workflow.\n6. **Set reminders**: Set reminders for tasks and deadlines within Evernote. This will ensure you stay on track and never miss a deadline.\n7. **Sync across devices**: Evernote syncs seamlessly across devices, so you can access your notes and tasks anywhere, anytime.\n\n**General tips:**\n\n1. **Start small**: Don't try to implement everything at once. Start with a small set of tasks and gradually add more as you become comfortable with the apps.\n2. **Customize to your workflow**: Experiment with different settings and features to find what works best for you.\n3. **Be consistent**: Consistency is key to making task management a habit. Try to use the apps at the same time every day to make it a habit.\n4. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your tasks and adjust your system as needed. This will help you stay on track and ensure you're using the apps effectively.\n\nRemember, the key to success is to find a system that works for you and stick to it.
