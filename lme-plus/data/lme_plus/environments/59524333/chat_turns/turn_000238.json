While they may not be seen as actual goddesses, there are individuals, concepts or sources of inspiration that have a similar role in contemporary creativity. For example, there are people especially musicians, writers, art curators, influencers, and motivational speakers, who inspire others to push their limits and explore new creative directions. There are programs such as Artists-in-Residence or writing workshops, which offer structured creative environments aimed at sparking the inner creativity of an individual or group.
