  "content": "The power to issue currency and regulate the money supply in the United States is delegated to the federal government under the Constitution, specifically Article I, Section 8, which gives Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof.\n\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established the Federal Reserve System, which serves as the central banking system of the United States and is responsible for issuing and regulating the supply of US currency.\n\nTogether, the Constitution and the Federal Reserve Act establish the federal government's exclusive authority over the issuance and regulation of currency in the United States. Any attempt by a state or other entity to issue its own currency or to supplant the US dollar as the official currency of the country would likely be in violation of these federal laws and regulations.",
