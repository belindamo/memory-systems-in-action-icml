In these cases, the courts have generally recognized the authority of Congress to regulate currency under the Constitution and have upheld various laws and regulations related to currency, including the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nFederal regulatory agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), have also issued guidance and regulations related to the use of digital currencies. These agencies have interpreted the authority of Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution to include the power to regulate digital currencies, and have implemented regulations and guidance aimed at ensuring the stability and security of the financial system, protecting consumers, and preventing illicit activities.\n\nIn summary, the interpretation of Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution to include the authority to issue paper money and regulate digital forms of currency has been made by the courts and federal regulatory agencies, based on the powers delegated to Congress under the Constitution.",
