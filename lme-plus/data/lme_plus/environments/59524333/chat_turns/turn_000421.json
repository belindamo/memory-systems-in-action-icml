Congrats on cleaning out the old clothes, that's the first step to a more organized space. Here are some tips to help you maximize your closet's potential:\n\n1. **Purge and categorize**: You've already purged your closet, but make sure to categorize your remaining items into groups like tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, and accessories.\n2. **Use a closet system**: Invest in a closet organizer system or DIY a shelving unit using IKEA products (you're already familiar with their assembly process). This will help you make the most of your closet's vertical space.\n3. **Double-hang rods**: Installing double-hang rods will double your hanging space, allowing you to store more items without overcrowding the closet.\n4. **Shelves and bins**: Use shelves for folded items like sweaters, jeans, or blankets. Add bins or baskets to store accessories like hats, scarves, or bags.\n5. **Utilize the back of the door**: Take advantage of the space on the back of the door by using over-the-door storage racks, hooks, or a shoe organizer.\n6. **Store out-of-season clothes**: Consider storing out-of-season clothes in storage bins or containers and keeping them on a high shelf or under the bed to free up space in your closet.\n7. **Implement a \"one in, one out\" policy**: To maintain your newly organized closet, adopt a rule where you get rid of an old item every time you bring a new one into your closet.\n8. **Keep shoes in order**: Store your shoes in a designated area, like on a shoe rack or in a shoe organizer, to keep them organized and easy to find.\n9. **Hang clothes by type**: Organize your clothes by type, such as dresses, tops, and pants, to make it easier to find what you need.\n10. **Maintain your space**: Set aside some time each week to maintain your closet's organization. Hang up clothes that are wrinkled or out of place, and put away items that are not being used.\n\nRemember, the key to a well-organized closet is to keep it tidy and maintain it regularly. By following these tips, you'll be able to find what you need quickly and enjoy a more peaceful morning routine.\n\nDo you have any specific closet organization challenges or questions?
