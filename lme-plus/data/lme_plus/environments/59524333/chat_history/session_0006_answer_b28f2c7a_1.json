Task Dependencies**: Use task dependencies to link tasks that rely on each other. This ensures that you complete tasks in the correct order and avoid blockers.\n\n**8. Custom Views**: Create custom views to see your tasks in a way that works best for you. For example, you can create a view that shows only tasks due today, or tasks with a specific label.\n\n**9.
