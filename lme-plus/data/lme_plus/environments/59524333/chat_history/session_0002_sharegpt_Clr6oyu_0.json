Mods can range from small tweaks to the game's mechanics to completely new gameplay features and even entire new game modes.\n\nMods are created by third-party developers and are not officially supported by the Minecraft developer, Mojang. However, the popularity of mods has led to the creation of tools like Minecraft Forge, which make it easier for players to install and manage mods in the game.\n\nPlayers can find and download mods from various online websites and forums, and there are many mods available for all different types of gameplay experiences. Some mods add new items and blocks to the game, while others change the game's mechanics or add new gameplay features. Some mods are designed to be used in conjunction with other mods, while others can be used on their own.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
