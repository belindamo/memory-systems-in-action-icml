      "content": "To create a Twitter card image, the recommended size is 1200x628 pixels. You can include this image in your HTML code using the `<meta>` tag and the `name` attribute set to `twitter:image`. Here is an example:\n```php\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\">\n```\nIn this example, the `twitter:card` property is set to `summary_large_image`, which tells Twitter to display the image as a large summary card. The `twitter:image` property specifies the URL of the image you want to display.\n\nNote that you will also need to include other `<meta>` tags in your HTML to provide additional information for the Twitter card, such as the title, description, and Twitter handle. You can find more information on the required properties and how to set them in Twitter's documentation: <https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started>."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, that's correct! The `og:image` meta tag you're using is for Open Graph Protocol, which is used by Facebook and other social media platforms to determine the preview of a shared link. To ensure that Twitter displays your preview image at 1200x628 pixels, you need to include the `twitter:card` and `twitter:image` meta tags as well, as mentioned in my previous answer.\n\nHere's the complete example:\n```php\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" />\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\">\n```\nThis will tell Twitter to display your link preview as a summary large image card, using the image specified in the `twitter:image` property. Make sure to replace the URL in the `content` attribute with the URL of your image."

      "content": "Great reply. So my \"twitter:image\" can be the same image (URL) as my \"og:image\" image (URL). In other words, is 1200x628 pixels the correct size for the \"twitter:image\" image?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, you can use the same image URL for both the `og:image` and `twitter:image` tags. And, yes, 1200x628 pixels is the correct size for the `twitter:image` image on Twitter. The recommended aspect ratio for Twitter card images is 1.91:1, and this size of 1200x628 pixels fits within that aspect ratio and provides a high-quality preview for your link.\n\nIt's also a good idea to make sure that your image is served with the correct content type (e.g. `image/jpeg` or `image/png`), and that the image file size is not too large (less than 5 MB). You can find more information about these requirements in Twitter's documentation: <https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started>"

      "content": "Also, in my og:graph code I have these image parameters:\nThe image is already sized to 1200x628 pixels, so can I remove these and instead add:\n\n ?/"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, you can remove the `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` meta tags, since the size of the image is already specified in the `og:image` tag. And, adding the `twitter:card` and `twitter:image` meta tags to your HTML will ensure that Twitter displays the link preview image correctly. Here's the complete example:\n```php\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" />\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\">\n```\nMake sure to replace the URL in the `content` attribute with the URL of your image."
