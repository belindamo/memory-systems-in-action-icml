      "content": "Gluten-free ice cream is intended for individuals with celiac disease or a gluten intolerance, as gluten can cause an immune response in these individuals that can lead to damage to the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and can be found in many processed foods, including ice cream. Gluten-free ice cream is made using ingredients that do not contain gluten, such as cornstarch or rice flour, in place of wheat-based ingredients. Some people without gluten intolerance also choose gluten-free ice cream as a healthier or lower-calorie option."
