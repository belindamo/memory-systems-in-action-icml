  "content": "Charcoal grilling will definitely give your bell peppers a rich, smoky flavor.\n\nAnd wow, a Korean-inspired marinade for chicken breasts sounds amazing! I'm intrigued! Korean cuisine is known for its bold flavors and spices, and I can imagine how well it would pair with BBQ. What's the marinade recipe you used? Was it based on traditional Korean ingredients like gochujang, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger?\n\nI'd love to hear more about it! Share the recipe, and I can help you refine it or suggest some variations.\n\n(By the way, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or taste buds, but I'm always excited to learn about new recipes and cooking techniques!)",
