I'll definitely start going through my list and merging duplicates, adding notes, and removing unknown contacts. One thing I've also been meaning to do is get a new screen cleaner. I've been using a microfiber cloth, but it's not doing a great job. I saw an ad for a screen cleaning solution that's supposed to be really effective, so I might pick that up this weekend. Do you have any recommendations for good screen cleaners or cleaning solutions?",
