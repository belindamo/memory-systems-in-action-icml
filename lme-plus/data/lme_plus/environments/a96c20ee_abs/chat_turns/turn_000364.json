Barbosa et al., 2021)\n\nIn this paper, the authors proposed a novel approach for classifying coffee beans based on visual features and machine learning techniques. The proposed approach used computer vision to extract visual features from images of coffee beans, and then applied a machine learning algorithm to classify the beans into two categories: Arabica and Robusta. The visual features were extracted using a combination of color-based and texture-based features, which were then fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed approach was evaluated on a dataset of 360 images of coffee beans, achieving an accuracy of 98.3%.\n\nThe authors noted that their proposed approach could be useful for quality control in coffee production, as well as for identifying coffee fraud (i.e., mislabeling of coffee beans). They also noted that the approach could be extended to classify coffee beans based on other characteristics, such as roast level or country of origin.\n\nPaper 5: \"Evaluation of coffee sensory attributes using machine learning techniques.\" (C. A. R. de Oliveira et al., 2021)\n\nIn this paper, the authors explored the use of machine learning techniques for evaluating coffee sensory attributes. Specifically, they used a dataset of sensory evaluations of 60 coffee samples, collected using a standard cupping protocol. The samples were evaluated on various sensory attributes, including aroma, flavor, acidity, body, and aftertaste.\n\nThe authors applied several machine learning algorithms to the dataset, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM). They found that SVM achieved the highest accuracy for predicting the sensory attributes, with an overall accuracy of 77%. They also noted that the results of their study could be useful for developing automated systems for coffee sensory evaluation, which could improve the efficiency and consistency of the cupping process.\n\nOverall, both of these papers demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques for improving various aspects of coffee production and consumption, from classification of coffee beans to sensory evaluation and quality control.",
