Here are some signs to help you determine if your car's suspension is too stiff or too soft during today's track day:\n\n**Signs of too stiff suspension:**\n\n1. **Harsh ride**: If the car feels extremely bumpy or uncomfortable, even on smooth tracks, it might be a sign that the suspension is too stiff.\n2. **Loss of traction**: If the car is consistently losing traction or sliding excessively, especially during cornering or braking, it could indicate that the suspension is too stiff.\n3. **Reduced grip**: If you notice a lack of grip or a decrease in cornering speed, it might be due to the suspension being too stiff, which can cause the tires to lose contact with the track.\n4. **Unsettled handling**: If the car feels twitchy or unstable, especially during high-speed corners or under braking, it could be a sign of too stiff suspension.\n5. **Increased understeer**: If the car is consistently understeering (pushing wide) during cornering, it might be due to the suspension being too stiff, which can cause the front tires to lose grip.\n\n**Signs of too soft suspension:**\n\n1. **Body roll**: If the car is rolling excessively during cornering, it might be a sign that the suspension is too soft.\n2. **Wallowing or floating**: If the car feels like it's floating or wallowing during cornering or braking, it could indicate that the suspension is too soft.\n3. **Lack of precision**: If the car feels imprecise or vague during cornering or steering, it might be due to the suspension being too soft.\n4. **Increased oversteer**: If the car is consistently oversteering (loosing rear traction) during cornering, it could be a sign of too soft suspension.\n5. **Increased dive or squat**: If the car is diving or squatting excessively during braking or acceleration, it might be a sign that the suspension is too soft.\n\n**What to do during the track day:**\n\n1. **Pay attention to your car's behavior**: Observe how your car responds to different driving styles, corners, and braking zones.\n2. **Take notes**: Write down your observations, including any issues or concerns you have about the car's behavior.\n3. **Make adjustments**: If you suspect the suspension is too stiff or too soft, make adjustments to the coilovers or consult with a track-side mechanic for guidance.\n4. **Experiment with different driving styles**: Try different driving styles, such as smoother or more aggressive inputs, to see how the car responds.\n5. **Seek feedback from instructors or experienced drivers**: Ask for feedback from instructors or experienced drivers who have driven your car or similar cars.\n\nBy paying attention to these signs and making adjustments accordingly, you'll be able to fine-tune your suspension setup and optimize your car's performance for your driving style.",
