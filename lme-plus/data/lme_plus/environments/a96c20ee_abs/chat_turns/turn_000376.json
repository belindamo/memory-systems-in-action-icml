Here are some tips to help you roast vegetables like a pro:\n\n**Choosing the right vegetables:**\n\n* Root vegetables like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and sweet potatoes are perfect for roasting.\n* Other vegetables like asparagus, bell peppers, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes also roast well.\n* You can mix and match different vegetables to create a colorful and flavorful medley.\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n* Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n* Wash and peel the vegetables as needed. Cut them into bite-sized pieces, making sure they're roughly the same size so they roast evenly.\n* Remove any seeds or pits, and trim any tough ends.\n\n**Seasoning:**\n\n* Drizzle the vegetables with olive oil, making sure they're evenly coated.\n* Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste. You can also add other seasonings like garlic powder, paprika, or dried herbs like thyme or rosemary.\n* Toss the vegetables to distribute the seasonings evenly.\n\n**Roasting:**\n\n* Spread the vegetables out in a single layer on a baking sheet. You may need to use multiple sheets depending on the quantity of vegetables.\n* Roast in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and caramelized.\n* Stir the vegetables halfway through the roasting time to ensure even browning.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Cut vegetables into different shapes and sizes to create a visually appealing salad.\n* Roast vegetables at different temperatures, like 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for more delicate vegetables or 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for heartier ones.\n* Add aromatics like onions, garlic, or lemon slices to the baking sheet for added flavor.\n* Try roasting vegetables with a bit of acidity, like lemon juice or vinegar, to balance out their natural sweetness.\n\n**For your quinoa salad:**\n\n* Once the vegetables are roasted, let them cool slightly before adding them to your quinoa salad.\n* Mix the roasted vegetables with cooked quinoa, chopped fresh herbs, and a tangy dressing for a delicious and healthy meal.\n\nI hope these tips help you roast amazing vegetables for your quinoa salad!",
