  "content": "Aside from the Epic of Gilgamesh, there are numerous other Assyrian texts that have survived until today. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. The Assyrian king Sennacherib commissioned the creation of a massive library in the 7th century BCE. The library contained over 30,000 clay tablets with texts on a wide range of subjects, including science, history, religion, and literature. Many of these texts have survived to modern times and provide valuable insights into ancient Assyrian culture and society.\n\n2. The Ashurbanipal Library, named after the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, was another famous library that contained thousands of texts on various subjects. The library is famous for containing the earliest surviving copies of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\n3. The Assyrian King List is a historical text that lists the names of the kings who ruled Assyria from the beginning of the empire until the end of the Neo-Assyrian period. The list provides valuable insights into the chronology of Assyrian history.\n\n4. The Annals of Ashurbanipal are historical records that document the military campaigns and conquests of King Ashurbanipal. The records provide a detailed account of the events leading up to the fall of the Assyrian Empire.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many Assyrian texts that have survived until today. The vast collection of Assyrian texts has provided scholars with valuable insights into the history, culture, and language of ancient Mesopotamia.",
