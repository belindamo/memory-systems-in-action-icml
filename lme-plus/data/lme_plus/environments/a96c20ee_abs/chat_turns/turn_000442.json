Leather jackets can add a tough, cool factor to your outfit and create a bold, stylish statement.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider when pairing a leather jacket with your graphic tee and distressed denim jeans:\n\n**1. Choose the right leather jacket**: Look for a leather jacket that fits well and has a style that complements your graphic tee and jeans. You can opt for a classic biker jacket, a bomber jacket, or a more modern, fashion-forward design.\n\n**2. Balance the look**: Since a leather jacket can be quite bold, balance it out with a simpler graphic tee. A smaller graphic or a more subtle design can work well.\n\n**3. Play with textures**: Mixing different textures can add depth to your outfit. The smooth, cool texture of the leather jacket can contrast nicely with the rougher, distressed denim jeans.\n\n**4. Add some attitude**: A leather jacket can instantly add an edgy vibe to your outfit. Embrace the attitude and have fun with it!\n\n**5. Don't forget about the shoes**: Choose shoes that complement the edgy look. Boots, such as ankle boots or combat boots, can work well with a leather jacket and distressed denim jeans.\n\nHere's an example of how you could style your outfit:\n\n* Graphic tee with a smaller graphic or a subtle design\n* Distressed denim jeans with ripped knees or frayed hems\n* Leather jacket in a bold, edgy style (e.g., biker jacket or bomber jacket)\n* Ankle boots or combat boots in a neutral color (e.g., black, brown)\n* Minimal jewelry, such as a simple necklace or a pair of stud earrings\n\nRemember, the key to pulling off an edgy look is to own it with confidence! Have fun experimenting with different combinations, and don't be afraid to try new things.",
