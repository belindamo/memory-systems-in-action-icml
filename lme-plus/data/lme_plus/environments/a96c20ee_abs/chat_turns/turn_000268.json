  "content": "Cherry shrimp are adaptable to a wide range of water parameters, but they thrive in soft to moderately hard water with a slightly acidic to neutral pH. Here are the recommended water hardness and pH ranges for cherry shrimp:\n\n**Water Hardness (GH & KH):**\n\n* General Hardness (GH): 4-10 dGH (degrees German Hardness)\n* Carbonate Hardness (KH): 1-4 dKH\n\nCherry shrimp can tolerate a wide range of hardness levels, but they prefer softer water. Aim for a GH around 5-7 dGH and KH around 1-2 dKH.\n\n**pH:**\n\n* pH range: 6.5-7.5\n* Ideal pH: 6.8-7.2\n\nCherry shrimp can tolerate a pH range of 6.0-8.0, but they thrive in a slightly acidic to neutral pH. A pH above 7.5 can lead to stress and health issues.\n\n**Other water parameters:**\n\n* Temperature: 65\u00b0F-75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C-24\u00b0C), as mentioned earlier\n* Water flow: Moderate to low water flow is recommended\n* Water changes: Regular water changes (10-20% every week) to maintain water quality and prevent buildup of toxins\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a water conditioner to remove chlorine and chloramines from tap water, which can harm cherry shrimp.\n* Monitor your water parameters regularly to ensure they remain stable and within the recommended ranges.\n* Avoid sudden changes in water parameters, as this can stress the shrimp.\n\nBy maintaining these water parameters, you'll create a comfortable and healthy environment for your cherry shrimp to thrive.",
