  "content": "A battery is charged by the flow of electrical current through the battery from an external source. The charging process involves the transfer of electrons from the external source to the battery.\n\nThe charging process is typically described in terms of positive and negative terminals, which are used to denote the polarity of the voltage applied to the battery. The positive terminal is typically marked with a \"+\" symbol, and the negative terminal is typically marked with a \"-\" symbol.\n\nWhen a battery is being charged, the positive terminal of the battery is connected to the positive terminal of the external source, and the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the negative terminal of the external source. This allows the flow of electrons from the external source to the battery.\n\nThe charging process continues until the battery is fully charged, at which point the battery will be able to deliver electrical energy to a circuit when it is connected to the circuit.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
