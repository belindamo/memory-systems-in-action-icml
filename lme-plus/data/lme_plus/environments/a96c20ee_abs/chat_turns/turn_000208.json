  "content": "The most effective treatment for computer eye strain is to give your eyes a break. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Take frequent breaks: Follow the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, look away from your screen and focus on something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This will help relax your eye muscles.\n\n2. Adjust your computer settings: Increase the font size, adjust the brightness of your screen, and reduce glare by using anti-glare screen filters.\n\n3. Blink and Massage: Blink frequently to prevent dry eyes. Also, massaging your eyelids can help improve blood circulation.\n\n4. Use the right lighting: Use soft lighting to reduce glare and avoid harsh overhead lighting.\n\n5. Get your eyes checked: Regular eye exams can help detect and fix vision problems before they cause eye strain.\n\n6. Adjust Your screen distance and angle: Comfortable viewing distance from computer screen is about an arms length, with the screen sitting at or slightly below eye level.\n\n7. Try out computer glasses: Prescription glasses or specially designed glasses for computer use help reduce eye strain.\n\nPreventing computer eye strain is better than treating it. Adopting proper computer ergonomics practices can go a great length in preventing computer eye strain.",
