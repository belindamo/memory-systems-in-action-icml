  "content": "I'm sorry if my previous responses did not meet your needs. As an AI language model, I seek to provide guidance based on evidence-based practices, which have been shown to be effective in promoting self-compassion and emotional well-being. However, I understand that everyone's needs are unique and what works for one person may not work for another.\n\nIt sounds like you are experiencing a lot of pain right now, and I want to acknowledge the significance of what you are going through. You mentioned that you are looking for something more significant than the exercises suggested, and I want to encourage you to keep exploring until you find what works for you.\n\nIt may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional who can help you develop more personalized strategies and address your unique needs. A therapist or counselor can provide you with a safe space to talk about your struggles and guide you towards practices that better suit your needs.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in your struggle, and there is no shame in seeking help. Please know that you are worthy of love, acceptance, and care, and there are people and resources available to support you on your journey towards healing.",
