However, it's important to note that road reconstruction is a complex process that can take several years depending on the extent of the damage and the availability of resources such as funding, materials, and labor. \n\nIn Bougainville, road reconstruction has been ongoing for several years after the civil war that began in 1988 and ended with the peace agreement in 2001. The Bougainville government has been working with international aid organizations to rebuild the region's infrastructure, including its road network. Success stories have emerged since the end of the conflict such as upgrading of the road network around the Aropa Airport, the construction of the Aropa bridge and the sealing of the Buka ring road. However, ongoing challenges and limited funding have slowed down the pace of reconstruction efforts.",
