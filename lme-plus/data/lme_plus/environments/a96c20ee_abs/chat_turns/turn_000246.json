  "content": "Yes, that's correct! The `og:image` meta tag you're using is for Open Graph Protocol, which is used by Facebook and other social media platforms to determine the preview of a shared link. To ensure that Twitter displays your preview image at 1200x628 pixels, you need to include the `twitter:card` and `twitter:image` meta tags as well, as mentioned in my previous answer.\n\nHere's the complete example:\n```php\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" />\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\">\n```\nThis will tell Twitter to display your link preview as a summary large image card, using the image specified in the `twitter:image` property. Make sure to replace the URL in the `content` attribute with the URL of your image.",
