I'd be happy to walk you through the process of creating a custom profile for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.\n\n**Step 1: Launch Synapse Software**\n\nOpen the Razer Synapse software on your computer.

A higher DPI setting can be beneficial for fast-paced games like Call of Duty.\n* **Polling Rate**: Set the polling rate to 1000 Hz for optimal performance.\n* **Acceleration**: Adjust the acceleration settings to your liking.

For example, you can assign the side buttons to perform actions like \"Use\" or \"Melee\".\n\n**Step 5: Customize Your Button Bindings**\n\nIn the \"Button Bindings\" tab, you can customize the bindings for each mouse button. You can assign keyboard keys, macro commands, or other actions to each button.\n\n**Step 6: Create a Macro**\n\nIn the \"Macro\" tab, you can create a custom macro command that performs a series of actions with a single button press. For example, you can create a macro that performs a \"Quick Scope\" action in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.\n\n**Step 7: Save Your Profile**\n\nOnce you've customized your mouse settings, button bindings, and macro commands, save your profile by clicking on the \"Save\" button.\n\n**Step 8: Apply Your Profile**\n\nTo apply your custom profile to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, click on the \"Apply\" button.
