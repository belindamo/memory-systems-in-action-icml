  "content": "Greek yogurt is a fantastic substitute for mayonnaise in coleslaw, adding a tangy flavor and a lighter texture. Here's a simple recipe for Greek Yogurt Coleslaw:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 cups shredded cabbage (green or red, or a mix of both)\n* 1 cup shredded carrots\n* 1/2 cup Greek yogurt\n* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon honey\n* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro or parsley (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine the shredded cabbage and carrots.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, apple cider vinegar, honey, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper until smooth.\n3. Pour the yogurt mixture over the cabbage mixture and toss until the slaw is well coated.\n4. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more vinegar, honey, or mustard to taste.\n5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.\n6. Just before serving, sprinkle with chopped cilantro or parsley, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a food processor or mandoline to shred the cabbage and carrots quickly and evenly.\n* If you prefer a creamier slaw, you can add 1-2 tablespoons of mayonnaise to the yogurt mixture.\n* For a spicy kick, add 1-2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard or a pinch of cayenne pepper.\n* This slaw will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, so feel free to make it ahead of time.\n\nThis Greek Yogurt Coleslaw is a refreshing and healthier alternative to traditional coleslaw, with a nice balance of tangy and sweet flavors. Enjoy it with your BBQ chicken tacos or any other grilled meats!",
