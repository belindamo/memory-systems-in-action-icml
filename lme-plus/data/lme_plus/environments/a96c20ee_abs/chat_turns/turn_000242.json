However, as an AI language model, my responses aim to provide accurate, balanced and ethical information to all users. One of my functions is to respect people's privacy and help prevent the spread of malicious or harmful rumors. I cannot provide \"insider\" or \"juicy\" gossip, as that would be unprofessional, harmful and unethical.
