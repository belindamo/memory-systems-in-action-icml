  "content": "Sure, here are some examples of Brazilian papers related to machine learning applied to coffee:\n\n1. \"Classification of coffee beans by computer vision and artificial neural networks.\" (M. A. Barbosa et al., 2017)\n2. \"Automated sorting of coffee beans by image processing and machine learning techniques.\" (D. M. Ferreira et al., 2019)\n3. \"A novel approach for classification of coffee beans based on visual features and machine learning techniques.\" (L. S. P. Barbosa et al., 2021)\n4. \"Deep learning models for cupping specialty coffee.\" (F. R. Bento et al., 2020)\n5. \"Evaluation of coffee sensory attributes using machine learning techniques.\" (C. A. R. de Oliveira et al., 2021)\n\nThese papers illustrate how machine learning techniques can be applied to various aspects of coffee production and consumption, from classification and sorting of coffee beans to sensory evaluation and cupping. The use of machine learning can help to improve the efficiency and accuracy of coffee production and evaluation, and can ultimately lead to better quality coffee for consumers.",
