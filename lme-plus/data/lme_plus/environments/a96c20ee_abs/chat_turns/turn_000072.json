Single-track trails can be a blast, but they can also be tough on your bike. Good on you for recognizing the need to maintain your bike before your next ride.\n\nOiling your chain and adjusting your derailleur are both great steps to take. Here are some additional tips to consider:\n\n**Chain maintenance:**\n\n* Make sure to use the right type of chain lube for your bike. There are different types of lube for different conditions (e.g., wet, dry, etc.).\n* Clean your chain before applying lube to remove any dirt or grime. You can use a chain cleaner or a rag to do this.\n* Apply the lube according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, you'll want to apply a small amount to the chain links and then wipe off any excess with a rag.\n\n**Derailleur adjustment:**\n\n* Check your derailleur's limit screws to ensure they're properly adjusted. These screws control how far the derailleur can move in and out.\n* Check the derailleur's alignment to make sure it's properly aligned with the cassette and chainrings.\n* If you're not comfortable adjusting the derailleur yourself, consider taking your bike to a local bike shop for a professional tune-up.\n\n**Other pre-ride checks:**\n\n* Check your tire pressure and make sure it's at the recommended level.\n* Inspect your brake pads and make sure they're not worn down too far.\n* Give your bike a once-over to ensure everything is securely attached and in good working order.\n* Consider checking your bike's bolts and quick releases to make sure they're tightened properly.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Make sure you have a basic tool kit with you on your ride, including a pump or CO2 cartridges, a multi-tool, and a spare tube or two.\n* Bring plenty of water and snacks to keep you fueled and hydrated.\n* Let someone know your route and expected return time, and consider carrying a phone or other emergency device in case of an incident.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well-prepared for your next bike ride. Enjoy the trails!\n\n(By the way, I'm glad you mentioned Mike \u2013 it's great that you're getting out and enjoying activities with your neighbor!)",
