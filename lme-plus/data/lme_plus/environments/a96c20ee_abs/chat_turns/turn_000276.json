  "content": "Choosing the right substrate is crucial for a thriving shrimp tank. Cherry shrimp are sensitive to certain substrates, so it's essential to select one that's gentle on them and meets their needs. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Recommended Substrates:**\n\n1. **Sand**: Sand is an excellent choice for cherry shrimp tanks. It's gentle on their delicate bodies, and they love to swim and play on the surface. Look for a fine-grained, smooth sand that's specifically designed for aquariums.\n2. **Pool Filter Sand**: Pool filter sand is a popular choice among shrimp keepers. It's inexpensive, easy to clean, and provides a comfortable surface for your shrimp to move around on.\n3. **Play Sand**: Play sand is another type of sand that's suitable for shrimp tanks. It's fine-grained, soft, and easy to clean.\n4. **ADA Amazonia Soil**: ADA Amazonia Soil is a popular substrate among planted aquarium enthusiasts, but it's also suitable for shrimp-only tanks. It's a gentle, nutrient-rich substrate that promotes healthy plant growth and provides a comfortable surface for shrimp.\n\n**Substrates to Avoid:**\n\n1. **Gravel**: Gravel can be too harsh for cherry shrimp, causing them to dig and burrow excessively. It can also lead to injuries and stress.\n2. **Crushed Coral**: Crushed coral can be too abrasive for cherry shrimp and may cause them to dig and burrow excessively.\n3. **Coarse Sand**: Coarse sand can be uncomfortable for cherry shrimp and may cause them to dig and burrow excessively.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* **Depth**: Keep the substrate depth shallow, around 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm), to prevent your shrimp from burrowing excessively.\n* **Rinsing**: Rinse the substrate thoroughly before adding it to your tank to remove any impurities or dust.\n* **Avoid Over-Cleaning**: Avoid over-cleaning the substrate, as this can cause stress to your shrimp. Instead, perform regular water changes and gentle substrate cleaning.\n\nBy choosing a gentle, shrimp-friendly substrate, you'll create a comfortable and thriving environment for your cherry shrimp. Happy shrimp keeping!",
