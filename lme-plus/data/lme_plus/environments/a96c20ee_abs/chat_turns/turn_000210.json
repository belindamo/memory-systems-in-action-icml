Take regular breaks: Apart from following the 20-20-20 rule, take a 10-15 minute break after every 2 hours spent on your computer. 2. Adjust your workspace: Position your computer screen to prevent reflections and glare. Also, ensure that the brightness of your screen matches the brightness of the room you are in. 3. Reduce screen time: When possible, try to limit the time you spend on your computer and other digital devices. 4. Increase font size on the screen: You can change your screen's resolution for large fonts and install extensions or apps that will provide larger text sizes. 5. Keep your computer clean: Ensure that your screen and workstation are clean and dust-free. 6. Adopt proper posture: Sit at a comfortable distance, avoid slouching and adjust your workstation to match your height. 7. Use artificial tears: Using safe, non-prescription artificial tears several times a day can keep your eyes moist to prevent dryness. 8. Check your monitor's refresh rate: Low refresh rates can lead to flicker or visual disturbances, while a higher refresh rate reduces strain on your eyes. By implementing these tips, you'll be taking proactive measures to prevent computer eye strain and improve your overall eye health.",
