  "content": "\"Steps for St. Jude\" is a wonderful team name that clearly conveys your team's mission.\n\nSetting a team fundraising goal is a great way to motivate your team members and track your collective progress. Both $1,000 and $2,000 are ambitious goals, but it ultimately depends on the size and commitment of your team.\n\nHere are some factors to consider when setting your team fundraising goal:\n\n1. **Team size:** If you have a smaller team (5-10 members), $1,000 might be a more realistic goal. With a larger team (10-20 members), you might aim for $2,000.\n2. **Fundraising experience:** If your team members have experience with fundraising or have a strong network of supporters, you might set a higher goal.\n3. **Timeframe:** Since the event is still a few months away, you have plenty of time to fundraise. This might give you confidence to set a higher goal.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would suggest starting with a goal of $1,000 and adjusting as needed. This will give your team a challenging yet achievable target to work towards. If you find that your team is exceeding expectations, you can always increase the goal.\n\nRemember to communicate your team's fundraising goal clearly on your Facebook page and encourage team members to share their personal fundraising pages with their networks.\n\nTo help your team reach its goal, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Personalize fundraising pages:** Encourage team members to customize their fundraising pages with personal stories, photos, and videos.\n2. **Social media sharing:** Share team updates, fundraising progress, and personal stories on social media to keep your network engaged.\n3. **Fundraising events:** Organize team fundraising events, such as bake sales, charity runs, or potlucks, to raise additional funds.\n4. **Corporate matching:** Reach out to local businesses or team members' employers to see if they offer corporate matching gifts.\n5. **Regular updates:** Share regular updates on your team's progress, highlighting individual achievements and milestones.\n\nBy setting a clear goal and working together, your \"Steps for St. Jude\" team can make a significant impact for the kids and families at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Good luck!",
