Since you've already made 10 online purchases since April, we can start by creating a template to track your expenses. Here's a suggested format:\n\n**Online Shopping Expenses Tracker**\n\n| **Date** | **Item Description** | **Cost** | **Store/Website** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\nWe can start filling in the details for each of your purchases. Since you mentioned you just got a great deal on a pair of sneakers from Amazon, let's start with that one:\n\n| **Date** | **Item Description** | **Cost** | **Store/Website** |\n| Today's Date (e.g., 2023-04-15) | Sneakers | $**X** (insert cost) | Amazon |\n\nPlease fill in the cost of the sneakers, and we can move on to the next purchase.\n\nFor the remaining 9 purchases, can you provide the following details for each:\n\n1. Date of purchase\n2. Item description\n3. Cost\n4. Store/website\n\nYou can share the details one by one, and I'll help you add them to the tracker.",
