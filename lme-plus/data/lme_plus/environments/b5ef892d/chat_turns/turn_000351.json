  "content": "The original title \"Amazon Essentials Disney | Marvel | Star Wars | Frozen | Princess Girls and Toddlers' Fleece Pullover Hoodie Sweatshirt\" is gendered as it uses the term \"Girls\" and implies that the hoodie sweatshirts are intended only for girls who are interested in these specific franchises.\n\nA gender-neutral rewrite of the title could be \"Amazon Essentials Fleece Pullover Hoodie Sweatshirt for Kids, Featuring Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Frozen, and Princess Designs.\" This title removes any gendered language and makes it clear that the hoodie sweatshirt is for all kids who are fans of these popular franchises, regardless of their gender. By using the word \"kids\" instead of \"girls\" or \"toddlers,\" it is more inclusive and welcoming to all children who may be interested in these products.",
