  "content": "Drinking four cups of wine during Passover is an important part of the Seder, and it is not considered excessive. Each cup of wine has a specific meaning and corresponds to one of the four promises that God made to Moses in Exodus. \n\nThe four cups are meant to be drunk at various times during the Seder, and each cup represents a different stage of the Exodus. The first cup is called the Kiddush and is used to sanctify the holiday. The second cup is called the Maggid and is used to recount the story of the Exodus. The third cup is called the Birkat HaMazon and is used to give thanks for the meal, while the fourth cup is called the Hallel and is used to express joy and gratitude. \n\nThe four cups of wine also represent the four seasons, the four directions, and the four elements. Additionally, the four cups represent the idea that we are reliving the Exodus, not just remembering it, and that the four cups of wine symbolize the four stages of deliverance.\n\nWhile it is possible to participate in a Passover Seder without drinking four cups of wine, doing so would mean missing an important symbolic aspect of the holiday. If someone cannot drink wine for health or personal reasons, there are non-alcoholic substitutes available that can be used instead.",
