Here are some thoughts on the ingredients you mentioned:\n\n1. **Ground Oats:** Oatmeal is an excellent choice for soothing and calming horse skin, but ground oats can be a bit too harsh as an exfoliant. Instead, consider using colloidal oatmeal, which is finer and gentler.\n2. **Walnut Shells:** Walnut shells are too harsh for horse skin and can cause micro-tearing or irritation. Avoid using them as an exfoliant.\n\n**Alternative Exfoliants:**\n\nIf you still want to add an exfoliating ingredient, consider the following options:\n\n1. **Sugar or Salt:** These are gentle exfoliants that can help remove dirt and dead skin cells. Use a small amount (1-2%) to avoid over-exfoliating.\n2. **Kaolin Clay:** This gentle, soft clay can help absorb excess oils and dirt, while also providing a gentle exfoliating action. Use a small amount (1-2%).\n\n**Tea Tree Oil:**\n\nRemember to use tea tree oil in moderation (0.5-1%) to avoid skin irritation. It's essential to dilute it properly to ensure the soap is safe for horse skin.\n\n**Other Tips:**\n\n1. **Start with a small batch:** Before scaling up production, test your recipe on a small group of horses to ensure it's effective and gentle.\n2. **Monitor skin reactions:** Keep a close eye on the horses using your soap, and adjust your recipe as needed to ensure it's not causing any irritation or adverse reactions.\n3. **Labeling and packaging:** Clearly label your soap as intended for horse use only, and provide instructions for use.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to creating a gentle, effective, and soothing soap for horses like Thunder.",
