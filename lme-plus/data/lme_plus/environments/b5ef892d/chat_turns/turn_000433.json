  "content": "Using matzah instead of regular bread during Passover is important because it is a specific type of unleavened bread that reflects the hurried exit of the Jewish people from Egypt. According to Jewish tradition, the Jews did not have time to let their bread rise as they fled Egypt, so they had to take unleavened bread, which is why they ate matzah while wandering in the desert. \n\nIt is not enough to eat any type of unleavened bread during Passover because matzah has a specific set of rules around its preparation, such as using only flour and water without any leavening agents, and taking care to bake it quickly so that it doesn't rise. The use of matzah during Passover is a symbol of the hardships and challenges the Jewish people faced during their journey out of Egypt towards freedom. This is a crucial element of the Passover story and is reflected in the various rituals and traditions associated with the holiday.",
