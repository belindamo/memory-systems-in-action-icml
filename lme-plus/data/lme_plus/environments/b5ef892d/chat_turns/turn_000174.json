Since you're looking to get back into your 20-minute Tuesday routine, I'd recommend the following:\n\n1. **Start with what you're used to**: Begin with the same 20-minute routine you're familiar with. This will help you build momentum and get back into the habit. You can always adjust the duration or intensity later.\n2. **Assess your current fitness level**: Be honest with yourself about your current fitness level. If you've taken a break, you might not be as strong or as conditioned as you were before. Start with lighter weights or fewer reps to ease back into it.\n3. **Gradually increase duration or intensity**: Once you've established a consistent routine, you can start to increase the duration or intensity. You could add 5-10 minutes to your workout, increase the weight, or add more reps. Make incremental changes to avoid burnout or injury.\n4. **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to your body's feedback. If you're feeling fatigued or experiencing muscle soreness, it might be a sign you need to adjust your routine.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a sustainable routine that you can maintain in the long term. It's better to start with a manageable routine and gradually increase the intensity or duration than to try to do too much too soon and risk burnout or injury.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n* Week 1-2: Stick to your original 20-minute routine to get back into the habit.\n* Week 3-4: Add 5-10 minutes to your workout, or increase the weight by a small amount (e.g., 1-2.5 pounds).\n* Week 5-6: Assess your progress and adjust your routine accordingly. You can continue to increase the duration, weight, or reps, or focus on different exercises or muscle groups.\n\nBy starting with what you're familiar with and gradually making adjustments, you'll be more likely to create a consistent routine that you can maintain in the long term.",
