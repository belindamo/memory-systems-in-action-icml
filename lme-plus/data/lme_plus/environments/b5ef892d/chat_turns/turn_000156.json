Many businesses are eager to give back to their community and may be interested in supporting a worthy cause like St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when reaching out to local businesses:\n\n1. **Research local businesses:** Identify businesses in your area that have a history of supporting charitable causes or have a connection to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n2. **Personalize your ask:** Instead of sending a generic email or message, personalize your ask by highlighting how the business's contribution will make a difference in the lives of children and families at St. Jude.\n3. **Clearly state your ask:** Be specific about what you're asking for - whether it's a monetary donation, sponsorship, or in-kind donation (e.g., goods or services).\n4. **Emphasize the benefits:** Explain how the business will benefit from supporting your team, such as increased visibility, positive community engagement, and tax deductions.\n5. **Follow up:** If you don't receive a response, consider following up with a polite phone call or email to inquire about their interest.\n\nSome potential sponsorship opportunities to consider:\n\n1. **Team sponsorship:** Ask a business to sponsor your entire team, providing a lump sum donation or sponsoring a specific aspect of your team's fundraising efforts.\n2. **In-kind donations:** Request donations of goods or services that can be used for fundraising events or auctions, such as food, drinks, or prizes.\n3. **Matching gifts:** Ask a business to match a portion of the funds your team raises, providing an incentive for team members to reach their fundraising goals.\n\nWhen reaching out to local businesses, you can use a template like this:\n\nSubject: Supporting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital through \"Steps for St. Jude\"\n\nDear [Business Owner's Name],\n\nI'm reaching out on behalf of \"Steps for St. Jude,\" a team of local residents participating in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer.

We'd be thrilled to set up a meeting or call to explore how we can work together.\n\nThank you for considering our request!\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nRemember to stay organized, track your outreach efforts, and follow up with businesses that express interest.
