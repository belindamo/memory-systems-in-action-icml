  "content": "1. Cross-examination is a foundation of the common law trial to expose flaws in evidence.\n2. Its aim is to damage the witness's credibility and elicit material favorable to the cross-examiner's case.\n3. The limits of cross-examination are not easily defined and may lead to seemingly irrelevant questions.\n4. The trial judge should allow counsel some leeway in cross-examination to test opposing witness evidence.\n5. A judge must contain cross-examination within reasonable limits in the interest of justice.\n6. The effectiveness of cross-examination is due to its tactical value.\n7. Wigmore claimed that cross-examination is the greatest legal engine for the discovery of truth.\n8. A High Court case held that a judge acted prematurely in barring a defendant from asking a police officer the cause of death of a fellow officer.\n9. The officer's cause of death was later found to be relevant to the accused's claims and the investigation's reliability.\n10. The rules for controlling evidence before the court can be hard to reconcile with the tactical value of cross-examination.",
