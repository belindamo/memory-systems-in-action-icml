  "content": "I'm glad you're considering the unique needs of horse skin. Creating a soap recipe tailored to horse skin requires a thoughtful balance of oils, lye, and additives. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n**Oil Blend:**\n\n1. **Coconut Oil (20-30%):** Provides cleansing and moisturizing properties, but be cautious not to overdo it, as it can be drying in high amounts.\n2. **Olive Oil (30-40%):** Rich in antioxidants and moisturizing properties, olive oil is an excellent choice for horse skin.\n3. **Sweet Almond Oil (20-30%):** Adds moisturizing and nourishing properties, as well as a gentle, non-irritating quality.\n4. **Other Oils (10-20%):** Consider adding small amounts of other oils like avocado oil, grapeseed oil, or sunflower oil to enhance the soap's moisturizing and nourishing properties.\n\n**Lye (Sodium Hydroxide) Calculation:**\n\n1. **Use a lye calculator:** To ensure accurate calculations, use a reliable lye calculator that takes into account the specific oils and their percentages in your recipe.\n2. **Target a moderate lye concentration:** Aim for a lye concentration between 20-25%. This will provide a gentle, yet effective cleansing experience for horse skin.\n\n**Additives:**\n\n1. **Oatmeal:** A small amount of oatmeal (1-2%) can add soothing and calming properties to the soap.\n2. **Aloe Vera:** Add a small amount of aloe vera gel or powder (1-2%) to enhance the soap's moisturizing and soothing properties.\n3. **Tea Tree Oil:** This essential oil has antibacterial and antifungal properties, making it an excellent addition to a horse soap. Use a small amount (0.5-1%) to avoid skin irritation.\n4. **Vitamin E Oil:** Add a small amount (1-2%) of vitamin E oil to provide antioxidant protection and enhance the soap's moisturizing properties.\n\n**Tips and Considerations:**\n\n1. **Keep it simple:** Avoid using too many additives or oils, as this can increase the risk of skin irritation or allergic reactions.\n2. **Use a gentle fragrance:** Choose a mild, horse-safe fragrance or essential oil to avoid skin irritation.\n3. **Test and adjust:** Before large-scale production, test your soap recipe on a small group of horses to ensure it's effective and gentle.\n4. **Labeling and packaging:** Clearly label your soap as intended for horse use only, and provide instructions for use.\n\nRemember to always follow safe soap-making practices, and consult with a veterinarian or equine expert if you're unsure about any aspect of your recipe or production process.",
