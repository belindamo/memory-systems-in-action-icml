As a beginner, it's essential to start with exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, are easy to learn, and don't require a lot of equipment. Here are some compound exercises that are perfect for a beginner like you:\n\n**Top 5 Compound Exercises for Beginners:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Works your legs, glutes, and core muscles. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend your knees and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push through your heels to return to standing.\n2. **Dumbbell Chest Press**: Targets your chest, shoulders, and triceps. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, lie on a flat surface with your knees bent and feet planted, and press the dumbbells upwards towards the ceiling.\n3. **Bent-Over Rows**: Works your back, shoulders, and biceps. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, bend your knees slightly, and hinge forward at the hips. Let your arms hang straight down, then lift the dumbbells to your sides until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.\n4. **Lunges**: Targets your legs, glutes, and core muscles. Stand with your feet together, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower your body until your back knee almost touches the ground. Push through your front heel to return to standing. Alternate legs with each rep.\n5. **Dumbbell Shoulder Press**: Works your shoulders, triceps, and core muscles. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, and press the dumbbells straight up over your head.\n\n**Tips for Beginners:**\n\n1. **Start with lighter weights**: Begin with a weight that allows you to complete the exercise with proper form. You can always increase the weight as you get stronger.\n2. **Focus on proper form**: Pay attention to your body position, engage your core, and avoid arching your back or using momentum to lift the weights.\n3. **Use a full range of motion**: Make sure to complete the full range of motion for each exercise to target the intended muscle groups.\n4. **Start with 3 sets of 8-12 reps**: This will help you build endurance and strength. As you get stronger, you can increase the number of sets or reps.\n5. **Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets**: Give your muscles time to recover and rebuild.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and only do what feels comfortable and safe. If you're new to strength training, it's always a good idea to consult with a fitness professional or doctor to create a personalized workout plan.\n\nHow do you feel about trying these exercises? Do you have any questions about form or technique?",
