Yes, baking soda and water are an excellent natural cleaning solution for ovens. Here's a simple method:\n\n**Baking Soda and Water Oven Cleaner**\n\n1. Turn off your oven and let it cool completely.\n2. Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 1 tablespoon of water to form a paste.\n3. Apply the paste to the interior surfaces of the oven using a sponge or cloth. Make sure to cover all surfaces, including racks and walls.\n4. Let the mixture sit overnight or for at least 8 hours. This will allow the baking soda to penetrate and break down tough grime.\n5. Use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe down the oven surfaces, removing the baking soda paste and grime.\n6. If some areas still require attention, you can use a gentle scrubber or steel wool to remove stubborn stains.\n7. Wipe the oven clean with a dry cloth to remove any excess moisture.\n\nThis method is non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and effective at removing grime and food residue. You can also add a few drops of lemon essential oil to the baking soda paste for a fresh, citrusy scent.\n\nSome other natural oven cleaning options you can try:\n\n* White vinegar and water: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the interior of the oven and let it sit for 2-3 hours before wiping clean.\n* Cornstarch and water: Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to form a paste. Apply to the oven surfaces and let sit for 30 minutes before wiping clean.\n\nIf you prefer a commercial oven cleaner, look for eco-friendly and non-toxic options. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and take necessary safety precautions when using any cleaning products.\n\nI hope this helps you tackle that oven cleaning task!",
