Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Products with a built-in scrubber or applicator:**\n\n1. **Scrubbing Bubbles Grout Cleaner**: This product comes with a built-in scrubber on the cap, which makes it easy to apply and scrub the cleaner into the grout lines.\n2. **Soft Scrub Grout Cleaner**: This product has a soft, non-abrasive scrubber built into the bottle cap, which is gentle on surfaces and effective at removing grout stains.\n3. **Lime-A-Way Grout Cleaner Gel**: The gel formula comes with a built-in scrubber on the applicator cap, making it easy to apply and scrub the cleaner into the grout lines.\n\n**Products that require a separate scrub brush:**\n\n1. **OxiClean Grout & Tile Cleaner**: This product is a powder that needs to be mixed with water to form a paste. You'll need a separate scrub brush to apply and scrub the paste into the grout lines.\n2. **CLR Grout & Tile Cleaner**: This product is a liquid that can be applied directly to the grout lines, but you'll need a separate scrub brush to scrub the area and remove the dirt and grime.\n3. **Grout Shine Grout Cleaner**: This product is a non-acidic cleaner that comes in a spray bottle. You'll need a separate scrub brush to apply and scrub the cleaner into the grout lines.\n4. **Tilex Grout Cleaner**: This product is a liquid that can be applied directly to the grout lines, but you'll need a separate scrub brush to scrub the area and remove the dirt and grime.\n\n**Tips for using a separate scrub brush:**\n\n1. Choose a scrub brush with stiff bristles that's specifically designed for grout cleaning. This will help you get into the tight spaces and remove dirt and grime effectively.\n2. Use a scrub brush with a long handle to reduce strain on your back and knees.\n3. Dip the scrub brush in warm water and wring it out thoroughly before applying the cleaner to the grout lines. This will help the cleaner spread evenly and reduce mess.\n4. Scrub the grout lines in a circular motion, working from one end of the tile to the other. This will help loosen dirt and grime and prevent scratching the tile surface.\n\nI hope that helps!",
