Target Based on Interests**\n\nTarget people who have shown interest in products or topics related to yours. For example, if you sell handmade jewelry, you could target people who have liked pages related to fashion, accessories, or jewelry.\n\n**5. Use Custom Audiences**\n\nCustom Audiences allow you to target people who have engaged with your content, visited your website, or made a purchase from you in the past. This can help you retarget people who have already shown interest in your product.\n\n**6. Exclude Unwanted Audiences**\n\nUse Facebook's exclusion targeting feature to exclude people who are unlikely to be interested in your product.

Identify which audiences are performing well and adjust your targeting accordingly.\n\n**8. Use Facebook's Automatic Placements**\n\nFacebook's Automatic Placements feature allows you to target multiple platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network, with a single ad campaign.
