  "content": "The number four is significant in Passover rituals because it represents the four promises that God made to Moses in Exodus 6:6-7. These promises are often referred to as the \"Four Cups of Wine.\" They are:\n\n1. \"I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.\"\n\n2. \"I will deliver you from their bondage.\"\n\n3. \"I will redeem you with an outstretched arm.\"\n\n4. \"I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God.\"\n\nEach promise is represented by one of the cups of wine that must be drunk during the Seder. The four cups are meant to represent the stages of the Exodus from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land. Additionally, the number four is also significant in Judaism because it represents the four matriarchs of the Jewish people (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah) and the four corners of the Earth.",
