For example, instead of saying \"I'm great at sales,\" you can say something like \"I increased sales by 20% in three months.\" 2. Share credit: Give credit to the team or colleagues that helped you achieve certain goals. Phrases like \"I was part of a great team that accomplished...\" or \"I was fortunate to work with talented colleagues that helped me achieve...\"\n\n3. Be humble: Acknowledge that you still have room for growth and improvement. Phrases like \"Although I achieved this, I still strive to learn and grow in this area...\"\n\n4. Use testimonials: Include testimonials from clients, managers or colleagues that can vouch for your achievements. It's a great way to demonstrate your accomplishments without appearing too boastful. 5. Highlight your values: Instead of saying \"I'm the best at...\" consider highlighting your values and what you can bring to the table. Phrases like \"I'm passionate about helping others achieve their goals\" or \"I prioritize building strong relationships with clients and within teams.\" Remember, it's important to highlight your accomplishments on your LinkedIn profile but it's equally important not to come across as too self-promotional. By showcasing your achievements in a humble and data-driven way, you can demonstrate your value without appearing too boastful."
