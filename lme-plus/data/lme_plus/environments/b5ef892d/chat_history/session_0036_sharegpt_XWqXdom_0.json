My only complaint is that the neck hole is a little small & it\u2019s really hard to pull off at the end of the day. My kids are top of the charts for head circumference, so I get it. If you\u2019re like us, buckle up for a wrestling match when you try to remove the hoodie!\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Lisa S.\n5.0 out of 5 stars Not just for boys\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on January 28, 2023\nSize: LargeColor: RedVerified Purchase\nThis is a great product. Perfect weight perfect fit all good. My problem is that I needed two of them. I have a 10 year old boy and an eight year old girl who are nearly the same size. I almost ordered two of another product, labeled for girls, because it didn\u2019t look like it could be specifically for girls but I really didn\u2019t want to risk making my son wear a \u201cgirly\u201d hoodie so I looked for one that was for boys. I found this one and paid seven dollars more than the other because it said for boys. When they arrived the absolute only difference is that inside the hood around the neck the \u201cboys\u201d hoodie has blue stitching. I won\u2019t return this one because it was only seven dollars more, but it kind of irritated me that the other was labeled for girls when there\u2019s nothing different about the two, except the cost.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Dee Harb\n5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect basic hoodie\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on March 9, 2023\nSize: LargeColor: WhiteVerified Purchase\nPurchased this hoodie in a size large for my 70lb, 55inch tall and slim 10 year old. It fit him perfectly but it will not fit him next year. He loves how soft and warm the fabric is, and has said it is his favorite hoodie. The white is a pure white and does get easily dirty, but nothing that a tide stick can\u2019t handle.\nHelpful\nIs this a true gender neutral product, or is it only for boys? if so, what is the indication of the latter?"

      "content": "The product title \"Amazon Essentials Boys and Toddlers' Fleece Pullover Hoodie Sweatshirts\" and the language used in some of the customer reviews suggest that the product is marketed primarily towards boys. However, the hoodie sweatshirts themselves do not have any gender-specific features and can be worn by anyone who fits into the available sizes.\n\nWhile some of the reviews use gendered language (e.g. \"my son\"), others do not make any mention of gender and simply describe the fit and quality of the hoodie sweatshirt. This suggests that the product can be enjoyed by kids of any gender.\n\nOverall, while the product may have been marketed towards boys, it can be considered a gender-neutral product in terms of its actual design and function."
