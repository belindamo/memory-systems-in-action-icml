Here are some tips to help you declutter and style them nicely:\n\n**Decluttering:**\n\n1. **Take everything off**: Start by removing all the books and items from your shelves. This will give you a fresh start and help you decide what to keep, donate, or discard.\n2. **Sort and categorize**: Group books by genre (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, biographies, self-help), author, or color. You can also separate books you've read from those you haven't.\n3. **Purge unwanted books**: Be honest with yourself \u2013 if you haven't read a book in years or won't likely read it again, consider donating or recycling it.\n4. **Consider your goals**: Think about how you want to use your bookshelves. Do you want to display decorative items, showcase favorite books, or create a functional workspace?\n\n**Styling:**\n\n1. **Create a focal point**: Designate a central shelf or area as a focal point, and arrange items around it to draw the eye.\n2. **Balance and symmetry**: Distribute items to achieve balance and symmetry. For example, pair larger books with smaller ones, or place a decorative item on one side and a similar item on the other.\n3. **Leave some breathing room**: Don't overcrowd your shelves. Leave about 1-2 inches between books and decorative items to create a visually appealing display.\n4. **Mix and match**: Combine books with decorative items like vases, frames, or objects that reflect your personal style.\n5. **Play with heights**: Vary the heights of items to add visual interest. Use stacks of books, bookends, or risers to create a layered look.\n6. **Add some greenery**: Incorporate plants or a vase with fresh flowers to bring in a natural touch.\n7. **Consider a theme**: If you have a specific theme or color scheme in your home office, carry it over to your bookshelves to create a cohesive look.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Dust and clean your bookshelves before restocking them.\n* Use bookends or bookmarks to keep books upright and organized.\n* Store books with their covers facing outwards to create a visually appealing display.\n* Keep frequently used books at eye level, and less frequently used ones on higher or lower shelves.\n* Consider using baskets or bins to store items like paperbacks, journals, or office supplies.\n\nNow, go forth and organize those bookshelves!"

I've been thinking about my old college dorm room desk, which I finally moved to the garage last weekend. It's amazing how much space it was taking up in my home office!

      "content": "The old college dorm room desk is finally gone, and your home office is breathing a sigh of relief! Now, let's tackle that mattress negotiation!\n\nNegotiating the price of a mattress in-store can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely possible. Here are some tips to help you negotiate like a pro:\n\n1. **Do your research**: Know the market value of the mattress you're interested in. Check online prices, read reviews, and compare prices at different stores.\n2. **Know the salesperson's goals**: Salespeople often have sales targets or commissions to meet. If you're purchasing near the end of the month or during a sale, they might be more willing to negotiate.\n3. **Be respectful and friendly**: Build a rapport with the salesperson. Be polite, friendly, and respectful. This can go a long way in getting them to work with you on the price.\n4. **Ask about discounts and promotions**: Inquire about any ongoing sales, discounts, or promotions. Some stores might offer bundle deals, student discounts, or loyalty programs.\n5. **Look for floor models or display items**: Floor models or display items might be cheaper than brand-new mattresses. Just make sure they're still under warranty and in good condition.\n6. **Negotiate the price, not the monthly payment**: Salespeople might try to focus on the monthly payment instead of the overall price. Make sure you're negotiating the total price of the mattress.\n7. **Be willing to walk away**: If you don't like the price, be prepared to walk away. This shows the salesperson you're not desperate, and they might be more willing to negotiate.\n8. **Use competitor prices**: If you've found a lower price at a competitor's store, show the salesperson. They might match or beat the price to keep your business.\n9. **Ask about price matching**: Some stores offer price matching. If you find a lower price later, they'll refund the difference.\n10. **Don't be afraid to ask**: Simply ask the salesperson, \"Is this the best price you can offer?\" or \"Is there any room for negotiation?\"\n\nSome common negotiation tactics include:\n\n* \"I've seen this mattress for $X online. Can you match that price?\"\n* \"I'm interested in purchasing the mattress, but I was hoping to get a better deal. Can you offer any discounts?\"\n* \"I'm a student/first-time buyer/senior citizen. Do you offer any special discounts for [group]?\"\n* \"I'd like to purchase the mattress and the [accessory]. Can you give me a bundle deal?\"\n\nRemember to stay calm, be respectful, and don't be pushy. Good luck, and I hope you score a great deal on your new mattress!"
