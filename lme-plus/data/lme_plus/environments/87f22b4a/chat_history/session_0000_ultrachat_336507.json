      "content": "As a language model AI, I do not have personal opinions or preferences. However, it is widely acknowledged by architects and art historians that the Modernism movement, which emerged at the turn of the 20th century, had a significant impact on modern architecture. This style emphasized simplicity, functionality, and the use of new materials such as glass, steel, and reinforced concrete. Modernism rejected ornamental decoration and instead focused on clean lines, open spaces, and the integration of buildings with their surroundings. The principles of Modernism are still influential in architecture today, and many contemporary buildings feature its design elements."
