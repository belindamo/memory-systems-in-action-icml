      "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Salesforce CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) is one of the leading CRM quoting systems that integrate well with NetSuite ERP. Salesforce CPQ allows you to streamline the quoting process, create accurate sales quotes, and generate professional sales proposals. The integration with NetSuite ERP helps in synchronizing customer information, products, and pricing data, ensuring seamless data flow between the two systems.\n\nHowever, technology and integrations can evolve over time, so it's essential to research and evaluate the most up-to-date options available on the market. Other CRM quoting systems might have developed better integrations with NetSuite ERP since my last update, so it's always a good idea to check the NetSuite SuiteApp Marketplace and consult with vendors and customer reviews to find the best fit for your business needs."

      "content": "Yes, Salesforce CPQ can obtain real-time product and pricing information stored in the ERP through integration with NetSuite. By using middleware or custom-built integration solutions, the two systems can communicate with each other to ensure that Salesforce CPQ has access to the most up-to-date product and pricing information stored in NetSuite ERP.\n\nThis integration allows Salesforce CPQ to automatically pull product catalog data, including pricing, from NetSuite ERP in real-time. As a result, sales teams can generate accurate and consistent quotes for customers, reducing errors and ensuring all quotes are based on the latest product and pricing information.\n\nTo achieve this real-time data synchronization, you might need to work with a skilled developer or an integration partner experienced with both Salesforce CPQ and NetSuite ERP to help set up the appropriate data connections, mappings, and workflows between the two systems."
