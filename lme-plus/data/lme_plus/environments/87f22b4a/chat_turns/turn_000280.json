  "content": "In 2008, the New Pangea National Congress passed the \"New Atomica\" bill, which successfully phased out the use of fossil fuels nationwide by 97.4% by 2015. The country's primary source of energy since then has been nuclear energy sourced from Atomica Industries, however, this has raised safety concerns that have yet to be addressed. In 2014, the Congress passed the \"Green Pangea\" bill, which mandated the implementation of recycling bins across the country, as well as providing basic education on recycling waste in both public and private schools.",
