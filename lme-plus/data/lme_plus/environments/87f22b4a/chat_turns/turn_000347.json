  "content": "I think it's a good idea to mention that you've been dealing with a lingering cold, but keep it brief and don't go into too much detail. This can help provide context for why you had to cancel your plans and show that you're not flaking out on her.\n\nHere's an example of how you could phrase it:\n\n\"Hey Rachel, I'm so sorry again for canceling our brunch plans on Valentine's Day. I know I wasn't feeling well, and unfortunately, I've been dealing with a lingering cold for the past month. I'm finally starting to feel better, and I'd love to make it up to you. Would you be free to grab brunch or coffee sometime soon?\"\n\nBy mentioning your illness, you're providing a valid reason for canceling and showing that you're not just being flaky. However, be careful not to go into too much detail or make excuses. You want to apologize, take responsibility, and move forward, not dwell on your health issues.\n\nRemember, the goal is to apologize, show you're making an effort to reconnect, and suggest new plans. Keep the focus on Rachel and your relationship, rather than your health issues.\n\nIf you do decide to mention your cold, make sure to keep it brief and don't make it the main focus of the message. You can always follow up with more details if Rachel asks about your health, but for now, keep it concise and light.",
