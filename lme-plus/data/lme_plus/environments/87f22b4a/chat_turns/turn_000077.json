Use traditional cooking methods: To make your dishes more authentic, try to cook them using traditional methods. For example, when making Shashlik, consider grilling it over charcoal to get the authentic flavor.\n\n2. Use authentic ingredients: As much as possible, try to use authentic ingredients when making these dishes. For example, use real sour cream or caviar when making Blini, and try to use fresh lamb or beef for Shashlik.\n\n3. Pay attention to details: Details are important in making traditional dishes. For instance, decoratively placing golden raisins or nuts on top of Kulich or syrup-based desserts will take them to the next level of authenticity.\n\n4. Follow the recipe: It's important to follow the recipe instructions precisely, especially when making traditional dishes. These recipes have been passed down for generations, so following them is a great way to honor the dish and its origins.\n\n5. Experiment to make the recipe your own: While following the recipe is important, don't be afraid to experiment a bit and personalize that traditional recipe. Start by modifying little things like adding ingredients in slight portions like spices or even different types of cheeses, and see how it impacts the overall taste.\n\nHopefully, these tips will help you create an authentic taste and bring the spirit of Stavropol to your table. Cheers!",
