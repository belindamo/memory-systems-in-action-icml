Some examples of the country's sustainability efforts include:\n\n1. Energy transition: Liechtenstein has set itself the goal of becoming largely energy self-sufficient by 2020. To achieve this, the country has promoted the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and hydropower. A new energy law was introduced in 2017 which aims to increase the share of renewable energy and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.\n\n2. Sustainable tourism: Liechtenstein's tourism industry is heavily focused on sustainable practices. The country has introduced a comprehensive set of guidelines for tourism operators with the aim of minimizing the impact on the environment and preserving local culture and traditions.\n\n3. Waste reduction: The government has introduced initiatives to reduce waste, such as a compulsory program for the recycling of electronic waste and the expansion of government subsidies for the purchase of more energy-efficient appliances.\n\n4. Green public procurement: Liechtenstein is committed to encouraging public procurement of environmentally friendly goods and services. This is an important step in reducing the carbon footprint of government activities.\n\nThere are other initiatives that the government has introduced, such as the establishment of a climate fund, which supports investments in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency measures.
