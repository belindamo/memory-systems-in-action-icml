Set up Hootsuite Analytics**\n\nMake sure you've set up Hootsuite Analytics for each of your social media accounts. This will allow you to track engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, shares, and clicks.\n\n**2. Use Hootsuite's Content Report**\n\nThe Content Report provides a detailed analysis of your social media posts' performance. To access the Content Report:\n\n* Go to the \"Analytics\" tab in Hootsuite.\n* Select the social media account you want to analyze.\n* Click on \"Reports\" and then \"Content Report\".\n* Choose the timeframe you want to analyze (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days).\n\nThe Content Report will show you a list of your social media posts, along with engagement metrics such as:\n\n* **Engagement Rate**: The percentage of users who engaged with your post.\n* **Engagements**: The total number of likes, comments, shares, and reactions.\n* **Reach**: The number of people who viewed your post.\n\n**3. Filter and sort content by engagement metrics**\n\nUse the filters and sorting options to identify the most engaging types of content. For example:\n\n* Filter by **Post Type** (e.g., photo, video, link, text-only) to see which types of content perform best.\n* Filter by **Topic** or **Hashtag** to see which topics or hashtags resonate with your audience.\n* Sort by **Engagement Rate** or **Engagements** to see which posts performed best.\n\n**4. Analyze top-performing content**\n\nIdentify the top-performing content in terms of engagement and analyze what makes it successful. Ask yourself:\n\n* What type of content is it (e.g., photo, video, link)?\n* What's the topic or theme?\n* Is it a specific format (e.g., listicle, how-to, behind-the-scenes)?\n* Are there any common hashtags or keywords?\n\n**5. Use Hootsuite's Heatmap**\n\nHootsuite's Heatmap provides a visual representation of your social media engagement. It shows when your audience is most active and engaged. To access the Heatmap:\n\n* Go to the \"Analytics\" tab in Hootsuite.\n* Select the social media account you want to analyze.\n* Click on \"Reports\" and then \"Heatmap\".\n\nThe Heatmap will help you identify:\n\n* **Peak engagement times**: When your audience is most active and engaged.\n* **Engagement patterns**: Are there specific days or times when your audience is more engaged?\n\n**6. Create a content calendar**\n\nBased on your analysis, create a content calendar that incorporates the most engaging types of content. Use Hootsuite's content calendar to plan and schedule your social media posts in advance.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to identify the most engaging types of content across your social media platforms using Hootsuite. This will help you create a more effective content strategy that resonates with your audience.",
