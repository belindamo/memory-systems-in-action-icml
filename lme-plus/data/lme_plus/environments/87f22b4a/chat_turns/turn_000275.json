  "content": "make this paragraph a lil shorter without removing any information in it: The island country was once exclusively inhabited by its natives referred to as \u201cKraenons\u201d. Despite their lack of appearance in any historical events with other countries before their English encounters, the Kraenons were fully capable of creating their own technology and advanced mathematics (Though interestingly, there have been no accounts of the Kraenons seeking out foreign civilization before they were discovered). After merging a large majority of the population with English settlers over nearly a century, a newly formed Pangean culture would take hold of the country. Pangean culture amalgamates many aspects of 1600s English and Kraenon culture such as the Kraenon \u201cBristle week\u201d and English \u201cChristmas\u201d. Pangeans hold a deeply devotional respect for birds, it is not uncommon to find residents of the country preparing bird seeds for native birds to feast. Over the 20th century, New Pangea experienced massive influence from western and European cultures, especially in technology and architecture such as the popularity of the telephone and television as well as homes with white exteriors and rectangular windows. Among the many cultural practices in New Pangea, one of the most followed and respected values in families and communities across the country are the benefits and regard for education, education is commonly viewed as the only path to success within the general population. New Pangea\u2019s educational philosophy is taken seriously even by the youth of the country who view subjects such as math or science as challenging entertainment rather than a forced subject of no interest.",
