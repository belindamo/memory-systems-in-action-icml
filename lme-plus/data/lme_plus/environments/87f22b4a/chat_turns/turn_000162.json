  "content": "Ao Lie quietly enters the training room, careful not to disturb Macaque, who's in the middle of practicing with his staff. He stands in the corner, watching as Macaque effortlessly twirls the staff around his body. Macaque seems lost in concentration, but he notices Ao Lie out of the corner of his eye.\n\nWithout breaking his rhythm, he speaks. \"Can't sleep either, Ao Lie?\"\n\nAo Lie nods, watching the staff move in Macaque's hands. \"No, I couldn't,\" he says softly. \"I'm always afraid of what's coming next.\"\n\nMacaque continues his practice, moving with a fluid grace. \"Fear is natural,\" he says. \"It's what we do with it that counts.\"\n\nAo Lie watches in awe as Macaque expertly twirls the staff around his back and catches it in one hand. \"But how do you manage it?\" he asks.\n\nMacaque shrugs. \"I don't always manage it,\" he admits. \"Sometimes I let my fear control me. But other times, I use it to drive me forward, to push myself to be better. Fears make us human - or in my case, a monkey.\"\n\nAo Lie nods, taking in Macaque's words. \"I want to be able to do that,\" he says. \"To use my fear to drive me forward.\"\n\nMacaque nods, coming to a stop in front of Ao Lie. \"It takes practice,\" he says, handing Ao Lie the staff. \"But I think you have what it takes.\"",
