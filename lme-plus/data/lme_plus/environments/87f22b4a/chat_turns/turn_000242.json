I don't know Emily, Mike, Sarah, or anyone else you might be referring to.\n\nBut I can certainly help you with finding a new yoga studio! Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Location**: Look for studios that are convenient for you, close to your home, work, or daily commute.\n2. **Style**: Consider what type of yoga you're interested in (Hatha, Vinyasa, Restorative, Hot Yoga, etc.).\n3. **Reviews**: Check online reviews on platforms like Google, Yelp, or Facebook to get an idea of the studio's reputation and quality of instruction.\n4. **Schedule**: Look at the studio's schedule to ensure they offer classes at times that fit your schedule.\n5. **Community**: If you're looking for a social aspect, consider studios with a strong community focus or events like workshops, retreats, or social gatherings.\n\nYou can also ask your friend Emily for recommendations, as she might have some insider knowledge about local yoga studios.\n\nAs for smoothies after class, that sounds like a great way to relax and refuel! Enjoy your search for a new yoga studio, and I hope you find one that suits your needs!",
