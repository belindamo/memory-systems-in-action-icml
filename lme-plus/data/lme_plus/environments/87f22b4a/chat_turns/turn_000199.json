But before I make a decision, can you tell me more about the return and exchange policies of both Garmin and Fitbit? I want to make sure I can return or exchange it if it doesn't fit well or if I'm not satisfied with its performance. By the way, I've had good experiences with online shopping, like my recent purchase from Zappos, which arrived quickly and fit perfectly.",
