I'm sure you'll love your new moisturizer!\n\n**Outfit question:** Ooh, adding a leather jacket to the outfit is a great idea! A leather jacket can add a cool, edgy touch to the overall look. However, you're right to wonder if it might be too much going on.\n\nTo make it work, consider the following:\n\n* Choose a fitted leather jacket that won't overwhelm your frame. A shorter, cropped jacket or a fitted bomber jacket would be a great choice.\n* Balance out the edginess of the leather jacket with the femininity of the fitted white tank top. You could add some delicate jewelry, like a small necklace or earrings, to soften the look.\n* Make sure the leather jacket isn't too bulky or heavy. You want to maintain a streamlined silhouette, especially with the ankle boots.\n* Consider the color of the leather jacket. A black or dark brown leather jacket would be a great choice to ground the outfit, while a lighter color might add too much visual interest.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could try adding the leather jacket and then removing it to see which look you prefer. Sometimes, it's all about finding the right balance of elements to create a cohesive, stylish outfit.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you feeling adventurous and want to try adding the leather jacket, or do you want to play it safe and stick with the original combo?",
