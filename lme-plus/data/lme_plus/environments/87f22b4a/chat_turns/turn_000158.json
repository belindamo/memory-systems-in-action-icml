  "content": "Macaque sat there for a few moments, deep in thought. \"You know, Ao Lie,\" he finally said, \"I have my own fears too. I'm afraid of failing again when we face the Spider Queen. I'm afraid of letting Wukong down in a fight. And...\" he trailed off, a small smile spreading across his face. \"I'm afraid of snakes.\"\n\nAo Lie blinked in surprise. \"You're afraid of snakes? But you're a legendary immortal monkey! How can you be afraid of something like that?\"\n\nMacaque chuckled. \"I know, it's silly, isn't it? But I can't help it. There's just something about them that gives me the creeps. I've been trying to work on overcoming it, though. Maybe someday I'll be able to face a snake without feeling scared.\"\n\nAo Lie nodded, feeling a little better. It was reassuring to know that even someone as powerful as Macaque had fears and doubts. \"Thanks, Macaque,\" he said. \"I appreciate you talking to me. I'm still scared, but it helps to know that I'm not alone.\"\n\n\"Of course, Ao Lie,\" Macaque said, patting him gently on the back. \"We're all in this together. And I know you'll be able to overcome your fears too. You're stronger than you think.\"",
