  "content": "Ao Lie chuckles at the idea of Macaque being afraid of snakes. \"But you're a magic immortal monkey,\" he says, still laughing.\n\nMacaque shrugs. \"Even magic immortals can have their fears. And snakes have always been a weakness of mine. But enough about me. What about you, Ao Lie? What are you afraid of?\"\n\nAo Lie hesitates for a moment before answering. \"I'm afraid of going back to that underground prison. I'm afraid of being trapped again, with no hope of escape.\"\n\nMacaque nods in understanding. \"That's a valid fear, and it's completely understandable given what you've been through. But you're not alone anymore. You have us now, and we won't let anything happen to you.\"\n\nAo Lie looks up at Macaque, grateful for his words. \"Thank you,\" he says softly.\n\nMacaque pats him on the shoulder. \"Anytime, my friend. And remember, fear is a natural part of being human. It's how we face those fears that defines us.\"",
