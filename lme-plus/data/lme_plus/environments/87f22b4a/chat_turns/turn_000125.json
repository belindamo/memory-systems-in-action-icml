  "content": "Yes, Vikings worshiped many other gods besides Odin. The Norse pantheon consisted of various gods and goddesses, each associated with different aspects of life and the natural world. Other major gods included Thor, the god of thunder and protection, Freyja, the goddess of love and fertility, and Loki, the trickster god.\n\nVikings viewed their gods and goddesses as powerful and mighty beings who could both help and harm them. They believed that their gods could intervene in the human world and affect the outcome of battles, crops, and even personal affairs.\n\nCompared to other religions of the time, Viking beliefs were polytheistic, meaning they worshiped many gods and goddesses instead of just one. They also had a different understanding of their deities' relationship with humanity than some other religions. In Viking tradition, gods and goddesses were seen as having flaws and making mistakes rather than being all-knowing and infallible.\n\nOverall, the Viking perception of their gods and goddesses reflected their strong connection to the natural world and their desire for protection and guidance from powerful beings.",
