The clean, crisp look of the white tank will provide a nice contrast to the ruggedness of the distressed denim. The fitted silhouette will also create a flattering, streamlined look. Just make sure to balance out the outfit with a cardigan or jacket to add some texture and interest. You could also add a statement necklace or earrings to draw attention to your upper body.\n\n**Skincare question:** Ah, dry skin during winter is a common issue! Here are some skincare tips and product recommendations that might help:\n\n1. **Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!** Use a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturizer that's rich in emollients and humectants. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and ceramides.\n2. **Exfoliate wisely**: Exfoliating can help remove dead skin cells and reveal smoother skin. However, be gentle, as over-exfoliating can strip your skin of its natural oils. Use a gentle exfoliant (like a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant with small, round beads) 1-2 times a week.\n3. **Use a humidifier**: Dry air can dry out your skin, so using a humidifier can help maintain a healthy moisture level in the air.\n4. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.\n\nSome great skincare products for dry skin during winter include:\n\n* Moisturizers: Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel, or CeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n* Exfoliants: Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Acid or Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant\n* Humidifiers: Honeywell HUL520W Mistmate Humidifier or Levoit LV600HH Hybrid Humidifier\n\nRemember, everyone's skin is different, so it might take some trial and error to find the right products and routines that work for you.",
