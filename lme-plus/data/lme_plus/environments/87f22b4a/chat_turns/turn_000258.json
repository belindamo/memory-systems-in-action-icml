However, here are some potential ways the country could do so:\n\n1. Cross-border business activities: Liechtenstein's location at the heart of Europe and its membership in the European Economic Area (EEA) provide access to a large market. The government could encourage cross-border business activities, such as setting up joint ventures, partnerships or subsidiaries with companies in neighboring countries or attracting foreign investment.\n\n2. Access to talent: Liechtenstein's location also gives the country access to a highly skilled and multilingual workforce from nearby regions. The government could develop programs to attract highly skilled professionals to work in the country, taking advantage of the country's favorable work-life balance, high living standards and tax benefits.\n\n3. Enhanced logistics: Liechtenstein's central location could also make it an attractive transit hub for goods, especially between the emerging Eastern European markets and the highly developed Western European markets. To leverage this, the government could develop logistics infrastructure, such as transport links and warehousing facilities.\n\nNote that these are just potential strategies and Liechtenstein's specific plans might differ according to its policy objectives, the global economic environment, and other factors.",
