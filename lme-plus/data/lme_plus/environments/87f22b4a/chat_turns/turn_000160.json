  "content": "Macaque tells Ao Lie that he too has his own fears. \"Fears of failing again when we face the Spider Queen, fears of letting down Wukong in a fight,\" he confesses, before adding with a chuckle, \"and a mild fear of snakes, believe it or not.\"\n\nAo Lie laughs in disbelief, unable to imagine a legendary magic immortal monkey like Macaque being afraid of anything.\n\nMacaque just shrugs. \"Fears make us human, or in my case, a monkey. It's nothing to be ashamed of,\" he says, offering a comforting smile. \"The important thing is how we handle them. You faced your fear of being underground and being trapped again today. You did what you had to do, and you saved our skins. That's nothing to sneeze at.\"\n\nAo Lie smiles back, grateful for the monkey's words of encouragement. \"Thanks, Macaque. You always know what to say,\" he says.\n\nMacaque winks. \"It comes with the immortality, kid,\" he says with a chuckle.",
