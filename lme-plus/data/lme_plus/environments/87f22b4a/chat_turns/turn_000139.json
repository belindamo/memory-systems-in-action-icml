Tracking your progress on making your own chicken feed can help you optimize your costs and improve your farm's sustainability.\n\nTo modify the template, you can add a few new columns and rows to the Variable Expenses section. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n**Variable Expenses:**\n\n| Category | January | February | March | ... |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ... |\n| Feed and Supplies |  |  |  | ... |\n| \u2023 Chicken Feed (Purchased) | $150 |  |  | ... |\n| \u2023 Goat Feed | $250 |  |  | ... |\n| \u2023 Grain for Homemade Feed | $______ |  |  | ... |\n| \u2023 Value of Homemade Feed | -$______ |  |  | ... |\n| ... |  |  |  | ... |\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n* **Grain for Homemade Feed**: This row will track the cost of the grains you purchase from the local farm to make your own chicken feed.\n* **Value of Homemade Feed**: This row will track the value of the feed you produce using those grains. Since you're not purchasing commercial feed, you'll subtract this value from your total feed costs.\n\nWhen you purchase grains, record the cost in the \"Grain for Homemade Feed\" row. Then, when you produce feed using those grains, estimate the value of the feed based on the quantity and quality of the feed. You can use a rough estimate of the cost of commercial feed as a benchmark.\n\nFor example, let's say you purchase $100 worth of grains in January and produce 50 pounds of homemade feed, which you estimate is equivalent to $75 worth of commercial feed. You would record:\n\n**Variable Expenses:**\n\n| Category | January | February | March | ... |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ... |\n| Feed and Supplies |  |  |  | ... |\n| \u2023 Chicken Feed (Purchased) | $150 |  |  | ... |\n| \u2023 Goat Feed | $250 |  |  | ... |\n| \u2023 Grain for Homemade Feed | $100 |  |  | ... |\n| \u2023 Value of Homemade Feed | -$75 |  |  | ... |\n| ... |  |  |  | ... |\n\nYour total feed costs for January would be:\n\n$150 (purchased chicken feed) + $250 (goat feed) + $100 (grain for homemade feed) - $75 (value of homemade feed) = $425\n\nBy tracking the cost of grains and the value of your homemade feed, you'll get a better understanding of your feed costs and the benefits of producing your own feed.",
