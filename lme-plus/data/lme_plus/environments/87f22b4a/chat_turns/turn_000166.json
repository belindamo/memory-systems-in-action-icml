I'm still scared of the dark, of being trapped underground, and of spiders.\"\n\nMacaque nods, listening intently.\n\n\"But watching you train, seeing how fearless you are, I think I want to face my fears too,\" Ao Lie continues. \"I want to learn from you, to become stronger.\"\n\nMacaque chuckles, a warm smile spreading across his face. \"Fears make us human, or in my case, a monkey. But facing them and overcoming them is what makes us truly powerful.\"\n\nAo Lie nods, feeling inspired. \"Thank you, Macaque. I think I'm ready to start training harder, to become a better fighter.\"\n\nMacaque puts a hand on Ao Lie's shoulder. \"I'm here to help you, as is Wukong and Bai Long Ma. We'll face our fears together and come out stronger for it.\"",
