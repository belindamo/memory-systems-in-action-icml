  "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Salesforce CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) is one of the leading CRM quoting systems that integrate well with NetSuite ERP. Salesforce CPQ allows you to streamline the quoting process, create accurate sales quotes, and generate professional sales proposals. The integration with NetSuite ERP helps in synchronizing customer information, products, and pricing data, ensuring seamless data flow between the two systems.\n\nHowever, technology and integrations can evolve over time, so it's essential to research and evaluate the most up-to-date options available on the market. Other CRM quoting systems might have developed better integrations with NetSuite ERP since my last update, so it's always a good idea to check the NetSuite SuiteApp Marketplace and consult with vendors and customer reviews to find the best fit for your business needs.",
