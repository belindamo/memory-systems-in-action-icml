Investment in education and training: To address the demographic changes affecting the country, the government could invest in education and training programs to help the workforce adapt to the changing economy, acquire new skills, and remain competitive in the global marketplace.\n\n3. Climate change mitigation and adaptation measures: The government could implement policies and programs to address the impacts of climate change on the economy. This could involve promoting renewable energy and sustainable development, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and supporting the agricultural industry to adapt to changing weather patterns.\n\n4. Favorable regulatory environment: To encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, the government may continue to create a favorable regulatory environment for businesses, including low taxes, flexible labor laws, and easy access to financing.\n\nIt is important to note that these are merely examples and Liechtenstein's government may be pursuing different strategies to address the challenges facing its economy in the next decade.",
