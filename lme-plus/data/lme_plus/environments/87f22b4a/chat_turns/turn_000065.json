Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros of mentioning your asylum seeker status and scholarship:**\n\n1. **Authenticity:** Being upfront about your situation can demonstrate your authenticity and honesty.\n2. **Diversity and inclusion:** Some companies might be interested in providing opportunities to underrepresented groups, including refugees and asylum seekers.\n3. **Scholarship recognition:** Mentioning the scholarship can highlight your achievements and the fact that you're proactive in pursuing your career goals.\n\n**Cons of mentioning your asylum seeker status and scholarship:**\n\n1. **Unnecessary information:** The job shadowing or mentorship opportunity might not be directly related to your asylum seeker status or scholarship.\n2. **Potential bias:** Unfortunately, there might be unconscious bias or stigma associated with asylum seekers or refugees, which could affect the company's response.\n3. **Focus on skills and interest:** You might want to focus on highlighting your skills, interests, and career goals rather than your personal circumstances.\n\n**Suggested approach:**\n\n1. **Focus on your skills and interests:** Emphasize your passion for IT, your career goals, and the skills you're acquiring through your vocational training program.\n2. **Mention your scholarship (optional):** If you feel comfortable, you can mention the scholarship as a way to demonstrate your achievements and motivation.\n3. **Omit your asylum seeker status (unless necessary):** Unless you're applying for a specific program or opportunity that's designed for refugees or asylum seekers, it might not be necessary to mention your status.\n\nHere's an updated example email or LinkedIn message:\n\nSubject: Exploring Job Shadowing Opportunities in IT\n\nDear [Company Representative],\n\nMy name is [Your Name], and I'm reaching out to express my interest in exploring job shadowing opportunities in the IT industry.

I'd love to learn more about your team's work and potentially shadow one of your IT professionals for a day or discuss mentorship opportunities.\n\nI'm proud to have received a scholarship for my vocational training program, which has given me the opportunity to pursue my career goals. I'm confident that this experience would not only enhance my skills but also provide valuable connections in the industry.\n\nIf this is something your company would be open to, please let me know, and we can discuss further details.\n\nThank you for considering my request, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nRemember to tailor your message to your comfort level and the company's specific opportunity.
