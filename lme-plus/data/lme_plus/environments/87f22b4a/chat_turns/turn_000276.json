  "content": "The island country of New Pangea was once exclusively inhabited by the Kraenons, who were capable of creating their own technology and advanced mathematics. After merging with English settlers, a new Pangean culture emerged, blending aspects of 1600s English and Kraenon culture, such as \"Bristle week\" and \"Christmas\". Pangeans hold a deep respect for birds and education is highly valued. Over the 20th century, New Pangea experienced influence from Western and European cultures, especially in technology and architecture. Education is viewed as the key to success, and is taken seriously by the youth who view subjects such as math or science as challenging entertainment rather than a forced subject of no interest.",
