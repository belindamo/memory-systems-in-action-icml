However, it is not unusual for countries to encounter challenges or resistance when implementing sustainability initiatives, particularly where those initiatives involve stricter regulations or impose additional costs.\n\nFor example, businesses may complain about the additional paperwork, costs or other burdens of complying with new regulations or may assert that such new regulations make it more difficult for them to compete with other businesses. The public may also have different opinions on the necessary steps that should be taken to address climate change, which can lead to controversy.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Liechtenstein has a strong record of working collaboratively with businesses and the public towards achieving sustainability goals. The country is known for its progressive and pragmatic approach, which has helped enable a great deal of support for its sustainability initiatives from both citizens and businesses.",
