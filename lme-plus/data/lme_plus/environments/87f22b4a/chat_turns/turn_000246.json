I'm here to provide general information and guidance.\n\nHowever, it's great that you're enthusiastic about sharing your positive experiences with Rachel! Highlighting the social aspect and the fun activities you do after class, like grabbing smoothies, can definitely help make yoga more appealing to her.\n\nRemember to also be respectful of Rachel's interests and preferences. If she's still hesitant, you could ask her about her concerns or what might make her more comfortable trying yoga. It's essential to prioritize her feelings and boundaries.\n\nGood luck, and I hope Rachel decides to give yoga a try with you!",
