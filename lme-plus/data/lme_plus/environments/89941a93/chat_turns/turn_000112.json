I'm not capable of personal experiences, so I didn't attend a guided tour at the Natural History Museum last Saturday, but I'd be happy to help you with recommendations!\n\nI'd be delighted to suggest other museums that are suitable for kids. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Children's Museum**: If you have younger kids, a dedicated children's museum is an excellent choice. These museums are designed for kids aged 12 and under, with interactive exhibits and play-based learning. You can find children's museums in many cities, so search for one near you.\n2. **Science Museum**: Science museums often have hands-on exhibits that kids love, making them an excellent choice for families. They cover a range of topics, from physics and chemistry to biology and technology.\n3. **Local History Museum**: A local history museum can be a great way to introduce kids to their local heritage and culture. These museums often have exhibits that showcase the region's history, with artifacts, stories, and interactive displays.\n4. **Art Museum**: Many art museums have family-friendly exhibits and activities, such as hands-on art projects, scavenger hunts, or interactive installations. Some art museums also offer family tours or workshops.\n5. **Maritime Museum**: If your kids are fascinated by boats and the sea, a maritime museum can be a great choice. These museums often have interactive exhibits, model ships, and even opportunities to board historic vessels.\n\nSome popular museums that are great for kids include:\n\n* The Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago, USA)\n* The Exploratorium (San Francisco, USA)\n* The Science Museum (London, UK)\n* The Australian Museum (Sydney, Australia)\n* The Canadian Museum of History (Gatineau, Canada)\n\nBefore planning your visit, I recommend checking the museum's website to:\n\n* Check the age range and interests of your kids to ensure the museum is suitable.\n* Look for family-friendly activities, exhibits, and events.\n* Plan your visit around any special exhibitions or closures.\n* Check for accessibility and amenities, such as stroller-friendly facilities, baby-changing areas, and cafes with kid-friendly food options.\n\nI hope this helps you plan a fun and educational day out with your family!",
