  "content": "The C-I-A Triad is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity that represents three core principles of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n* Confidentiality means that data should only be accessible to authorized individuals or systems. For example, password-protecting sensitive documents or encrypting emails to keep them private.\n* Integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data. For example, ensuring that data has not been altered or tampered with in transit or at rest, such as by using digital signatures or checksums.\n* Availability means that data should be accessible and usable by authorized individuals when needed. For example, ensuring that critical systems are up and running, or having backup systems in place in case of a failure.\n\nOverall, the C-I-A Triad provides a framework for understanding the goals and priorities of information security and helps organizations ensure that their data is secure, accurate, and available to those who need it.",
