Since you're looking for exhibits that are suitable for kids and not too crowded, I'd recommend the following:\n\n**Less Crowded Exhibits:**\n\n1. **Mammals Gallery**: This exhibit features a wide range of taxidermied mammals, including giant pandas, giraffes, and elephants. The gallery is often less crowded than the dinosaur exhibits, and kids love seeing the different animals up close.\n2. **Human Evolution Gallery**: This exhibit takes you on a journey through human history, showcasing fossils, artifacts, and interactive displays. It's a great way to learn about our ancestors and is often less busy than other areas.\n3. **Creepy-Crawlies**: The insect and arachnid exhibits are usually less crowded than the more popular dinosaur areas. Kids will love seeing the fascinating insects, spiders, and other creepy-crawlies from around the world.\n\n**Kid-Friendly Exhibits:**\n\n1. **Dino Zone**: While the dinosaur exhibits can be busy, the Dino Zone is a great area for kids to learn about these prehistoric creatures. There are interactive displays, fossilized dinosaur bones, and even a T. rex skull!\n2. **Hands-on Investigate Centre**: This area is designed for kids aged 5-12, where they can engage in hands-on activities, like fossil digging, microscopy, and other interactive experiments.\n3. **Nature Base**: This exhibit features a variety of natural history specimens, including a giant squid, a fossilized tree, and a collection of minerals. It's a great place for kids to explore and learn about the natural world.\n\n**Tips to Avoid Crowds:**\n\n1. **Visit during the week**: If possible, plan your visit on a weekday instead of a weekend, when schools and families often visit.\n2. **Arrive early or late**: Get to the museum early or visit later in the day to avoid the peak lunchtime crowds.\n3. **Take breaks**: If you notice an exhibit is getting too crowded, take a break and come back later when it's less busy.\n\nRemember to check the Natural History Museum's website for any special events, closures, or exhibitions that might affect your visit. Have a wonderful time with your niece and nephew!",
