Mixing in Premier League and European football questions will definitely add an extra layer of excitement to your sports trivia game. And, of course, including Manchester City-specific questions will make it a special treat for you and your fellow City fans.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your questions. You could even consider offering prizes or bragging rights for the winners, or creating teams to make it a more collaborative effort.\n\nIf you need any more help or have any other questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you and your friends a fantastic time at your fantasy football draft party and sports trivia game! May the best team win, and may the Blues have a fantastic season!\n\n(P.S.
