Here are some easy to moderate day hike recommendations:\n\n**Sequoia National Park**\n\n1. **Congress Trail**: A 2-mile loop trail that takes you through the Giant Forest, including the General Sherman Tree. This trail is paved and relatively flat, making it a great introduction to the park.\n2. **Alta Peak Trail**: A 4.5-mile out-and-back trail that takes you to the highest point in the park (11,200 ft.). The trail gains about 1,000 ft. in elevation, but the views of the Great Western Divide are breathtaking.\n3. **Marble Falls Trail**: A 4-mile out-and-back trail that takes you to a beautiful waterfall. The trail gains about 500 ft. in elevation and passes through a scenic forest.\n\n**Kings Canyon National Park**\n\n1. **General Grant Grove Trail**: A 1.5-mile loop trail that takes you through the General Grant Grove, home to the second-largest tree in the world. This trail is relatively flat and easy to navigate.\n2. **Cedar Grove Trails**: A network of trails that offer scenic views of the Kings River and surrounding mountains. The trails range from easy to moderate and offer varying distances and elevation gains.\n3. ** Zumwalt Meadow Trail**: A 4-mile out-and-back trail that takes you to a picturesque meadow surrounded by towering peaks. The trail gains about 500 ft. in elevation and offers scenic views of the Kings River.\n\n**Tips and Recommendations**\n\n* Check the park's website for up-to-date trail information and any necessary permits or restrictions.\n* Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, as the high elevation can be unforgiving.\n* Consider bringing a map and compass or GPS device, as cell service can be limited in the parks.\n* Be mindful of your physical limitations and take regular breaks to rest and rehydrate.\n\nWhich of these trails appeal to you, or would you like more recommendations?",
