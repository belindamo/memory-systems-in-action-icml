You might want to try BroadwayHD, which offers a library of streamed productions of Broadway shows, or the National Theatre at Home, which offers a collection of live theater performances from the National Theatre in London. Additionally, many individual theater companies have been producing and streaming virtual performances over the past year, so it might be worth checking the websites of theaters in your area to see what they have available.",
