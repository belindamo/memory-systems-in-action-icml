  "content": "I actually attended a guided tour at the Natural History Museum last Saturday, and it was really great! We focused on the new dinosaur exhibit, and our guide, Rachel, was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic. I learned that the museum had acquired a new Triceratops fossil just a few months ago, which is now the centerpiece of the exhibit. The tour was quite crowded, though, and we had to wait for about 20 minutes to get into the exhibit hall.",
