  "content": "You raise a valid point regarding how prisoners of war are still used in current conflicts. While there have been commendable efforts to reduce the number of prisoners of war, and the number of conflicts themselves have declined in recent decades, we still face a world with significant challenges such as political and economic instability, regional tensions, and the global threat of terrorism. The march towards lasting peace remains a complex and challenging process, but it is important to recognize that progress can be made through cooperation, diplomacy, and multilateralism.
