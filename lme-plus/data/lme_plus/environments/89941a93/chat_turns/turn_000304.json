Can you please provide me with some details to get started?\n\nHere are a few questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n1. What is your starting and ending point for the trip?\n2. What is the approximate route you'll be taking (e.g., east coast to west coast, north to south, specific cities or regions)?\n3. How many days do you have for the trip, and how many days would you like to dedicate to cycling?\n4. Are you looking for routes with dedicated bike paths, bike lanes, or low-traffic roads?\n5. Are there any specific types of scenery or attractions you'd like to see while cycling (e.g., coastal routes, mountainous terrain, national parks)?\n6. What's your cycling experience level? Are you comfortable with longer distances, hills, or do you prefer shorter, more leisurely rides?\n7. Do you have any specific bike-related requirements (e.g., bike shops or rentals along the route, accommodation with bike storage)?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your preferences, I can start suggesting bike-friendly routes and attractions along your way.",
