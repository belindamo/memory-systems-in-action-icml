  "content": "In terms of military strategy and tactics, prisoners of war had limited value during World War I. However, they were often used as bargaining chips in negotiations between the belligerent nations. Both sides sought to use the prospect of prisoner releases as a means of gaining concessions from their adversaries.\n\nPrisoners of war were also used to bolster morale and propaganda efforts. Both sides portrayed their own prisoners as brave and heroic, while casting their enemies as cruel and inhumane towards captives. The mistreatment of prisoners by the Central Powers, particularly the Ottoman Empire, was used by the Allied powers to rally public opinion against them.\n\nOverall, while prisoners of war did not play a significant role in the military outcome of World War I, they were certainly not treated as pawns by both sides. Instead, they were used as political tools and propaganda symbols, and their treatment often reflected the changing fortunes of the war.",
