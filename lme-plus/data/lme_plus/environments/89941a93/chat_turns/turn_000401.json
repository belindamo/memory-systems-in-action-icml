Speaking of loyalty programs, I just received an email from Alaska Airlines informing me that I've been upgraded to MVP Gold status due to my increased travel frequency in the past quarter, so I'll get priority boarding, extra baggage allowance, and access to airport lounges \u2013 perks I'm really looking forward to enjoying on my upcoming trips. Can you tell me if Alaska Airlines operates direct flights from LAX to HNL as well?",
