Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Focusing on one or two poets at a time:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Allows for a deeper understanding of the poet's style, themes, and techniques\n* Enables you to appreciate the poet's development and growth across their work\n* Can help you develop a stronger connection to the poet's unique voice and perspective\n\nCons:\n\n* Might limit your exposure to other poets and styles\n* Could lead to a slower pace of discovery, as you delve deeper into a single poet's work\n\n**Reading multiple poets simultaneously:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Exposes you to a wide range of styles, themes, and techniques\n* Can help you identify commonalities and differences between poets\n* Allows you to discover new voices and perspectives more quickly\n\nCons:\n\n* Might make it harder to develop a deep understanding of any one poet's work\n* Could lead to superficial readings, as you're not fully immersing yourself in a single poet's work\n\nI'd recommend starting with a balance between the two approaches. You could try focusing on one or two poets at a time, but also keep a \"poetry sampler\" or a collection of poems from various poets on hand. This way, you can:\n\n1. Delve deeper into the work of a single poet, exploring their style, themes, and techniques.\n2. Occasionally dip into your poetry sampler to discover new voices, styles, and perspectives.\n\nThis approach will allow you to develop a deeper understanding of individual poets while still exposing yourself to a wide range of poetry.\n\nAs you read, take notes, ask yourself questions, and reflect on what resonates with you. Pay attention to the poets' use of language, imagery, and structure. How do they explore themes and emotions? What do you admire about their work?\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to read what speaks to you and inspires your own writing. Enjoy your journey into the world of poetry!",
