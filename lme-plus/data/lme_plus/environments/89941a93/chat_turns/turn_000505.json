It's also fascinating that you had a thought-provoking conversation with your grandma about her near-death experience. It's not uncommon for such conversations to lead to introspection and exploration of one's own beliefs and values.\n\nNow, regarding meditation techniques for stress and anxiety, here are some additional methods you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Body Scan Meditation**: Lie down or sit comfortably, and bring your attention to different parts of your body, starting from your toes and moving up to the top of your head. As you focus on each area, release any tension or discomfort.\n2. **Loving-Kindness Meditation**: Focus on sending kind thoughts to yourself and others. Repeat phrases like \"May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be at peace\" and extend them to others, including those you may have difficulty with.\n3. **Mindful Breathing with a Twist**: Instead of just focusing on your breath, try to observe your thoughts and emotions as they arise. When you notice your mind wandering, gently acknowledge the thought and let it go, returning to your breath. This can help you develop a sense of detachment from your thoughts.\n4. **Guided Imagery**: Listen to guided meditation recordings that lead you through imaginative scenarios, such as visualizing a peaceful beach or a serene forest. This can help distract your mind from anxious thoughts and promote relaxation.\n5. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and moving up to your head. This can help release physical tension and promote relaxation.\n6. **Walking Meditation**: Pay attention to your breath and the sensation of your feet touching the ground as you walk slowly and deliberately. Bring your attention back to the present moment whenever your mind wanders.\n7. **Mantra Meditation**: Choose a simple word or phrase, such as \"om\" or \"I am calm,\" and repeat it to yourself as you meditate. This can help quiet your mind and reduce anxiety.\n\nRemember, the key to making progress with meditation is consistency and patience. It's great that you've established a regular practice, and now you can experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you.\n\nAs you continue to explore your beliefs and values, you may find that meditation helps you develop a greater sense of clarity and understanding. It's a powerful tool for self-reflection and personal growth.",
