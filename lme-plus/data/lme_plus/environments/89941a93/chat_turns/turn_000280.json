  "content": "I don't have personal opinions, but research suggests that using air fresheners in your home can have a negative impact on indoor air quality. air fresheners often contain chemicals such as phthalates, benzene, and formaldehyde, which can be harmful when inhaled over time. these chemicals are known to cause respiratory and other health problems, particularly in children.\n\nin addition to these chemicals, air fresheners can also contribute to the formation of other indoor air pollutants when they react with ozone, which can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat. therefore, the use of air fresheners is not recommended if one is looking to improve indoor air quality. it is suggested to use natural alternatives, such as opening windows and airing out spaces, using baking soda to absorb odors, or using essential oils to freshen the air.",
