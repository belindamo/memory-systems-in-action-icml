  "content": "I think the thing that really stuck with me was the Triceratops fossil itself. I mean, it's just amazing to think that this creature lived millions of years ago, and now we get to see its fossilized remains up close. Our guide, Rachel, shared some fascinating facts about the fossil and how it was acquired, which really added to the experience.\n\nI also appreciated how the exhibit was designed to showcase the fossil in a way that made it feel really immersive and engaging. The lighting, the displays, everything just came together to create this sense of wonder and awe. It was really cool!",
