Subtle patterns can also help to tie together different design elements in the room, like your dark grey couch and light beige curtains.\n\nThat being said, if you want to add more contrast to your room, you could consider a rug with a slightly bolder pattern or a rug that incorporates a secondary color. This can help to create a more dynamic and interesting visual effect.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider when deciding between a subtle pattern and a bolder pattern:\n\n* If you want to create a calm and serene atmosphere, a subtle pattern might be the way to go.\n* If you want to add more visual interest and contrast to your room, a bolder pattern could be a good choice.\n* Consider the overall aesthetic you're going for in your room. If you're going for a minimalist or Scandinavian-inspired look, a subtle pattern might be a good fit. If you're going for a more bohemian or eclectic look, a bolder pattern could work well.\n* Think about the other design elements in your room, like your furniture and decor. If you have a lot of bold or bright pieces, a subtle pattern might help to balance things out. If you have a lot of neutral or calming pieces, a bolder pattern could add some much-needed contrast.\n\nUltimately, the decision comes down to your personal style and the overall aesthetic you're trying to create in your room. I recommend checking out some rug options and seeing what resonates with you!\n\nDo you have any other questions about rug patterns or design? I'm here to help!",
