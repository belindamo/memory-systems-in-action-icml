A casual conversation will help you get a better sense of their reading habits and preferences, and it'll also give them an opportunity to ask questions and get a feel for the book club's dynamic.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a welcoming and engaging environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. By being thoughtful and considerate in your approach, you'll set the stage for a successful and enjoyable book club experience.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with your conversations with Rachel and Sophia, and I hope they'll be a great addition to your book club!\n\nHappy reading and discussing!",
