To prepare your road bike for the long trip, I recommend the following adjustments and checks:\n\n1. **Tire pressure and condition:** Ensure your tires are in good condition, with adequate tread depth and no signs of wear. Check the recommended tire pressure for your specific tires and adjust accordingly.\n2. **Brake pads:** Inspect your brake pads and replace them if they're worn out. You don't want to risk brake failure on a long, downhill descent.\n3. **Chain and cassette:** Clean and lube your chain, and inspect your cassette for wear. Consider replacing your chain and cassette if they're nearing the end of their lifespan.\n4. **Gear adjustments:** Make sure your derailleurs are properly adjusted and shifting smoothly. You don't want to be stuck with a malfunctioning gear system on a long ride.\n5. **Bolts and screws:** Check all bolts and screws on your bike, including the stem, handlebars, and seatpost, to ensure they're securely tightened.\n6. **Cables and housing:** Inspect your brake and gear cables for fraying or damage. Replace them if necessary to ensure smooth shifting and braking.\n7. **Saddle and handlebar tape:** Consider replacing your saddle and handlebar tape if they're worn out. A comfortable saddle and grip can make a big difference on long rides.\n8. **Accessories:** Make sure your bike computer, lights, and any other accessories are securely attached and functioning properly.\n9. **Basic tool kit:** Carry a basic tool kit with you, including Allen wrenches, screwdrivers, and tire levers, in case you need to make any adjustments or repairs on the road.\n10. **Pre-ride checks:** Before each ride, perform a quick check of your bike, including tire pressure, brakes, and gears, to ensure everything is in working order.\n\nBy performing these checks and adjustments, you'll be well-prepared for your road bike adventure across the country.\n\nRemember to also pack a small repair kit with basic tools, spare tubes, and a pump or CO2 cartridges, in case you need to make any repairs or adjustments on the road.\n\nLastly, don't forget to plan your route, check the weather forecast, and pack accordingly to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride.",
