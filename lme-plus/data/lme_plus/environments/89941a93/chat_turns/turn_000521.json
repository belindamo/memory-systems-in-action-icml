Here are some tips on how to store gin:\n\n1. **Cool, dark place**: Store your gin in a cool, dark place, such as a cupboard or pantry away from direct sunlight. Light can cause the gin to degrade and lose its flavor.\n2. **Avoid heat sources**: Keep your gin away from heat sources like ovens, radiators, or direct sunlight, as high temperatures can cause the gin to evaporate and lose its flavor.\n3. **Upright storage**: Store your gin bottles upright to prevent the cork or cap from coming into contact with the liquid. This can cause the cork to become soggy or the cap to corrode, affecting the flavor.\n4. **Tightly sealed**: Make sure the cap or cork is tightly sealed to prevent oxidation, which can affect the flavor and aroma of the gin.\n5. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Avoid storing gin in areas with extreme temperatures, such as basements or attics, as this can cause the gin to freeze or become too warm.\n\nAs for the shelf life of gin, it typically depends on several factors, including the quality of the gin, storage conditions, and how well the bottle is sealed. Generally, an unopened bottle of gin can last:\n\n* **Indefinitely**: If stored properly, an unopened bottle of gin can last indefinitely. The flavor and aroma may mellow over time, but it will still be safe to drink.\n* **1-2 years**: Once opened, a bottle of gin can last for 1-2 years, depending on how well it's stored and how often it's used. The flavor and aroma may start to degrade over time, but it should still be safe to drink.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that gin is a high-proof spirit, and its flavor and aroma can change over time due to oxidation. If you notice any significant changes in the flavor, aroma, or color of your gin, it's best to use it within a reasonable time frame or replace it with a fresh bottle.\n\nNow that you've found a gin you love, make sure to store it properly to preserve its flavor and aroma. Enjoy your Cucumber Lime Refresher, and happy mixing!",
