  "content": "I am planning a summer holiday and thinking about either the UK or a country in mainland Europe. The holiday would be for me and my wife. We enjoy a mix of cosmopolitan things and also some immersion in nature. We also like to sample local culture, and in particular like to sample local cuisine with visits to good restaurants and gastro pubs. The holiday could be a mixture of driving and walking. Provide me with a sample itinerary for a UK holiday and then something that you think would be suitable in Europe.",
