  "content": "Asking Maria about her own plans for teaching bachata classes or workshops is a great idea. As your salsa instructor, she might be considering adding bachata to her repertoire or know of other instructors who are planning to teach bachata classes.\n\nBy asking Maria about her plans or upcoming events, you can:\n\n* **Get first dibs on new classes**: If Maria is planning to teach bachata classes in the future, you'll be the first to know and can reserve a spot before the classes fill up.\n* **Take advantage of her expertise**: If Maria is teaching bachata classes, you'll get to learn from an instructor you already know and trust, which can make the learning process more comfortable and enjoyable.\n* **Get insider information on workshops and events**: Maria might know of upcoming bachata workshops, festivals, or events in the area that aren't publicly advertised yet. She can give you the scoop on the best events to attend and help you plan your dance calendar.\n\nSome questions you can ask Maria include:\n\n* Are you planning on teaching any bachata classes in the future?\n* Do you know of any upcoming bachata workshops or events in the area?\n* Would you be interested in teaching a bachata class or workshop if there's enough interest from students?\n* Do you have any recommendations for bachata instructors or studios in the area that are offering classes or workshops?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll not only get valuable information but also show Maria that you're interested in learning bachata and willing to support her as an instructor.",
