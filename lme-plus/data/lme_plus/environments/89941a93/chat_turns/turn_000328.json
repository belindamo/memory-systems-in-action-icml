  "content": "Prisoners of war had a limited impact on the outcome of World War I. Although they were a significant issue for both sides, their treatment often reflected the changing fortunes of the war, and their release or exchange were part of the negotiations leading to peace. However, they did serve as a useful propaganda tool for both sides, and the poor treatment of prisoners by the Central Powers helped to turn public opinion against them. Additionally, the release of prisoners and the repatriation of war refugees after the war contributed to the post-war instability and tensions in Europe.",
