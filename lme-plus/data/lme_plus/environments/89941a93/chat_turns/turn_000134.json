  "content": "Baked salmon is an excellent choice! Salmon is an incredibly nutritious fish, packed with omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and various vitamins and minerals. Here are some healthy seasoning and marinade recommendations that pair well with salmon:\n\n**Seasonings:**\n\n1. **Lemon Pepper**: A classic combination of lemon zest, black pepper, and garlic adds a bright, citrusy flavor to salmon.\n2. **Dill and Parsley**: Fresh dill and parsley add a fresh, herbaceous flavor that complements salmon nicely.\n3. **Smoked Paprika**: A smoky, savory flavor that pairs well with the richness of salmon.\n4. **Garam Masala**: This Indian spice blend adds a warm, aromatic flavor that works well with salmon.\n5. **Cajun Seasoning**: A blend of paprika, garlic, onion, and cayenne pepper adds a spicy kick to salmon.\n\n**Marinades:**\n\n1. **Lemon-Herb Marinade**: Mix lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, and chopped fresh herbs like parsley, dill, or thyme.\n2. **Asian-Glazed Marinade**: Combine soy sauce, honey, ginger, and garlic for a sweet and savory glaze.\n3. **Mediterranean Marinade**: Mix olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and oregano for a bright, herby flavor.\n4. **Indian-Style Marinade**: Combine yogurt, lemon juice, garam masala, cumin, and coriander for a creamy, aromatic marinade.\n5. **Balsamic Glaze Marinade**: Mix balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and honey for a sweet and tangy glaze.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Keep it simple**: Don't overpower the delicate flavor of salmon with too many ingredients.\n2. **Acidity helps**: Acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar help to break down the proteins in salmon, making it more tender and flavorful.\n3. **Don't overmarinate**: Salmon can become mushy if marinated for too long. Aim for 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the strength of the marinade.\n4. **Experiment with different temperatures**: Baking salmon at different temperatures can affect its texture and flavor. Try baking at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for a crispy exterior and a medium-rare interior.\n\nRemember to always cook salmon to an internal temperature of at least 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) to ensure food safety. Enjoy your delicious and healthy baked salmon!",
