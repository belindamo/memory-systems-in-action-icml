  "content": "That's a great approach! Focusing on one or two poets at a time will allow you to really delve into their work and understand their unique style and perspective. And, keeping a poetry sampler will give you the opportunity to discover new voices and styles.\n\nMary Oliver and Ada Lim\u00f3n are both wonderful poets to start with. Mary Oliver's poetry is known for its accessibility and its ability to connect readers with nature. Her poems often explore themes of spirituality, identity, and the human experience. Ada Lim\u00f3n's poetry, on the other hand, is known for its lyricism and its exploration of themes such as identity, family, and social justice.\n\nAs you read their work, pay attention to the ways in which they use language, imagery, and structure to convey their ideas and emotions. Notice how they use metaphor, simile, and other literary devices to create vivid and powerful images.\n\nWhen you're ready to move on to other poets, you can explore some of the other poets I mentioned earlier, such as Warsan Shire, Danez Smith, or Ocean Vuong. Each of these poets has a unique style and perspective, and they can offer you a wealth of inspiration and insight.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to read what speaks to you and inspires your own writing. Don't be afraid to explore different poets and styles until you find what resonates with you.\n\nGood luck on your poetry journey!",
