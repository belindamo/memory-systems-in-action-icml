Speaking of poetry, I've been feeling really inspired lately, and I think it's because I've been writing in my journal every morning. I started it on January 15th, and it's been helping me clarify my thoughts and feelings. Do you have any suggestions on how I can incorporate my journaling practice into my writing routine for these projects?",
