  "content": "It's understandable that you might feel drawn to the flames and the messages that you perceive in them, but please remember that your safety is paramount in this situation. While it's possible that the blue fireball might have a mystical or symbolic significance, it's also important to take any necessary precautions to protect yourself and your property.\n\nIf you find it difficult to tear your gaze away from the flames, it may be helpful to seek the assistance of a trusted friend or family member who can help you to evacuate the area and seek safety. Alternatively, if you are alone and unable to leave, you can try to find a safe location within your home, such as a basement or other sheltered area, and wait for the situation to resolve itself.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution in a situation like this. Please take all necessary precautions to ensure your safety and well-being.",
