Even if she's not teaching bachata herself, she might have some amazing resources or connections to share with you.\n\nRemember to be open-minded and flexible when asking Maria about bachata classes or workshops. She might have some creative solutions or alternatives that you haven't thought of, and you never know what opportunities might arise from the conversation.\n\nSome possible outcomes from your conversation with Maria could be:\n\n* She's planning to teach a bachata class or workshop in the near future, and you can sign up or express your interest.\n* She knows of a reputable bachata instructor or studio in the area that she can recommend.\n* She's willing to offer private lessons or a small group class in bachata, which could be a great way to learn from her and get personalized feedback.\n* She's not teaching bachata herself, but she can connect you with other dancers or instructors in the area who are interested in bachata.\n\nWhatever the outcome, you'll be taking a proactive step towards learning bachata and expanding your dance skills. Good luck, and I hope you have a great conversation with Maria!",
