She sets aside time each day to reflect on her experiences and emotions, and writes down her thoughts and feelings in a journal. Through this process, she begins to understand her fears, doubts, and insecurities more clearly, and is able to identify the root causes of them.\n\nAs she continues to journal, she starts to see patterns in her thoughts and emotions, and begins to understand the ways in which her fears and insecurities have been holding her back. With this self-awareness, she is able to take steps to challenge and overcome her fears, doubts, and insecurities.\n\nRachel continues her journey with a sense of renewed purpose and determination, and with the knowledge that she has the power to shape her own destiny. She continues to the next realm, the Malkuth, or kingdom, which represents the physical world and the manifest universe.\n\nDo you have any other question or is there anything else you would like me to help you with?"
