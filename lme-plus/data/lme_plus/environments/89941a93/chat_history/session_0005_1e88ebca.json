Four days is a great amount of time to explore the park, and I'm sure you were able to experience some of the most breathtaking sights and trails.\n\nYosemite is one of those parks that has something for everyone, from easy day hikes to more challenging backpacking trips, and from stunning valley views to serene alpine lakes.
