      "content": "Let's get started on categorizing those receipts.\n\n**Trendy Treasures**: This one might fit into the **Clothing** category, unless you bought a gift for someone, in which case it would go into **Gifts**. What did you buy at Trendy Treasures?\n\n**Staples**: Office supplies, perhaps? That would fit into the **Household** category, as it's likely for personal or home office use.\n\n**Bed Bath & Beyond**: This one could fit into **Household** as well, as it's likely for home goods or decor.\n\n**IKEA**: Another one that fits into **Household**, as it's likely for furniture or home decor.\n\n**Farmer's Market**: Fresh produce and food, right? That would fit into **Household** under the **Groceries** subcategory.\n\nLet me know if any of these assumptions are incorrect, or if you need help with anything else!"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Since you're still in the process of shopping for your mom's Mother's Day gift, it's a good idea to wait until you've made the final purchase to add it to the list. You can keep track of the potential expenses in your mind or make a note of them, but it's best to wait until the transaction is complete before adding it to your expense tracker.\n\nHowever, if you've already made any purchases for your mom's gift, even if it's not the final one, you can go ahead and add it to the **Gifts** category. Just make sure to update the amount if you end up returning or exchanging the item.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to keep track of your expenses as you go, rather than trying to recreate them from memory later on. So, if you do end up making a purchase, be sure to save the receipt or confirmation email and add it to your expense tracker accordingly.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or when you're ready to add more receipts to the list!"
