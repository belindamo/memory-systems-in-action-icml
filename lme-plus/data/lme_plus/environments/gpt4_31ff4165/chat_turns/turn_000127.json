I can suggest a few options to help you find out if the exhibit is still on display:\n\n1. **Check the museum's website:** Visit the city gallery's website to see if they have a section for current or upcoming exhibitions. You can usually find this information on the homepage or under a tab like \"Exhibitions\" or \"What's On.\"\n2. **Call the museum:** Give the museum a call to ask about the exhibit's status. They should be able to tell you if it's still on display, when it closes, and if there are any special events or programs related to the exhibit.\n3. **Social media:** Check the museum's social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) to see if they've posted any updates about the exhibit.\n4. **Local event calendars:** Look for local event calendars or art blogs that might list information about the exhibit and its duration.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find out if the exhibit is still on display! Enjoy your visit to the city gallery!",
