  "content": "That's wonderful! It's great that you're enthusiastic about attending book events and engaging with authors. However, I should let you know that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to keep track of real-time events or specific authors' schedules. I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I won't be aware of specific events or interactions you've had with authors.\n\nBut I'm happy to chat with you about books and authors, and help you prepare for your upcoming event! If you have any questions about the book or author you're about to meet, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help.",
