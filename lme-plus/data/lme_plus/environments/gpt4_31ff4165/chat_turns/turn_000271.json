  "content": "From the first dataset, it appears that there were very few calls containing the keyword \"Error\" until June and August of 2020, when there was one error each month. There is then a gradual increase in the number of errors until September 2021, where there is a spike in the number of errors at 9, before decreasing again.\nIt can be inferred that there is a correlation between the number of errors and the number of vaccines given, as the number of errors spike when the number of vaccines given increase.\nIt would be interesting to see how the number of webinars and newsletter sent out regarding vaccine errors correlates with the number of errors and number of vaccines given.",
