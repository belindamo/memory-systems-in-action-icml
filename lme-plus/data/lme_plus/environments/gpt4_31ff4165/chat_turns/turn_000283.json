  "content": "Excellent plan! Setting a reminder on your phone is a great way to stay on track, and finding a comfortable spot in your bedroom to relax can help you associate that space with winding down. Having a friend or family member hold you accountable can also provide an added motivation to stick to your rule.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself if you slip up. It's not about being perfect, but about creating a consistent habit that improves your sleep and overall well-being. If you do happen to check your phone or watch TV before bed, don't beat yourself up over it. Instead, acknowledge the setback and try to do better the next night.\n\nIt's also important to find alternative activities that bring you joy and help you relax. Reading, meditation, or listening to calming music can be great options. You might also consider trying some gentle stretches, doing some light yoga, or practicing gratitude journaling before bed.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a bedtime routine that signals to your body that it's time to sleep. By establishing a consistent routine and avoiding screens before bed, you'll be taking a big step towards improving the quality of your sleep.\n\nHow do you think you'll handle situations where you need to use your phone or computer for work or other important tasks before bed? Will you try to find ways to limit your screen time or adjust your work schedule to avoid working too close to bedtime?",
