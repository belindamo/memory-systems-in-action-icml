  "content": "The 1884 Electoral Reform Act was a significant development in Norwegian political history, as it effectively transformed the composition and powers of the Storting, the Norwegian parliament.\n\nBefore the 1884 Act, the Storting was dominated by wealthy landowners and elites who were largely resistant to democratic reforms. The Act, however, introduced a more democratic electoral system that expanded the right to vote and allowed greater representation for the working class and rural populations.\n\nUnder the 1884 Act, the right to vote was significantly broadened, allowing all adult males who were 25 years or older and who had lived in a particular district for at least two years to vote. Additionally, the Act introduced proportional representation, meaning that the number of representatives a political party could have in the Storting was based on the share of the vote they received in elections.\n\nThe 1884 Act also granted the Storting greater powers, including the authority to make laws, levy taxes, and approve the budget. Previously, the Storting\u2019s powers were more limited, and its ability to pass important reforms was often constrained by the veto power of the king.\n\nOverall, the 1884 Electoral Reform Act played a crucial role in democratizing Norwegian politics and creating a more representative and powerful Storting, paving the way for further democratic reforms in the years to come.",
