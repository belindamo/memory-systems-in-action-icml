Here are some ideas that'll complement your Vegan Black Bean and Sweet Potato Enchiladas nicely:\n\n1. **Mexican Street Corn Salad**: A refreshing side that's perfect for warm days. Grilled corn, diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro, lime juice, and a sprinkle of cotija cheese (or vegan alternative) make for a flavorful and colorful side.\n2. **Cilantro Lime Rice**: A twist on traditional rice, this side dish is flavored with cilantro, lime juice, and a hint of garlic. It's light, fluffy, and pairs well with the rich enchiladas.\n3. **Grilled or Saut\u00e9ed Greens**: Quickly cooked greens like kale, spinach, or collard greens can provide a nice contrast to the rich, comforting enchiladas. Add some garlic, lemon juice, and a pinch of red pepper flakes for extra flavor.\n4. **Roasted Sweet Potato Wedges**: If you want to stick with sweet potatoes, try roasting them as wedges instead of dicing them. They'll come out crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, making a great side dish.\n5. **Avocado Salad**: A simple mix of diced avocado, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, and salt can provide a creamy, refreshing contrast to the spicy enchiladas.\n6. **Mexican-Style Street Corn Tortilla Chips**: If you want something crispy and fun, try making your own tortilla chips and seasoning them with lime juice, chili powder, and cotija cheese (or vegan alternative).\n7. **Pico de Gallo**: A fresh, chunky salsa made with diced tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, and lime juice. It's a classic Mexican condiment that pairs well with enchiladas.\n\nChoose one or two of these options to serve alongside your enchiladas, and I'm sure you'll have a well-rounded, delicious meal!\n\nWhich side dish catches your attention?",
