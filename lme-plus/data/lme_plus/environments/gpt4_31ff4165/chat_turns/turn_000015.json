  "content": "Azure DevOps is not a PaaS (Platform as a Service) because it is not a platform that provides a complete runtime environment for developing, running, and managing applications.\n\nInstead, Azure DevOps is a SaaS (Software as a Service) offering that provides a set of cloud-based services for software development teams to plan, build, test, and deploy software. These services include source control, continuous integration and delivery, project management, testing, and collaboration tools.\n\nAzure DevOps is built on top of the Azure platform and utilizes Azure services such as Azure Boards, Azure Pipelines, and Azure Repos. However, it is not a PaaS platform itself, as it does not provide a runtime environment or infrastructure for running applications.",
