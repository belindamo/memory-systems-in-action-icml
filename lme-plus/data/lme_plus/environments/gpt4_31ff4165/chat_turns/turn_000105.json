  "content": "Sure, here are a few spots that are popular among locals and tourists alike for post-festival dinner and drinks in Kyoto:\n\n1. Pontocho: Located near the Kamogawa River, the Pontocho alley is lined with traditional restaurants, bars and tea houses, making it an ideal spot for dinner or drinks after the Gion Matsuri. 2. Kiyamachi: This street is lined with many restaurants and bars and is situated along the Kamogawa River. Like Pontocho, it's a popular spot in Kyoto for post-festival dinners and drinks. 3. Gion: Gion is Kyoto's famous geisha district and has many restaurants, tea houses and bars to choose from. The atmosphere is very charming, and you'll see beautiful traditional buildings and lanterns that will give you the feel of the Kyoto of the past. 4. Fushimi Inari Shrine: While not a spot for dinner and drinks, taking a nighttime walk up the iconic red torii gate trail of Fushimi Inari Shrine while it's quiet at night is a beautiful experience. Remember to eat and drink responsibly, and enjoy your time in Kyoto!",
