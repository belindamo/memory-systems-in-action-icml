  "content": "Ancho chili powder and Mexican oregano will add a rich, complex flavor profile to your enchilada filling.\n\nAncho chili powder, in particular, is a great choice because it's relatively mild, with a slightly sweet and slightly smoky flavor. It's made from dried ancho chilies, which are a type of poblano pepper. The powder is often used in traditional Mexican cuisine to add depth and warmth to dishes like enchiladas, stews, and braises.\n\nWhen using ancho chili powder, keep in mind that it's a bit more subtle than other chili powders, so you may need to use a bit more to get the desired flavor. Start with a small amount, taste, and adjust to your liking.\n\nMexican oregano, as you know, is a staple in many Mexican dishes. Its pungent, earthy flavor pairs beautifully with the sweet potatoes and black beans. It's a great addition to the filling, and I think you'll find it enhances the overall flavor profile.\n\nRemember to toast the spices: Before adding the ancho chili powder and Mexican oregano to the filling, take a minute to toast them in a dry pan over low heat. This will help bring out their aromas and flavors. Simply add the spices to the pan, stir occasionally, and cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant.\n\nI hope you enjoy the added depth and complexity these spices bring to your enchilada filling! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Happy cooking!",
