What did you buy at Trendy Treasures?\n\n**Staples**: Office supplies, perhaps? That would fit into the **Household** category, as it's likely for personal or home office use.\n\n**Bed Bath & Beyond**: This one could fit into **Household** as well, as it's likely for home goods or decor.\n\n**IKEA**: Another one that fits into **Household**, as it's likely for furniture or home decor.\n\n**Farmer's Market**: Fresh produce and food, right? That would fit into **Household** under the **Groceries** subcategory.\n\nLet me know if any of these assumptions are incorrect, or if you need help with anything else!",
