Some specific areas where more research may be useful include:\n\n1. Evaluation of existing policies: Researchers can study the effectiveness of different policy interventions in reducing inequality, including by analyzing data on the outcomes of these policies and assessing their impact on different groups in society.\n2. Comparative studies: Researchers can study the experiences of different countries or regions in implementing policies to reduce inequality, and compare the effectiveness of different approaches.\n3. Interdisciplinary research: Inequality is a complex issue that is influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic, social, and political factors. Researchers from a variety of disciplines, such as economics, sociology, political science, and public health, can work together to better understand the root causes of inequality and to identify effective policy solutions.\n4. Basic research: Basic research in fields such as psychology, sociology, and economics can also help to shed light on the underlying mechanisms that drive inequality, and can inform the development of more targeted and effective policy interventions.",
