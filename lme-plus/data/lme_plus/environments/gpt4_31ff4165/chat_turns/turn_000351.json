I recommend checking with the hotel's website or contacting the casino directly to confirm their current hours.\n\nAs for rules and restrictions, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Age restriction**: You must be at least 21 years old to enter the casino and gamble.\n2. **Dress code**: The Las Vegas Hilton casino has a casual dress code, but some areas or events may have specific dress requirements.\n3. **Smoking policy**: Smoking is allowed in designated areas only, and some areas may be non-smoking.\n4. **ID and credit checks**: Be prepared to show valid government-issued ID and possibly undergo a credit check if you plan to use credit or cash a check.\n5. **Table limits**: Table limits may vary depending on the game and time of day. Check the table signs or ask the dealer for the minimum and maximum bets.\n6. **Tipping**: Tipping is not mandatory but is generally expected for good service.\n7. **Drinking and gambling**: Be responsible and drink in moderation. Don't gamble while intoxicated, as it can impair your judgment and lead to poor decision-making.\n8. **Security**: The casino has security personnel and cameras in place to ensure a safe environment. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.\n\nRemember to gamble responsibly and within your means. Set a budget, know your limits, and don't chase losses.\n\nHave a great time at the casino, and may the odds be ever in your favor!",
