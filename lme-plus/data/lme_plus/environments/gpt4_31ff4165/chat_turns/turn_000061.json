  "content": "Yes, there were several other major reforms that contributed to the transformation of Norway's political landscape over time.\n\nOne significant development was the gradual shift towards parliamentary democracy, which began in the late 19th century and continued through the early 20th century. This involved reducing the power of the monarchy and increasing the power of the Storting and the Prime Minister, who became the de facto leader of the government.\n\nAnother key reform was the establishment of a more comprehensive welfare state, which began in the mid-20th century. This involved the introduction of policies such as universal healthcare, free education, and a social safety net, which helped to promote greater equality and social mobility in Norwegian society.\n\nOther major developments in Norwegian politics and governance include the expansion of civil liberties, the growing role of women in politics and public life, and the emergence of new political parties and movements.\n\nOverall, Norway's political landscape has been shaped by a range of social, economic, and political factors, including the country's history, culture, and unique institutional arrangements. However, the continued focus on democratic values and progressive policies has been a hallmark of Norway's political evolution, and has helped to maintain the country's reputation as one of the most stable and prosperous democracies in the world today.",
