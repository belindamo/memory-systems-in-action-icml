However, even 15-20 minutes of relaxation techniques can make a significant difference in your sleep quality.\n\nHere's a condensed bedtime routine that you can try to fit into your 15-20 minute window:\n\n**11:15 PM - 11:20 PM (5 minutes)**\n\n* Take a few deep breaths and acknowledge that it's time to wind down. You can say to yourself, \"It's time to relax and prepare for bed.\"\n* Dim the lights in your bedroom to signal to your body that it's time to sleep.\n\n**11:20 PM - 11:30 PM (10 minutes)**\n\n* Choose one or two relaxation techniques from the following:\n\t+ Deep breathing exercises: Focus on slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try a 4-7-8 pattern: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds.\n\t+ Progressive muscle relaxation: Tense and release each major muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head.\n\t+ Guided imagery: Imagine yourself in a peaceful, relaxing environment, such as a beach or a forest. Use all your senses to create a vivid mental picture.\n\t+ Mindfulness meditation: Focus on your breath, a mantra, or a calming phrase. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your chosen focus.\n\n**11:30 PM - 11:40 PM (10 minutes)**\n\n* Get ready for bed by:\n\t+ Brushing your teeth\n\t+ Changing into comfortable pajamas\n\t+ Turning off any remaining lights or electronics\n\n**11:40 PM - 11:45 PM (5 minutes)**\n\n* Get into bed, get comfortable, and settle in for the night. Take a few final deep breaths, and remind yourself that you're ready to sleep.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a consistent routine that signals to your body that it's time to sleep. Even a short routine can be beneficial, and you can always adjust it as needed.\n\nGive this condensed routine a try and see how it works for you. If you find that you need more time or want to add more activities, you can always adjust your schedule accordingly.",
