Ecological Restoration: The park management wants to protect the biodiversity native to the park. One mitigation strategy is to reduce the impact of invasive species that outcompete native plants and disturb ecosystems. They carry out various control methods, including herbicides, physical removal, and mechanized removal.\n\n2. Trail Maintenance and Repair: The park trails are regularly inspected, maintained and sometimes closed due to extreme weather conditions or hazardous conditions. Efforts are made to minimize human impact on the natural environment.\n\n3. Wildlife Management: A significant part of the park management effort is dedicated to wildlife management programs to ensure healthy populations of native animals. Conservation efforts include monitoring, tracking, and protection to reduce the impacts of human activity.\n\n4. Education and Outreach: Various methods are employed to educate visitors on best park management practices, the importance of conservation, and the environment. This includes visitor guides, brochures, signage and videos.\n\nGenerally, these efforts have proved to be effective in preserving and maintaining the park and its ecosystem, but natural disasters and unforeseen events can have a significant impact on the park. It's crucial to continue research and implement strategies to protect and maintain our parks.",
