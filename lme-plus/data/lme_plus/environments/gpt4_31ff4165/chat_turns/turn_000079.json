I've got some fantastic suggestions to add depth and excitement to your enchilada filling:\n\n1. **Chili powder**: A blend of spices, including chili peppers, garlic, and cumin, that will add a rich, slightly smoky flavor.\n2. **Ancho chili powder**: A mild, slightly sweet chili powder made from dried ancho chilies. It pairs beautifully with sweet potatoes and black beans.\n3. **Ground coriander**: Similar to cumin, but with a slightly sweeter, more citrusy flavor. It's a great addition to Mexican and Southwestern dishes.\n4. **Mexican oregano**: A pungent, earthy herb that's commonly used in Mexican cuisine. It adds a nice depth to the filling.\n5. **Ground cinnamon**: Yes, you read that right! A small amount of cinnamon can add a warm, comforting flavor to the sweet potatoes and black beans.\n6. **Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce**: If you like a little heat, add some diced chipotle peppers to the filling. They'll add a smoky, spicy flavor.\n7. **Lime juice or zest**: A squeeze of fresh lime juice or some grated lime zest can brighten up the flavors and add a nice acidity.\n8. **Garam masala**: This Indian spice blend typically includes ground spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. It might seem unusual in a Mexican dish, but it adds a fascinating, aromatic flavor.\n9. **Pumpkin pie spice**: Another unexpected addition, but the warm, sweet spices in pumpkin pie spice (like cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger) can complement the sweet potatoes and black beans nicely.\n\nRemember, when working with new spices, start with a small amount and taste as you go. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess spice.\n\nWhich ones of these options catch your attention?",
