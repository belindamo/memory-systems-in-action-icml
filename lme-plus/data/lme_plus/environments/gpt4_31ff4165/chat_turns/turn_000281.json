Here's why:\n\n1. **Blue light reduction**: By avoiding screens, you'll minimize your exposure to blue light, which can suppress melatonin production and make it harder to fall asleep.\n2. **Reduced stimulation**: Screens can be stimulating, whether it's due to the content you're consuming or the notifications and alerts that can trigger a response. Avoiding screens can help calm your mind and body.\n3. **Improved wind-down time**: Having a screen-free hour before bed allows you to focus on relaxation techniques, reading, or other calming activities that can help you unwind and prepare for sleep.\n4. **Better sleep quality**: Studies have shown that avoiding screens before bed can lead to improved sleep quality, duration, and depth.\n\nTo make this rule effective, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Set a specific \"no screens\" time**: Decide on a specific time, such as 10:15 PM, and make it a habit to avoid screens from then until bedtime.\n2. **Find alternative activities**: Replace screen time with relaxing activities, like reading, meditation, or listening to calming music.\n3. **Use screen time tracking tools**: Utilize features like Screen Time on iOS or Digital Wellbeing on Android to track your screen time and set reminders to take breaks or stop using screens before bed.\n4. **Make it a habit**: Consistency is key. Try to stick to your \"no screens\" rule even on weekends or days off to make it a habitual part of your routine.\n\nRemember, it might take some time to adjust to this new habit, but the benefits to your sleep and overall well-being can be significant.\n\nHow do you think you'll implement this rule into your daily routine? Do you have any specific strategies in mind to help you stay on track?",
