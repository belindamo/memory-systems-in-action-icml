Doing them right after your guided breathing sessions can be a wonderful way to transition into a more relaxed state. Here are some simple stretches that can help:\n\n1. **Neck Stretch**: Slowly tilt your head to the right, bringing your ear towards your right shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds and then switch sides. This stretch can help relieve tension in the neck and shoulders.\n2. **Shoulder Rolls**: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion. Repeat for 30 seconds. This stretch can help loosen up tight shoulders and improve posture.\n3. **Chest Stretch**: Place your hands on a wall or door frame and lean forward, stretching your chest. Hold for 30 seconds. This stretch can help improve flexibility in the chest and shoulders.\n4. **Arm Circles**: Hold your arms straight out to the sides and make small circles with your hands. Gradually increase the size of the circles as you continue. Repeat for 30 seconds. This stretch can help loosen up the shoulders and improve flexibility in the arms.\n5. **Side Stretch**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and slowly lean to one side, keeping your arms extended. Hold for 30 seconds and then switch sides. This stretch can help improve flexibility in the hips and lower back.\n6. **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Kneel on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Bring one knee forward, keeping your foot flat on the ground. Hold for 30 seconds and then switch legs. This stretch can help improve flexibility in the hips and lower back.\n7. **Cat-Cow Stretch**: Start on your hands and knees. Arch your back, lifting your tailbone and head towards the ceiling (like a cat). Then, round your back, tucking your chin to your chest and your tailbone towards the ground (like a cow). Repeat for 30 seconds. This stretch can help improve flexibility in the spine and relieve tension in the neck and back.\n8. **Leg Stretch**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lean forward, reaching for your toes, and hold for 30 seconds. This stretch can help improve flexibility in the hamstrings and calves.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Breathe deeply and naturally while stretching\n* Don't bounce or force your muscles beyond a comfortable range of motion\n* Hold each stretch for 30 seconds to allow your muscles to relax and lengthen\n* Listen to your body and stop if you experience any discomfort or pain\n\nIncorporating these stretches into your daily routine can help you feel more relaxed, flexible, and centered. Enjoy your new stretching routine!",
