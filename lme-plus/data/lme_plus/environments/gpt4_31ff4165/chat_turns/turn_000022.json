Use version control to save your work\nand coordinate code changes across your team. Source control is an essential\ntool for multi-developer projects.\n\u2022 The version control system saves a snapshot of your files (history) so that you\ncan review and even roll back to any version of your code with ease. Also, it\nhelps to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources.\n\u2022 For most software teams, the source code is a repository of invaluable\nknowledge and understanding about the problem domain that the developers\nhave collected and refined through careful effort.\n\u2022 Source control protects source code from catastrophe and the casual\ndegradation of human error and unintended consequences.",
