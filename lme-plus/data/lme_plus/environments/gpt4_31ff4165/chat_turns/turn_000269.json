IKEA is a great place to find affordable and stylish plants, and snake plants are definitely a popular choice for their ease of care.\n\nIt's wonderful that you've been enjoying Slinky's company, and I'm sure it's bringing a touch of greenery and freshness to your space. Remember to water it sparingly, as snake plants prefer dry soil between waterings, and make sure it's getting enough indirect light.\n\nIf you have any more questions about plant care or need any further assistance, feel free to ask! Otherwise, enjoy your lovely Slinky and happy planting!",
