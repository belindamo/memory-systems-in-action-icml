Here are some tips to help you make the most of your lunchtime conversation:\n\n1. **Open-Ended Questions**: Ask open-ended questions that encourage your niece to share her thoughts and feelings about the showcase. Instead of asking \"Did you have fun?\", ask \"What was your favorite part of the showcase?\" or \"What did you think of performing in front of an audience?\"\n2. **Active Listening**: Give your niece your undivided attention, and actively listen to what she has to say. Maintain eye contact, nod to show you're engaged, and ask follow-up questions to delve deeper into her thoughts.\n3. **Encourage Storytelling**: Encourage your niece to tell you stories about her experience, such as what it was like to rehearse, what she liked about her costume, or what she thought of her fellow performers.\n4. **Avoid Criticism or Praise**: Try to avoid offering criticism or excessive praise, as this can put pressure on your niece or make her feel like she needs to perform for your approval. Instead, focus on her feelings and experiences.\n5. **Share Your Own Thoughts**: Share your own thoughts and feelings about the showcase, such as what you enjoyed about her performance or what you thought of the production. This can help create a sense of mutual understanding and connection.\n6. **Make it a Conversation**: Remember, it's a conversation, not an interrogation! Make sure to share your own experiences and thoughts, and respond to what your niece has to say.\n7. **Keep it Light**: Keep the conversation light and fun, especially if your niece is still processing her emotions about the showcase. Avoid pushing her to talk about anything that might make her uncomfortable.\n8. **Celebrate Her Effort**: Celebrate your niece's effort and hard work, regardless of the outcome. Let her know that you're proud of her for taking risks and trying something new.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a supportive and encouraging atmosphere for your lunchtime conversation. Enjoy your time with your niece, and I'm sure you'll have a wonderful conversation!",
