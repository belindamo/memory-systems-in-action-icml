One of them was a woman who works for a non-profit organization that uses social media to promote social change. We exchanged numbers, and I've been following their social media accounts since then.\n\nWhat struck me was how effectively they're using social media to raise awareness about important issues and mobilize people to take action. It's a great reminder of the power of social media in promoting social change.\n\nAs someone who's passionate about mental health awareness, I believe that social media can play a crucial role in breaking the silence and stigma surrounding mental health issues.
