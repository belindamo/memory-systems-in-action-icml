  "content": "Dear [Subscriber],\n\nWe wanted to share with you the story behind Gary Dranow and the Manic Emotions' latest album, Destiny Road. For a decade, Dranow poured his heart and soul into the creation of this deeply personal musical journey that chronicles his struggles, triumphs, and everything in between.\n\nDestiny Road was initially written in the 90s, and the band intended to release it in the summer of 1998. The album was recorded on Jefferson Airplane's old 2\" 16 Track machine, which was owned by his producer Jerry Manfredi. The legend of this machine is that they actually had it on their private airplane!\n\nBut life had other plans for Gary. \"We finished recording the tracks and then I abruptly moved to Park City, Utah. We never got the chance to master the tracks, and for the next ten years, I concentrated on my ski racing and coaching.\"\n\nDespite the delay, Dranow's passion for music never wavered. He eventually returned to the studio and completed the album, which was released to critical acclaim. Destiny Road is an autobiographical and deeply personal musical journey that showcases Dranow's talent as a songwriter and his dedication to his craft.\n\nAs a subscriber to our newsletter, you're part of this musical journey. We're grateful for your support and excited to share our latest updates with you.
