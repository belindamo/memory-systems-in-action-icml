  "content": "That sounds like a fun day out! I'm happy to help with recommendations, but I need a bit more information from you. Since I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time information about specific locations or businesses. I don't know which children's theater company or location you're referring to.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general advice on finding kid-friendly Italian restaurants:\n\n1. Online Search: Try searching online for \"kid-friendly Italian restaurants near me\" or \"family-friendly Italian restaurants in [neighborhood/city]\". This should give you a list of options to choose from.\n2. Check Websites and Menus: Look at the websites of potential restaurants to see if they have a kids' menu or mention being family-friendly. You can also check their menus to ensure they have options that your niece might enjoy.\n3. Reviews and Ratings: Read reviews from other parents or families to get an idea of the restaurant's atmosphere and service. Look for ratings or reviews that mention being kid-friendly.\n4. Call Ahead: If you're unsure, call the restaurant ahead of time to ask about their kid-friendliness, menu options, and if they have any activities or amenities for kids.\n\nSome popular kid-friendly Italian dishes include:\n\n* Pasta with marinara sauce and meatballs\n* Cheese pizza\n* Chicken tenders with dipping sauce\n* Mac and cheese\n* Garlic bread\n\nWhen you arrive at the restaurant, don't hesitate to ask your server for recommendations or special requests. They're usually happy to accommodate kids' tastes and needs.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your niece's showcase will be a wonderful experience!",
