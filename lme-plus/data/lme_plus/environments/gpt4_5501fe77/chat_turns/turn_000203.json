  "content": "Short breaks throughout the day are an excellent way to prevent burnout and recharge your energy. It can be difficult to take long breaks if you have a lot of tasks to accomplish, so taking shorter breaks, as often as you can, is a great way to keep yourself motivated and focused while still giving your brain and body a chance to rest. Remember to prioritize your mental and physical health while working towards your activism goals. Good luck!",
