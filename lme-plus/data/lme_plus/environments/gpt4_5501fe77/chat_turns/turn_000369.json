It was one of the oldest and most popular festivals in the Roman calendar and was a time of merriment, gift-giving, and role-reversals.\n\nDuring Saturnalia, the usual social norms were turned upside down, and slaves were given the day off and allowed to participate in the festivities. They were even allowed to gamble, something that was normally prohibited. Masters would serve their slaves, and there was a general sense of revelry and inversion of the usual social order.\n\nGift-giving was also an important part of Saturnalia, and people would exchange small presents such as candles, figurines, and sweets. Decorations, including wreaths and garlands, were also used to celebrate the festival.\n\nSaturnalia was a time of feasting and merriment, and people would come together to enjoy lavish banquets, drink wine, and sing songs.
