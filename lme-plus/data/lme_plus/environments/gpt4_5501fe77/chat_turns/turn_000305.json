Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Phone Notifications**: Set reminders on your phone using a built-in alarm clock, a reminder app (e.g., Google Keep, Any.do), or a habit-tracking app (e.g., Habitica, HabitBull).\n2. **Computer Notifications**: Set reminders on your computer using a digital calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar), a task management tool (e.g., Trello, Asana), or a browser extension (e.g., Todoist, RescueTime).\n3. **Smart Speaker**: If you have a smart speaker like Amazon Echo or Google Home, you can set reminders using voice commands.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Start with a gentle reminder volume or tone to ease into your morning routine.\n2. Consider setting reminders for the night before to prepare your gear, clothes, or breakfast ingredients to make your morning routine smoother.\n3. Review and adjust your reminders regularly to ensure they're working effectively for you.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Do you have any questions or would you like to make any changes?",
