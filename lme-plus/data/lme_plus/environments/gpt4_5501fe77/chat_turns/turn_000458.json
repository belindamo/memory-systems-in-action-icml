  "content": "I think I'll start by asking my followers about their favorite TV shows or movies, since that's a topic I'm passionate about and it's relevant to my content. I might ask something like, \"What's your favorite TV show to binge-watch on a lazy Sunday? \ud83d\udcfa\" or \"What's the best movie you've seen recently? \ud83c\udfa5\" This will help me get a sense of what my followers are interested in and start a conversation around a topic we both care about. I'll also try to keep my questions open-ended and easy to respond to, and make sure to engage with followers who answer my questions. Thanks for the tips!",
