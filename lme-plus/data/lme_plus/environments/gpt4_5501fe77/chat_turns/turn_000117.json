  "content": "While it is not necessary to use separate exfoliators for the face and body, it is recommended as the skin on the face is typically more delicate and sensitive than the skin on other parts of the body. Facial exfoliators are designed to be more gentle and formulated to address specific concerns such as acne, hyperpigmentation or anti-aging while body exfoliators are often stronger and formulated to target rough, dry and flaky skin. Using a separate exfoliator for the face and body can help to ensure that each area is receiving the appropriate treatment and protection it requires.",
