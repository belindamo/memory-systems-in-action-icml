I've been experimenting with different flavors in my cooking, and I'm interested in exploring more herbal and vegetable-based cocktails. Speaking of cooking, I've been meal prepping on Sundays and trying to incorporate more vegetables into my meals. Do you have any suggestions for healthy, easy-to-make meals or snacks that can be prepped ahead of time?",
