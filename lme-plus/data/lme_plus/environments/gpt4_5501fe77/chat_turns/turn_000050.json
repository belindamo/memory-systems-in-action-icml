That is where a lot of Dranow\u2019s lyrical inspiration comes from. \n\nThe song \u201cMade it Another Day\u201d speaks directly to this experience. \u201cYou go to sleep with the weight of the world on your shoulders and then wake the next morning free of those feelings and being surprised you\u2019ve made it another day to take on your daily struggle once again. The lyric \u2018Like a rat in a wheel\u2019 brings the image to the life of the never-ending struggle to get your personal life in order only to be dissuaded at the end of every day and that making progress in the inevitable headwinds that buffet your life.\u201d Gary explains. \n\nGary Dranow is thrilled to be performing and sharing his music with fans once again. His unwavering spirit and determination are an inspiration to all who have followed his journey. Keep your ears open for more Gary Dranow and The Manic Emotions in 2023 and beyond\".\n\nPlease write in English language.",
