  "content": "I'm glad to hear that music therapy is being used in children's hospitals. I've had a chance to participate in a bake sale organized by my college's volunteer club recently, and we managed to raise $300 for a children's hospital. It's amazing to think that our efforts could potentially contribute to programs like music therapy that bring comfort and joy to the kids. Do you know if there are any specific music therapy programs or organizations that work with children's hospitals that I could look into supporting?",
