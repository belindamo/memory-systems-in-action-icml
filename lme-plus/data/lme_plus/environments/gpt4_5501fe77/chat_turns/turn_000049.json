We wanted to follow up on that and update you on what's been happening with the band since then.\n\nIn 2008, Dranow got back into music, and by 2021 he had re-established the Manic Emotions with band members located in the Salt Lake City area. Almost immediately, they started playing shows. Dranow is a consummate performer, and his live sets are a testament to his energy, charisma, and unwavering passion for music.\n\nOf course, Dranow's career has not been without its challenges, and he has faced his fair share of obstacles along the way. His struggles with manic depression have fueled his creativity and inspired him to make music that speaks to the human experience. Through his music, he has been able to connect with fans from all walks of life and inspire them to embrace their own struggles and triumphs.\n\nAs a subscriber to our newsletter, you're part of this musical journey. We're grateful for your support and excited to share our latest updates with you.
