Avoid anything too tight or constricting.\n* Dress in layers, as the room may be cooler or warmer than expected. You can always remove layers as needed.\n* Consider wearing clothing with a bit of stretch, like yoga pants or leggings, to allow for comfortable movement.\n\n**What to Bring:**\n\n* A good quality yoga mat: Invest in a mat that provides good grip and cushioning.\n* A blanket or strap: These can be helpful for modifying poses or getting comfortable in deeper stretches.\n* Blocks: If you have them, bring blocks to help support your body in various poses.\n* Water bottle: Stay hydrated during class by bringing a water bottle.\n* A small towel: You may want a towel to wipe away sweat or use as a prop.\n\n**Setting Up Your Mat:**\n\n* Arrive early to set up your mat and get comfortable in the space.\n* Place your mat in a quiet, peaceful spot in the room, away from distractions.\n* Set up your props, such as blocks, blankets, and straps, within easy reach.\n* Take a few deep breaths and get comfortable on your mat before class begins.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Arrive 10-15 minutes before class to meet the teacher, ask questions, and get settled.\n* Let the teacher know if you're new to yin yoga or have any injuries or concerns.\n* Be prepared to slow down and listen to your body.
