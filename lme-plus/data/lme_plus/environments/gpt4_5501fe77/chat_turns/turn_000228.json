Since I watched that YouTube video about the new Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure ride, I'm really excited to experience it for myself. Do you think I should head to Hagrid's ride as soon as I get to Islands of Adventure, or should I explore the rest of the Wizarding World first?\nassistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nYeah, I'd definitely recommend heading to Hagrid's ride as soon as you get to Islands of Adventure. I mean, it's a brand-new attraction and it's gonna be super popular, so you should try to beat the crowds. Plus, you can always explore the rest of the Wizarding World afterwards, but if you wait too long, the wait times for Hagrid's ride might get really long. So, yeah, get it out of the way first and then enjoy the rest of the Wizarding World!",
