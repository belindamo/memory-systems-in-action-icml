Adding subtle shading to the flower using your Copic markers can give it a beautiful, lifelike quality and add depth to the design.\n\nWhen using Copic markers for shading, remember to:\n\n1. **Start with a light touch**: Begin with a light layer of shading and build up gradually. It's easier to add more color than it is to remove it.\n2. **Choose the right shades**: Select Copic markers that are one to two shades deeper than the base color of the flower. This will create a natural-looking gradient.\n3. **Blend, blend, blend**: Use gentle, smooth strokes to blend the shading into the base color. This will help create a seamless transition and prevent harsh lines.\n4. **Pay attention to the flower's shape**: Consider the shape and structure of the flower when applying shading. Add shading to areas where the petals would naturally curve inward or where shadows would fall.\n5. **Less is more**: Remember, the goal is to add subtle depth, not to overpower the design. Start with a light hand and add more shading gradually until you achieve the desired effect.\n\nSome tips for shading a small, delicate flower:\n\n* Use the tip of the Copic marker to create fine details and subtle shading.\n* Focus on adding shading to the center of the flower, where the petals meet, and along the edges of the petals.\n* Consider adding a tiny highlight to the center of the flower using a lighter shade or a white gel pen to create a sense of dimension.\n\nBy adding subtle shading to the flower, you'll create a beautiful, realistic design that will elevate the gift tag and make it an extra-special touch for your sister's birthday gift.",
