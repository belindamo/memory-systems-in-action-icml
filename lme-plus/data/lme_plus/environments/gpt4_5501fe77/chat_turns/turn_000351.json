Roasted or grilled vegetables, such as zucchini, bell peppers, eggplant, or asparagus.\n\n3. A cool, creamy side salad like coleslaw or potato salad.\n\n4. Grilled or roasted corn on the cob with butter or a spicy mayo sauce.\n\n5. Sweet potato fries or roasted sweet potatoes with cinnamon and chili powder.\n\n6. A refreshing green salad with a spicy vinaigrette.\n\n7. A side of black bean salsa or pico de gallo.\n\nAny of these sides would help balance out the heat of the spicy chicken and provide a delicious contrast of flavors and textures.",
