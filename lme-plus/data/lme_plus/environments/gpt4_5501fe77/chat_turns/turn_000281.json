Here are some tips to help you design an effective promotional material:\n\n**Flyer/Postcard Design Tips:**\n\n1. **Eye-Catching Image**: Use a high-quality, visually appealing image of your products or a lifestyle shot that showcases your products in use. This will help grab attention and make people want to learn more.\n2. **Clear Headline**: Use a bold, easy-to-read font to create a headline that clearly communicates what your product is and what makes it unique.

Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to make it easy to scan.\n6. **Color Scheme**: Choose a color scheme that reflects your brand and products. Bright, bold colors can grab attention, while pastel colors can create a softer, more vintage feel.\n7. ** Fonts**: Select fonts that are easy to read and consistent with your brand.
