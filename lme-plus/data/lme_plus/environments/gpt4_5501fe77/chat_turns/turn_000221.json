However, here are some approximate rates to give you an idea:\n\n**Standard Room Rates:**\n\n* Value Season (usually weekdays during off-peak periods): around $120-$150 per night\n* Regular Season (weekdays during peak periods): around $150-$200 per night\n* Peak Season (weekends and holidays): around $200-$250 per night\n\n**Family Suites:**\n\n* Value Season: around $180-$220 per night\n* Regular Season: around $220-$280 per night\n* Peak Season: around $280-$350 per night\n\nKeep in mind that these are approximate rates and can vary depending on the time of year and availability. I recommend checking the Universal Orlando website or a hotel booking website like Expedia, Booking.com, or Hotels.com for the most up-to-date prices.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Cabana Bay offers some amazing deals and discounts, especially if you're a Florida resident, a student, or a member of the military. Be sure to check their website for special offers and packages that might save you some money.\n\nAdditionally, consider staying during the off-season (usually from mid-January to mid-March and from September to mid-November) when prices tend to be lower. You can also look into booking a room with a \"Volcano View\" which might be slightly cheaper than a \"Pool View\" or \"Bay View\" room.\n\nIf you're flexible with your travel dates and room type, you might be able to snag a great deal at Cabana Bay!",
