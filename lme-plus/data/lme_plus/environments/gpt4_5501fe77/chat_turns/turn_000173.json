Adding embroidery details to the gift tag using a matching pastel-colored floss can add an extra layer of texture and visual interest to the design.\n\nEmbroidery floss is a great choice because it's easy to work with, and the soft, cotton threads will complement the delicate look of the flower and the pastel yarn. By using a matching pastel color, you'll create a beautiful, cohesive look that ties in with the scarf and the gift tag.\n\nWhen it comes to adding embroidery details, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Keep it simple**: Remember, the gift tag is small, so keep the embroidery design simple and understated. A few strategically placed stitches can make a big impact.\n2. **Choose the right stitch**: Select an embroidery stitch that complements the design and the fabric. For a delicate flower, a simple running stitch or a small French knot might be a good choice.\n3. **Use a matching thread**: As you mentioned, using a matching pastel-colored floss will help tie in the embroidery with the rest of the design.\n4. **Don't overdo it**: A little embroidery goes a long way. Start with a small design element and add more details gradually until you achieve the desired look.\n\nSome ideas for embroidery details on the gift tag could be:\n\n* A small, delicate outline around the flower using a running stitch\n* A few strategically placed French knots in the center of the flower\n* A simple, cursive message or the recipient's name using a stem stitch\n* A small, decorative border around the edges of the gift tag using a herringbone or chevron stitch\n\nBy combining the Copic marker shading with the embroidery details, you'll create a beautiful, multi-dimensional gift tag that adds an extra special touch to the scarf. Your sister will surely appreciate the thought and attention to detail you've put into the gift.",
