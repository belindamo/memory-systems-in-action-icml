I can provide general recommendations and suggestions, but I wouldn't know about a specific \"new place\" or \"community theater\" in your area.\n\nThat being said, I can offer some tips to help you find great Italian restaurants in downtown areas:\n\n1. Online Review Sites: Check out review websites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews to see what other diners have to say about Italian restaurants in your downtown area. Look for places with high ratings and pay attention to comments about the food, service, and atmosphere.\n2. Ask Locals: Ask your friends, colleagues, or neighbors who live or work in the downtown area for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge about the best Italian restaurants.\n3. Italian-American Chamber of Commerce: The Italian-American Chamber of Commerce often has a list of recommended Italian restaurants in various cities. You can check their website to see if they have a chapter in your area.\n4. Authenticity: If you're looking for an authentic Italian experience, look for restaurants that have Italian chefs, owners, or staff. They might offer more traditional dishes and a more immersive experience.\n5. Menu Variety: Check the menu online to see if it offers a variety of dishes beyond the usual pasta and pizza. A good Italian restaurant should have a range of options, including seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.\n\nSome popular Italian dishes to look for on the menu include:\n\n* Risotto\n* Osso Buco\n* Chicken or Veal Parmesan\n* Bruschetta\n* Pollo alla Cacciatora\n* Cannoli or Tiramisu for dessert\n\nRemember to make reservations in advance, especially if you're planning to dine during peak hours or on weekends.\n\nI hope these tips help you find an excellent Italian restaurant in downtown!"
