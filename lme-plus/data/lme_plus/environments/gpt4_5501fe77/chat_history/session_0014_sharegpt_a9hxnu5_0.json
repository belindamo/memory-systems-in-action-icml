      "content": "A global full text search refers to a search functionality that allows a user to search for specific words or phrases within an entire collection of documents, regardless of their location or format. This type of search is typically implemented using specialized software, such as a search engine, that is able to index and search the text in the documents quickly and efficiently. The search results can include a list of documents that contain the searched words or phrases, along with information such as the relevance or rank of each result."

      "content": "There are several reasons why organizations might choose to implement a global full text search:\n\n1. Improved information access: By allowing users to quickly and easily search for specific information within a large collection of documents, global full text search can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information access.\n2. Increased productivity: By making it easier for employees to find the information they need, global full text search can help to increase productivity and reduce the time and effort required to complete tasks.\n3. Better customer service: By making it easier for customers to find the information they need on a company's website, global full text search can help to improve customer service and satisfaction.\n4. Competitive advantage: Having a powerful search functionality can be a competitive advantage for companies that need to access large amounts of data quickly and easily\n5. Better data analysis: Having a global full text search can help to discover insights from unstructured text data, this can be a powerful tool for companies to make better decisions."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "There are several advantages of full text search compared to form search:\n\n1. Flexibility: Full text search allows users to enter natural language queries, which can be in the form of full sentences or phrases. This makes it more flexible and intuitive for users than form search, which often requires users to select specific options from a predefined set of choices.\n2. Relevancy: Full text search often uses advanced algorithms to rank search results by relevance, which can help users to quickly find the most relevant information. Form search results are typically not ranked by relevance.\n3. Comprehensive: Full text search can search through all the words in a document, not just a specific field, which means that users can find information that may not be easily found through form search.\n4. Handling of misspellings: Full text search often includes spell checking and correction, which can help users to find the information they are looking for even if they misspell a word. Form search does not have this capability.\n5. Handling synonyms: Full text search often includes the handling of synonyms, so if a user searches for a word that is similar to the actual word on the document, it will still find the correct information. Form search does not have this capability."

      "content": "And what is exactly form search?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Form search is a type of search functionality that allows users to search for specific information by filling out a form with predefined fields and options. The form typically includes one or more input fields where users can enter their search criteria, and may also include additional fields that allow users to further refine their search. The form search results will be based on the specific fields and options selected by the user, and will not take into account other information within the documents.\n\nForm search is typically used to search structured data, such as databases, spreadsheets, and other types of structured documents. It is often used in situations where the data is organized in a specific way, and the user needs to search for specific information within that structure. For example, a form search may be used on a database of customer information to search for customers by name, address, or other specific criteria.\n\nForm search can be useful when the user knows exactly what they are looking for and when the data is structured, but it can be less flexible and less accurate than full-text search when the data is unstructured or the user is not exactly sure what they are looking for."

      "content": "I have to build a backoffice for customer support team. This team attends by phone the calls of customers and they have to search in real time for different fields in order to pick up information like payment methods, subscriptions, acquired products, etc. What kind of search I have to desing and why?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "For your customer support team, you would likely want to design a form search for the backoffice. The main reason for this is that the customer support team needs to search for specific information within a predefined set of fields, such as payment methods, subscriptions, and acquired products. Form search is well-suited for this type of scenario because it allows users to search for specific information within a predefined set of fields, and can be tailored to match the specific needs of your customer support team.\n\nAdditionally, form search can be more efficient than full-text search when searching for specific information in large data sets, as it narrows the search results to specific fields and can be faster than performing a full-text search.\n\nForm search can also be useful when the data is structured and the customer support team knows exactly what they are looking for, which is the case when customer support is handling customer's calls. This can help the team to quickly and easily find the information they need to assist customers, which can improve the customer service experience and increase productivity.\n\nIn summary, a form search is the best option for your backoffice because it allows customer support team to search specific information in real time with a predefined set of fields, it's efficient, fast, and well suited for the specific needs of your customer support team."
