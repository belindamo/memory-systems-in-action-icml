The goal of using the app is to lower the risks of water damage, fire and other expensive damages that can go wrong with a house. The app will be centered around the different seasons (spring, summer, fall and winter), and generate maintenance tasks that should be done regularly for an old house.\n\nFirst, I want you to generate at least 12 categories that we can create tasks within. Please provide an explanation of what each category is. Make it a list in markdown."
