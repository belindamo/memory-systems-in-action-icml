      "content": "Mitsubishi has not announced any plans to expand their electric vehicle lineup recently. However, they have a strong history of developing electric vehicles, starting with the introduction of the i-MiEV in 2009. Mitsubishi has also recently released the Outlander PHEV, a plug-in hybrid version of the popular Outlander SUV.\n\nIn 2019, there were some reports that Mitsubishi was considering investing in the development of all-electric SUVs by partnering with Nissan and Renault. However, it's unclear whether these plans have been put on hold due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOverall, it's possible that Mitsubishi will continue to expand its electric vehicle lineup in the future, given the growing demand for environmentally friendly vehicles and the company's past experience in this area."

      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have access to confidential information and could not predict with certainty whether Mitsubishi will transition to only producing electric vehicles in the future. However, many car manufacturers around the world have announced plans to shift towards electric vehicles as governments around the world impose stricter emissions regulations, and consumers increasingly demand more environmentally friendly cars.\n\nMitsubishi could follow this growing trend by expanding its electric vehicle lineup, and it is possible that they may eventually transition to producing only electric vehicles. However, such a decision would depend on several factors, such as technological advancements, the availability of resources needed to produce electric vehicles, market demand, and regulatory requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, while Mitsubishi has a history of developing electric vehicles, only time will tell whether the company will ultimately transition to only producing electric vehicles."
