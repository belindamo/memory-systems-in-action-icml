While I can certainly search for additional sources, population data for a specific location can be challenging to obtain, and projections can be subject to factors that are difficult to anticipate.\n\nThat being said, if you provide more details about the sources you have consulted or the specific aspects of population growth in Larisa, Greece, that you are interested in, I can certainly try to direct my searches to provide information that is more tailored to your needs.",
