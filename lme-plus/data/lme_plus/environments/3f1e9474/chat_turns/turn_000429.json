  "content": "I love those tips! The 30-day rule is a great idea, and I can see how it would help with impulse buys. I've heard of it before, but I've never actually implemented it. I think I'll give it a try and see how it goes.\n\nThe \"wish list\" or \"someday\" fund is also a great idea. I do have a wishlist on Amazon, but it's more of a dumping ground for things I'm interested in rather than a curated list of items I'm saving up for. I like the idea of setting up a separate fund for big-ticket items, though. It would help me prioritize my spending and make more intentional purchasing decisions, like you said.\n\nOne thing I've tried in the past is using website blockers to limit my access to online shopping websites during certain times of the day or week. It's helped me avoid mindless browsing and reduce the temptation to make impulse purchases. But I think the 30-day rule and the \"wish list\" fund strategies could be even more effective in helping me make more thoughtful purchasing decisions.\n\nThanks for the advice! Do you have any more tips or strategies to share?",
