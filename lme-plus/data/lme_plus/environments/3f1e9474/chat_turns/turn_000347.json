  "content": "TruWest Credit Union offers a variety of mortgage options to help its members achieve their homeownership goals. Here are the types of mortgages that TruWest Credit Union offers:\n\n1. Fixed-Rate Mortgages: With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate remains the same throughout the life of the loan, which can help members budget their monthly payments.\n2. Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs): With an ARM, the interest rate can adjust periodically based on market conditions. TruWest Credit Union offers 5/1, 7/1, and 10/1 ARMs, which means that the interest rate is fixed for the first 5, 7, or 10 years of the loan, and then adjusts annually thereafter.\n3. Jumbo Mortgages: TruWest Credit Union offers jumbo mortgages for members who need to borrow more than the conforming loan limit. Jumbo mortgages have higher loan amounts and may have different underwriting requirements than conventional mortgages.\n4. FHA and VA Mortgages: TruWest Credit Union also offers government-backed FHA and VA mortgages, which can be a good option for members who may not qualify for a conventional mortgage.\n\nTruWest Credit Union's mortgage options also include refinancing options, such as cash-out refinancing and rate-and-term refinancing. Members can apply for a mortgage online, and TruWest Credit Union offers personalized support throughout the mortgage process.",
