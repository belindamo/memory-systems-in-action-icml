Attending conferences can help members network with other professionals in the industry, learn about the latest trends and technologies, and gain inspiration for their own projects.\n2. Tech talks: Invite guest speakers to give talks on specific topics related to tech, such as machine learning, web development, or cybersecurity. Tech talks can help members gain insights from experts in the field, learn about new technologies and tools, and ask questions to deepen their understanding.\n3. Code challenges: Create coding challenges that members can work on individually or in teams. Code challenges can help members apply their knowledge to real-world problems, practice their coding skills, and learn from others.\n4. Coding bootcamps: Host coding bootcamps where members can learn a new skill or technology over a short period of time. Bootcamps can help members gain practical experience, learn from experts in the field, and network with other members.\n5. Code review clubs: Create a code review club where members can review each other's code and provide constructive feedback. Code review clubs can help members improve their coding skills, learn new techniques, and gain a deeper understanding of programming concepts.\n6. Group projects: Assign group projects to members where they can collaborate to build a software project, a website, or an app. Group projects can help members learn to work together, develop their project management skills, and gain practical experience in building software.\n\nAs for more ideas like the blog writing task, you could also consider creating a podcast or video series where members can share their knowledge and experience. Members can create short episodes on specific topics, interview experts in the field, or discuss current events in tech. This can help members develop their presentation skills, gain exposure to new ideas, and share their knowledge with a wider audience.",
