March 15th: Best Buy (wireless charging pad)\n3. March 20th: Amazon (pair of sneakers)\n\nThat's three online purchases in March so far.\n\nCan you think of any other purchases you might have made in March, or do you think these three are the only ones?\n\nAlso, I'm curious - what triggered your purchase on March 15th during the commercial break? Was it an ad you saw, or did you suddenly remember you needed a wireless charging pad?\n\nLastly, do you usually buy things on impulse, or do you tend to plan your purchases in advance?",
