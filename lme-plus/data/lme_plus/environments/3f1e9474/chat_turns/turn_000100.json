Thank you for breaking it down and providing a balanced approach!\n\nI realize that it's not just about positive thinking, but also about taking concrete actions towards achieving my goals. And I need to be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances and focus on the journey, rather than just the end result.\n\nYou know, talking about this makes me think of my conversation with Sarah again. She was saying that everything happens for a reason, and that our experiences shape us into who we are meant to be. I'm starting to see how that perspective can be really empowering.\n\nDo you think that's related to the idea of manifesting desires? Like, if I'm meant to achieve something, will the universe conspire to help me get there?",
