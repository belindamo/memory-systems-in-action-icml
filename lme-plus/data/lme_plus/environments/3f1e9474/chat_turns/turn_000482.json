However, many car manufacturers around the world have announced plans to shift towards electric vehicles as governments around the world impose stricter emissions regulations, and consumers increasingly demand more environmentally friendly cars.\n\nMitsubishi could follow this growing trend by expanding its electric vehicle lineup, and it is possible that they may eventually transition to producing only electric vehicles. However, such a decision would depend on several factors, such as technological advancements, the availability of resources needed to produce electric vehicles, market demand, and regulatory requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, while Mitsubishi has a history of developing electric vehicles, only time will tell whether the company will ultimately transition to only producing electric vehicles.",
