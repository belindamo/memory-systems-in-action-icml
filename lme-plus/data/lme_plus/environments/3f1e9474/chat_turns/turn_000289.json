The Australian dollar is a fascinating currency with a rich history.\n\nThe Australian dollar (AUD) is the official currency of Australia and was introduced on February 14, 1966, replacing the Australian pound. Here's a brief history of the Australian dollar:\n\n**Pre-Decimal Era (1825-1966)**\n\nBefore the introduction of the Australian dollar, Australia used the Australian pound (GBP), which was pegged to the British pound. The first coins minted in Australia were the Holey Dollar and the Dump, introduced in 1825. These coins were made from Spanish dollars and were used to alleviate a shortage of coins in the colony.\n\n**Decimalization (1966)**\n\nIn the 1960s, the Australian government decided to decimalize its currency, replacing the pound with the dollar. The new currency was introduced on February 14, 1966, with the Australian dollar divided into 100 cents. The introduction of the decimal system was a significant change, as it simplified financial transactions and made it easier to calculate prices.\n\n**Coin Design**\n\nThe design of the Australian dollar coins features a range of iconic Australian symbols, including:\n\n1. Kangaroo: The kangaroo is a national symbol of Australia and appears on the 1-dollar coin.\n2. Commonwealth Coat of Arms: The Commonwealth Coat of Arms appears on the 50-cent coin.\n3. Platypus: The platypus, a unique Australian animal, appears on the 20-cent coin.\n4. Echidna: The echidna, another native Australian animal, appears on the 5-cent coin.\n\n**Banknotes**\n\nAustralian banknotes feature prominent Australians, including:\n\n1. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith (50-dollar note)\n2. David Unaipon (50-dollar note)\n3. Mary Reibey (20-dollar note)\n4. John Flynn (20-dollar note)\n5. Edith Cowan (50-dollar note)\n\n**Interesting Facts**\n\n1. The Australian dollar is one of the most widely traded currencies in the world.\n2. The Royal Australian Mint produces over 2 billion coins annually.\n3. The Australian dollar is used by several Pacific island nations, including Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu.\n4. The first Australian dollar coins were minted in 1966, but they were not released into circulation until 1967 due to a delay in the production of the 1-cent and 2-cent coins.\n\nYour 2019 Australian Kangaroo coin is a great addition to your collection! The kangaroo design has been a popular feature on Australian coins since 1984.",
