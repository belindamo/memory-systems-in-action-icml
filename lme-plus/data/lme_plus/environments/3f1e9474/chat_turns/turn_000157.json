Collaboration and multidisciplinary teams: Collaborating and working with a team with diverse skills, shared values, and expertise around specific issues can drive social impact and environmental sustainability.\n\n4. Community engagement: Partnering organizations should engage with the communities affected by the initiatives before, during, and after the partnership project. This enables the community to maintain leadership in driving solutions while providing feedback on the implementation of strategies.\n\n5. Independent assessment: Using independent third parties to assess partnership activities provides credibility, reviewing progress, and ensuring that goals and metrics remain aligned with core ethical principles.\n\nThrough these strategies, partnerships between corporations and governmental or non-governmental organizations can lead to genuine social and environmental impact rather than just being perceived as good public relations for organizations involved.",
