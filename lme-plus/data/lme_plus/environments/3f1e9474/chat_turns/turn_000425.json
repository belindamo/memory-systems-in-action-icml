I don't remember buying anything else online that month.\n\nAs for the wireless charging pad, I think I saw an ad for it on YouTube or Facebook, and it reminded me that I had been meaning to get one for my new phone. It was one of those \"why not now?\" moments, and I quickly checked the price on Best Buy's website during the commercial break. It was on sale, so I decided to go for it!\n\nAs for my shopping habits, I'd say it's a mix of both impulse and planned purchases. Sometimes I see something I want and just buy it, but other times I'll add things to my wishlist or cart and wait for sales or discounts. I do try to be mindful of my spending, but I'm not always successful!\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any other questions about my online shopping habits?",
