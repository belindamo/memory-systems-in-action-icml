Since you've recently installed a new SSD on your laptop, it's unlikely to be related to your desktop computer's freezing issue.\n\nLet's explore some potential causes and troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Resource-intensive programs:** When you run multiple resource-hungry programs simultaneously, it can cause your system to slow down or freeze. Try closing unnecessary programs or background applications to free up system resources.\n2. **System resource usage:** Check your system's resource usage by pressing the Windows key + R, typing \"taskmgr,\" and pressing Enter. This will open the Task Manager. Sort the processes by CPU, Memory, or Disk usage to identify any resource-intensive programs. You can also check the Performance tab to see if any system resources are being maxed out.\n3. **Overheating:** If your desktop computer is overheating, it can cause freezing or shutdowns. Make sure your computer is in a well-ventilated area, and ensure that the vents are not blocked. You can also check the CPU and GPU temperatures using software like SpeedFan, HWMonitor, or GPU-Z.\n4. **Driver updates:** Outdated drivers can cause system instability. Open the Device Manager (Press the Windows key + X and select Device Manager), expand each category, and look for devices with a yellow exclamation mark or a red X. Update drivers for these devices using the Update Driver button or by visiting the manufacturer's website.\n5. **System updates:** Ensure your operating system and software are up-to-date. Sometimes, updates can resolve issues and improve system performance.\n6. **Malware:** Run a full scan with your antivirus software to detect and remove any malware that might be causing the freezing issue.\n7. **System file corruption:** Corrupted system files can cause system instability. Run the System File Checker tool (SFC) to scan and repair corrupted system files. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator and run the command \"sfc /scannow.\"\n8. **BIOS updates:** If you're using an older BIOS version, it might be causing compatibility issues. Check with your motherboard manufacturer for BIOS updates and follow their instructions to update.\n9. **RAM issues:** Although you've replaced your keyboard and mouse, it's still possible that there's an issue with your RAM. Run a memory stress test like MemTest86+ to identify any faulty RAM modules.\n\nBefore we proceed, I'd like to ask a few more questions:\n\n* What's your desktop computer's specifications (CPU, RAM, Storage, Operating System)?\n* Are you using any resource-intensive programs like video editing software, games, or virtual machines?\n* Have you noticed any other symptoms like slow performance, crashes, or error messages?\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions, and we can further troubleshoot the issue.",
