  "content": "Sure! Proton therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses proton beams to destroy cancer cells. Unlike conventional radiation therapy, which uses X-rays, proton therapy delivers high-energy protons that can be more precisely targeted to the cancerous tissue while sparing surrounding healthy tissue.\n\nCERN's technology is used to generate these proton beams. The protons are accelerated to very high speeds using a particle accelerator and then guided by magnetic fields towards the patient's tumor. The energy of the proton beam can be adjusted to deposit most of its dose within the tumor tissue while minimizing radiation to healthy organs and tissues.\n\nCERN's Proton Synchrotron (PS) accelerator, built in the 1950s, was actually the world's first dedicated proton accelerator! Since then, CERN has continued to develop and improve its proton accelerator technology, which is now used in medical centers around the world for proton therapy.\n\nIn addition to providing proton therapy technology, CERN also collaborates with medical physicists and physicians to develop and refine proton therapy treatment techniques, as well as conduct research to better understand the biological effects of proton radiation on cancer cells.",
