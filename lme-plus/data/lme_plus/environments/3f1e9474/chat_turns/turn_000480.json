  "content": "Mitsubishi has not announced any plans to expand their electric vehicle lineup recently. However, they have a strong history of developing electric vehicles, starting with the introduction of the i-MiEV in 2009. Mitsubishi has also recently released the Outlander PHEV, a plug-in hybrid version of the popular Outlander SUV.\n\nIn 2019, there were some reports that Mitsubishi was considering investing in the development of all-electric SUVs by partnering with Nissan and Renault. However, it's unclear whether these plans have been put on hold due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOverall, it's possible that Mitsubishi will continue to expand its electric vehicle lineup in the future, given the growing demand for environmentally friendly vehicles and the company's past experience in this area.",
