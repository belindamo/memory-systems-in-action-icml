  "content": "I've been having some trouble with my daily commute lately. I've been taking the bus instead of driving to work, which has been saving me around 30-40 minutes each way. I've been using this time to listen to audiobooks or podcasts, which has been great for my mental health and productivity. However, I did have a bit of a setback last Thursday when the bus broke down, causing me to be late for a meeting. I ended up having to take an Uber, which set me back around $15. Can you suggest some ways to make my daily commute more reliable and efficient?",
