  "content": "The ASOS purchase on March 3rd was actually a planned purchase. I had been eyeing a specific pair of jeans for a while, and ASOS had a sale on denim during that time. I had been waiting for the sale to happen, and when it did, I pulled the trigger. I'd say it was a semi-planned purchase, as I knew I wanted the jeans, but I didn't know exactly when I'd buy them until the sale came up.\n\nAs for being mindful of my spending, I don't have a super strict budget, but I do try to keep an eye on my expenses. I've been trying to cut back on subscription services, like streaming platforms and music apps. I realized I was paying for a few services I didn't use regularly, so I've been canceling them one by one.\n\nI've also been trying to reduce my spending on eating out and takeout. I've been cooking more at home and meal prepping on the weekends. It's been helping me save money and eat healthier, which is a win-win!\n\nOne area where I do struggle is with impulse buys, especially when it comes to tech gadgets or accessories. I love staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends, and sometimes I get caught up in the excitement of a new release. That's where I need to work on being more mindful and asking myself if I really need something before making a purchase.\n\nHow about you? Do you have any tips for staying on top of spending habits or avoiding impulse buys?",
