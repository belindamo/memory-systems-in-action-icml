  "content": "I'm creating a product photography business. Which categories do companies want to have their products put in? For example, white background is one. People also like outdoor lifestyle photography for certain gear. Countertop in a cozy kitchen is useful for kitchen gadgets, etc. Please name 20 categories in a list. Do not name the product category themselves but the photography setting. For example, instead of naming toys, you might name a family room, a play table, kids playing with the toy etc.",
