  "content": "I'm considering a career in the non-profit sector because I want to make a positive impact on people's lives. I've also been thinking about my childhood and how my parents' beliefs have influenced me. My parents are both atheists, and they instilled in me a sense of skepticism and critical thinking. However, as I've grown older, I've begun to question whether there's more to life than just science and reason. I've been wanting to explore spirituality and mysticism more, but it's hard to shake off the doubts that have been ingrained in me since childhood. Do you think this could affect my ability to work in the non-profit sector, especially if I'm working with organizations that have religious affiliations?",
