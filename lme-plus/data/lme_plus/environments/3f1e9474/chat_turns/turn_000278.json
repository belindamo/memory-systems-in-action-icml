  "content": "I like some of the theme and decoration ideas you suggested. I was thinking of having a mix of old and new games at the party, so a \"Game Night\" theme might work well. I also like the idea of having different gaming stations set up around the party area. For food and drinks, I was thinking of having a \"Snack Attack\" station with a variety of snacks, and maybe some specialty drinks like a \"Game Changer\" cocktail. Do you have any ideas for party favors or giveaways that would fit well with a board game theme?",
