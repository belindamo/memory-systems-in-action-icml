You mentioned making a purchase on March 3rd from ASOS. Can you tell me more about that purchase? What did you buy, and was it something you had been planning to get or an impulse buy?\n\nAlso, you mentioned trying to be mindful of your spending. Have you set a budget for yourself, or are there any specific categories where you're trying to cut back on spending?",
