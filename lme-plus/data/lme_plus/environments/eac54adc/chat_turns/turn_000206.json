If you prefer to borrow from libraries or buy from other sources, a non-Amazon e-reader might be a better fit.\n2. **Format compatibility**: If you want to read EPUB files, choose a non-Amazon e-reader. If you're invested in the Amazon ecosystem, a Kindle with MOBI/AZW support might be the way to go.\n3. **Storage capacity**: Consider how many books you want to carry at once and choose an e-reader with sufficient storage.\n4. **Additional features**: Some e-readers offer features like built-in lights, waterproofing, or touchscreens. Think about what features matter most to you.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Check e-book prices**: Compare prices across platforms to ensure you're getting the best deal.\n2. **Explore library options**: Many libraries offer e-book lending services, which can be a cost-effective way to access books.\n3. **Convert formats**: If you need to convert e-book formats, tools like Calibre can help.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider your reading habits, budget, and the features that matter most to you.
