He decides to speak up, breaking the silence.\n\n\"Hey, Dad,\" Tommy begins, \"Can I ask you something?\"\n\nDavid looks over at him, his expression softening. \"Of course, Tommy. Anything.\"\n\n\"I just want to know,\" Tommy hesitates for a moment, \"what it was like for you when you were growing up. Like, what were some of the things that were hard for you?\"\n\nDavid's eyes widen in surprise, but then he nods slowly. \"I understand. It's important for you to know.\"\n\nHe takes a deep breath and begins to speak, his voice quiet and measured. \"When I was a kid, my dad was always angry. He would hit us and scream at us for the smallest things. I was always scared, and I never knew what would set him off.\"\n\nTommy listens intently, his heart aching for his father. \"I'm so sorry, Dad,\" he says softly.\n\nDavid shakes his head. \"It's not your fault, Tommy. But it's affected me for a long time. I never felt safe or secure. And even now, as an adult, I still struggle with feeling like I'm not good enough, like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.\"\n\nTommy nods, understanding all too well. \"I get it, Dad. I really do. I feel like that too, a lot of the time.\"\n\nDavid looks at him, his eyes full of compassion. \"I know, son. And that's why I'm so proud of you. You're so brave, and you're not afraid to stand up for what's right. You're going to do great things.\"\n\nTommy feels a lump form in his throat, and he looks away for a moment to gather his emotions. \"Thanks, Dad. That means a lot.\"\n\nThey walk in silence for a few moments, the weight of their shared experiences hanging heavy in the air. Finally, David speaks up again.\n\n\"I just want you to know, Tommy, that I'm always here for you. No matter what happens, I'll always be on your side.\"\n\nTommy nods, feeling a deep sense of gratitude and love for his father. \"I know, Dad. And I'm here for you too.\"\n\nAs they continue walking, Tommy feels a newfound sense of closeness with his dad. He realizes that while they have both experienced their own traumas and struggles, they are not alone. And with each other's support, they can face anything that comes their way.",
