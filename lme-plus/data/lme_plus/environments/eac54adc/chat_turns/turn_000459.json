This information should be presented in a way that is accessible and understandable to them. \n\nIt is also important to acknowledge and address any underlying concerns or values that might drive their denial of climate change, like economic concerns or political ideology, and suggest solutions that align with their values.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s important for people who want to take action on climate change to engage in meaningful conversations with people who deny its existence, as this can allow them to better understand each other's perspectives and build trust.\n\nFinally, politicians need to be held accountable for their actions or inaction on climate change by citizens carrying out their democratic duties via voting, peaceful protests, or public advocacy.",
