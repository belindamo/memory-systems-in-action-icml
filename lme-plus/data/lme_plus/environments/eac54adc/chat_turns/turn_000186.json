Plus, it's a fruit salad, so it's meant to be a refreshing and casual dish.\n\nBy mixing everything together, you'll also ensure that each bite has a good balance of sweet, tangy, and creamy elements. The honey lime dressing will tie everything together, and the Greek yogurt will add a nice cooling touch.\n\nNow that we've got the prep and assembly plan sorted, I think you're all set for a delicious and refreshing fruit salad! If you have any other questions or need any more assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope your potluck goes amazingly well, and your fruit salad is a huge hit!",
