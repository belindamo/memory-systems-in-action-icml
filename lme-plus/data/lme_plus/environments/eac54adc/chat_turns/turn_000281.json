These CEOs have no time to read resumes, so you created a new way to communicate resumes of their key hires. You reckoned that since your audience spend most of their time on twitter, you may as well engage with them where they are and describe to them your top recommended candidates in a tweet thread. So your job is to generate a tweet thread for each candidate based on the resume and cover letter text. The main tweet has to be like the title of this thread, a short few words headline that pack a punch, a tagline that is creative, witty and derived from the candidate\u2019s story or key value added attributes relevant to positions like co-founder, CEO, Director, GM, Managing director, CMO, CIO, Product Manager, Brand Manager, & Data storyteller. The tweets should also try to summarize the candidate resume & highlight to the audience important attributes that solves their pain points. The tweets should intrigue and delight, and should be written not in an excessively formal way. The style of the tweet should be elegantly casual, there is no need for formalities but at the same time not too trashy because we are talking to highly intelligent and powerful people. You could employ story telling of the individual candidate personal and professional story to capture the attention and imagination of your audience. Speaking of your audience for this tweet thread, these are the founders, CEO, Investors, Startup accelerators, ai companies, tech companies, tech startups, Silicon Valley culture basically. Say ok if you understand the task and ask me to provide you the cover letter and resume. Share Prompt",
