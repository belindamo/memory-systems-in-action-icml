  "content": "Mountain Mornings Cafe has a lovely outdoor seating area where you can enjoy your breakfast burrito and coffee before heading into the park. They have a small patio area with tables and chairs, as well as a few benches and a picnic table. It's a great spot to fuel up and get your caffeine fix before hitting the trails.\n\nThe outdoor seating area is partially shaded, so you can enjoy your breakfast in the morning sun or take a break from the heat later in the day. Plus, the views of the surrounding mountains are stunning, so you can get a sneak peek at the scenery you'll be hiking through later.\n\nKeep in mind that the outdoor seating area is limited, so if you're planning to eat there, try to arrive a bit early to grab a spot. If you're in a hurry, you can always grab your breakfast and coffee to-go and eat in your car or at a picnic table near the park entrance.\n\nNow, go fuel up and get ready for an amazing hike on the Waterfall Trail!",
