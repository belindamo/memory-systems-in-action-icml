  "content": "Happy birthday to your best friend! I'd be delighted to help you come up with some gift ideas.\n\nIt's great that you've been shopping a lot lately, but I understand how it can get overwhelming. Let's start fresh! Since you mentioned your neighbor's housewarming gift, I'll take a cue from that. You seem to have a good taste in home decor and luxury items.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your best friend? For instance:\n\n1. What are their interests or hobbies?\n2. Do they have a favorite color or style (e.g., classic, modern, bohemian)?\n3. Are they more of a practical person or someone who appreciates sentimental gifts?\n4. What's your budget for the gift?\n5. Do you want the gift to be something they can use, wear, or display?\n\nFeel free to share as much or as little as you'd like, and I'll start suggesting some gift ideas for your best friend's birthday!",
