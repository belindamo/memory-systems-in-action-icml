  "content": "Tommy listened intently as David spoke about his childhood trauma. David shared how he was unable to defend himself from the bullies and how it made him feel helpless and powerless. \"I didn't know what to do,\" David said. \"I just froze. It was like I was stuck in this nightmare and couldn't escape.\"\n\nTommy nodded, understanding all too well the feeling of helplessness in the face of bullying. \"I'm sorry, Dad,\" he said. \"I had no idea.\"\n\nDavid smiled weakly. \"It's okay, son. It's not your fault. I just never knew how to talk about it before.\"\n\nThey continued walking, and David shared more about his struggles with PTSD and how it had affected him throughout his life. Tommy listened with empathy and understanding, feeling a newfound appreciation for his dad's strength in the face of such adversity.\n\n\"I never knew,\" Tommy said quietly. \"I had no idea what you went through.\"\n\nDavid looked at his son and smiled. \"I know, son. I didn't want to burden you with it. But I'm glad we can talk about it now.\"\n\nAs they walked, Tommy and David talked about the importance of seeking help and not being ashamed to talk about their struggles. They both knew that they still had a lot of healing to do, but they also knew that they could face it together.\n\n\"I'm proud of you, Dad,\" Tommy said, placing a hand on his father's shoulder.\n\nDavid smiled. \"I'm proud of you too, son. You're stronger than you know.\"\n\nThey continued walking, sharing stories and talking about their shared experiences. Tommy felt a sense of closeness with his dad that he had never felt before. He knew that they had a long road ahead of them, but he also knew that they were going to face it together.",
