A book club meeting is a fantastic way to meet like-minded individuals, and it's awesome that you connected with Alex over your shared interest in sci-fi.\n\nAs for making a good impression on a first date, here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. **Be yourself**: Authenticity is key on a first date. Don't try to be someone you're not or pretend to have interests you don't really have.\n2. **Dress appropriately**: Make an effort to dress well, but also be mindful of the date's style and location. You want to make a good impression, but you also want to be comfortable.\n3. **Be respectful and courteous**: Open doors, offer your seat, and use good manners. These small gestures can go a long way in showing your date that you're considerate and respectful.\n4. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to what your date is saying and show genuine interest in their thoughts and experiences. Ask follow-up questions and engage in meaningful conversations.\n5. **Keep the conversation balanced**: Make sure the conversation isn't one-sided. Share your own experiences and thoughts, but also let your date share theirs.\n6. **Avoid controversial topics**: Steer clear of sensitive or controversial topics like politics, religion, or ex-partners. You want to keep the conversation light and enjoyable.\n7. **Be punctual and plan ahead**: Show up on time, and have a plan in place for the date. This will demonstrate that you're responsible and considerate of your date's time.\n8. **Be open-minded**: Don't go into the date with preconceived notions or expectations. Be open to getting to know Alex and having a good time, regardless of whether it's a romantic connection or not.\n9. **Keep it light and fun**: A first date should be enjoyable and light-hearted. Don't put too much pressure on the date, and try to have fun with it.\n10. **Follow up**: After the date, send a thank-you note or text to show your appreciation for the time spent together. This will also give you an opportunity to gauge the other person's interest in a second date.\n\nRemember, the goal of a first date is to have fun, get to know each other, and see if there's a connection. Don't stress too much about making a perfect impression, and focus on enjoying the experience.\n\nGood luck on your date with Alex, and I hope you have a fantastic time discussing your shared love of sci-fi!",
