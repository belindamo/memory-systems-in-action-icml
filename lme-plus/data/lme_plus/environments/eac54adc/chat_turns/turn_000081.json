  "content": "Bombay Sapphire is a great choice for a Negroni, and the orange twist is a classic garnish that pairs well with the citrus notes in the gin.\n\nWith Bombay Sapphire, you're getting a more botanical-forward gin with a slightly sweeter and more citrusy flavor profile compared to other gins. This might be contributing to the bitterness you're experiencing, as the juniper and other botanicals can amplify the bitter flavors of the Campari.\n\nGiven your ingredients, here are a few adjustments you could try:\n\n1. **Reduce the Campari**: Try using 1/4 oz or 1/3 oz Campari instead of 1/2 oz. This will help balance the bitterness and let the gin and sweet vermouth shine through.\n2. **Add a touch more sweet vermouth**: Increase the sweet vermouth to 3/4 oz or even 1 oz to balance out the bitterness. This will add more sweetness and depth to the cocktail.\n3. **Experiment with a different sweet vermouth**: Bombay Sapphire pairs well with a more citrusy sweet vermouth. You could try using a sweet vermouth like Carpano Antica or Dolin, which have a more orange-forward flavor profile.\n4. **Add a dash of citrus bitters**: A small amount of citrus bitters (about 2-3 dashes) can help balance the flavors and add a bit more citrus brightness to the cocktail.\n5. **Try a different orange twist**: While an orange twist is a classic garnish, you might want to experiment with a different type of citrus, like a lemon or grapefruit twist, to see if it changes the flavor profile.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions. The beauty of cocktail-making lies in experimentation and finding the perfect balance for your taste buds.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you willing to try one or two of these adjustments to see if they help balance the flavors?",
