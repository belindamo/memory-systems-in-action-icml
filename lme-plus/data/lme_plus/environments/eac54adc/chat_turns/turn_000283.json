  "content": "Coverletter:\nUnique blend of skills and expertise - seasoned marketer with data science know-how and a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies.\nCurrently doing a lot of community building activities like coyote hikers which is a hiking group that has 500+ members, coyote chess circle and group that partnered up with chess.com lately. in addition to that I\u2019ve started singularity syndicate that is also a group that meets online bi-weekly to discuss technologies that are shaping our future. In singularity syndicate events, I present few slides then open the floor for discussion with the audience. This also is going to turn into a podcast and a YouTube channel. Besides that I\u2019m about to finish my masters degree in information systems with concentration on data analytics and business intelligence, and my technical skills are ok but I\u2019m more on the project / product management or business development and marketing side, but my true value is that I understand the technology and I can speak and \u201csell\u201d technology products or be in charge of marketing for these products. I am interested in a summer internship with potential long-term employment, where I can utilize the following:\n\u2022 my 15 years of experience in marketing, leadership and business development,\n\u2022 my master's degree in information systems with concentration on data science (2023),\n\u2022 my technical skills in data analysis and visualization, and no-code web & mobile applications, \n\u2022 my fascination & knowledge in\u00a0artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies,\n\nI believe I have a story to tell, growing up in a small town in Lebanon, leaving the country amidst the 2006 war, climbing the ladder in the advertising industry in Dubai and Riyadh. Then decided to put all my savings in my family\u2019s small private school, where I moved back to the village to run it, modernize and rebranded it. I\u2019ve even demolished the existing building and created a new one, but then got severely in dept and this adventure crumbled in financial troubles that forced me to leave Lebanon back to Saudi Arabia and to work back in the digital marketing domain where I took on senior roles like Managing Director, and chief marketing officer. Then became a consultant for some companies and decided to stop all of this and move to the US. The US move was a calculated risk (hopefully :-)) where doing a masters in information systems with data analytics in concentrations seems to be the best option at the time, it captured my interest in technology with what is possible with my skillset. And here I am trying to find ways to be useful in society and to humanity and contribute to something meaningful and something that I enjoy. \u2028 I\u2019m only interested in working on things I find interesting and meaningful. I\u2019m all about impact-driven entrepreneurship. So if you are an impact-driven entrepreneur and need a co-partner for your startup, someone who knows how to scale your company and sell you product to your best customer, then I am your man. And below is the resume to back it upShare Prompt",
