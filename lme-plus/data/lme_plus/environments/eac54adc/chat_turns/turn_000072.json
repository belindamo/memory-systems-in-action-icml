  "content": "I'm interested in exploring more fantasy novels with complex world-building and intricate plots. I'm currently reading \"The Poppy War\" by R.F. Kuang, which I'm really enjoying. I also recently finished \"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August\" by Claire North, which was a really complex and thought-provoking read. It took me about six weeks to finish, and I'm still thinking about its intricate plot and themes.",
