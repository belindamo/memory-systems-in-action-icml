I'll assume the park has a mix of trails with varying difficulties. For a moderate hike, I'll suggest a few options:\n\n1. **Look for trails with elevation gains between 500-1000 feet**: This will give you a good workout without being too strenuous. You can expect some uphill climbs, but they won't be excessively steep or long.\n2. **Choose trails with scenic rewards**: Since you enjoyed the view from the top of the mountain last time, look for trails that offer similar scenic payoffs. This could be a summit, a ridgeline, or a scenic overlook.\n3. **Consider trails with water features**: If the park has streams, rivers, or waterfalls, these can make for great destinations or scenic stops along the way.\n\nSome specific questions to help me narrow down recommendations:\n\n* Do you remember the name of the trail you hiked to the top of the mountain last time? I can try to suggest alternative trails in the same area.\n* Are there any specific features you'd like to see on this hike, such as old growth forests, meadows, or unique rock formations?\n* Are you open to exploring other areas of the park, or do you want to stay close to the campsite or visitor center?\n\nLet me know, and I'll do my best to suggest a few moderate trails that fit your preferences!",
