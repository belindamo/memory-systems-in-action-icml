Here's a general outline to get you started:\n\n**Step 1: Set a date and time**\n\nYou've already decided on a Saturday afternoon in a few weeks, which is a great choice. Make sure to give your guests enough notice, so they can clear their schedules.\n\n**Step 2: Create a guest list**\n\nMake a list of all the family members you'd like to invite. Consider the following:\n\n* Immediate family: parents, siblings, spouses, children\n* Extended family: aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents\n* Close family friends: those who are like family to you\n\n**Step 3: Plan the venue**\n\nYou mentioned having the gathering at your childhood church, which is a great idea. If that doesn't work out, consider other options like:\n\n* Home: your home, a family member's home, or a large backyard\n* Park: a local park or recreation center with picnic tables and playgrounds\n* Community center: a rented space with amenities like tables, chairs, and kitchen facilities\n\n**Step 4: Send out invitations**\n\nYou can use various methods to send out invitations, depending on your family's preferences:\n\n* Paper invitations: create your own or use templates online\n* Digital invitations: use email, social media, or online invitation platforms like Evite\n* Phone calls: personally call or text close family members to invite them\n\n**Step 5: Plan activities**\n\nConsider the age range and interests of your guests when planning activities. Here are some ideas:\n\n* Outdoor games: lawn games, scavenger hunts, or a family sports tournament\n* Indoor games: board games, card games, or a family trivia contest\n* Food and drinks: potluck, BBQ, or a catered meal\n* Photo booth: set up a DIY photo booth with props and backdrops\n* Family history: share stories, look at old photos, or create a family tree\n\n**Step 6: Plan food and drinks**\n\nDecide on the type of food and drinks you'll serve, considering any dietary restrictions or preferences. You can:\n\n* Host a potluck: ask guests to bring a dish to share\n* Cater the event: hire a catering service or order food from a local restaurant\n* DIY: prepare the food and drinks yourself or with the help of family members\n\n**Step 7: Prepare for the day of the event**\n\n* Set up tables, chairs, and decorations\n* Prepare games and activities\n* Have a plan for inclement weather (if outdoors)\n* Assign tasks to family members to help with setup, cleanup, and supervision\n\nRemember to relax and enjoy the event with your family! With a little planning, you'll create a wonderful and memorable family gathering.\n\nHow's that for a starting point? Do you have any specific questions or areas you'd like more guidance on?",
