However, when it comes to asking questions like \"How many cups of coffee do you drink per day?\" or \"Do you get headaches when you don't have coffee in the morning?\", you might want to consider a few things:\n\n1. **Accuracy**: People might not accurately report their coffee consumption or symptoms. Some might underreport or overreport to seem more or less addicted than they actually are.\n2. **Subjectivity**: What constitutes a \"coffee addict\" can be subjective. One person might consider themselves an addict because they drink 2 cups a day, while another person might think they're not an addict despite drinking 5 cups.\n3. **Sensitivity**: Questions about physical symptoms like headaches might make some participants uncomfortable or anxious.\n\nInstead, you could focus on more lighthearted, humorous, and behavioral questions that still capture the essence of coffee addiction. Here are some alternative question ideas:\n\n1. **Coffee habits**: Do you always order the same coffee drink at your favorite coffee shop? Do you have a coffee ritual (e.g., every morning, before a workout, during a specific TV show)?\n2. **Coffee obsession**: Do you have a coffee-themed mug collection? Have you ever tried a new coffee shop just because of its Instagram-worthy decor?\n3. **Coffee dependence**: Do you feel more alert and focused after a cup of coffee? Do you get irritable or sluggish without your morning coffee?\n4. **Coffee quirks**: Do you have a favorite coffee creamer or sweetener? Do you always carry a coffee thermos with you?\n\nThese types of questions can help you create a more entertaining and engaging quiz that still pokes fun at coffee addiction in a lighthearted way. You can then use the results to categorize participants into funny labels like \"Coffee Connoisseur,\" \"Caffeine Crusader,\" or \"Coffee Snob.\"\n\nRemember to keep your quiz concise, visually appealing, and easy to understand. You can use a mix of multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions to keep things interesting. Good luck, and have fun creating your quiz!",
