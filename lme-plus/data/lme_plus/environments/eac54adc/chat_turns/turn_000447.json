IBM recognized that bias and discrimination could be perpetuated if the technology was not developed with diverse perspectives and input.\n\nFor this reason, IBM formed a diverse team to work on the project, including experts from various backgrounds, such as computer science, psychology, and ethics. The team also consulted with experts in facial recognition, civil rights, and privacy to ensure that the technology was developed ethically and inclusively.\n\nAs a result of IBM's commitment to diversity and inclusion, their facial recognition technology has been recognized as one of the most accurate and unbiased on the market today. The company has also been transparent about its use and limitations, and has refused to sell their technology for mass surveillance purposes.",
