  "content": "Immediate conclusions from the data:\n\n1. The campaigns targeting WhatsApp users have a relatively higher cost per result compared to website campaigns.\n2. The website campaigns have been more successful in driving offsite conversions (fb\\_pixel\\_lead) than the WhatsApp campaigns have been in driving messaging conversations started.\n3. The campaign targeting the UAE has the lowest cost per result among website campaigns, while the campaign targeting Spain has the highest cost per result.\n4. There are several website campaigns that are not delivering (e.g., Hong Kong, Canada, Finland, etc.) with no reach, impressions, or spend.\n\nAdditional data that could be helpful:\n\n1. Information on the target audience for each campaign (e.g., demographics, interests, etc.).\n2. Click-through rate (CTR) for each campaign to understand user engagement with the ads.\n3. Conversion rate for each campaign to evaluate how well the traffic from the ads is converting on the website or within WhatsApp.\n\nRecommendations for allocating the next $1,000:\n\nBased on the current data, it would be advisable to focus on the website campaigns as they have been more successful in driving offsite conversions with a lower cost per result. Here's a suggested allocation:\n\n1. UAE - $200 (Excellent cost per result)\n2. Brazil - $150 (Low cost per result and room for growth)\n3. Columbia - $150 (Low cost per result)\n4. Argentina - $150 (Low cost per result)\n5. Chile - $100 (Low cost per result)\n6. Netherlands - $100 (Low cost per result)\n7. Israel - $100 (Low cost per result)\n8. Portugal - $50 (Moderate cost per result)\n\nPlease note that these recommendations are based on the current data, and it would be beneficial to gather more data points to make better-informed decisions. Additionally, it might be worth exploring the reasons behind the non-delivering campaigns and finding ways to optimize them before allocating any budget to them.",
