  "content": "That's a great plan! I'm sure your parents will be happy to help you try to find the information you're looking for. It's always wonderful to revisit fond memories and share stories about family members who have passed on.\n\nRemember to ask follow-up questions and take notes if your parents do remember any details about the church or the funeral. Even small details, like the color of the church's doors or the type of flowers that were present, can help trigger more memories or provide clues to help you find the right church.\n\nAlso, be sure to express your gratitude to your parents for their help and for sharing their memories with you. It's a great way to bond and show appreciation for their role in your life.\n\nIf you need any more guidance or have any further questions, feel free to ask. I'll be here to help. Good luck with your conversation with your parents, and I hope you're able to find the information you're looking for!",
