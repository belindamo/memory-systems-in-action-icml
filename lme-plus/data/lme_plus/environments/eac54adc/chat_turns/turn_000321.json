  "content": "I've been experimenting with different lighting setups in my home office, and I recently moved my desk closer to the window, which has helped a lot during the day. However, in the evenings, I've been relying on a combination of my desk lamp and a floor lamp in the corner of the room. It's been working pretty well, but I'm still tweaking the setup to get it just right. Do you have any advice on choosing the right floor lamp for my office?",
