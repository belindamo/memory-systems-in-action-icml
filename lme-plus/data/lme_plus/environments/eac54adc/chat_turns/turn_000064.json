I'll write a heartfelt message inside the passport holder, something like \"Wishing you many amazing adventures and unforgettable memories!\" or \"May this passport holder take you to all the places you've always wanted to go!\". That way, every time my friend uses the passport holder, they'll be reminded of our friendship and the thought I put into the gift. Thanks for the suggestion!",
