  "content": "I'm interested in exploring more fantasy novels with complex world-building and intricate plots. I recently finished \"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August\" by Claire North, which was a really complex and thought-provoking read. It took me about six weeks to finish, and I'm still thinking about its intricate plot and themes. I'm also currently reading \"The Poppy War\" by R.F. Kuang, which I'm really enjoying. Can you recommend some books with similar themes and complexities?",
