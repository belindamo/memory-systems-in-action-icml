  "content": "I'm interested in exploring more fantasy novels with complex world-building and intricate plots. I recently finished \"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August\" by Claire North, which was a really complex and thought-provoking read. It took me about six weeks to finish, and I'm still thinking about its intricate plot and themes. In September, I joined an online book club that focuses on reading and discussing fantasy novels, and \"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August\" was our first book. It was really interesting to see how different people interpreted the story and its characters. I'm also currently reading \"The Poppy War\" by R.F. Kuang, which I'm really enjoying. Can you recommend some books with similar themes and complexities?",
