Here are some ideas to make it a more personalized gift:\n\n1. **Monogramming**: Check if Fjallraven offers monogramming services or if you can find a third-party service that can add your friend's initials to the passport holder. This will give it a touch of elegance and make it truly unique.\n2. **Personalized Note**: Include a heartfelt, handwritten note or a funny message inside the passport holder. You could write a message like, \"Happy travels, my friend!\" or \"May this passport holder take you on many amazing adventures!\"\n3. **Travel-themed Accessories**: Add a few travel-themed accessories like a set of nice notecards, a small travel-sized game, or a packet of gourmet coffee to make it a more substantial gift.\n4. **Customized Luggage Sticker**: Design a custom luggage sticker with a fun design or a inside joke that's just between the two of you. This will add a personal touch to the passport holder and make it stand out.\n5. **Travel Journal**: Include a beautiful travel journal that your friend can use to document their travels. This will encourage them to write down their experiences and reflect on their adventures.\n6. **Wine and Cheese**: Pair the passport holder with a nice bottle of wine and a gourmet cheese board.
