  "content": "Excellent choices! Pineapple and kiwi will add a lovely tropical twist to your fruit salad, and the Greek yogurt will provide a creamy and refreshing element.\n\nYou can use the Greek yogurt in a few ways:\n\n1. **Yogurt dollop**: Simply dollop a spoonful of Greek yogurt on top of the fruit salad as a garnish. This will add a burst of creaminess to each bite.\n2. **Yogurt mixture**: Mix the Greek yogurt with a bit of honey and lime juice (similar to the dressing) to create a creamy and tangy sauce. Then, pour it over the fruit salad.\n3. **Fruit and yogurt chunks**: Cut the fruit into bite-sized pieces and mix them with chunks of Greek yogurt. This will distribute the yogurt throughout the salad and create a fun texture.\n\nIf you choose to incorporate the Greek yogurt, start with a small amount (about 1/4 cup) and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess yogurt from the salad.\n\nNow, let's talk about the preparation. How do you plan to prepare your fruit? Will you slice, dice, or chop the strawberries, pineapple, and kiwi?",
