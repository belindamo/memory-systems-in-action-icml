A 1960s Omega Seamaster is a highly sought-after collector's item, and the appraisal value of $5,000 is a great starting point.\n\n**Authentication and Servicing by Omega:**\n\nGetting your Omega Seamaster serviced and authenticated by Omega themselves can significantly increase its value and desirability. Omega's official authentication and servicing can provide:\n\n1. **Verification of authenticity**: Omega will confirm that your watch is a genuine Omega Seamaster and not a counterfeit or modified piece.\n2. **Service history**: Omega will document the watch's maintenance and repair history, which can increase its value and provide a clear record for future owners.\n3. **Restoration to original condition**: Omega's skilled watchmakers can restore your watch to its original condition, which can improve its appearance and functionality.\n\nThe cost of authentication and servicing by Omega will depend on the type of service required, but it's generally around $500-$2,000.
