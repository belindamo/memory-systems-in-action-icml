  "content": "That's a great idea! Asking your parents about your great aunt's funeral is a excellent way to gather more information. Funerals often involve more formal documentation and records, which might help you track down the church's contact information.\n\nIt's possible that your parents might have:\n\n1. **Funeral program or bulletin**: They might have kept a copy of the funeral program or bulletin, which would likely include the church's name and address.\n2. **Contact information from the funeral home**: The funeral home might have provided contact information for the church, which your parents might have kept in their records.\n3. **Photos or videos**: They might have photos or videos from the funeral that show the church's exterior or interior, which could help you identify the location.\n4. **Memories or stories**: Your parents might remember conversations with your great aunt or other family members about the church, which could provide valuable clues.\n\nWhen you ask your parents about your great aunt's funeral, try to ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share as much as they can remember. For example:\n\n* \"Do you remember the church where Aunt [Name]'s funeral was held?\"\n* \"Do you have any photos or documents from the funeral that might show the church's name or address?\"\n* \"Did Aunt [Name] have a favorite priest or connection to the church that might help us find the right one?\"\n* \"Do you remember any distinctive features about the church, like a statue or a stained-glass window?\"\n\nBy asking these questions, you might be able to uncover more information that can help you find the contact information of your childhood church.\n\nRemember to be patient and respectful of your parents' memories. It's possible that they might not remember everything, but even small details can be helpful in your search.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you're able to find the information you're looking for!",
