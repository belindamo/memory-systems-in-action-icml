Here are some tips to help you achieve your goal:\n\n1. **Set specific goals**: Identify your current reading speed and set a realistic goal for improvement. For example, aim to increase your reading speed by 50-100 words per minute (wpm) while maintaining comprehension.\n2. **Practice active reading**: As you read, ask yourself questions like \"What's the main idea of this chapter?\", \"What's the author trying to say?\", or \"What new information am I learning?\" This helps you stay engaged and focused.\n3. **Improve your vocabulary**: Expand your vocabulary to recognize words quickly. Read books from different genres, and make a note of unfamiliar words. Look them up and use flashcards to reinforce your learning.\n4. **Use your peripheral vision**: Instead of focusing on individual words, take in groups of words at a time, using your peripheral vision. This will help you read more efficiently and increase your speed.\n5. **Use a pointer**: Try using a pointer, like a finger or a pen, to guide your eyes as you read. This helps you stay focused and move more quickly through the text.\n6. **Skim and scan**: Learn to skim headings, subheadings, and bullet points to quickly grasp the main ideas. Scan the text to identify key phrases and sentences that support the main ideas.\n7. **Use active reading techniques**: Techniques like SQ3R (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review) or KWL (Know, Want to know, Learned) can help you stay engaged and retain more information.\n8. **Eliminate subvocalization**: Try to avoid saying the words in your head as you read. Instead, focus on understanding the meaning of the text. This will help you read more quickly and efficiently.\n9. **Take breaks**: Break your reading into shorter sessions with breaks in between. This will help you stay focused and retain more information.\n10. **Practice with different materials**: Vary your reading materials, such as articles, blogs, and books, to improve your reading speed and comprehension across different formats.\n11. **Get comfortable**: Make sure you're reading in a comfortable position, with good lighting, and minimal distractions.\n12. **Track your progress**: Keep a reading log or use an app to track your progress, set reminders, and monitor your reading speed and comprehension.\n\nRegarding \"The Power\" by Naomi Alderman, it's great that you're finding it thought-provoking! With these tips, you can continue to make progress and enjoy the book while improving your reading speed and comprehension.\n\nRemember, the key is to practice consistently and make adjustments as needed. Be patient, and you'll see improvement over time. Good luck, and happy reading!",
