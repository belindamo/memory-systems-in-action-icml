By the way, I've been trying to be more active on the dating scene lately, and I recently attended a book club meeting at a local bookstore. I met some interesting people, including a guy named Alex who shares my love for sci-fi novels. We exchanged numbers, and I'm planning to meet up with him soon to discuss our favorite authors. Do you have any tips on how to make a good impression on a first date?",
