  "content": "Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a form of cancer treatment that involves the use of low-energy thermal neutrons to destroy cancer cells. The implementation of BNCT clinically involves the following protocols:\n\n1. Patient preparation: The patient is given a boron-containing compound that selectively accumulates in the cancer cells.\n2. Neutron exposure: The patient is then exposed to a beam of low-energy thermal neutrons. This causes the boron-10 atoms in the boron-containing compound to capture a neutron, which leads to the emission of alpha particles and lithium ions that destroy the cancer cells.\n3. Dosimetry: To ensure accurate dosing, the patient's exposure to the neutron beam and the distribution of boron within the body must be carefully measured.\n4. Quality control: Quality control procedures are in place to ensure the safe and effective delivery of the treatment. This includes regular maintenance and calibration of the neutron beam and the equipment used to deliver it.\n5. Patient monitoring: Patients undergoing BNCT are monitored throughout the treatment process to assess their response to the therapy and to identify any potential side effects.\n\nThese are the general protocols for implementing BNCT clinically, but the specifics can vary depending on the type of cancer being treated, the patient's individual health status, and the particular facility where the treatment is being administered.",
