I recently finished a fantasy novel, \"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August\" by Claire North, which was a really complex and thought-provoking read. It took me about six weeks to finish, and I'm still thinking about its intricate plot and themes. I'm interested in finding more books that challenge my mind like that one did.",
