I'm just an AI, here to help answer your questions and provide assistance.\n\nBut I'd be happy to help you with smoothie recipes! What fruits do you have leftover from your Walmart haul that you'd like to use? Are you looking for a specific type of smoothie (e.g. tropical, berry, green)? Let me know, and I can suggest some delicious combinations for you to try!",
