  "content": "Sure, I can provide some quotes from talks and interviews from a few of the notable design leaders listed in the previous tables, along with some common mantras and philosophies they share:\n\nJony Ive, former Chief Design Officer at Apple:\n\n* \"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\"\n* \"Simplicity is not the absence of clutter, that's a consequence of simplicity. Simplicity is somehow essentially describing the purpose and place of an object and product.\"\n* \"Our goal is to try to bring a calm and simplicity to what are incredibly complex problems so that you're not aware really of the solution, you're not aware of how hard the problem was that was eventually solved.\"\n\nJohn Maeda, Chief Experience Officer at Publicis Sapient:\n\n* \"Design is an expression of the purpose.\"\n* \"Design is too important to be left to designers.\"\n* \"Incorporate the unpredictability of life into your designs.\"\n\nIvy Ross, Vice President of Design for Hardware at Google:\n\n* \"Design is empathy for people within the context of business.\"\n* \"One of the greatest opportunities for innovation is when you can make something accessible and convenient for everybody.\"\n* \"At Google, we're really interested in designing for life, not just lifestyle.\"\n\nMarc Mathieu, Chief Marketing Officer at Samsung Electronics America:\n\n* \"Design is a translator. Design is a mediator.\"\n* \"We're not just designers, we're problem-solvers.\"\n* \"The way to drive innovation is through a relentless focus on people.\"\n\nNaresh Ramchandani, Partner at Pentagram:\n\n* \"Design is not just what we do, it's what we don't do.\"\n* \"Design is about not compromising on what you believe in.\"\n* \"Design is a means of bringing clarity and focus to the world.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples, but some common themes and mantras among these design leaders include: the importance of empathy and understanding people's needs, the value of simplicity and clarity, the idea that design should be driven by purpose and meaning, and the belief that design can solve complex problems and drive innovation.",
