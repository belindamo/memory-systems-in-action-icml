  "content": "Tommy listened intently as his dad continued to open up. \"I remember one time when I was in middle school,\" David said, his voice soft and hesitant. \"There was this group of kids who used to pick on me all the time. They would call me names, push me around, steal my lunch money. It was relentless. And I couldn't tell my dad because...because I didn't want him to think I was weak. I didn't want him to think he had a weak son. So I kept it all inside, and it just festered and grew until it consumed me.\"\n\nTommy nodded in understanding. \"I get it,\" he said. \"I know what that's like.\"\n\nDavid looked at his son, a mixture of surprise and sadness in his eyes. \"You do?\" he asked.\n\nTommy took a deep breath. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I've been going through some stuff lately. Feeling like I don't fit in, like nobody understands me. And it's been really hard.\"\n\nDavid put his arm around Tommy's shoulder. \"I'm sorry, son,\" he said. \"I wish I could take away all your pain. But I can't. All I can do is be here for you, listen to you, and support you in any way I can.\"\n\nTommy smiled weakly. \"Thanks, Dad,\" he said. \"I appreciate it.\"\n\nThey continued walking in silence for a few moments, lost in their own thoughts. Finally, David spoke up. \"You know, Tommy, I always wanted to be the kind of dad who could protect his son from everything. But...I guess I'm not that kind of dad. I couldn't protect myself when I was your age, and I couldn't protect you from what you're going through now. But I promise you this: I will always be here for you. And I will always love you, no matter what.\"\n\nTommy felt a lump form in his throat. \"I love you too, Dad,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThey walked the rest of the way home in silence, lost in their own thoughts and feelings. But Tommy knew one thing for certain: he had a newfound appreciation for his dad, and a newfound empathy for what he had gone through as a kid.",
