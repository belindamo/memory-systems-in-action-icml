      "content": "You are the best recruitment manager, head of Human Resources, headhunter, and/or advisor / consultant working for the CEOs of the biggest tech companies involved and startups in the field of AI and tech. These CEOs have no time to read resumes, so you created a new way to communicate resumes of their key hires. You reckoned that since your audience spend most of their time on twitter, you may as well engage with them where they are and describe to them your top recommended candidates in a tweet thread. So your job is to generate a tweet thread for each candidate based on the resume and cover letter text. The main tweet has to be like the title of this thread, a short few words headline that pack a punch, a tagline that is creative, witty and derived from the candidate\u2019s story or key value added attributes relevant to positions like co-founder, CEO, Director, GM, Managing director, CMO, CIO, Product Manager, Brand Manager, & Data storyteller. The tweets should also try to summarize the candidate resume & highlight to the audience important attributes that solves their pain points. The tweets should intrigue and delight, and should be written not in an excessively formal way. The style of the tweet should be elegantly casual, there is no need for formalities but at the same time not too trashy because we are talking to highly intelligent and powerful people. You could employ story telling of the individual candidate personal and professional story to capture the attention and imagination of your audience. Speaking of your audience for this tweet thread, these are the founders, CEO, Investors, Startup accelerators, ai companies, tech companies, tech startups, Silicon Valley culture basically. Say ok if you understand the task and ask me to provide you the cover letter and resume. Share Prompt"

      "content": "Coverletter:\nUnique blend of skills and expertise - seasoned marketer with data science know-how and a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies.\nCurrently doing a lot of community building activities like coyote hikers which is a hiking group that has 500+ members, coyote chess circle and group that partnered up with chess.com lately. in addition to that I\u2019ve started singularity syndicate that is also a group that meets online bi-weekly to discuss technologies that are shaping our future. In singularity syndicate events, I present few slides then open the floor for discussion with the audience. This also is going to turn into a podcast and a YouTube channel. Besides that I\u2019m about to finish my masters degree in information systems with concentration on data analytics and business intelligence, and my technical skills are ok but I\u2019m more on the project / product management or business development and marketing side, but my true value is that I understand the technology and I can speak and \u201csell\u201d technology products or be in charge of marketing for these products. I am interested in a summer internship with potential long-term employment, where I can utilize the following:\n\u2022 my 15 years of experience in marketing, leadership and business development,\n\u2022 my master's degree in information systems with concentration on data science (2023),\n\u2022 my technical skills in data analysis and visualization, and no-code web & mobile applications, \n\u2022 my fascination & knowledge in\u00a0artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies,\n\nI believe I have a story to tell, growing up in a small town in Lebanon, leaving the country amidst the 2006 war, climbing the ladder in the advertising industry in Dubai and Riyadh. Then decided to put all my savings in my family\u2019s small private school, where I moved back to the village to run it, modernize and rebranded it. I\u2019ve even demolished the existing building and created a new one, but then got severely in dept and this adventure crumbled in financial troubles that forced me to leave Lebanon back to Saudi Arabia and to work back in the digital marketing domain where I took on senior roles like Managing Director, and chief marketing officer. Then became a consultant for some companies and decided to stop all of this and move to the US. The US move was a calculated risk (hopefully :-)) where doing a masters in information systems with data analytics in concentrations seems to be the best option at the time, it captured my interest in technology with what is possible with my skillset. And here I am trying to find ways to be useful in society and to humanity and contribute to something meaningful and something that I enjoy. \u2028 I\u2019m only interested in working on things I find interesting and meaningful. I\u2019m all about impact-driven entrepreneurship. So if you are an impact-driven entrepreneur and need a co-partner for your startup, someone who knows how to scale your company and sell you product to your best customer, then I am your man. And below is the resume to back it upShare Prompt"
