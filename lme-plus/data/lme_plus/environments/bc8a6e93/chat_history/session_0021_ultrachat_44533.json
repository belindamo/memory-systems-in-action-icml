They can consider factors such as brightness, color temperature, and glare reduction when designing their workplace lighting. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the lighting is suitable for the type of work being performed and that it is evenly distributed throughout the workplace. Companies should also encourage employees to take regular breaks, adjust their computer screen's brightness to match the ambient lighting, and reduce glare on screens to prevent eye strain and headaches."
