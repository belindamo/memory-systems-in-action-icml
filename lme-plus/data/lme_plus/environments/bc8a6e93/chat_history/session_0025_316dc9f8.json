However, based on data from HowLongToBeat, a website that aggregates playtime data from various sources, here are some estimates:\n\n* **Main Story:** 20-25 hours - This is the estimated time it takes to complete the main story quests, focusing on the critical path and ignoring side quests and exploration.\n* **Main Story + Extras:** 30-40 hours - This estimate includes completing the main story, as well as some side quests, upgrading Aloy's skills, and exploring the world to a moderate extent.\n* **100% Completion:** 50-60 hours - To achieve 100% completion, you'll need to complete all main quests, side quests, find all collectibles, upgrade Aloy's skills, and explore every nook and cranny of the Forbidden West.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates may vary depending on your playstyle and level of dedication. If you're a completionist who wants to explore every corner of the map, you might need to add 10-20 hours to the estimates above.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the game's director, Mathijs de Jonge, mentioned in an interview that the main story is designed to be around 20-25 hours long, but players can easily spend 50-60 hours or more exploring the world and completing side quests."
