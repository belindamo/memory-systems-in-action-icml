It's a classic comfort food that pairs well with many dishes, including your shrimp stir-fry and jasmine rice.\n\n**Tips for Making Delicious Garlic Bread:**\n\n1. **Use high-quality ingredients**: Fresh garlic, good-quality bread, and real butter make a big difference in the flavor and texture of your garlic bread.\n2. **Roast your garlic**: Roasting garlic mellows out its flavor and gives it a deeper, nuttier taste. Simply slice the top off a whole head of garlic, drizzle with olive oil, and roast at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 30-40 minutes.\n3. **Use the right bread**: A crusty bread, such as baguette or ciabatta, works well for garlic bread. You can also use a rustic bread or even a garlic bread loaf.\n4. **Don't overdo the garlic**: While garlic is the star of the show, you don't want to overpower the bread. Start with a moderate amount of garlic and adjust to taste.\n5. **Add some herbs**: Mix in some chopped fresh herbs like parsley, thyme, or rosemary to add depth and freshness to your garlic bread.\n6. **Butter matters**: Use high-quality, salted butter for the best flavor. You can also mix in some grated Parmesan cheese for extra richness.\n7. **Don't overbake**: Garlic bread is best when it's lightly toasted and still slightly soft in the center. Keep an eye on it while it's baking to avoid overcooking.\n\n**Simple Garlic Bread Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 loaf of crusty bread (e.g., baguette or ciabatta)\n* 3-4 cloves of roasted garlic, minced\n* 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter, softened\n* 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Fresh herbs (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
