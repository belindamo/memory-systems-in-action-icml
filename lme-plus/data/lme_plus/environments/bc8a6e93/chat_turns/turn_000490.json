This will help them cook more evenly and prevent a soggy texture.\n\n**Tips for Cooking Shrimp:**\n\n* Cook shrimp until they're pink and opaque, about 2-3 minutes per side, depending on their size.\n* Don't overcook shrimp, as they can become tough and rubbery.\n* Use a medium-high heat to quickly sear the shrimp and lock in their juices.\n\nNow, go ahead and give that shrimp and vegetable stir-fry a try!",
