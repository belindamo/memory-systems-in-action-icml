Sai Ua - a grilled sausage made with pork, lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, and chili.\n3. Khao Soi - a northern-style noodle soup that is typically served with chicken or beef.\n4. Som Tam - a spicy papaya salad that is also popular throughout Thailand.\n5. Nam Prik Ong - a spicy tomato-based dip that is typically served with steamed vegetables.\n6. Gaeng Om - a vegetable and herb soup that is a staple dish in several hill tribe communities.\n\nDo note that the level of spiciness varies depending on the dish and the location. So, if you are sensitive to spicy food, it's worth asking the locals to make it mild for you.\n\nBe sure to try some of the local snacks and desserts too, such as Khanom Krok (coconut pancakes), Bananas wrapped in banana leaves, and Khao Lam (sticky rice cooked in bamboo).",
