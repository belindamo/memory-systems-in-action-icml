  "content": "Sure, we can include the probability of the student keeping all the bars up as well:\n\nProbability of keeping all bars up = 0.95\n\nSo, to calculate the probability of the student running the entire course without making a mistake and keeping all the bars up, we need to multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 = 0.698337203125\n\nTherefore, the chance that she runs the course without making a mistake and keeps all the bars up is approximately 69.83%.",
