  "content": "To calculate the probability that the student runs the entire course without making a mistake, we need to multiply the probabilities of her completing each obstacle without error.\n\nProbability of completing A-frame = 0.95\nProbability of completing Dogwalk = 0.95\nProbability of completing Teeter = 0.95\nProbability of completing Weaves = 0.95\nProbability of completing first Backside = 0.95\nProbability of completing second Backside = 0.95\n\nTo find the probability of all these events happening together, we multiply the probabilities together:\n\n0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 = 0.735091875\n\nTherefore, the chance that she runs the course without making a mistake is approximately 73.51%.",
