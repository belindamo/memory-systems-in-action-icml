  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I've actually had a lot of success with lemon-based desserts in the past - I recently made a lemon blueberry cake for my niece's birthday party and it was a huge hit. I was a bit nervous about how it would turn out, but the combination of the tangy lemon and sweet blueberries was perfect. Do you have any tips on how to get the perfect balance of flavors in a lemon dessert?",
