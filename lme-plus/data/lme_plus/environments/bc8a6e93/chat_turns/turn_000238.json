  "content": "Yes, companies can also address the importance of proper lighting in their wellness programs to prevent eye strain and headaches. Poor lighting can cause eye strain, fatigue, headaches, and affect employee productivity. On the other hand, good lighting can improve mood, reduce fatigue, and promote alertness.\n\nTherefore, companies should provide adequate lighting to promote a healthy and productive work environment. They can consider factors such as brightness, color temperature, and glare reduction when designing their workplace lighting. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the lighting is suitable for the type of work being performed and that it is evenly distributed throughout the workplace.
