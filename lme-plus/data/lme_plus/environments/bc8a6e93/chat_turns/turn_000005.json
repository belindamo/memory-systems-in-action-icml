Deep cleaning can be a challenge, but it's worth it to keep your bathroom sparkling and hygienic.\n\nNow, about that toilet brush... You're right to replace it regularly, as it can harbor bacteria and odors. Three weeks is a good interval, but it's generally recommended to replace toilet brushes every 1-2 months, depending on usage.\n\nHere are some tips for choosing a good toilet brush:\n\n1. **Look for sturdy construction**: A durable toilet brush with a sturdy handle and robust bristles will make cleaning easier and more effective.\n2. **Choose the right bristle type**: You can opt for a toilet brush with:\n\t* **Nylon bristles**: Good for general cleaning, gentle on toilet surfaces, and easy to clean.\n\t* **Scouring bristles**: Better for tackling tough stains and mineral deposits, but may scratch some toilet surfaces.\n3. **Consider a toilet brush with antimicrobial properties**: Some toilet brushes have antimicrobial materials that help reduce bacterial growth.\n4. **Check the head size and shape**: A larger head can cover more surface area, but may be harder to maneuver in tight spaces. A smaller head might be better for compact toilets.\n5. **Think about the handle material**: A comfortable, non-slip handle can make cleaning easier and more comfortable.\n\nSome popular toilet brush brands include:\n\n* Clorox\n* OXO\n* Scotch-Brite\n* Mr. Clean\n* Lysol\n\nWhen selecting a toilet brush, read reviews and consider your personal preferences, toilet type, and cleaning needs.\n\nRemember to always rinse your toilet brush thoroughly after cleaning and store it in a well-ventilated area to prevent bacterial growth.",
