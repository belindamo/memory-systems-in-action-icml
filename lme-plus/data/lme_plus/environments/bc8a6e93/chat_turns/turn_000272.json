It's always nice to visit friends and explore new cities, even if it's just a short trip.\n\nGlad to hear that you were able to get a seat with extra legroom, which made the flight more comfortable for you. Those little perks can make a big difference, especially on shorter flights.\n\nBy the way, how was your experience with American Airlines? Were there any notable pros or cons during your flight?",
