Turmeric: Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties that may help alleviate fibroid pain. 4. Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3s, found in fatty fish, flaxseed, and chia seeds, have anti-inflammatory properties that may help manage fibroid symptoms. 5. Green tea: Green tea contains compounds called catechins, which may help shrink fibroids and reduce heavy bleeding. 6. Iron supplements: If fibroids are causing heavy bleeding and anemia, iron supplements may be helpful in maintaining healthy iron levels. It's important to note that natural remedies and supplements should not replace medical treatment for fibroids.
