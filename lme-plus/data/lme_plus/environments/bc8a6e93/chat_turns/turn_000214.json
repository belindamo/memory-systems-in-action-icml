  "content": "I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, I did not find any information on a company called \"Hart Vision\". However, based on your recent message, it appears that you were referring to Hart Vision Medical, a company that provides medical equipment and supplies.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff date, I did not find any specific information on whether Hart Vision Medical sells bed rails. However, they do offer a variety of other medical equipment and supplies, including mobility aids, home medical equipment, and respiratory equipment. It is possible that they may also offer bed rails, but it is recommended to check their website or contact them directly for more information.",
