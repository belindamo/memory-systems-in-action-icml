  "content": "If we assume that each run is independent (i.e., the outcome of one run does not affect the outcome of the other runs), we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of making at least one mistake in 4 consecutive runs.\n\nThe probability of making at least one mistake in one run is 0.264908125 (from the previous calculation). Therefore, the probability of not making a mistake in one run is 1 - 0.264908125 = 0.735091875.\n\nLet X be the number of runs in which the student makes at least one mistake in 4 consecutive runs. Then X follows a binomial distribution with n = 4 and p = 0.264908125.\n\nThe probability mass function of X is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (4 choose k) \\* p^k \\* (1-p)^(n-k), for k = 0,1,2,3,4\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probability of making at least one mistake in 4 consecutive runs:\n\nP(X >= 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n= 1 - (4 choose 0) \\* (0.264908125)^0 \\* (0.735091875)^(4-0)\n= 0.7383018669230469\n\nTherefore, the chance that the student makes at least one mistake in 4 consecutive runs is approximately 73.83%.",
