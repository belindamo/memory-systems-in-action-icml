However, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to the schedules of specific recreation centers or gyms. But I can suggest a few ways for you to find out what classes are available on Wednesdays and Thursdays:\n\n1. **Check the recreation center's website**: You can visit the recreation center's website and look for their group fitness schedule or class timetable. They might have a section for Wednesday and Thursday classes.\n2. **Use their mobile app**: If the recreation center has a mobile app, you can download it and check the class schedule from your phone.\n3. **Call or visit the recreation center**: You can give the recreation center a call or stop by in person to ask about their Wednesday and Thursday class schedules. They'll be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information.\n4. **Check social media**: Sometimes, recreation centers will post their class schedules or updates on their social media pages, such as Facebook or Instagram.\n\nRemember to check the schedule in advance to ensure that the class you're interested in is available and to reserve a spot if necessary.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a great time trying out a new class!",
