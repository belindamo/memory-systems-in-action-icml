  "content": "Lysol wipes are a popular choice for cleaning and disinfecting, but it's essential to use them correctly and on the right surfaces.\n\nLysol wipes are generally safe to use on:\n\n* Toilet seats, handles, and surrounding areas\n* Sinks (but check the type of sink material first, see below)\n* Toilet paper holders\n* Door handles\n* Light switches\n* Remote controls\n\nHowever, you should exercise caution when using Lysol wipes on certain surfaces:\n\n* **Natural stone countertops**: Lysol wipes can etch or damage natural stone surfaces like marble, granite, or travertine. Instead, use a gentle, stone-specific cleaner.\n* **Wooden or laminate countertops**: Lysol wipes can damage the finish or wood surface. Use a gentle, wood-specific cleaner or a diluted mixture of soap and water.\n* **Unsealed or waxed surfaces**: Lysol wipes can strip away the wax or sealant, damaging the surface. Use a gentle, surface-specific cleaner.\n* **Electronic screens**: Lysol wipes can damage screens or leave streaks. Use a microfiber cloth and a gentle screen cleaner instead.\n* **Fabric or upholstery**: Lysol wipes can damage or discolor certain fabrics. Use a gentle, fabric-specific cleaner.\n\nIf you're unsure about the safety of using Lysol wipes on a particular surface, it's always best to:\n\n1. Check the manufacturer's instructions or website for guidance.\n2. Perform a small, inconspicuous test patch to ensure the product doesn't damage the surface.\n3. Consider alternative, gentle cleaning products specifically designed for the surface in question.\n\nRemember to always follow the instructions on the Lysol wipes label, and use them in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling the fumes.",
