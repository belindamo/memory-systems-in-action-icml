Buy in bulk: Purchasing staple ingredients such as rice, beans, and oats in bulk can save you money in the long run. 4. Focus on plant-based ingredients: Plant-based ingredients such as beans, lentils, and tofu can be cheaper than meat alternatives while also being full of protein and nutrients. 5. Use simple cooking techniques: Cooking techniques such as saut\u00e9ing, roasting, and steaming are simple and inexpensive ways to prepare meals. 6. Purchase generic brands: Generic brands of food can be just as nutritious as name-brand equivalents, and can save you money. 7. Don't waste food: Leftovers can be made into a new meal, such as turning roasted vegetables into a soup. Hope these tips help you create more healthy and budget-friendly meals!",
