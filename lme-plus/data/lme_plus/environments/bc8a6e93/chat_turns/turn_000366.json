The RSPB recognizes their importance and works to protect them in several ways, including:\n\n1. Insect-friendly habitats: The RSPB creates and manages habitats that support a wide range of insect species. This includes wildflower meadows, hedgerows, and other areas that provide food and shelter for insects.\n\n2. Protecting rare and threatened insect species: The RSPB monitors and protects rare and threatened insect species, such as the large blue butterfly, by creating and managing habitats and raising awareness about their status.\n\n3.
