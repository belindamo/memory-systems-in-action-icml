However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or local knowledge, so I don't have specific recommendations for kid-friendly local contractors in your area.\n\nBut don't worry, I can suggest a few ways to find reliable and trustworthy contractors in your area:\n\n1. **Ask around**: Ask friends, family, neighbors, or coworkers who have young children for recommendations. They might have had a good experience with a contractor in the past.\n2. **Online reviews**: Check online review platforms like Yelp, Angie's List, or Google Reviews to find contractors with good ratings and reviews in your area.\n3. **Local hardware stores**: Visit local hardware stores or home improvement centers and ask for recommendations. They might have a list of trusted contractors they work with.\n4. **Professional associations**: Look for contractors who are members of professional associations like the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI) or the National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA).\n5. **Check licenses and certifications**: Make sure the contractor is properly licensed, insured, and certified to work in your state and on the type of project you need help with.\n\nWhen you find a potential contractor, don't hesitate to ask questions like:\n\n* Can you provide references from previous clients with similar projects?\n* Do you have experience working with children's play equipment?\n* What's your process for ensuring safety during assembly and installation?\n* Can you provide a detailed estimate and timeline for the project?\n* Do you offer any warranties or guarantees for your work?\n\nBy doing your research and asking the right questions, you can find a reliable and trustworthy contractor to help you with the assembly and installation of your playhouse and swing set.",
