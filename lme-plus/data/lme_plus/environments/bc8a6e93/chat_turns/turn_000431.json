To calculate the conversion rate, you'll need to track the number of conversions and the number of leads generated.\n\nLet's say you generated 50 leads from your Facebook ad campaign, and 10 of those leads converted into customers (e.g., made a purchase). To calculate the conversion rate:\n\n1. Number of conversions: 10\n2. Number of leads: 50\n3. Conversion rate = (Number of conversions \u00f7 Number of leads) \u00d7 100\n= (10 \u00f7 50) \u00d7 100\n= 20%\n\nThis means 20% of the leads generated from your ad campaign converted into customers.\n\n**Focus on Increasing Followers or Generating Leads?**\n\nBoth increasing followers and generating leads are important, but they serve different purposes in your overall marketing strategy.\n\n**Increasing Followers:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Increased brand awareness and visibility\n\t+ Potential for organic reach and engagement\n\t+ Can lead to more website traffic and potential leads\n* Cons:\n\t+ Followers may not necessarily translate to conversions\n\t+ Follower growth can be slow and may not directly impact revenue\n\n**Generating Leads:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Directly impacts revenue and conversions\n\t+ Allows for targeted follow-up and nurturing\n\t+ Can provide valuable data for retargeting and optimization\n* Cons:\n\t+ May not necessarily increase brand awareness or followers\n\t+ Can be more costly than follower growth\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide where to focus:\n\n1. Are you looking to build brand awareness and establish a presence on social media? If so, focusing on increasing followers might be a good starting point.\n2. Are you looking to drive revenue and conversions? If so, generating leads should be your primary focus.\n3. Do you have a sales funnel in place to nurture and convert leads? If not, you may want to focus on building a lead generation strategy first.\n\nIn your case, since you've already generated 50 leads and seen an increase in followers, you might consider focusing on:\n\n1. Optimizing your lead generation campaigns to increase conversions and revenue.\n2. Nurturing your existing leads through email marketing, retargeting, or other tactics to increase conversions.\n3. Using your existing followers to amplify your brand message and drive more leads through user-generated content, social proof, or influencer partnerships.\n\nBy focusing on lead generation and conversion optimization, you can create a more sustainable and revenue-driven social media strategy. However, don't neglect your follower growth entirely, as it can still provide long-term benefits and support your overall marketing efforts.",
