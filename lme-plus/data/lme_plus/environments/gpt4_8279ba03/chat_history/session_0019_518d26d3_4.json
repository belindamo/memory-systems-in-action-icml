By the way, I've been wearing my new black leather boots a lot lately, I got them on February 10th and I've worn them five times since then, including to my friend's birthday party on the 14th. I also wore them to work on the 17th and 22nd, and to a casual dinner with my family on the 25th. Maybe I can wear them with the new sneakers once I get them."
