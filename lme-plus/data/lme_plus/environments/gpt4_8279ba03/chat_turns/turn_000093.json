  "content": "I think these suggestions are really helpful in addressing the concern of being seen as a \"marketing person\" trying to cash in on the wellness trend. I like the idea of sharing my personal story and passion for wellness, and focusing on the \"why\" behind my work. I also appreciate the suggestion to highlight my expertise through research, interviews, and case studies.\n\nOne thing that I'm still wondering about is how to balance being authentic and transparent about my journey with the need to present myself as a credible and knowledgeable wellness professional. I don't want to come across as inexperienced or unqualified, but at the same time, I want to be honest about my background and the fact that I'm still learning and growing.\n\nDo you have any advice on how to strike a balance between authenticity and professionalism in my online presence and marketing efforts?",
