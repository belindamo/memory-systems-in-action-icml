But I can offer some general guidance on how to compare prices on Travelocity, Expedia, and Booking.com.\n\n**Comparing Flight Prices:**\n\n1. **Use a meta-search engine:** Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak allow you to compare prices across multiple airlines, online travel agencies (OTAs), and meta-search engines.\n2. **Set up price alerts:** Many airlines and OTAs offer price alerts, which can notify you when prices drop or reach a certain threshold.\n3. **Be flexible with dates:** Prices can vary greatly depending on the day of the week and time of year. Consider flying on off-peak days or during the off-season.\n4. **Consider alternative airports:** If you have multiple airport options, check prices for each airport to find the best deal.\n\n**Comparing Hotel Prices:**\n\n1. **Use a hotel search engine:** Websites like Trivago or HotelsCombined allow you to compare prices across multiple booking sites.\n2. **Check the hotel's website:** Sometimes, hotels offer exclusive deals or discounts on their official website.\n3. **Look for package deals:** Booking a flight and hotel together as a package can sometimes be cheaper than booking them separately.\n4. **Read reviews and check the hotel's policy:** Make sure to read reviews from multiple sources and check the hotel's cancellation and refund policies before making a booking.\n\n**Travelocity, Expedia, and Booking.com:**\n\n1. **Travelocity:** Travelocity is an OTA that offers a \"Price Match Guarantee\" and a rewards program.\n2. **Expedia:** Expedia is another OTA that offers a \"Best Price Guarantee\" and a rewards program. They also have a \"Bundle and Save\" feature that can help you save money by booking flights and hotels together.\n3. **Booking.com:** Booking.com is a hotel booking platform that offers a \"Price Match Guarantee\" and a rewards program. They also have a \"Genius\" program that offers exclusive discounts and perks.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Clear your cookies:** Some booking sites use cookies to track your searches and may increase prices if they see you're interested in a particular route or hotel. Clearing your cookies can help you avoid this price increase.\n2. **Use incognito mode:** Browsing in incognito mode can also help you avoid price increases.\n3. **Book in advance:** Generally, the earlier you book, the better the prices.\n4. **Read the fine print:** Make sure to read the terms and conditions, including any fees or restrictions, before making a booking.\n\nI hope this helps! Remember to always research and compare prices carefully to find the best deals for your trip.",
