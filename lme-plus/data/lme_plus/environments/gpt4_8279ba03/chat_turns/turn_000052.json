  "content": "Roasted vegetable quinoa bowls are incredibly versatile, and you can definitely experiment with different vegetables to find your favorite combinations. Here are some tips to help you substitute or add other vegetables to the recipe:\n\n**Vegetable Options:**\n\n* **Root vegetables:** Beets, carrots, parsnips, and turnips roast beautifully and add a sweet, earthy flavor to the dish.\n* **Cruciferous vegetables:** Broccoli, kale, and cabbage can be used in place of Brussels sprouts. They'll add a similar crunch and bitterness to balance out the sweetness of the other vegetables.\n* **Winter squash:** Butternut squash, acorn squash, or delicata squash can replace sweet potatoes for a similar sweetness and creamy texture.\n* **Mushrooms:** Add some cremini, shiitake, or portobello mushrooms to the mix for an earthy flavor and meaty texture.\n* **Other options:** Asparagus, bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant can also be added to the roasting pan for a colorful and flavorful bowl.\n\n**Tips for Roasting:**\n\n* **Cutting:** Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces, so they roast evenly. You may need to adjust the cooking time based on the size and density of the vegetables.\n* **Timing:** Roasting times will vary depending on the vegetables you choose. Harder vegetables like beets and sweet potatoes may take 30-40 minutes, while softer vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower may be done in 20-25 minutes.\n* **Temperature:** Keep the oven temperature at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for most vegetables. If you're using delicate vegetables like asparagus or bell peppers, you may want to reduce the temperature to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) to prevent burning.\n* **Seasoning:** Don't be afraid to add different herbs and spices to the vegetables during the roasting process. Some options include paprika, garlic powder, dried thyme, or lemon zest.\n\n**Quinoa and Assembly:**\n\n* **Cook quinoa according to package instructions:** Use a 2:1 ratio of water to quinoa and cook until fluffy and tender.\n* **Assemble the bowl:** Once the quinoa is cooked and the vegetables are roasted, assemble the bowl by placing a scoop of quinoa at the bottom, followed by your chosen roasted vegetables, and finishing with a dollop of cashew sour cream (if using).\n\nFeel free to get creative and experiment with different vegetable combinations to find your favorite!",
