  "content": "Some of the main crops grown in Herefordshire include:\n\n1. Apples: Herefordshire is known as the cider capital of England and has a long history of apple production. There are over 10,000 hectares of orchards in the county.\n\n2. Soft fruits: Strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are all grown in Herefordshire and are used in the manufacture of jams, jellies, and other preserves.\n\n3. Beef: Herefordshire is also known for its beef production. The county has a long tradition of rearing Hereford cattle, which are prized for their meat.\n\n4. Wheat: Wheat is also grown in Herefordshire, although it is not as prevalent as other crops. In the past, wheat was grown more extensively in the county than it is today.\n\n5. Potatoes: Potatoes are also grown in Herefordshire, primarily for use as chips or in other processed foods.\n\nOver time, the types of crops grown in Herefordshire have shifted. For example, during the medieval period, barley was the primary crop grown. In the 18th and 19th centuries, hop production became more prevalent, with Herefordshire becoming one of the country's main hop-growing regions. The popularity of hops declined in the 20th century, and farmers shifted to apple and soft fruit production. Today, beef and apple production remain the county's most important agricultural activities.",
