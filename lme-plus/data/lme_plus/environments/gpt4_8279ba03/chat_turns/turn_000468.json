  "content": "I'm glad you're excited to try out the recipe! Using mozzarella as a substitute for burrata is a great idea, and it's a good choice since you're familiar with its texture and flavor. \n\nAs for store-bought mozzarella brands, I've listed a few popular options. You can't go wrong with BelGioioso, Polly-O, Galbani, Sorrento, or the Fresh Mozzarella Company. Look for a product that's made with high-quality milk and has a good texture and flavor. \n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
