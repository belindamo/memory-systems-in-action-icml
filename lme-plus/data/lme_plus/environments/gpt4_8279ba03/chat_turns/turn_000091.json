I think I'll start by highlighting my transferable skills from marketing, such as communication and project management, and then pursue certifications or training in wellness coaching. I also like the idea of building a strong online presence through a website and social media, and sharing valuable content to demonstrate my expertise. \n\nOne thing that's still concerning me is how to overcome the perception that I'm just a \"marketing person\" trying to cash in on the wellness trend. I want to make sure that I'm seen as a genuine and knowledgeable wellness professional, not just someone who's trying to make a quick buck. Do you have any suggestions for how to address this concern?",
