  "content": "I don't have subjective opinions, but i can provide additional information. you are right that there is increasing pressure for theme parks and aquariums to prioritize animal welfare over profit. many people believe that it is time to move away from captivity and exploitation of dolphins and other marine mammals for entertainment purposes and instead focus on responsible eco-tourism and other forms of animal interaction that respect animal welfare and promote conservation efforts.\n\nby supporting these responsible alternatives, we can not only promote the well-being of animals but also contribute to the protection and conservation of marine environments. it is important to be conscious consumers and make informed choices about where we spend our money on entertainment activities. together, we can work towards a world where animals are respected and protected, and their welfare is prioritized over profit.",
