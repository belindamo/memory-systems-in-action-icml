However, it's important to recognize that theological differences can be deeply personal, and compromise is not always possible when it comes to matters of faith. \n\nFor example, some members of the United Methodist Church firmly believe that LGBTQ+ individuals should be allowed to marry and serve as clergy, while others believe that these practices conflict with their understanding of scripture and the teachings of their faith. These differences are not just abstract beliefs, but are intertwined with their identities and personal convictions. \n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the United Methodist Church is a global denomination, with members and congregations spanning many different regions and cultures. Different regions may have varying beliefs and practices, making it difficult to find a one-size-fits-all compromise.\n\nWhile it's true that societal divisions and a lack of empathy can exacerbate theological differences, it's important to recognize that these schisms are the result of deeply held and widely varying beliefs, rather than a failure to compromise or empathize.",
