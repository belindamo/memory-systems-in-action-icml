  "content": "So I should expect to pay around $6,000 to $12,000 in closing costs and fees for a $200,000 apartment. That's a significant amount, but I'll make sure to factor it into my budget. Since I'll be putting 20% down, that means I'll need to save up around $40,000 for the down payment and another $6,000 to $12,000 for closing costs and fees. That's a total of $46,000 to $52,000. I'll need to adjust my savings plan to reach that goal. Can you help me create a simple budget plan to reach my savings goal?",
