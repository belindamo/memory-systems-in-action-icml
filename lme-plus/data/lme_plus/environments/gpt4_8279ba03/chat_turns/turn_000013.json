It's great that you're looking for ways to support them!\n\nHere are some relaxation techniques that might help your mom:\n\n1. **Deep Breathing Exercises**: Encourage your mom to take slow, deep breaths in through her nose and out through her mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath. You can find guided deep breathing exercises online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.\n2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: This technique involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in the body. Start with the toes and work your way up to the head, holding each muscle group for a few seconds before releasing.\n3. **Mindfulness Meditation**: Mindfulness meditation involves focusing on the present moment, without judgment. You can find guided meditations online or through apps like Insight Timer. Start with short sessions (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase as your mom becomes more comfortable with the practice.\n4. **Visualization**: Encourage your mom to imagine a peaceful, relaxing place (e.g., a beach or a forest) and engage all her senses in the experience. This can help distract from stress and pain.\n5. **Yoga or Tai Chi**: These gentle exercises can help reduce stress, improve mood, and alleviate migraines. You can find classes in your area or follow along with videos online.\n6. **Aromatherapy**: Certain scents like lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus can be calming and soothing.
