That's a great way to give back to your community.\n\nLet's add a new category to your gift-giving budget:\n\n**Just Because Gifts**\n\n* This category can include gifts for no particular occasion, like the belated anniversary gift for your neighbors or a spontaneous gesture for a friend.\n* Assign a budget for this category, considering how often you tend to give these types of gifts and how much you're comfortable spending.\n\nFor example, you might allocate:\n\n* $20-$50 per quarter for Just Because Gifts (about $5-$12.50 per month)\n\nThis way, you'll have a dedicated fund for those impromptu gifts that bring joy to others and support local businesses.\n\nRemember to review your budget regularly and adjust as needed. You might find that you need to reallocate funds from one category to another or make changes based on your changing financial situation.\n\nSome additional tips to consider:\n\n* **Set a \"gift fund\"**: Consider setting aside a specific amount each month or quarter, like $20 or $50, specifically for gifts. This way, you'll have a dedicated fund for all your gift-giving needs.\n* **Prioritize your categories**: If you find that you're consistently overspending in one category, consider prioritizing your categories. For example, you might prioritize birthdays and holidays over Just Because Gifts.\n* **Be mindful of frequency and cost**: Be aware of how often you're giving gifts and the average cost of each gift. This will help you make adjustments to your budget and ensure you're staying within your means.\n\nBy categorizing your gifts and setting a budget, you'll be able to enjoy the joy of giving while maintaining a healthy financial outlook.",
