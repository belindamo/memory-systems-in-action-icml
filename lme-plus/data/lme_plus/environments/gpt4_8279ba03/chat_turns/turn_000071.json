I've got a lot of rehearsals and performances lined up, and I want to make sure I can fit in time for my daily routine and other commitments. By the way, I learned my lesson from my last production - I wore my costume to the last 4 rehearsals to make sure I was comfortable with it, and it made a big difference. Can you suggest some apps or tools that can help me stay on top of my schedule?",
