I'm looking forward to seeing the murals, visiting Amoeba Music, and getting a feel for the area's history and vibe. Thanks for the recommendations!\n\nBy the way, speaking of music, my friend Jack, who I went to the concert with last month, is a huge music fan. He's always introducing me to new bands and artists. Have you got any recommendations for music venues or festivals in San Francisco that I should check out?",
