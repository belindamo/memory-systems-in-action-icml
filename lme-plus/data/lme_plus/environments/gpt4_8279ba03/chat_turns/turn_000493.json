You'll enjoy the fresh seafood and the views of the Bay Bridge and Alcatraz.\n\nThat's great that you ran into your friend Emily and heard about her amazing seafood adventures in Europe! It's always exciting to catch up with old friends and hear about their travels and experiences. Did she have a favorite seafood dish or destination that stood out to her during her travels?\n\nBy the way, since you're interested in seafood, I should mention that San Francisco is also famous for its cioppino, a hearty seafood stew that originated in the city. It's a must-try when you're in the area. Alioto's, which I mentioned earlier, is a great spot to try cioppino.\n\nNow, back to your trip planning. Are you thinking of exploring any other neighborhoods or attractions in San Francisco beyond Fisherman's Wharf and Yosemite? The city has a lot to offer, from the vibrant Haight-Ashbury neighborhood to the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park. Let me know if you need any more recommendations or insider tips!",
