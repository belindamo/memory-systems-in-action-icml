Sorry to hear you're experiencing buffering and video quality problems.\n\nBefore we dive in, I just want to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have direct access to your specific account or device, so we'll need to go through some troubleshooting steps together.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about the issues you're experiencing? For example:\n\n1. How often do you experience buffering or poor video quality on YouTube Premium?\n2. Is it happening on a specific device (e.g., phone, tablet, smart TV, computer) or across multiple devices?\n3. Are you using a specific internet connection (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular, Ethernet) when you experience the issues?\n4. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might be causing the problems (e.g., specific times of day, certain types of content, etc.)?\n\nAs for your true-crime podcast hobby, that's really interesting! I'm glad you've found a new passion to enjoy during your morning jogs. If you don't mind me asking, what draws you to true-crime podcasts? Is there a particular aspect that fascinates you?\n\nLet's focus on resolving your YouTube Premium issues first, and then we can chat more about true-crime podcasts if you'd like!",
