Here's why:\n\n1. **Complex world-building:** Altered Carbon has a complex, layered world with a rich history, and Season 2 builds upon the foundation established in Season 1. A quick refresher will help you appreciate the new storylines and characters.\n2. **Character connections:** While Season 2 introduces new characters, it also continues the story of some characters from Season 1. A rewatch or recap will help you remember their motivations, relationships, and backstories.\n3. **Plot threads:** Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off, and some plot threads are continued or referenced throughout the new season. A refresher will help you understand the context and significance of these plot points.\n\nIf you don't have time for a full rewatch, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Read a recap:** Check out a detailed recap of Season 1 online, which should give you a good summary of the main events, characters, and plot twists.\n2. **Watch a \"Previously On\" video:** Netflix often releases \"Previously On\" videos that summarize the previous season.
