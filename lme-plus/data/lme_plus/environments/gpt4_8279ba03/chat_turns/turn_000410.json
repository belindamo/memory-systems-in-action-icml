  "content": "Your task is to assist in designing a branching scenario for an e-learning course, aimed at teaching effective decision-making skills in a specific domain. The branching scenario should present learners with realistic situations and challenges, requiring them to make choices that lead to various consequences. As a helper, you should ensure that the scenario is engaging, immersive, and educational. The branching scenario should be structured in a way that allows learners to experience the outcomes of their decisions, reflect on the choices they made, and learn from their mistakes. Additionally, the scenario should include feedback mechanisms and opportunities for learners to revisit their choices, enabling them to better understand the implications of their decisions. Finally, the branching scenario should be designed with a clear learning objective in mind and be aligned with the overall instructional goals of the course.",
