  "content": "One creative solution could be to establish a nationwide program that encourages and incentivizes the learning and use of multiple languages, including both national and regional languages. This program could provide language learning resources, such as classes and online materials, and offer benefits such as job opportunities or academic credits for those who achieve proficiency in multiple languages. By promoting multilingualism, this program would not only help preserve regional languages but also foster a sense of national unity and shared cultural identity through language learning and exchange. Additionally, this program could be designed in a way that is inclusive of all socioeconomic groups, ensuring that marginalized communities have access to these language learning resources and opportunities.",
