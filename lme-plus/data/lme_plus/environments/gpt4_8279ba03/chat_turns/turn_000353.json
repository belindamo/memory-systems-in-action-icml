  "content": "Thank you for the correction. You are absolutely right that Vercel does not require a DNS verification record when adding a domain to a project, unless the domain is being reused across multiple projects.\n\nSo to summarize the correct steps for configuring a custom domain `docs.danfletcher.com` for Dan's Gitbook subdomain:\n\n1. Dan creates a CNAME record for `docs.danfletcher.com` in his DNS settings that points to `dans-gitbook.vercel.app`.\n2. You add the custom domain `docs.danfletcher.com` to the list of domains for your Gitbook project in the Vercel dashboard.\n3. Wait for the DNS changes to propagate.\n4. Vercel automatically provisions an SSL certificate for the custom domain `docs.danfletcher.com` using Let's Encrypt.\n\nAfter completing these steps, Dan's documentation site should be accessible via the custom domain `docs.danfletcher.com`.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to clarify this. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!",
