  "content": "It's difficult to predict whether people will still want to have children naturally in the future. However, it's safe to say that fertility treatments and gene editing may offer a wider range of options to individuals and couples who may not have been able to conceive naturally or who want to ensure that their children do not inherit certain genetic disorders.\n\nDespite this, there may still be individuals and couples who prefer to conceive naturally, either for personal or cultural reasons. Furthermore, while advancements in reproductive technology offer new possibilities for family formation, it's important to remember that they also require significant time, effort, and financial resources. Additionally, there may be concerns about the safety and ethics of certain technologies, which may deter some individuals and couples from pursuing these options.\n\nOverall, while there may be a growing interest in fertility treatments and gene editing, it's important to recognize that natural conception and traditional family formation will likely continue to be an important part of many people's lives.",
