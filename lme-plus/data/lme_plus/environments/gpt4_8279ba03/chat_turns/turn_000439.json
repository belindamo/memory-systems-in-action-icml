Give your character a unique backstory - A character's personality is shaped by their experiences, so create a backstory that is tailored to the character's personality. Consider their family background, childhood experiences, and where they grew up. These experiences can help shape a character's voice and personality.\n\n2. Write a character backstory scene - Write a scene that depicts a formative experience in your character's life. This will help you get into your character's head and understand their motivations and personality.\n\n3. Create a character questionnaire - Ask your character questions about their personality, motivations, and attitudes. This can help you get a better understanding of who they are and how they think.\n\n4. Develop character traits and quirks - Give your character unique traits and quirks that set them apart from other characters. These can be physical (such as a limp or a stutter), or personality traits (such as being impulsive or obsessive).\n\n5. Write in your character's voice - Practice writing in your character's voice to help develop their unique style of speaking. Think about how your character would communicate, what phrases they would use, and how they would structure their sentences.\n\n6. Use character journals - Encourage your character to write in a journal, where they can discuss their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This will help you get to know your character on a deeper level.\n\n7. Consider your character's beliefs - Think about your character's belief system and how it affects their personality. Do they have strong convictions or are they more open-minded?\n\n8. Observe real people - Pay attention to the people around you and how they communicate. Use various character traits that you observe in real people as inspiration for your character.\n\nBy using these techniques or exercises, you can develop a fully-realized character with a unique voice and personality that readers will find compelling.",
