You can make your own burrata cheese at home, but it does require some practice and patience. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 gallon whole milk\n* 1/4 cup cheese salt\n* 1/4 cup citric acid (available at most home brew or winemaking stores)\n* 1/2 tsp rennet (vegetable or animal)\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1 cup shredded stracciatella or mozzarella\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Begin by making the mozzarella. Combine the milk, cheese salt, and citric acid in a large pot. Heat the mixture to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), then add the rennet. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until you see a clean break.\n2. Cut the curds into small pieces and let them sit for another 5 minutes. Then, heat the mixture to 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) and hold it at that temperature for 5-10 minutes.\n3. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool to 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C). Use a slotted spoon to remove the curds from the whey and transfer them to a cheesecloth or butter muslin.\n4. Let the curds drain for 10-15 minutes, until most of the whey has been removed. Gather the edges of the cheesecloth and give the curds a gentle squeeze to remove any excess liquid.\n5. Divide the curds into small balls, about the size of a golf ball. Flatten each ball slightly into a disk shape.\n6. Place a tablespoon or two of heavy cream and shredded stracciatella in the center of each disk. Fold the mozzarella over the filling and press the edges together to seal the burrata.\n7. Serve the burrata cheese within a few hours of making it, or store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n\nTips for making perfect burrata cheese:\n\n* Use high-quality, fresh ingredients to ensure the best flavor and texture.\n* Keep the mozzarella curds at the right temperature (80\u00b0F to 105\u00b0F) to achieve the perfect stretch and texture.\n* Don't overwork the curds, as this can make them tough and dense.\n* Use a gentle",
