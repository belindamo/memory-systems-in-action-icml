  "content": "The two layers of regional and national identity within India has been described as \"nationalist diglossia.\"\n\nNationalist diglossia refers to the co-existence of two language varieties or registers, where one is used for national communication and the other is used for regional communication. In the case of India, Hindi and English are the languages used for national communication, while regional languages are used for regional communication. This creates a diglossic situation where people are required to be proficient in both the national language and their regional language. This phenomenon has been described as nationalist diglossia as it reflects the tension between national identity and regional identity within the country. The term \"nationalist\" here refers to the emphasis placed on the national language as a symbol of national unity and identity.",
