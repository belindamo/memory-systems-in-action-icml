  "content": "Major language policy in India will always need to strike a balance between issues and concerns of different linguistic communities.\n\nIndia is a linguistically diverse country with a large number of languages spoken by different communities. The language policy in India needs to take into account the concerns and needs of various linguistic communities, such as the promotion and preservation of minority languages, the use of regional languages in education, and the role of English as a medium of instruction and communication. At the same time, language policy also needs to ensure that there is linguistic unity and communication across the country. Therefore, striking a balance between the interests of different linguistic communities is crucial for the success of language policy in India.",
