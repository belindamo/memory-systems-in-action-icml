  "content": "That's great news! Congratulations on taking the first step into the world of pottery!\n\nAs a beginner, it's excellent that you're considering your approach. Both pottery wheel and hand-building techniques are essential skills to learn, and it's not necessarily an either-or situation. However, I'd recommend starting with hand-building techniques first, and here's why:\n\n1. **Foundational skills**: Hand-building techniques, such as coiling, pinching, and sculpting, will help you develop fundamental skills like shaping, texturing, and manipulating clay. These skills are essential for creating forms, regardless of whether you're using a wheel or not.\n2. **Understanding clay behavior**: Hand-building allows you to get a feel for the clay's behavior, its plasticity, and how it responds to different techniques. This understanding will help you when you transition to the pottery wheel.\n3. **Developing patience and control**: Hand-building requires patience, attention to detail, and control, which are vital skills for any potter. By mastering these skills, you'll be better prepared to work with the pottery wheel.\n4. **Cost-effective**: Starting with hand-building techniques means you won't need to invest in a pottery wheel right away. You can focus on developing your skills and learning the basics of pottery without the added expense.\n5. **Wheel skills will build upon hand-building skills**: Once you've developed your hand-building skills, you'll find that many of the techniques you've learned will translate to the pottery wheel. You'll be able to focus on learning wheel-specific skills, like centering and throwing, without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThat being said, if you do decide to invest in a pottery wheel, it's not a bad idea to start with a beginner-friendly, manual wheel. This will allow you to get a feel for the wheel and develop your skills without breaking the bank.\n\nIn your class, you'll likely have access to pottery wheels and guidance from an instructor, which will give you a chance to try out both hand-building and wheel throwing techniques. By the time you've completed the class, you'll have a better understanding of which direction you want to take your pottery journey.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of learning and creating!",
