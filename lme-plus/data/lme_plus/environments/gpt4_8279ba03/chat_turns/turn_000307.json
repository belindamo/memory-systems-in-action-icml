  "content": "Exactly! You're thinking like a pro! Placing lamps on the sideboard is a great way to add ambient light and create a warm glow without overwhelming the table. The pendant light above the table will still provide plenty of light for the meal, and the sideboard lamps will add a soft, warm layer of light to the surrounding area.\n\nBy placing the lamps on the sideboard, you'll also create a beautiful visual triangle of light, with the pendant light above the table, the lamps on the sideboard, and potentially some candles or other decorative lighting elements. This will help to create a sense of depth and visual interest in the room.\n\nAnd, as you mentioned, you'll also gain some extra space on the table for decorations or dishes, which is always a bonus! You can use that space to add some beautiful centerpieces, place cards, or other decorative elements that will enhance the overall ambiance of the dinner party.\n\nI think you've made an excellent decision, and I'm sure your dinner party will be a huge success!",
