  "content": "I plan to prioritize my training and make sure I have enough time for rest and recovery. I'll also try to schedule my long runs and strength training sessions on the weekends, when I have more free time. During the week, I'll focus on shorter runs and yoga sessions, which can be fit into my lunch break or after work. I'll also make sure to communicate with my family and friends about my training schedule, so they know when I'm available and when I need to focus on my training.\n\nI've also been thinking about my nutrition and hydration plan, and I want to make sure I'm fueling my body properly for my long runs and strength training sessions. I've heard that proper nutrition and hydration are critical for ultra-marathon training, and I don't want to neglect that aspect of my training.\n\nDo you have any tips on how to fuel my body properly for ultra-marathon training?",
