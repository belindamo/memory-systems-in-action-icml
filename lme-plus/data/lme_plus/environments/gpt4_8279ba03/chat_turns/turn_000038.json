  "content": "Another solution could be to create a national language policy that prioritizes the promotion and preservation of all languages, not just those recognized in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. This policy could involve incentivizing multilingualism and bilingualism, encouraging the teaching of regional and minority languages in schools, providing resources for language revitalization efforts, and promoting cultural and linguistic diversity in media and other forms of public discourse. By valuing all languages and cultures, this approach could help to build a more inclusive and equitable society, while also preserving India's rich linguistic heritage.",
