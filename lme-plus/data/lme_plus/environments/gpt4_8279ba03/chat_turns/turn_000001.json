  "content": "I'd be happy to help you determine how much mortgage you can afford.\n\nTo do this, we'll need to consider a few factors beyond just your annual salary. Here are some questions to help us get started:\n\n1. What's your current credit score? A good credit score can help you qualify for better interest rates and terms.\n2. How much of a down payment are you planning to make? The more you put down, the lower your monthly mortgage payments will be.\n3. What's your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio? This is the percentage of your monthly gross income that goes towards paying debts, including credit cards, student loans, car loans, and other debts.\n4. What's your desired monthly mortgage payment? Are you comfortable with a higher payment or do you want to keep it as low as possible?\n5. What's the interest rate you expect to get on your mortgage? This can vary depending on the lender, your credit score, and market conditions.\n6. Do you have any other sources of income or assets that could impact your mortgage affordability?\n\nAssuming you don't have any other debts or financial obligations, here's a rough estimate of how much mortgage you might be able to afford based on your annual salary:\n\n* Generally, lenders recommend that your housing costs (mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance) shouldn't exceed 30% of your gross income.\n* Based on your $73,000 annual salary, that would put your monthly housing costs at around $1,825.\n* Let's assume you'll put 20% down ($40,000 on a $200,000 home) to avoid PMI (private mortgage insurance).\n* Using a mortgage calculator, a $160,000 mortgage (80% of the purchase price) at a 4% interest rate would result in a monthly mortgage payment of around $763.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a rough estimate and doesn't take into account other expenses like maintenance, utilities, and homeowners association fees. Additionally, your lender may have different requirements and guidelines.\n\nTo get a more accurate assessment, I recommend:\n\n1. Checking your credit score and working on improving it if necessary.\n2. Gathering information on your debts and income to calculate your DTI ratio.\n3. Researching and comparing mortgage rates and terms from different lenders.\n4. Consulting with a financial advisor or mortgage broker to get personalized advice.\n\nI hope this helps you get started!",
