However, I can suggest a few ways to help you get an idea of the average apartment prices in your city center:\n\n1. Online Real Estate Portals: Websites like Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, or local real estate websites can give you an idea of the current market prices for apartments in your city center. You can filter your search by location, price range, and property type (e.g., condos, apartments, etc.).\n2. Local Real Estate Agents: Reach out to local real estate agents who specialize in city center properties. They can provide you with more accurate and up-to-date information on current prices, trends, and available listings.\n3. Property Listings: Check online property listings, such as Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or local online classifieds, to get an idea of the going rates for apartments in your desired area.\n4. Neighborhood Guides: Look for neighborhood guides or reports from local real estate companies, which often include information on average sale prices, rental prices, and market trends.\n5. Government Websites: Your city or county government's website might have information on property values, tax assessments, or market data that can give you an idea of the average prices in the area.\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of the average apartment prices in your city center, you can reassess your budget and adjust your expectations accordingly. You might need to consider factors like:\n\n* Compromising on location: If prices are too high in the city center, you might need to look at neighboring areas or consider a longer commute.\n* Adjusting your must-haves: Be flexible with your apartment requirements, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, or amenities.\n* Saving for a larger down payment: If you're willing to wait, saving for a larger down payment could increase your purchasing power and help you afford a more expensive property.\n* Exploring alternative options: Consider alternative types of properties, such as a townhouse or a fixer-upper, which might be more affordable.\n\nRemember to factor in additional costs like closing costs, property taxes, and insurance when calculating how much mortgage you can afford.",
