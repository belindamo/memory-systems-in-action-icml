  "content": "Sure, here's an updated article that takes into account the experiences at ADD as well:\n\nAs a seasoned software developer and team leader with a track record of driving successful project outcomes, I am excited to apply for the FDSE role at Palantir. With over 5 years of experience developing software for unmanned aerial vehicles at the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), I have honed my skills in delivering high-quality software that meets strict operational requirements.\n\nAt ADD, I was responsible for developing software to meet Required Operational Capability (ROC) for defense strategies. This required not only a deep understanding of the complex requirements and constraints of the defense industry, but also the ability to design and implement software with operational confidence, accuracy, and performance.\n\nMore recently, I have been working at Conalog, where I have developed a cloud-based SaaS platform for real-time IoT data analytics. In this role, I have developed a data pipeline for real-time IoT data as an event-driven distributed system, and a web application for serving real-time status data and analytics via Digital Twin. I have also continuously improved the platform's scalability and user-demand features through an agile development process, resulting in a more cost-effective and streamlined platform.\n\nAs a software development team leader, I have managed teams of developers to deliver complex projects on time and within budget. My experience at ADD and Conalog has taught me the importance of effective communication, teamwork, and adaptability to meet changing requirements.\n\nI am eager to apply my diverse experiences in software development to the exciting and challenging work at Palantir. The opportunity to work with a world-class team of engineers and contribute to innovative solutions that make a real-world impact is truly inspiring. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience in further detail.",
