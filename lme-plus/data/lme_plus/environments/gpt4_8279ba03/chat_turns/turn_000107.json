  "content": "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. It's a great attitude to have, focusing on the thought and effort behind the gift rather than the price tag. Remember, it's the thought that counts, not the cost.\n\nBy focusing on the thought and effort, you'll be able to show your loved ones that you care without breaking the bank. And, you'll also be able to stay within your budget and avoid financial stress.\n\nIt's also important to remember that gifts are just one way to show you care. Sometimes, it's the little things, like a kind word, a listening ear, or a helping hand, that can mean the most.\n\nKeep in mind that it's okay to say no to gifts or to set boundaries around your gift-giving. It's better to be honest and open with your loved ones about your financial situation than to overspend and stress yourself out.\n\nYou got this! You're taking steps to be more mindful of your gift-giving and to focus on what truly matters. Keep up the good work, and happy gifting!",
