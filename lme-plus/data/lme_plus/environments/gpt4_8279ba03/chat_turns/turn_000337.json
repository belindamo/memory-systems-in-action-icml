Here are some pros and cons of each option to consider:\n\n**Booking Flights and Hotels Separately:**\n\nPros:\n\n* More flexibility: You can choose the best flight options and hotel deals separately, which might result in better prices.\n* Wider selection: You're not limited to packages that include specific flights and hotels.\n* Easier changes: If you need to make changes to your itinerary, it might be easier to do so when booking separately.\n\nCons:\n\n* More work: You'll need to research and book each component separately, which can be time-consuming.\n* No bundle discounts: You might miss out on package discounts that can be offered when booking together.\n\n**Booking Flights and Hotels Together as a Package:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Convenience: Booking a package can be a one-stop-shop, saving you time and effort.\n* Bundle discounts: Many travel websites, including Travelocity, offer discounts when booking flights and hotels together.\n* Simplified changes: If you need to make changes to your itinerary, it's often easier to do so when booking a package.\n\nCons:\n\n* Limited flexibility: You're restricted to the flights and hotels included in the package.\n* Less customization: You might not be able to choose the exact flights or hotels you want.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n* Are you looking for the absolute best deals on flights and hotels, even if it means booking separately?\n* Do you value the convenience of booking a package and having everything taken care of?\n* Are you flexible with your travel dates or do you have specific preferences?\n\nBased on your research, if Travelocity offered the best deals for you, it's likely that booking a package through them could be a good option. However, if you're looking for more flexibility or customization, booking separately might be the way to go.\n\nUltimately, weigh the pros and cons carefully and make a decision based on your priorities and travel style.",
