  "content": "Good question - Vercel will automatically generate a URL which will be something like 'dans-gitbook.vercel.app', but Vercel allows customers to assign custom domains to their Vercel deployments. In this case, I've assigned a custom domain of 'gitbook.com', as well as a wildcard subdomain of '\\*.gitbook.com'. This allows for custom subdomains. Does that make sense?",
