  "content": "Speakers of a language demand to get their language included in the eighth schedule of the Indian Constitution due to linguistic insecurity. The eighth schedule lists the official languages of India, and inclusion in this list provides a language with official recognition and protection. Minority language speakers may fear that their language is at risk of being marginalized or even lost, and seek official recognition and support to preserve and promote their language and culture. The inclusion of a language in the eighth schedule can also bring various benefits such as access to education, government services, and job opportunities in that language.",
