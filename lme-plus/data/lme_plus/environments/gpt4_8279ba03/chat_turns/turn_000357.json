  "content": "You're correct, my apologies for the oversight. Since you've already set up a wildcard subdomain, you don't need to add the custom domain `docs.danfletcher.com` to the list of domains for your Gitbook project on Vercel.\n\nInstead, Dan can simply create a CNAME record for `docs.danfletcher.com` in his DNS settings that points to `dans-gitbook.vercel.app`. After the DNS changes propagate, Dan's documentation site should be accessible via the custom domain `docs.danfletcher.com` without any further configuration needed on the Vercel side.\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention and I apologize for any confusion caused. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!",
