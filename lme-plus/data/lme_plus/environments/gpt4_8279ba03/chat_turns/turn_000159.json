  "content": "The question of who would be considered a parent if someone's genes are edited is indeed a fascinating one. It raises important questions about how we define parenthood and the role that biology plays in that definition. \n\nCurrently, the legal definition of parenthood is based on biological relationship (genetic or gestational) or legal adoption. However, as new reproductive technologies emerge, such definitions may need to be re-examined to accommodate the changing landscape. It's possible that gene editing could blur the lines between biological and social parenting, and we may need to consider new legal frameworks for parental responsibility and custody.\n\nAt present, there is no established legal precedent for determining who is a parent when it comes to gene editing. This is something that will require extensive debate and discussion by legal and ethical experts. Ultimately, the outcome will depend on the values and principles that society deems important in defining and recognizing parenthood.",
