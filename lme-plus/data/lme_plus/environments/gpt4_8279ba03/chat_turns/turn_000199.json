I've been looking at some online training plans and I think I'll choose one that's specifically designed for 50K ultra-marathon training. I like the idea of having a plan to follow, but I also want to be able to adjust it as needed based on how my body is feeling. I've heard that listening to your body is key when it comes to ultra-marathon training, so I want to make sure I'm not pushing myself too hard.
