Keeping track of when you wear and maintain your shoes can really help extend their lifespan.\n\nAnd don't forget to clean those white Converse! It's great that you're remembering to take care of them. Cleaning them regularly can help remove dirt and stains, and keep them looking their best.\n\nBy the way, it's interesting that you mentioned the specific date you wore them to a picnic.
