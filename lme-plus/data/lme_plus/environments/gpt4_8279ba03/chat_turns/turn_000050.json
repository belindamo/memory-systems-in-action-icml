Cook until the spinach has wilted and the vegetables are tender. Season with dried basil, oregano, salt, and pepper to taste.\n4. **Prepare the lasagna noodles:** Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions.

Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and the lasagna is hot and bubbly.\n8. **Let it rest:** Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* For an extra creamy lasagna, you can use up to 1 1/2 cups of cashew cream sauce.\n* If using vegan mozzarella shreds, you can sprinkle them on top of the lasagna before baking or add them to the cashew cream sauce for an extra cheesy flavor.\n* Feel free to customize the vegetable filling with your favorite ingredients or add other layers like saut\u00e9",
