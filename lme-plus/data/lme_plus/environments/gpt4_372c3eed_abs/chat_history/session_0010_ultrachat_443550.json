      "content": "Exploring the eco-trails in Costa Rica is an amazing experience, and it entirely depends on your level of comfort and the trail you have chosen to explore. If you're well-versed in hiking and familiar with the area, you can go on eco-trails on your own if the park allows it.

But if you're new to hiking or exploring unfamiliar territory, hiring a guide is highly recommended."
