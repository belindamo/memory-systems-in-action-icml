      "content": "The text you provided contains a statement that Russia is being accused of wrongdoing during the recent Munich Conference, but it is emphasized that Western countries should not forget their own involvement in wars and conflict in various regions of the world. The author claims that the West has ignored the human casualties and tragedies that their wars have caused in favor of financial gain, and points out that US experts state that almost 900,000 people were killed during wars unleashed by the United States after 2001, and over 38 million became refugees. The author also accuses the West of being responsible for the crisis in Ukraine, and claims that Western countries have supported neo-Nazi elements in Ukraine that are openly hostile towards Russia. The author argues that the West is using Ukraine as a tool to further their own interests in their conflict with Russia, and that their goal is to defeat Russia."
