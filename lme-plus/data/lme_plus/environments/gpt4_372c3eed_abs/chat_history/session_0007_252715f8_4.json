Meal prepping on Sundays is a great habit to get into, and I'm happy to help you get started. Here are some tips to help you begin:\n\n**1. Plan your meals**: Before you start meal prepping, decide what meals you want to prep for the week. Look at your schedule and plan out breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day. Consider your dietary preferences, allergies, and ingredient availability.\n\n**2. Make a grocery list**: Once you have your meal plan, create a list of the ingredients you need to buy. You can also consider what leftovers you can use from your dinner party to reduce food waste and save time.\n\n**3. Start small**: Don't try to prep an entire week's worth of meals in one day. Begin with 2-3 meals or a few snacks, and gradually increase your prep as you get more comfortable with the process.\n\n**4. Prepare a \"protein base\"**: Cook a large batch of a protein source like chicken, beans, or lentils, which can be used in various meals throughout the week. This will save you time and make meal prep more efficient.\n\n**5. Utilize leftovers**: Just like you did with the leftover chicken, think about how you can repurpose ingredients from one meal into another. This will reduce food waste and save you time during the week.\n\n**6. Portion and store**: Divide your prepped meals into individual portions and store them in airtight containers. Label and date each container so you know what you have and how long it's been in the fridge.\n\n**7. Consider a \"assembly-line\" approach**: Prep individual components of meals, like grains, vegetables, and proteins, and then assemble them into complete meals throughout the week.\n\n**8. Keep it simple**: Don't feel like you need to create complex, gourmet meals. Simple meals like salads, soups, and stir-fries are great for meal prep.\n\n**9. Be flexible**: Life can be unpredictable, and your meal prep plans might change. Don't stress if you need to adjust your plan or use a meal prep container for a different meal than intended.\n\n**10. Have fun and experiment**: Meal prep is a process, and it might take some trial and error to find what works best for you. Experiment with new recipes, ingredients, and cooking techniques to keep things interesting.\n\nSome popular meal prep ideas using leftovers include:\n\n* Turning last night's dinner into tomorrow's lunch\n* Using leftover roasted vegetables in a soup or salad\n* Making a big batch of rice or quinoa and using it throughout the week\n* Creating a \"leftover mashup\" meal, where you combine different leftovers into a new dish\n\nI hope these tips help you get started with meal prep on Sundays!"
