  "content": "Yes, that's exactly right. Narrative therapy is often described as empowering because it places the client's experiences and perspectives at the center of the healing process. This can be a refreshing change for clients who may have only been given a label or diagnosis in the past, and who may have felt like their experiences have been minimized or overlooked.\n\nBy focusing on the client's strengths and resources, narrative therapy can also help to build their sense of agency and control over their lives. This can be especially important for trauma survivors who may have experienced a sense of powerlessness and helplessness as a result of their trauma.\n\nOverall, narrative therapy offers a unique approach to healing and recovery that puts the client's needs, experiences, and perspectives at the center of the therapeutic process. It empowers clients to take an active role in their healing journey by focusing on their strengths and building a collaborative relationship with their therapist.",
