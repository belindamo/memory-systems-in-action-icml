  "content": "Decentralized applications (dApps) are applications that run on a decentralized network, rather than on a central server. They are built on decentralized technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) and can be used to provide a wide range of services and functionality.\n\ndApps can be used for a variety of purposes, including peer-to-peer transactions, identity management, supply chain management, and more. They are decentralized in nature, meaning that they are not controlled by a central authority and are instead governed by the rules and protocols of the decentralized network on which they run.\n\ndApps can be built on a variety of decentralized platforms, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum and EOS. They can also be developed using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.\n\nOverall, decentralized applications (dApps) are applications that run on a decentralized network and can be used to provide a wide range of services and functionality.
