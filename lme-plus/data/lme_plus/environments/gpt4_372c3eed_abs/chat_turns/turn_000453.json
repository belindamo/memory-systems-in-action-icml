  "content": "The \"Convex Hull\" problem on LeetCode is a classic problem in computational geometry. It's a great problem to practice your skills in algorithms and data structures.\n\nRemember to take your time, read the problem statement carefully, and think about the problem before starting to code. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Understand the problem**: Make sure you understand what a convex hull is and how it's defined.\n2. **Choose an algorithm**: There are several algorithms to solve the convex hull problem, such as the Gift Wrapping algorithm, Graham's scan, or the Jarvis march. Choose one that you're familiar with or want to learn.\n3. **Implement the algorithm**: Write clean, readable code that implements the chosen algorithm. Make sure to handle edge cases and consider the time and space complexity of your solution.\n4. **Test your solution**: Write test cases to validate your solution. Think about different scenarios, such as a single point, two points, or multiple points that form a convex hull.\n5. **Optimize your solution**: Once you have a working solution, think about how to optimize it. Can you improve the time complexity or reduce the space complexity?\n\nIf you get stuck or need help, feel free to ask. I'll be here to assist you.\n\nGood luck, and have fun solving the problem!",
