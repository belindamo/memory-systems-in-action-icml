It's also great that you're challenging yourself with more advanced classes and workshops \u2013 arm balances and inversions can be intimidating, but with consistent practice and preparation, you'll be able to tackle them with confidence!\n\nUsing an app like Yoga Studio can also help you develop a more mindful and introspective practice, as you're able to focus on your breath, alignment, and inner awareness in the comfort of your own home. It's a great way to deepen your practice and prepare yourself for more challenging classes or workshops.\n\nRemember to always listen to your body and honor its limitations, especially when working on more advanced poses or transitions. It's okay to take it slow and modify or rest when needed \u2013 yoga is a journey, not a competition!\n\nHow do you plan on incorporating Yoga Studio into your practice leading up to the arm balances and inversions workshop?
