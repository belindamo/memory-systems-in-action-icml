Involving the church's outreach committee and youth group can help amplify the impact of your project and create a sense of community among the congregation.\n\n**Outreach Committee:**\n\n* They likely have existing relationships with local organizations and community groups, which can help with logistics and promotion.\n* They may have experience with organizing community service projects, providing valuable guidance and expertise.\n* They can help connect with other church members who may be interested in participating or donating resources.\n\n**Youth Group:**\n\n* They can bring energy and enthusiasm to the project, making it a fun and engaging experience for everyone involved.\n* They can help spread the word about the food drive and clean-up event through social media, school networks, and friend groups.\n* Participating in community service projects can be a great way to teach them about social responsibility, empathy, and the importance of giving back.\n* They may be able to contribute fresh ideas and perspectives to the project, helping to make it more appealing to their peers.\n\n**Tips for involving the youth group:**\n\n1. **Make it relatable**: Emphasize how the food drive and clean-up event can make a positive impact on their own community and peers.\n2. **Give them ownership**: Encourage them to take on specific roles or responsibilities, such as promoting the event on social media or helping with logistics.\n3. **Make it fun**: Incorporate fun activities or games into the clean-up event to keep them engaged and motivated.\n4. **Provide guidance and support**: Ensure that they have the necessary resources and guidance to successfully participate and contribute to the project.\n5. **Recognize their contributions**: Acknowledge and celebrate their efforts and contributions to the project, helping to build their confidence and sense of accomplishment.\n\nBy involving both the outreach committee and youth group, you can create a collaborative and intergenerational effort that benefits the entire church community. Remember to keep the lines of communication open, and don't hesitate to ask for help or guidance when needed. Good luck, and I hope your project is a huge success!",
