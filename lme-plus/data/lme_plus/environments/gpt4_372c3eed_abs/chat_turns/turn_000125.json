  "content": "Exploring the eco-trails in Costa Rica is an amazing experience, and it entirely depends on your level of comfort and the trail you have chosen to explore. If you're well-versed in hiking and familiar with the area, you can go on eco-trails on your own if the park allows it. However, if you're unfamiliar with the area or have little hiking experience, it's highly recommended to hire a guide.\n\nA guide can provide valuable information about the park's flora and fauna, including plant identification and animal spotting, giving you a more enriching experience. They can also be quite helpful for first-aid assistance in case of accidents along the hiking trails.\n\nMoreover, some parks, like Corcovado National Park, require visitors to hire an accredited guide for safety reasons, so it's essential to check the park's regulations beforehand.\n\nIn summary, if you're experienced in hiking and familiar with the specific trail, then you can explore on your own. But if you're new to hiking or exploring unfamiliar territory, hiring a guide is highly recommended.",
