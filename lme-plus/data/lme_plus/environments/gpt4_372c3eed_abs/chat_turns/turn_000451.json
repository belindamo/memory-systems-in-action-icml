  "content": "Here are some specific problems on LeetCode and Codeforces that cover topics like convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and geometric searching:\n\n**Convex Hulls:**\n\n1. **LeetCode: Convex Hull** (Medium): Given a set of 2D points, find the convex hull.\n2. **Codeforces: Convex Hull** (Medium): Given a set of 2D points, find the convex hull and calculate its area.\n3. **LeetCode: Largest Triangle Area** (Medium): Given a set of 2D points, find the largest triangle area that can be formed using three points from the set.\n\n**Voronoi Diagrams:**\n\n1. **Codeforces: Voronoi Diagram** (Hard): Given a set of 2D points, construct the Voronoi diagram and find the nearest point to a given query point.\n2. **LeetCode: Voronoi Diagram** (Hard): Given a set of 2D points, construct the Voronoi diagram and find the nearest point to a given query point.\n3. **Codeforces: Closest Pair** (Medium): Given a set of 2D points, find the closest pair of points.\n\n**Geometric Searching:**\n\n1. **LeetCode: Point and Rectangle** (Medium): Given a set of rectangles and a query point, find all rectangles that contain the point.\n2. **Codeforces: Point Location** (Medium): Given a set of rectangles and a query point, find the rectangle that contains the point.\n3. **LeetCode: Rectangles Intersection** (Hard): Given a set of rectangles, find all pairs of rectangles that intersect.\n\n**Other Geometric Problems:**\n\n1. **Codeforces: Polygon Clipping** (Medium): Given a polygon and a clipping rectangle, find the clipped polygon.\n2. **LeetCode: Circle and Rectangle Overlapping** (Medium): Given a circle and a rectangle, determine if they overlap.\n3. **Codeforces: Line Segment Intersection** (Medium): Given a set of line segments, find all pairs of intersecting line segments.\n\nRemember to practice problems at your own pace, and don't be afraid to ask for help or look up resources when you're stuck. Good luck, and have fun practicing!",
