Here's a shorter version that includes \"forests\" and starts with \"Roses are Red, Violets Blue\":\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue,\nForests awaken in spring anew.\nLeaves unfurl, a verdant hue,\nAs life bursts forth, and skies turn blue.\n\nBirds sing sweetly in the trees,\nBeneath the shade, where wildflowers please.\nForests thrive, with each passing day,\nIn springtime's glory, they have their say.\n\nSo let us cherish this time of year,\nWhen forests come alive, and all is clear.\nIn the beauty of spring, we find our way,\nTo the forests that thrive, and the life they display.",
