  "content": "I've been using Yoga Studio to supplement my practice at home, especially on days when I can't make it to the studio. I really like the variety of classes and sequences they offer, and the customizable feature is super helpful. I've been focusing on core strength and flexibility, and the app has some great classes and poses that target those areas.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the \"Focus On\" section, which allows me to target specific areas like hips, shoulders, or hamstrings. It's really helpful for working on specific areas of tension or weakness. I also appreciate that the app offers classes for different levels, from beginner to advanced, so I can challenge myself as I progress.\n\nI've found that using Yoga Studio has really helped me stay consistent with my practice, even on days when I can't make it to the studio. It's also been helpful in preparing me for more challenging classes or workshops, like the arm balances and inversions workshop I'm signed up for next month.",
