  "content": "Yes, it can be frustrating when therapy only focuses on identifying problems and shortcomings without exploring or building on the client's strengths and resources. This is where narrative therapy can be particularly helpful. By shifting the focus to the client's strengths and resources, narrative therapy can help clients to build on their existing skills, abilities, and knowledge to create positive change in their lives.\n\nFurthermore, narrative therapy seeks to build a collaborative relationship between the therapist and client, rather than assuming the therapist knows best. This means that clients are encouraged to be active participants in the therapy process, and their ideas and input are valued and respected. This collaborative approach can help clients to feel more empowered and engaged in their therapy, which in turn can lead to more positive outcomes.\n\nOverall, narrative therapy's focus on strengths and resources, along with its collaborative and client-centered approach, can make therapy feel more supportive and uplifting compared to traditional forms of therapy. Clients can feel empowered to take control of their healing journey and make positive changes in their lives based on their own unique strengths and resources.",
