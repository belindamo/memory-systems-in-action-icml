  "content": "Excellent decision! Checking the weight capacity is crucial to ensure your roof rack can handle the weight of your gear.\n\nAnd yay for taking your bike out for a spin! Now that the weather is getting nicer, it's a great time to get some exercise and enjoy the outdoors.\n\nIf you're planning to carry your bike on your roof rack, make sure to check the bike's weight and dimensions to ensure the rack can accommodate it. You might also want to consider the type of bike you have, as some roof racks are designed specifically for certain types of bikes (e.g., road bikes, mountain bikes, etc.).\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions and guidelines for loading and securing your gear on the roof rack to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride.\n\nNow, I'll let you get back to researching the weight capacity of the Thule Evo and Yakima FullBack. If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!",
