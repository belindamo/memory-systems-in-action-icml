  "content": "The terms \"mentorship\" and \"mentoring\" are often used interchangeably to refer to a relationship in which an experienced or more knowledgeable individual (the mentor) provides guidance, support, and advice to a less experienced or less knowledgeable individual (the mentee). In the context of your project, either term could be used to refer to the process of providing support and guidance to students through electronic means.\n\nThe choice between \"mentorship\" and \"mentoring\" may depend on personal preference or the specific focus and goals of your project. Both terms are commonly used in the field of education to describe the process of providing guidance and support to students.\n\nI hope this helps clarify the distinction between \"mentorship\" and \"mentoring.\" If you have any further questions or need more guidance, don't hesitate to ask.",
