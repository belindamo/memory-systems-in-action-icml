I'm also going to explore the resources you mentioned to learn more about South Asian cultures and histories. By the way, I was thinking about my own family's cultural background and how my mom is from Rajasthan, India, and my dad is from Karachi, Pakistan. I've always been curious about our family's migration patterns and how we ended up where we are today. Do you think it's possible to trace our family's migration history through historical records and documents?",
