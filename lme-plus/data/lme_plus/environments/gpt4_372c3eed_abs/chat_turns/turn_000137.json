They have a wonderful selection of rugs.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a rug that matches your sofa, it's a great idea to consider a few things:\n\n**Matching Sofa and Rug:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Creates a cohesive look and ties the room together\n\t+ Can make the space feel more harmonious and calm\n\t+ Easy to choose a rug that complements the sofa's color and style\n* Cons:\n\t+ Might make the room feel too \"matchy-matchy\" or boring\n\t+ Limited flexibility to change up the room's decor in the future\n\n**Contrasting Sofa and Rug:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Creates a bold and interesting visual contrast\n\t+ Can add energy and personality to the room\n\t+ Allows for more flexibility to change up the room's decor in the future\n* Cons:\n\t+ Requires more thought and effort to choose a rug that complements the sofa without clashing\n\t+ Might create a busy or overwhelming atmosphere if not done correctly\n\nUltimately, it depends on your personal style and the overall aesthetic you're aiming for in your living room. If you want a calm and cohesive look, matching the rug to your sofa could be a great choice. However, if you want to add some visual interest and personality to the room, a contrasting rug could be a great option.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider when choosing a contrasting rug:\n\n* Choose a rug that complements the sofa's color, but in a different shade or tone. For example, if your sofa is a dark gray, you could choose a rug with a lighter gray or beige tone.\n* Consider the rug's pattern and texture. A bold pattern or texture can add visual interest and create a nice contrast with a solid-colored sofa.\n* Don't be afraid to introduce a new color or pattern to the room. A contrasting rug can be a great way to add a pop of color or create a focal point in the room.\n\nI hope this helps! If you're still unsure, you could always order samples of different rugs from West Elm or other retailers to see how they look in your living room before making a final decision.",
