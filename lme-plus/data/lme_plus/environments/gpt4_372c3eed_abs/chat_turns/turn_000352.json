It offers a wide range of classes, customizable sequences, and a pose library, which can be really helpful for practicing at home or when you can't make it to a studio.\n\nYoga Studio is particularly useful for beginners, as it provides clear instructions, modifications, and adjustments for various poses. It's also a great tool for more experienced practitioners who want to focus on specific areas, like flexibility, strength, or balance.\n\nOne of the things I like about Yoga Studio is that it allows you to create your own custom classes and save them for future practice. This feature is super convenient, especially if you have a busy schedule and need to fit in a quick practice at home.\n\nHave you found Yoga Studio to be helpful in supplementing your studio practice? Do you have a favorite feature or class style on the app?",
