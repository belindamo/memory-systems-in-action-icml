  "content": "Narrative therapy differs from other forms of therapy for trauma survivors in several ways. One of the key differences is its emphasis on the client's own story or narrative. In narrative therapy, the therapist seeks to understand the client's story and how they make sense of their experiences, rather than trying to diagnose or label them.\n\nAnother key difference is its emphasis on externalizing problems. Narrative therapy views problems as separate from the person, rather than inherent to their identity. This can be particularly helpful for trauma survivors, as it can help them to see their traumatic experiences as external events that happened to them, rather than defining them as a person.\n\nNarrative therapy also emphasizes the client's strengths and resources. Rather than focusing on deficits and limitations, narrative therapy seeks to build on the client's existing strengths and resources, helping them to become more empowered and autonomous in their healing journey.\n\nFinally, narrative therapy often involves a collaborative and non-hierarchical approach between the therapist and client. The therapist works with the client to co-create their treatment plan, and the client is an active participant in the therapy process. This can help to build a sense of trust and respect between the therapist and client, which can be particularly important for trauma survivors who may have experienced a loss of control and agency.\n\nOverall, narrative therapy differs from other forms of therapy for trauma survivors in its emphasis on the client's story, externalizing problems, focusing on strengths and resources, and its collaborative and non-hierarchical approach.",
