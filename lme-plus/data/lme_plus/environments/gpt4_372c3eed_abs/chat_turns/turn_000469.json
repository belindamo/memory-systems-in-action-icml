We will fight with every ounce of strength we possess, and we will emerge victorious.\n\nFor too long, we have been complacent, content to let our enemies plot and scheme in the shadows. But no more. We will take the fight to them, and we will crush them beneath our feet.\n\nWe are the sons and daughters of Odin, the mighty All-Father. We are the warriors of Asgard, feared and respected throughout the Nine Realms. We are invincible, unbreakable, and unstoppable.\n\nSo let us march into battle with our heads held high, our hearts filled with courage, and our souls burning with the fire of victory. For today, we are Thor, the God of Thunder, and we will not be defeated.\n\nFellow Asgardians, let us show them the might of our Realm, our people, and our King.\n\nFor Asgard!\n\nLet the battle begin!",
