  "content": "Yes, you can use the \"stop doing, do more of, do less of, keep doing\" tool as an ongoing evaluation mechanism to make decisions on whether to say yes to certain work requests. You can periodically review the team's progress and make adjustments to their work priorities based on their progress in the different areas. For example, if the team is doing well in the \"keep doing\" area, but needs improvement in the \"do less of\" area, you can use that information to help determine which work requests to say yes to and which ones to decline. The tool can also help the team stay focused on their goals and ensure that they are working on the right things to achieve those goals.",
