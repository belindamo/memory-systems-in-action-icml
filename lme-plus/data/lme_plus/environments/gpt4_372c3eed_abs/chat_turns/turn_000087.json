Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n2. In a large skillet, heat the enchilada sauce over medium heat. Add the diced onion and bell pepper and cook until the vegetables are tender.\n3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked fajita chicken, saut\u00e9ed onion and bell pepper mixture, and chopped cilantro (if using). Mix well.\n4. In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom. Arrange 1 tortilla on top of the sauce.\n5. Spoon half of the chicken mixture onto the tortilla, followed by half of the shredded cheese.\n6. Repeat the layers: enchilada sauce, tortilla, chicken mixture, and cheese.\n7. Top the final layer of cheese with any remaining enchilada sauce.\n8. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25-30 minutes.\n9. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n10.
