Reaching out to professors can be intimidating, but it's a crucial step in finding the right fit for your research interests.\n\nRemember to be yourself, be respectful, and show your enthusiasm for their work. Professors appreciate students who are proactive and genuinely interested in their research.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'll be here to help. Good luck with your emails, and I hope you have productive conversations with Prof. Ver Steeg and Prof. Seltzer!\n\nAs you move forward with your application process, keep in mind that it's not just about getting into a program, but also about finding a community that aligns with your goals and values.
