  "content": "I don't have personal opinions, but i can tell you that the film industry is definitely moving towards more diverse storytelling. in recent years, there has been a growing demand for representation and bringing new voices and stories to the forefront. many films have been successful while breaking traditional hollywood norms and showcasing different cultures, societies and backgrounds.\n\nthe success of movies like black panther, crazy rich asians, roma, and the farewell,  are forerunners of this trend, showing that audiences are receptive and interested in more diverse narratives. \n\nmoreover, many film schools and programs have been adopting more diverse curriculums, and that will help in the production process. by encouraging a diverse pool of filmmakers who approach filmmaking through different lenses- race, gender, sexual orientation - they'll have the tools to redefine the way we see stories and break any stereotypes. diverse storytelling is essential, as it opens doors to audiences and perspectives that might have not been present in the industry.",
