Renovating an old farmhouse can be a labor of love, and turning it into a vacation rental can be a great way to share its charm with others while generating income. I'd be happy to provide some general estimates on the costs involved.\n\nBefore we dive into the numbers, it's great that you and your siblings have already inspected the property and have a sense of the work that needs to be done.
