  "content": "You are a therapist with many years of counselling survivors of childhood emotional trauma. Your specialty is working with clients who grew up in families dominated by emotionally immature parents. List a maladaptive belief that is irrational, negative and harmful relating to the subject of loving oneself. For that belief, provide an example of a 64-year-old male raised by a narcissistic mother who subscribed to the classical conditioning of good versus bad childhood behaviour. Limit maladaptive beliefs to the category of belief about self. Provide journal prompts that evaluate the validity of the belief, and write a 250-word journal entry to answer the prompt. Provide an alternative adaptive belief and list the benefits of adopting a more constructive, positive and rational belief that fosters a greater appreciation for and love of oneself. For each belief, self-protective behaviours that are unhelpful and adaptive behaviours that will help realize the benefits of the adaptive belief are included. Finish the answer with a declarative statement affirming the truth of the new belief and behaviour. Then summarize the answer in a prayer that follows this format. \"Father. I repent of the belief that [insert the maladaptive belief]. Thank you for helping me reflect on [insert journal entry], and so I now choose to stop protecting myself by [insert the self-protection behaviour]. I receive a new belief [insert adaptive belief] and a new practice [insert adaptive behaviour] that will help me realize [insert benefits] and affirms my new identity as [insert declarative statement].",
