The refill pack is a compact, recyclable pouch that contains the same amount of detergent as a traditional bottle.\n3. **Use and Refill:** Use the detergent as you normally would, and when you're running low, simply refill your container with a new refill pack.\n4. **Recycle the Refill Pack:** Once you've used up the detergent from the refill pack, recycle the pouch through TerraCycle's recycling program or participating retail stores.\n\n**Where to Purchase the Reusable Container:**\n\nYou can find the Tide PurClean reusable container at the following online retailers:\n\n* Amazon\n* Walmart\n* Target\n* Tide's Official Website\n\nYou can also check with local retailers in your area to see if they carry the reusable container.\n\n**Tips and Benefits:**\n\n* The reusable container is designed to be used up to 10 times, reducing waste by up to 60%.\n* The refill packs are compact and lightweight, making them easy to store and transport.\n* Tide PurClean is a plant-based, biodegradable detergent that's gentle on clothes and the environment.\n* By participating in the refill program, you'll be reducing your carbon footprint and helping to minimize waste.\n\n**Cost and Availability:**\n\nThe cost of the reusable container and refill packs may vary depending on the retailer and location.
