  "content": "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Choosing a rug that matches your sectional sofa can create a cohesive and harmonious look in your living room. It's great that you've found a rug from West Elm that you love, and even though it's a bit pricey, it's an investment in your home's decor.\n\nRemember, a good area rug can really tie a room together and add warmth and texture to the space. It's worth spending a bit more money on a high-quality rug that will last for years to come.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your new rug and sectional sofa combo!",
