However, it is common for a show or a film to receive mixed reviews upon its initial release, and reviews may become more positive over time as the work gains a cult following or new appreciation. It is also possible for reviews to become more critical as time passes and societal norms change. Overall, it is best to research specific reviews and their evolution over time for a more accurate understanding."

However, according to some sources, \"Uncensored\" received mixed reviews upon its release. Some critics praised the show for its raw and unfiltered portrayal of the struggles of African American royalty, while others felt that it lacked depth and substance. Some critics were also concerned about the way the show depicted violence and drug use, which they felt could glamorize these issues. Overall, it is difficult to generalize the reviews of the show as they varied greatly depending on the source."

At the same time, some have criticized the show for its focus on celebrity gossip and sensationalism.
