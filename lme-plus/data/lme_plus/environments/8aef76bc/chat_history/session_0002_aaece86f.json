It's possible that it's a fictional park or a local amusement park that doesn't have an online presence.\n\nIf you could provide more information about Adventure Land, such as its location or any distinctive features you remember from your visit, I might be able to help you better. Alternatively, you can try searching online for \"Adventure Land theme park\" along with the city or state where you visited it to see if it has an official website or social media presence.\n\nIf you're unable to find information about Adventure Land, you might consider reaching out to Alex or Rachel to see if they remember any details about the park or the event you attended together.

      "content": "I think I see where the confusion is. Unfortunately, I have to break the news to you that Adventure Land theme park is not a real theme park. It's possible that it's a fictional park, or it could be a generic name used for a local event or festival.\n\nScream Fest is a common name for Halloween-themed events, so it's likely that it was a one-time event or a recurring event held at a different venue. Without more information about the location or the organizers of the event, it's difficult for me to pinpoint the exact venue or find information about private room bookings.\n\nIf you remember any other details about the event, such as the city or state where it was held, the type of attractions or activities available, or any distinctive features of the venue, it might help me narrow down the search. Alternatively, you can try searching online for \"Scream Fest\" along with the city or state where you attended the event to see if it was a one-time event or a recurring festival.\n\nI'm happy to help you brainstorm alternative options for celebrating Rachel's birthday, though!"

Could you please tell me what city or state you're located in, or what theme parks are nearby?
