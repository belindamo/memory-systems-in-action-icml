  "content": "Sure! Here are more detailed descriptions of the four tabbard designs I suggested earlier, along with simple line drawing examples of each:\n\n1. Classic design: The classic design features the American flag on the front of the tabbard, with the red and white stripes on the bottom half and the blue field with white stars on the top half. The tabbard itself is a simple tunic with no sleeves, and the American flag can be either painted or embroidered onto the tabbard. Here is an example of what this design might look like:\n```markdown\n_________\n|       |\n|   *   |\n|   *   |\n|   *   |\n|___*___|\n|   |   |\n|___|___|\n```\n2. Heraldic design: The heraldic design features the American flag divided into quadrants, with each quadrant featuring a different emblem or symbol representing a different aspect of American heritage, such as an eagle, a liberty bell, or the Statue of Liberty. The tabbard itself is a simple tunic with no sleeves, and the quadrants can be either painted or embroidered onto the tabbard. Here is an example of what this design might look like:\n```markdown\n_________\n|   |   |\n|  A|B  |\n|___|___|\n|   |   |\n|  C|D  |\n|___|___|\n```\n3. Medieval-inspired design: The medieval-inspired design takes inspiration from the coats of arms of medieval knights, and features the American flag alongside other symbols and emblems representing American values and ideals, such as a bald eagle, a shield, or a banner with a motto. The tabbard itself is a tunic with a V-shaped neckline and a diagonal split down the center, and the motifs can be either painted or embroidered onto the tabbard. Here is an example of what this design might look like:\n```ruby\n        /\\\n      //\\\\\n    ///\\\\\\ \n  ////\\\\\\\\\n//////\\\\\\\\\\\\\n|      |     |\n|      |     |\n|  *   |  *  |\n|      |     |\n|______|_____|\n```\n4. Modern design: The modern design takes a more abstract approach to the American flag, featuring bold geometric shapes and colors that evoke the spirit of contemporary design. The tabbard itself is a simple tunic with no sleeves, and the abstracted flag motifs can be either painted or embroidered onto the tabbard. Here is an example of what this design might look like:\n```markdown\n_________\n|   |   |\n|* *|* *|\n|___|___|\n|   |   |\n|* *|* *|\n|___|___|\n```\nI hope these descriptions and simple line drawing examples make it easier to envision what each tabbard design might look like!",
