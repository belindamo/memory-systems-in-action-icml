  "content": "Templates improve consistency. Resource Manager templates provide a common\nlanguage for deployments. Regardless of the tool or SDK that you use to deploy the\ntemplate, the structure, format, and expressions inside the template remain the same.\n\u2022 Templates help express complex deployments. Templates enable you to deploy\nmultiple resources in the correct order. For example, you wouldn't want to deploy a\nvirtual machine prior to creating an operating system (OS) disk or network interface.\nResource Manager maps out each resource and its dependent resources and creates\ndependent resources first. Dependency mapping helps ensure that the deployment is\ncarried out in the correct order.\n\u2022 Templates reduce manual, error-prone tasks. Manually creating and connecting\nresources can be time consuming, and it's easy to make mistakes. Resource Manager\nensures that the deployment happens the same way every time.\n\u2022 Templates are code. Templates express your requirements through code. Think of a\ntemplate as a type of Infrastructure as Code that can be shared, tested, and versioned\nsimilar to any other piece of software. Also, because templates are code, you can create\na \"paper trail\" that you can follow. The template code documents the deployment.",
