  "content": "Ocean Breeze Waterpark is a real waterpark located in Virginia Beach, Virginia. However, I have to clarify that it's a waterpark, not a theme park. It's possible that you're thinking of a different park or mixing it up with another attraction.\n\nIf you're looking for theme parks near Ocean Breeze Waterpark, there aren't any major theme parks in the immediate area. However, you might consider the following options:\n\n1. Busch Gardens Williamsburg: Located about an hour and a half from Virginia Beach, Busch Gardens Williamsburg is a theme park that offers private room bookings for events and celebrations. They have various options, including restaurants and event spaces, that can accommodate groups of different sizes.\n2. Kings Dominion: About a 2.5-hour drive from Virginia Beach, Kings Dominion is a theme park in Doswell, Virginia. They offer private room bookings for groups and events, including birthday parties.\n\nKeep in mind that these parks may have specific rules and regulations for private events, and availability might be limited. I recommend visiting their websites or contacting them directly to inquire about private room bookings and options.\n\nIf you're open to considering other types of venues, you might also look into local event spaces, restaurants, or hotels that offer private rooms for events and celebrations. They might be able to provide a fun and memorable experience for Rachel's birthday!",
