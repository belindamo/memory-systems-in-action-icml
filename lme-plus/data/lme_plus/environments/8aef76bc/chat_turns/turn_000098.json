I took it out for a spin on the 17th when I went for a hike in the nearby state park. The weather was perfect, with the sun shining through the trees, creating these amazing dappled light effects that I just couldn't resist capturing. I'm curious, can you provide some tips on how to use a wide-angle lens to capture cityscapes at night, especially with all the lights and activity?",
