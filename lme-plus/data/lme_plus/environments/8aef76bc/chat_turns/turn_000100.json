  "content": "I'm planning to head out tonight to capture some nighttime cityscapes with my new wide-angle lens. Earlier in February, on the 8th, I attended a photography workshop in town, where we learned about composition and working with natural light. I think those skills will come in handy tonight, especially when dealing with the artificial light of the city. Can you provide some tips on how to adjust my camera settings for nighttime cityscape photography, especially when it comes to ISO, aperture, and shutter speed?",
