I've been trying to participate in at least one charity event per month, and I'm already signed up for the charity yoga event on June 3rd. By the way, I'm still on a high from the charity bike ride I did last month - I managed to raise $500 in pledges from my colleagues and friends, and we had a blast riding together.",
