Since you mentioned you do a 15-minute tidy of the kitchen on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I'll assume you have a good sense of your cleaning pace. Let's break down the estimated time for each zone based on a moderate cleaning pace:\n\n**Zone 1: Counters and Sink**\n\n* Clearing clutter and putting away items: 10-15 minutes\n* Wiping down counters: 10-15 minutes\n* Deep cleaning the sink: 10-15 minutes\n* Total estimated time: 30-45 minutes\n\n**Zone 2: Stovetop and Oven**\n\n* Removing debris and wiping down stovetop: 10-15 minutes\n* Deep cleaning the stovetop: 20-30 minutes\n* Cleaning the oven: 20-30 minutes (depending on the type of oven and level of grime)\n* Total estimated time: 50-75 minutes\n\n**Zone 3: Refrigerator and Freezer**\n\n* Purging expired items and wiping down shelves: 20-30 minutes\n* Cleaning the fridge seals: 10-15 minutes\n* Total estimated time: 30-45 minutes\n\n**Zone 4: Floors and Cabinets**\n\n* Sweeping and mopping: 20-30 minutes\n* Wiping down cabinets: 20-30 minutes\n* Total estimated time: 40-60 minutes\n\n**Additional Tasks**\n\n* Cleaning light switches, outlets, and doorknobs: 10-15 minutes\n* Taking breaks: 10-15 minutes (assuming 2-3 breaks)\n\n**Total Estimated Time**\n\nBased on these estimates, you can expect to spend around 2-3 hours deep cleaning your kitchen. However, this time may vary depending on the size of your kitchen, the level of grime, and your personal cleaning pace.\n\n**Tips to Save Time**\n\n* Focus on one zone at a time to maintain your momentum and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n* Break larger tasks into smaller chunks, like cleaning one shelf at a time or focusing on one area of the stovetop.\n* Use cleaning products that work quickly and efficiently to save time.\n* Consider enlisting the help of a friend or family member to speed up the process.\n\nRemember, deep cleaning is a process, and it's okay to take your time. If you need to, break the tasks into smaller chunks and spread them out over a few days. The key is to stay focused and motivated, and you'll be enjoying a sparkling clean kitchen in no time!",
