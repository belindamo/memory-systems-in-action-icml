  "content": "Those appetizer suggestions sound amazing! I think I'll go with the Honeyed Goat Cheese Crostini and the Fresh Fruit and Prosciutto Skewers. They're both easy to make and seem like they'll pair well with the Summer Sunset Spritz. \n\nBy the way, I was thinking of serving a main course as well. Do you have any recommendations for a summer-inspired dish that would complement the flavors of the spritz and appetizers?",
