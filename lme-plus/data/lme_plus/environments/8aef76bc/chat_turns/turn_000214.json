It's always better to be safe than sorry, and the extra layer of protection against scratches and cracks would give me peace of mind. Plus, the glare reduction and fingerprint resistance features sound like nice bonuses. I'll check out Zagg's website and see which model would be the best fit for my Samsung Galaxy S21. Thanks for the advice!",
