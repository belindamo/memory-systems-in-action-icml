Study spiritual texts, such as the Bhagavad Gita, and seek guidance from a qualified spiritual teacher.\n3. Cultivate the company of spiritual associates, who can inspire and guide you on your spiritual journey.\n4. Incorporate spiritual practices, such as prayer and selfless service, into your daily routine.\n\nChanting can be a powerful way to remind yourself of the true nature of the soul.
