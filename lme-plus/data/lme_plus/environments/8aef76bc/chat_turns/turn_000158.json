  "content": "I actually did the decluttering and organizing of my craft room a few weeks ago. It took me about 2 hours to get everything sorted out, but it was worth it. I set up a new shelf for my yarn stash and also invested in a few storage bins to keep my fabric and other supplies organized. Now I can easily find what I need when I need it. By the way, my sister's birthday is coming up on the 25th of this month, and I'm making her a scarf. I've been working on it every other day, usually for about an hour or two in the evening after dinner.",
