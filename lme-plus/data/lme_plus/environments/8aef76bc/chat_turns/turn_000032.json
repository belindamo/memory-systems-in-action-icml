Now that I've got the living room and dining room under control, I'd like to tackle the bedrooms and bathroom. I've been trying to do a load or two of laundry every Sunday afternoon, which has been helping me stay on top of it, but I think I need to focus more on dusting and tidying up the bedrooms.
