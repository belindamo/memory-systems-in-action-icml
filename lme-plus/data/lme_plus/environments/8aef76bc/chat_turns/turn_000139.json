Here are some easy and delicious ways to add spinach and kale to your meals:\n\n**Spinach:**\n\n1. **Add to omelets or frittatas**: Spinach pairs well with eggs, cheese, and veggies. Simply chop fresh spinach leaves and add them to your omelet or frittata mixture.\n2. **Sneak it into smoothies**: Blend spinach with your favorite fruits, yogurt, and milk for a nutrient-packed smoothie. The sweetness of the fruit will mask the earthy flavor of spinach.\n3. **Wilt it into pasta sauces**: Add a handful of fresh spinach leaves to your pasta sauce during the last minute of cooking. The heat will wilt the spinach, and it'll blend in with the sauce.\n4. **Use as a pizza topping**: Spinach is a great addition to homemade pizzas. Simply add fresh spinach leaves on top of your pizza before baking.\n5. **Add to soups and stews**: Spinach can be added to soups and stews towards the end of cooking time, allowing it to wilt and blend in with the flavors.\n\n**Kale:**\n\n1. **Make kale chips**: Massage kale leaves with olive oil, salt, and your favorite seasonings, then bake in the oven until crispy.
