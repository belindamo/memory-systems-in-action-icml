  "content": "Excellent choice on the appetizers! They'll provide a lovely contrast in textures and flavors to the refreshing Summer Sunset Spritz.\n\nFor a summer-inspired main course, I'd recommend the following dishes that will complement the flavors of the spritz and appetizers:\n\n1. **Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken**: Marinate chicken breasts in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs like thyme and rosemary. Grill the chicken until cooked through, then serve with a side of roasted vegetables or a salad. The bright, citrusy flavors will pair nicely with the spritz.\n2. **Seared Salmon with Citrus-Herb Quinoa**: Pan-sear salmon fillets with a citrus-herb crust (lemon zest, parsley, dill, and breadcrumbs) and serve with a quinoa dish flavored with lemon juice, olive oil, and chopped fresh herbs. The delicate fish will be elevated by the citrus and herb notes.\n3. **Summer Vegetable Risotto**: Create a creamy risotto with a mix of saut\u00e9ed summer vegetables (zucchini, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and onions) and flavored with white wine, garlic, and herbs like basil and parsley. Finish with grated Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of olive oil. The creamy risotto will soak up the sweetness of the spritz.\n4. **Grilled Peach and Prosciutto Salad**: Grill sliced peaches and layer them with prosciutto, mixed greens, crumbled goat cheese, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. The sweetness of the peaches and the saltiness of the prosciutto will complement the flavors of the spritz and appetizers.\n5. **Summer Pasta Salad**: Toss cooked pasta with a mix of cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell peppers, onions, and Kalamata olives. Dress with a vinaigrette made from olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs like parsley and dill. This light and refreshing pasta salad will pair nicely with the spritz.\n\nThese dishes are all relatively easy to prepare, and you can adjust the ingredients and flavors to suit your taste preferences. They'll provide a lovely summer-inspired main course to accompany your Summer Sunset Spritz and appetizers.\n\nWhich of these options resonates with you, or do you have another dish in mind?",
