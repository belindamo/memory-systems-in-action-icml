  "content": "The Daily Grind's point expiration policy is a great thing to clarify.\n\nAccording to The Daily Grind's loyalty program terms, points expire 12 months from the date they are earned. This means that any points you earn will be valid for 1 year from the date you earn them. If you don't redeem them within that timeframe, they'll unfortunately expire and be removed from your account.\n\nFor example, since you earned 12 points 3 weeks ago, you have about 11 months and 1 week to redeem them for a free drink or other rewards before they expire.\n\nIt's always a good idea to keep an eye on your point balances and expiration dates to make sure you're making the most of your loyalty programs. You can set a reminder for yourself to check your points regularly or log in to your account periodically to stay on top of your balances.\n\nDoes that make sense?",
