  "content": "Thank you for providing more information!\n\nBased on your description, it's possible that the software update has introduced some power-hungry features or optimized certain settings that are affecting your battery life. Here are some potential causes and suggestions to help you troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Adaptive Battery Management**: Samsung's Adaptive Battery Management feature might be causing the battery drain. Go to Settings > Device care > Battery > Adaptive battery, and toggle it off to see if it makes a difference.\n2. **Power-hungry features**: Some features like Always-On Display, Edge Lighting, or gesture navigation might be consuming more power than before. Try disabling them temporarily to see if it improves battery life. You can find these settings in Settings > Display or Settings > Advanced features.\n3. **Background app refresh**: As I mentioned earlier, some apps might be refreshing in the background more frequently, causing battery drain. Check the \"Battery\" or \"Device maintenance\" section to identify and restrict background app refresh for certain apps.\n4. **5G connectivity**: If you're in an area with 5G coverage, your phone might be using more power to maintain a 5G connection. Try switching to 4G or LTE to see if it improves battery life. Go to Settings > Connections > Mobile networks > Network mode.\n5. **Charging habits**: Since your phone gets warm when charging, it's possible that the fast charging feature is causing the issue. Try switching to a slower charging method or using a different charger to see if it makes a difference.\n6. **Battery calibration**: As I mentioned earlier, try calibrating your battery by letting it drain to 0% and then charging it to 100%. Repeat this process a few times to see if it improves the battery life.\n7. **Software glitch**: It's possible that the software update introduced a glitch that's affecting battery life. Try performing a \"Software update\" in Settings > Software update to see if there are any new updates available.\n\nTo further troubleshoot, I recommend using Samsung's built-in diagnostic tool:\n\n1. Go to Settings > Device care > Diagnostics\n2. Run the \"Battery diagnosis\" test\n3. Review the results to see if it identifies any issues or provides recommendations\n\nIf none of these steps improve your battery life, you may want to consider visiting a Samsung authorized service center or contacting their support team for further assistance.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to optimize your battery life by:\n\n* Reducing screen brightness and turning off unnecessary features\n* Using Power saving mode or Adaptive power saving\n* Closing unused apps and limiting background app refresh\n* Avoiding extreme temperatures and keeping your phone away from direct sunlight\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
