It's possible that you're thinking of a different theme park or a different event.\n\nAs a friendly AI, I've been trying to help you figure out the details, but it seems that the information you provided is not based on a real theme park or event.\n\nIf you're still interested in booking a private room for Rachel's birthday, I'd be happy to help you explore options at real theme parks in your area. Could you please tell me what city or state you're located in, or what theme parks are nearby? I can try to provide you with information on private room options and help you plan a fun celebration for Rachel's birthday!",
