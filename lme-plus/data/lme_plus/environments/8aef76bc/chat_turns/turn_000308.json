  "content": "That's great to hear! Lavender oil is a wonderful choice for promoting relaxation and focus during yoga practice. And peppermint oil can be a fantastic addition to your pre-practice routine to give you a boost of energy and invigoration. It's always exciting to experiment with different essential oils and find what works best for you.\n\nRemember to start with small amounts and adjust to your liking, as essential oils can be potent. Also, be sure to dilute the peppermint oil with a carrier oil before applying it to your skin, as it can be quite strong.\n\nIt's wonderful that you're taking the time to explore and customize your yoga practice to suit your needs. Keep experimenting, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.\n\nHappy practicing, and I hope you enjoy your peppermint-infused pre-practice routine!",
