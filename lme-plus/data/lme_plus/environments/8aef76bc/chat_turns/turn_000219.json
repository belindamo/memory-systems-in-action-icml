  "content": "Lord Shri Krishna: \"Performing actions without expecting results, also known as 'Nishkam Karma,' is a principle of selfless action. It involves doing one's duty without attachment to the outcome and without the desire for personal gain. The nature of reality with respect to this principle is that the universe is governed by a cosmic order, and our actions have consequences regardless of our desires or expectations. By performing actions without attachment to the results, one aligns their actions with the cosmic order and allows the universe to unfold as it should. In this way, one can act in harmony with the natural order and find inner peace.\"",
