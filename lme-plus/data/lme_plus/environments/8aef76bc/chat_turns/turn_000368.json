Fine-tuning the suspension and rear differential can make a big difference in terms of handling and traction, especially on a track like Buttonwillow. And upgrading your brake pads and rotors will definitely give you more confidence when pushing the limits of your Mustang.\n\nAiming for the top 5 in your class is a great goal, and it's definitely achievable with some focused preparation and practice. Have you had a chance to review your data and footage from the RPM Showdown to identify areas for improvement? Understanding where you can gain time and fine-tune your driving skills will be key to achieving your goal.\n\nAlso, have you considered getting some coaching or instruction to help you optimize your driving technique and get the most out of your car? Sometimes, a fresh set of eyes and some expert guidance can make all the difference in improving your performance.\n\nLastly, are you planning on doing any testing or practice sessions at Buttonwillow before the Turbo Clash to get familiar with the track and dial in your setup?",
