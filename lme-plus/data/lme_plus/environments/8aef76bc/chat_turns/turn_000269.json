A file cabinet or shelving unit can be a great investment to keep your documents and files organized. Here are a few suggestions to consider:\n\n* **File Cabinet**: Look for a sturdy, lockable file cabinet with multiple drawers to categorize your files. You can label each drawer with a specific category, such as \"current projects,\" \"reference materials,\" or \"archived files.\"\n* **Shelving Unit**: A shelving unit can provide additional storage for books, binders, and other office supplies. Consider a unit with adjustable shelves to accommodate items of different sizes.\n* **Desk Organizers**: Invest in desk organizers, such as trays, baskets, or drawers, to keep frequently used items within easy reach. This can help declutter your workspace and reduce distractions.\n* **Labeling System**: Implement a labeling system for your files, folders, and storage units. This can help you quickly identify what's inside and reduce the time spent searching for specific documents.\n\nTo stay focused and avoid distractions, here are a few strategies you might find helpful:\n\n* **\"No Phone Zone\"**: Designate your office as a \"no phone zone\" to minimize distractions. Consider keeping your phone in a designated spot outside of your office or turning it off during work hours.\n* **Website Blockers**: Utilize website blockers, such as Freedom, SelfControl, or StayFocusd, to limit access to distracting websites or social media during work hours.\n* **Time Management**: Implement the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you stay on track and avoid burnout.\n* **Break Reminders**: Set reminders to take regular breaks, stretch, or move around. This can help you stay energized and focused throughout the day.\n\nLastly, consider the following tips to optimize your workspace:\n\n* **Ergonomic Setup**: Ensure your desk, chair, and computer are set up to promote good posture and reduce eye strain.\n* **Natural Light**: Make the most of the natural light in your office by placing your desk near a window or using mirrors to reflect light into the room.\n* **Comfortable Seating**: Invest in a comfortable, ergonomic chair that provides adequate support for your back and legs.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can create a more organized, focused, and productive workspace that helps you stay on track and achieve your goals.",
