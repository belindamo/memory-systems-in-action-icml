  "content": "I think I'll go with the Grilled Lemon Herb Chicken. I love the idea of a light and refreshing main course that won't overpower the flavors of the Summer Sunset Spritz and appetizers. Plus, it's easy to make and can be prepared in advance, which is a big plus for a dinner party.\n\nSpeaking of preparation, do you have any tips on how to plan and execute a smooth dinner party? I want to make sure everything goes off without a hitch and my guests have a great time.",
