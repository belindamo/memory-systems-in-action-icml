Here are some tips on what to eat before, during, and after your runs:\n\n**Before Your Run:**\n\n1. **Carb-loading**: Focus on complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which provide sustained energy. Good options include:\n\t* Oatmeal with banana and honey\n\t* Whole-grain toast with avocado and eggs\n\t* Greek yogurt with berries and granola\n2. **Hydrate**: Drink 16-20 ounces of water or a sports drink 1-2 hours before your run to ensure you're well-hydrated.\n3. **Avoid heavy meals**: Eat a light meal or snack 1-2 hours before your run to avoid digestive discomfort. Avoid heavy, greasy, or spicy foods.\n4. **Caffeine**: If you're sensitive to caffeine, consider avoiding it or limiting it to a small amount 30-60 minutes before your run.\n\n**During Your Run:**\n\n1. **Hydrate**: Aim to drink 8-10 ounces of water or a sports drink every 10-15 minutes. You can also use energy gels, chews, or tablets for quick energy boosts.\n2. **Electrolytes**: If you're running in hot weather or for an extended period, consider consuming electrolyte-rich drinks or snacks to replenish lost salts.\n3. **Energy gels or chews**: If you need a quick energy boost, use energy gels or chews that contain carbohydrates, electrolytes, and caffeine (if you're comfortable with it).\n\n**After Your Run:**\n\n1. **Replenish carbohydrates**: Within 30-60 minutes after your run, consume a mix of carbohydrates and protein to replenish energy stores and support muscle recovery. Examples include:\n\t* Banana with peanut butter and honey\n\t* Chocolate milk and a handful of nuts\n\t* Smoothie with yogurt, fruit, and honey\n2. **Protein for recovery**: Aim for 15-20 grams of protein within 30-60 minutes after your run to support muscle repair and recovery. Good sources include:\n\t* Greek yogurt\n\t* Lean meats (chicken, turkey, fish)\n\t* Nuts and seeds\n3. **Hydrate**: Continue to drink water or a sports drink to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes.\n4. **Post-run meal**: Within 1-2 hours after your run, eat a balanced meal that includes complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats. Examples include:\n\t* Grilled chicken with quinoa and steamed vegetables\n\t* Whole-grain pasta with lean beef and marinara sauce\n\t* Salad with grilled salmon, avocado, and whole-grain croutons\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Experiment and find what works for you**: Everyone's digestive system is different, so try different foods and drinks to see what works best for you.\n2. **Avoid new foods on race day**: Stick to familiar foods and drinks on race day to minimize the risk of digestive discomfort.\n3. **Listen to your body**: If you experience digestive issues or discomfort during or after your runs, adjust your nutrition plan accordingly.\n\nRemember, nutrition is a personalized aspect of training, so it's essential to experiment and find what works best for you. If you have specific dietary restrictions or concerns, consider consulting a sports dietitian or a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.\n\nHow's your current nutrition plan looking? Are there any specific foods or drinks you're unsure about?",
