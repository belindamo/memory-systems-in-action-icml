I'm here to provide information and answer your questions to the best of my abilities!\n\nHowever, I'd love to hear about your experience attending the production! What stood out to you about the performance, set design, or direction? Was there a particular aspect that resonated with you, or a moment that left a lasting impression?\n\nSharing your thoughts will help me better understand your perspective and provide more tailored recommendations or insights about the play.",
