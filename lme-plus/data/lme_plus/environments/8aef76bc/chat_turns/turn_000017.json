  "content": "I think I see where the confusion is. Unfortunately, I have to break the news to you that Adventure Land theme park is not a real theme park. It's possible that it's a fictional park, or it could be a generic name used for a local event or festival.\n\nScream Fest is a common name for Halloween-themed events, so it's likely that it was a one-time event or a recurring event held at a different venue. Without more information about the location or the organizers of the event, it's difficult for me to pinpoint the exact venue or find information about private room bookings.\n\nIf you remember any other details about the event, such as the city or state where it was held, the type of attractions or activities available, or any distinctive features of the venue, it might help me narrow down the search. Alternatively, you can try searching online for \"Scream Fest\" along with the city or state where you attended the event to see if it was a one-time event or a recurring festival.\n\nI'm happy to help you brainstorm alternative options for celebrating Rachel's birthday, though!",
