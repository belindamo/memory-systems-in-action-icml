As an AI language model, I do not have access to JURIST's internal policies, nor do I have specific knowledge of past partnerships they have pursued with law schools or institutions. However, I can suggest that you visit JURIST's website to view their past partnerships and collaborations, as well as their mission and values. Such information would provide a better understanding of JURIST's priorities and criteria for partnerships.",
