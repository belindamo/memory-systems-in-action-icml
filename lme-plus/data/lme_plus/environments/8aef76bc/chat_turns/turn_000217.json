Here is a hypothetical answer from Lord Shri Krishna to your question:\n\nLord Shri Krishna: \"To give up attachment to materialism and sensual gratification, one must understand the fleeting nature of these things and the eternal nature of the soul. One must focus on the spiritual self and not be swayed by temporary desires. One must also understand that true happiness comes from within, not from external sources. Cultivate detachment by performing actions without attachment to their fruits, and engage in selfless service to others.\"",
