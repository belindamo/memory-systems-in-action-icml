However, let's focus on identifying the cause of the battery drain and overheating issue.\n\nSince you suspect that the recent software update might be the culprit, let's explore that possibility. Here are some potential causes and suggestions to help you troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Software update bugs**: It's possible that the recent software update introduced some bugs that are causing the battery drain and overheating. Check if there are any new updates available, and install them to see if it resolves the issue.\n2. **Background app refresh**: After an update, some apps might be refreshing in the background more frequently, causing battery drain. Go to your phone's settings, then to \"Battery\" or \"Device maintenance,\" and check which apps are consuming the most power. You can restrict background app refresh for certain apps or limit their battery usage.\n3. **New features or services**: The update might have introduced new features or services that are consuming more power. Review the update's changelog or release notes to see if there are any new features that might be causing the issue.\n4. **Battery calibration**: Sometimes, a software update can affect the battery's calibration. Try calibrating your battery by letting it drain to 0% and then charging it to 100%. Repeat this process a few times to see if it improves the battery life.\n5. **Hardware issues**: Although less likely, it's possible that the software update revealed an underlying hardware issue. If your phone is old or has been subjected to physical damage, it could be causing the battery to drain faster. In this case, you might need to visit a authorized service center for a diagnosis.\n\nTo help you better, can you please provide more information about your phone, such as:\n\n* The phone model and operating system version\n* The exact date of the software update\n* The average battery life you're getting now compared to before the update\n* Any other symptoms you've noticed, such as slow performance or unexpected shutdowns\n\nLet's work together to troubleshoot the issue and get your phone's battery life back to normal!",
