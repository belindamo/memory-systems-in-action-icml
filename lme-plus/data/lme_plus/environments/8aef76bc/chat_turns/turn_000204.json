I've noticed my phone heating up more than usual, and I think it might be due to a recent software update. By the way, I've been using a portable power bank from Anker that I got on March 10th, which has been a lifesaver on long days - it cost around $40 and has been worth every penny. Can you help me figure out what's going on with my battery?",
