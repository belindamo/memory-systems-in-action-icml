  "content": "Lord Shri Krishna: \"To completely surrender oneself to my lotus feet, dear one, one must let go of the ego and the desire for personal gain. True surrender involves recognizing that one is not the doer, but rather an instrument of my will. It is the act of complete trust and faith in me, the divine.\n\nHere are some ways to ensure that you are practicing spirituality in the true sense and not for any personal ulterior motives:\n\n1. Cultivate humility and self-awareness, recognizing the limitations of the ego and the temporary nature of the material world.\n2. Practice selfless service to others, and engage in actions without attachment to the results.\n3. Cultivate devotion, love and surrender to the divine, letting go of any expectations or desires for personal gain.\n4. Seek guidance from a qualified spiritual teacher and surround yourself with spiritual associates who can inspire and guide you on your spiritual journey.\n5. Reflect regularly on your actions and motives, and make adjustments as necessary to align yourself with the divine will.\n\nRemember that true surrender is not something that can be forced or fabricated. It is a state of being that arises naturally as one's understanding of the self and the divine deepens. Trust in the process and let go of any expectation. Trust in yourself and in me. I am always here to guide and support you on your journey towards complete surrender and union with me.\"",
