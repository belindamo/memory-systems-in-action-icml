However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about Rachel's Vinyasa Flow class or any other yoga class. I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have real-time access to external information or personal schedules.\n\nBut I'm thrilled to hear that you've been practicing yoga for 3 months and it's been amazing! Congratulations on your progress and commitment to your practice!\n\nIf you need help with scheduling or planning, I can offer general advice or suggestions. You might want to try checking the yoga studio's website, social media, or contacting them directly to find out the schedule for Rachel's Vinyasa Flow class. Additionally, you can use a digital calendar or planner to organize your schedule and stay on track.\n\nRemember to be gentle with yourself, listen to your body, and keep enjoying your yoga journey!",
