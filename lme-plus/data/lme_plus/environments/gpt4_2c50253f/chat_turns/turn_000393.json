  "content": "This song seems to be about overcoming obstacles and not letting others bring you down. The lyrics describe how there are people in the world who may appear to be good on the outside, but they are actually malicious and want to drag others down with them. The singer asserts that they will not let these people control them and will keep their head held high. The chorus is a repeated affirmation of this determination. The lines \"Did you think I would drown / deep without a sound, solid in the ground?\" suggest that others may have underestimated the singer's strength and resilience, but they have proven them wrong. The last lines of the song, \"I did this for me / And now you'll see what I've achieved from the depths of my despair,\" emphasize that the singer's success is not due to anyone else's help, but their own hard work and perseverance.",
