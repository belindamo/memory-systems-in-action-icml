  "content": "Condition Red nods and starts to do some research on the daemonites. He scours the internet and various forums for any mention of them, but there doesn't seem to be much information available to the public.\n\nAfter a few hours of searching, he comes across a private message board that discusses unusual occurrences and conspiracy theories. There, he finds a thread dedicated to the daemonites, and several users who claim to have encountered them in the past.\n\nCondition Red reaches out to the users privately, and after some back and forth communication, he discovers that one of them, who goes by the username \"Specter\", has extensive knowledge of the daemonites and their activities on Earth.\n\nHe shares this information with the rest of the team and suggests reaching out to Specter for more information and possibly recruiting them to our cause.",
