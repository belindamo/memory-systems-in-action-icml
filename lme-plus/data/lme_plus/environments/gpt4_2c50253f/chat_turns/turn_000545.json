  "content": "Based on the lyrics you provided for \"Just Another Day\" by Oingo Boingo, I think the most unexpected theme is the reference to \"razors in my bed\" that come out at night. This line is quite unexpected because it is a metaphor and doesn't seem to be fitting with the other lyrics in the song. The lyrics are primarily focused on the monotony of daily life, fear and violence, and dreams and nightmares, the theme of \"razors in my bed\" is not clearly connected with any of those themes, but it seems to be a metaphor for something else. Without more context, it's hard to say what exactly the metaphor is intended to represent, but it certainly adds a level of intrigue and mystery to the song.",
