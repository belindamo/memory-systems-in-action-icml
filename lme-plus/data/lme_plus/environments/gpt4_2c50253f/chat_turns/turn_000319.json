Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n**Customizing Block Sessions on Freedom:**\n\n1. **Open Freedom**: Launch the Freedom app on your device (available on desktop, mobile, or browser extension).\n2. **Create a New Block Session**: Tap/click on the \"New Block\" button.\n3. **Choose Your Devices**: Select the devices you want to block social media on (e.g., laptop, phone, tablet, or all devices).\n4. **Select the Block List**: Choose the pre-set block list you want to use (e.g., \"Social Media\", \"Distracting Websites\", or create a custom list).\n5. **Set the Block Duration**: Choose the duration of the block session (e.g., 2 hours, 4 hours, or custom).\n6. **Schedule the Block**: Set the start and end time for the block session. You can choose a one-time block or recurring blocks (e.g., every weekday from 9 am to 12 pm).\n7. **Add Exceptions**: If needed, add specific websites or apps you want to allow during the block session (e.g., work-related platforms).\n8. **Save the Block**: Name your block session and save it.\n\n**Tips for Setting Realistic Goals:**\n\n1. **Start Small**: Begin with short block sessions (e.g., 1-2 hours) and gradually increase the duration as you build self-regulation skills.\n2. **Identify Your Goals**: Reflect on why you want to block social media. Is it to increase productivity, reduce distractions, or improve mental health? Set specific, measurable goals (e.g., \"I want to write for 2 hours without checking social media\").\n3. **Schedule Around Your Needs**: Block social media during times when you need to focus (e.g., work hours, studying, or creative projects).\n4. **Leave Buffer Time**: Allow some buffer time between block sessions to accommodate unexpected tasks or breaks.\n5. **Be Flexible**: Don't be too hard on yourself if you need to adjust your block sessions. Life can be unpredictable, and it's essential to find a balance that works for you.\n6. **Monitor Progress**: Use Freedom's analytics to track your progress, identify patterns, and adjust your block sessions accordingly.\n7. **Reward Yourself**: Celebrate your successes and reward yourself for staying focused during block sessions. This will help motivate you to continue your progress.\n\nRemember, the key is to set realistic goals that align with your needs and lifestyle. Start with a conservative approach and adjust as needed. Good luck, and I hope Freedom helps you stay focused and productive!",
