  "content": "If customers purchase the Video Marvels Ultimate Bundle, which includes the OTO2 - Video Marvels Elite Club with recurring monthly subscription, you can offer them a special deal on the recurring payments. There are a few ways you can approach this:\n\n1. Offer a discounted rate for the recurring subscription: If the standalone OTO2 has a recurring fee of $27-$47 per month, you could offer a discounted rate of $17-$37 per month for those who purchase the bundle. This provides an additional incentive for customers to buy the complete package.\n2. Include a certain number of months free: Offer customers who purchase the bundle a specific number of months of free access to the Video Marvels Elite Club. For example, you could provide 3 or 6 months of free membership, after which they would be charged the regular monthly rate.\n3. Offer a lifetime membership at a one-time fee: Instead of a recurring subscription for the Video Marvels Elite Club, you could provide a lifetime membership for those who purchase the bundle. This would be a one-time fee (already included in the bundle price) that grants customers permanent access to the Elite Club features, without any additional monthly charges.\n\nRemember to clearly state the terms of the deal for the OTO2 recurring subscription when customers purchase the bundle, so they are fully aware of the costs and benefits associated with their purchase.",
