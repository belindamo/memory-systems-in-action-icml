  "content": "Grifter realizes the importance of finding out more about these alien creatures and their potential threat to the world. He knows that he can't do it alone and decides to reach out to some of his contacts in the intelligence community for help.\n\nHe contacts his old friend and fellow Team 7 member, John Lynch, who now works for the International Operations (I.O.) organization. He briefs Lynch on what he has witnessed, including the fact that the creatures seemed to be able to possess human bodies and take on their appearance.\n\nLynch agrees to help Grifter investigate this new threat and brings in the resources of I.O. to aid in their efforts. They begin to scour intelligence reports and gather information from their sources to learn more about these mysterious creatures.\n\nAs they delve deeper into their investigation, they discover that these beings are part of a larger alien race that has been secretly infiltrating Earth for years, covertly taking over human bodies to further their own agenda. The creatures are incredibly difficult to detect and even harder to kill, making them a formidable and dangerous enemy.\n\nGrifter and Lynch work together to develop a plan to stop the alien infiltration and protect humanity from this new threat. They know it won't be easy, but they are committed to the mission and will do whatever it takes to save the world from this alien menace.",
