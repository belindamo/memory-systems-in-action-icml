  "content": "The Paterson Police Department is facing criticism after the fatal shooting of a 31-year-old man, Najee Seabrooks, who worked with the city's Violence Intervention Program and was reportedly experiencing a mental health crisis. The police were called to his apartment and tried to de-escalate the situation for four hours before shooting him. Members of the Paterson Healing Collective (PHC), an organization for which Seabrooks worked, were at the scene but were not allowed to help him. Local activists are circulating a petition with over 4,300 signatures condemning the police department and demanding a total restructuring. There are calls for crisis assistance teams to be implemented in the city of Paterson, like in Oakland, to reduce such events. Governor Phil Murphy has announced $10 million for Arrive Together, a program that pairs social workers with police to specifically deal with people in emotional crisis. But critics say that is a small amount compared to police budgets, and they are calling for the state to do more for crisis intervention groups like PHC. A coalition of social justice organizations, including PHC and Black Lives Matter Patterson, will hold a prayer vigil and demonstration outside City Hall tomorrow, hoping that this tragedy will serve as a tipping point for police-community relations in Paterson.\n\nThree interesting quotes from the transcript are:\n\n1. \"The very services we're trained to provide were denied to Najee.\" - Liza Chowdury, leader of the Paterson Healing Collective.\n2. \"We know that the reason why the violence interruption groups exist because the police aren't equipped to handle many situations of crisis. And the police shouldn't be the only solution to handling crisis.\" - Charles Boyer of Salvation and Social Justice.\n3. \"If we can filter billions of dollars to police departments in the state of New Jersey, surely we can fund these and stand up these organizations at the same level.\" - Charles Boyer of Salvation and Social Justice.",
