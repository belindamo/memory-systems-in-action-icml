However, I think there might be some confusion - I'm a large language model, I don't have personal relationships or interactions, so I didn't take Ethan to a pediatrician appointment. But I'm happy to help you with your question!\n\nIncluding the baby's name and birthdate on the onesies or banners is a wonderful idea! It adds a personal touch to the garland and makes it even more special for your cousin and their baby. You could also consider including other details like the baby's weight, length, or time of birth to make it even more personalized.\n\nHere are a few ways you could incorporate the baby's name and birthdate into the garland:\n\n1. **Onesie Design**: Design a custom onesie with the baby's name and birthdate printed on it. You could use a cute font and add some decorative elements like stars or hearts.\n2. **Banner**: Create a banner with the baby's name and birthdate in bold letters. You could add some cute graphics like baby blocks or rattles to make it more festive.\n3. **Photo Overlay**: Overlay the baby's name and birthdate onto a photo of the baby, and then print it out and attach it to a onesie or banner.\n\nRemember to keep the design simple and easy to read, so the focus remains on the baby's special milestones. And don't forget to get your cousin's approval before finalizing the design!\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to see how your garland turns out!",
