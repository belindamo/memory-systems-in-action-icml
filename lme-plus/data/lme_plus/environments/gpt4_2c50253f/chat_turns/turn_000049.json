Here are a few ways you can do it:\n\n1. **Printed Iron-On Transfers**: You can print out small photos of the baby on iron-on transfer paper, and then iron them onto the onesies. This will give you a permanent, washable image on the onesie. Make sure to follow the instructions on the transfer paper carefully.\n2. **Photo Editing Software**: Use a photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop or Canva to add the baby's picture to a digital onesie template. You can then print out the designed onesies on paper or cardstock and hang them up.\n3. **Decoupage**: Cut out small photos of the baby and decoupage them onto the onesies using a glue stick or decoupage medium. This will give you a more textured, layered look.\n4. **Photo Printing Services**: Some online photo printing services, like Shutterfly or Snapfish, offer custom onesie printing with photos. You can upload the baby's pictures and order custom onesies with the photos printed directly on them.\n\nOnce you've added the photos to the onesies, you can string them together with twine, ribbon, or yarn to create a beautiful, personalized garland. You could also add other embellishments like buttons, bows, or ribbons to make it even more special.\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to get your cousin's permission before using their baby's photos.\n* Choose photos that are clear and well-lit, and that show the baby's face clearly.\n* Consider using a mix of black and white and color photos to add visual interest to the garland.\n* If you're short on time, you could also use ultrasound pictures or baby-themed graphics instead of photos.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
