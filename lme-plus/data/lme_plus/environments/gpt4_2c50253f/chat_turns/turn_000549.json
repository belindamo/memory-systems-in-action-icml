  "content": "Yes, besides the metaphor of \"razors in my bed\" that represents the protagonist's violent dreams and nightmares, I think there are other surprising elements in the song \"Just Another Day\" by Oingo Boingo that can be seen as:\n\n* The line \"I had a dream last night, the world was set on fire\" is a surprising image as it implies a catastrophic event that is different from the daily life, violence, and fear that the song is focused on. It adds a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness to the overall atmosphere of the song.\n* The reference to \"people wake from dreams, with voices in their ears, that will not go away\" is a surprising element as it implies that the protagonist's reality is affected by what he/she hears and sees in the dreams, it might be an allusion to something more serious than just nightmares, like post-traumatic stress disorder, for instance.\n* The repeated mention of a \"smile on my face, for everyone\" might seem surprising because it doesn't fit with the overall atmosphere of the song, which is mainly focused on fear, violence and the monotony of daily life. It can be interpreted as a sign of resilience and optimism in the face of adversity, or it could be a way of coping with the reality.\n\nOverall, the song \"Just Another Day\" by Oingo Boingo has a complex structure and themes, and it's packed with surprising elements that adds depth and intrigue to the lyrics.",
