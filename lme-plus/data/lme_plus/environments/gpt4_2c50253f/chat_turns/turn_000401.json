  "content": "The lyrics of \"Altar in the Sun\" seem to be more focused on themes of risk-taking, adrenaline, and a sense of urgency, rather than existentialism. The lines \"Blood in, blood out/Locked in till I\u2019m living in a box/But how else does anyone leave?\" suggest a feeling of being trapped or confined, but the focus of the song seems to be on breaking free and taking risks to find something better. The repeated lines \"I love when things that used to hurt just turn me on/You can find me at my altar in the sun\" suggest a desire to embrace pain and use it as fuel for growth or excitement. Overall, the lyrics seem to be more about living in the moment and taking risks than grappling with existential questions.",
