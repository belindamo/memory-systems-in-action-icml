Here are some ways to cope with the intensity of grief:\n\n1. Practice self-care: Focus on taking care of yourself, both physically and emotionally. Regular exercise, eating well, and getting enough sleep can be helpful in minimizing stress and providing a healthy outlet for emotions.\n\n2. Seek support: Connect with others who can provide emotional support during this time. Reach out to family, friends or consider talking to a therapist or joining a support group.\n\n3. Allow yourself to feel your emotions: Instead of trying to suppress your feelings, try to recognize and acknowledge your emotions. Find a safe way to express your feelings, either through journaling, art, or talking to someone.\n\n4. Use relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, can help manage overwhelming emotions.\n\n5. Consider seeking professional help: If you feel like your grief is too much to handle or you need extra help, reach out to a mental health professional. They can offer guidance and support in managing the intensity of your feelings.\n\nRemember that it's okay to take time to heal and process your grief. Grief is a process that takes time, and everyone experiences it differently. Be patient and kind to yourself during this time.",
