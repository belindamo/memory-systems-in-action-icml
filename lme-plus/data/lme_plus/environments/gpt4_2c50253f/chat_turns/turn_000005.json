  "content": "Yes, that's a valid point. Social media has made it easier for the dissemination of unverified or fake news, which can spread quickly and influence people's perceptions and opinions. This can create a lack of trust in mainstream news and polling results, further complicating the process of gaining accurate data. Additionally, social media has contributed to the rise of alternative sources of information, which can shape people's views, making it difficult to predict election outcomes accurately. As a result, it is crucial for pollsters to exercise their best practices and for people to be aware of the challenges when interpreting polling data from social media platforms.",
