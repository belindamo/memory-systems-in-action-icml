It's great to hear that you're enjoying the experience so far.\n\nFor a 20-gallon tank, you have a lot of decoration options to choose from. Here are some popular and aquarium-safe ideas:\n\n1. **Live Plants**: Adding live plants can bring a natural touch to your tank. They also help to oxygenate the water and provide hiding places for your fish. Some popular options for a 20-gallon tank include Java Moss, Anacharis, and Water Wisteria.\n2. **Rocks and Caves**: Rocks and caves can create hiding places and visual interest in your tank. You can use natural rocks or artificial ones specifically designed for aquariums. Make sure to clean and prepare them properly before adding them to your tank.\n3. **Driftwood**: Driftwood can add a unique, natural element to your tank. It can also provide hiding places and create a sense of depth. Just be sure to boil or soak the driftwood before adding it to your tank to remove any tannins.\n4. **Decorative Gravel or Substrate**: You can choose a decorative gravel or substrate that complements the colors and theme of your tank. Some popular options include brightly colored gravel, sand, or even glass beads.\n5. **Treasure Chests or Sunken Ships**: If you want to add a fun, whimsical element to your tank, consider a treasure chest or sunken ship decoration. These can be a great way to create a themed tank and provide hiding places for your fish.\n6. **Artificial Corals or Reefs**: Artificial corals or reefs can add a pop of color and create a sense of depth in your tank. They can also provide hiding places and visual interest.\n7. **Water Features**: If you want to create movement and sound in your tank, consider adding a water feature like a waterfall or a bubbler.\n\nRemember to choose decorations that are safe for your fish and won't cause any water quality issues. Also, make sure to leave enough swimming space for your fish and avoid overcrowding the tank.\n\nWhich type of decoration are you leaning towards?
