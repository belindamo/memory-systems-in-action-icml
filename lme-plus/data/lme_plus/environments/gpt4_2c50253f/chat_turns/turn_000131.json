Here are some ways you can incorporate them into your routine:\n\n**Coconut Oil:**\n\n1. **Pre-Shampoo Treatment:** Apply a generous amount of coconut oil to your hair, from roots to ends, 30 minutes to an hour before washing. This helps to nourish and moisturize your hair, making it softer and more manageable.\n2. **Hair Mask:** Use coconut oil as a hair mask once or twice a week. Apply a generous amount to your hair, cover with a shower cap, and leave it on for 2-3 hours or overnight. Shampoo and condition as usual.\n3. **Leave-In Conditioner:** Apply a small amount of coconut oil to the ends of your hair as a leave-in conditioner to lock in moisture and reduce frizz.\n4. **Styling Product:** Use coconut oil as a styling product to add shine and tame flyaways. Apply a small amount to the ends of your hair or use it as a hair serum.\n\n**Argan Oil:**\n\n1. **Hair Serum:** Apply a few drops of argan oil to the ends of your hair as a finishing product to add shine, reduce frizz, and protect from heat damage.\n2. **Hair Mask:** Mix argan oil with a hair mask or use it as a standalone mask to nourish and moisturize your hair.\n3. **Leave-In Conditioner:** Apply a small amount of argan oil to the ends of your hair as a leave-in conditioner to lock in moisture and reduce breakage.\n4. **Scalp Treatment:** Massage argan oil into your scalp to stimulate hair growth, reduce dandruff, and soothe itchiness.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Always warm the oil in your hands before applying it to your hair to help it absorb better.\n* Start with a small amount and adjust as needed, as both coconut and argan oil can be rich and weigh your hair down if used excessively.\n* Mix coconut oil and argan oil together for an ultimate hair treatment.\n* Use high-quality, cold-pressed, and organic oils to ensure maximum benefits.\n* Be patient, as it may take some time to see the effects of using these oils.\n\n**Combining with Your Green Earth Shampoo:**\n\n* Use coconut oil or argan oil as a pre-shampoo treatment before washing with your Green Earth shampoo.\n* Apply a small amount of coconut oil or argan oil as a leave-in conditioner after washing with your Green Earth shampoo.\n* Mix a few drops of argan oil with your Green Earth conditioner for an extra dose of nourishment.\n\nRemember to always do a patch test before using any new hair products, including coconut oil and argan oil, to ensure you don't have any sensitivity or allergic reactions.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with incorporating coconut oil and argan oil into your hair care routine!",
