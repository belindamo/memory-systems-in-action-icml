  "content": "While it is true that many retailers have capitalized on the tradition of hanging stockings by producing and marketing a wide variety of stockings and stocking-related merchandise, the custom does have historical roots that predate modern commercialism. In fact, the practice of hanging stockings dates back centuries in many cultures around the world. For example, in some European countries, children would leave out their shoes or boots instead of stockings, and Saint Nicholas would fill them with gifts and treats. The tradition was also popularized in the poem 'A Visit from St. Nicholas,' which is more commonly known as 'The Night Before Christmas,' published in 1823. So while retailers may have capitalized on the tradition, the practice of hanging stockings has been a part of holiday traditions in many cultures for centuries.",
