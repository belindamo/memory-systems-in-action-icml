  "content": "That's wonderful! It's great to hear that you're connecting with like-minded people online, especially when it comes to sharing a passion for vegan cooking. Online communities and social media platforms can be a fantastic way to meet new people, learn from each other, and get inspired by new recipes and ideas.\n\nIt's also fantastic that you're open to experimenting with new ingredients and substitutions. Vegan cooking is all about creativity and flexibility, and it's amazing how many delicious and innovative recipes can be created with a little bit of experimentation.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what was the recipe video you commented on, and what ingredient were you discussing substitutions for? I'm always curious to learn more about new recipes and cooking techniques!\n\nAnd by the way, have you considered sharing your own vegan recipes or cooking experiences online? You could start a blog, YouTube channel, or social media account to share your passion with others. Who knows, you might just inspire someone to try vegan cooking for the first time!",
