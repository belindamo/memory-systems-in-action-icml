  "content": "My apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's recalculate the pro forma net income for the next year considering the 7% growth rate in EBIT.\n\n1. New Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT):\nNew EBIT = EBIT \\* (1 + Sales Growth Rate)\nNew EBIT = $2,647.0 \\* (1 + 0.07)\nNew EBIT = $2,647.0 \\* 1.07 \u2248 $2,831.29 million\n2. New Interest Expense:\nSince interest expense doesn't vary as a function of sales, it remains the same.\nNew Interest Expense = $334.7 million\n3. New Income Before Tax:\nNew Income Before Tax = New EBIT - New Interest Expense\nNew Income Before Tax = $2,831.29 - $334.7 \u2248 $2,496.59 million\n4. New Income Tax Expense:\nNew Income Tax Expense = New Income Before Tax \\* Tax Rate\nNew Income Tax Expense = $2,496.59 \\* 0.35 \u2248 $873.31 million\n5. New Net Income:\nNew Net Income = New Income Before Tax - New Income Tax Expense\nNew Net Income \u2248 $2,496.59 - $873.31 \u2248 $1,623.28 million\n\nThe amount closest to the pro forma net income for the next year is:\n\nc. $1,623.43 million",
