Opening up new trade routes: The discovery of the New World enabled European explorers to find new trade routes to Asia, Africa and the Americas. This allowed for a significant expansion of trade, which in turn led to the growth of international commerce.\n\n2. Acquisition of new resources: The New World was rich in resources such as precious metals, spices, and exotic foods that were unknown in Europe. The acquisition of these resources helped to fuel the growth of European economies and allowed them to become global powers.\n\n3. Colonization: The discovery of the New World also led to European powers colonizing various parts of the Americas. Countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, and England all established colonies in the New World, which led to the spread of European culture and ideas.\n\n4. Changes in international relations: The discovery of the New World led to changes in international relations as European nations, particularly Spain and Portugal, became dominant powers on the global stage.

It led to increased trade, the acquisition of new resources, significant colonization, and changes in international relations.",
