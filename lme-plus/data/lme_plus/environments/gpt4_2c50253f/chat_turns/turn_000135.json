Here's why:\n\n1. **Moisture boost:** Coconut oil can help nourish and moisturize your hair, but a deep conditioning treatment can provide an extra dose of hydration and repair.\n2. **Detangling:** Coconut oil can make your hair more prone to tangling, so a deep conditioning treatment can help detangle and add manageability.\n3. **pH balance:** Coconut oil can alter the pH of your scalp and hair, and a deep conditioning treatment can help restore the natural pH balance.\n\nA deep conditioning treatment can help lock in the benefits of the coconut oil pre-shampoo treatment and provide additional nourishment to your hair. You can use a deep conditioning mask or treatment product, or even a DIY treatment like a hair mask made with ingredients like avocado, honey, or olive oil.\n\nIf you decide to stick with your regular conditioner, that's okay too! However, keep in mind that a regular conditioner might not provide the same level of nourishment and repair as a deep conditioning treatment.\n\nHere's a suggested routine for you:\n\n1. Pre-shampoo treatment with coconut oil (30 minutes to 1 hour)\n2. Shampoo with your Green Earth sulfate-free shampoo\n3. Deep conditioning treatment (15-30 minutes)\n4. Rinse thoroughly and style as usual\n\nIf you don't have a deep conditioning treatment product, you can try a DIY treatment like this:\n\n* Mix 1 ripe avocado, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* Apply to your hair, focusing on the ends\n* Cover with a shower cap and leave on for 15-30 minutes\n* Rinse thoroughly and shampoo as usual\n\nRemember to be gentle when combing or detangling your hair after the treatment, as it may be more prone to tangling.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear about your experience with the coconut oil pre-shampoo treatment and deep conditioning!",
