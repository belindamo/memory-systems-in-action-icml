  "content": "The lyrics of \"Near-Life Experience\" seem to be about the fear and exhilaration of facing mortality and the importance of living life to the fullest. The opening lines about not knowing what hit you and playing with fire suggest that life can be unpredictable and dangerous, and that we should appreciate the time we have. The repeated refrain of \"this is a near-life experience\" emphasizes the intensity and urgency of the moment, and the need to seize the day. The lines about dancing on the edge with someone and losing your breath suggest a sense of risk and excitement, while the final lines about fighting to live before life is taken away reinforce the idea that life is fleeting and precious.",
