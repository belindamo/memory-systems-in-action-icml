  "content": "Multiplying the New Income Before Tax by (1 + Sales Growth Rate) as the very beginning of the calculation process would be incorrect because it wouldn't properly account for the growth in individual components of the income statement.\n\nThe pro forma net income calculation should be performed step by step, considering the growth rate for each component that varies as a function of sales (revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other income/expenses) while keeping interest expense constant.\n\nApplying the sales growth rate directly to the New Income Before Tax without considering the growth in each component of the income statement could lead to inaccurate results. By incorporating the sales growth rate into each relevant component, you can correctly estimate the impact of the growth on the company's financials and ultimately calculate the pro forma net income more accurately.",
