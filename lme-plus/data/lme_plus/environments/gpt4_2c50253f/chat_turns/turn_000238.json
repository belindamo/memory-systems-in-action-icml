  "content": "I've been thinking about my fueling strategy, and I plan to use a combination of energy gels, sports drinks, and water to stay fueled and hydrated during the marathon. I've been practicing with different types of fuel during my long runs to see what works best for me.\n\nI'm also planning to take advantage of the aid stations along the course, especially for water and electrolyte replenishment. I've heard that it's crucial to stay on top of hydration and electrolyte levels during a long race like a marathon.\n\nOne thing I'm still deciding on is whether to use a hydration belt or rely on the aid stations for water. I've heard pros and cons of both approaches, and I'm not sure what will work best for me.\n\nDo you have any advice on hydration belts vs. aid stations? Have you heard of any specific products or brands that work well for runners?",
