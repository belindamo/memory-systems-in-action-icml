  "content": "Yes, edible packaging currently has a higher cost than plastic packaging. The material itself is more expensive to produce, and processing and handling are also more complex. Companies are working to optimize the production process and reduce costs, but for now, edible packaging will likely be more expensive than traditional plastic packaging. However, it is important to consider the long-term benefits of using sustainable packaging options. Over time, increasing demand for sustainable packaging will drive down the costs of production, and recycling or reusing packaging materials will have an environmental impact. So while there may be some extra costs upfront, switching to sustainable packaging alternatives can help support long-term sustainability goals and ultimately save costs over time.",
