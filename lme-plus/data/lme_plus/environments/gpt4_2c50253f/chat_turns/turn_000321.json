Here's how:\n\n**Allowing Exceptions on Freedom:**\n\n1. **Open Freedom**: Launch the Freedom app on your device.\n2. **Edit Your Block Session**: Select the block session you want to edit and tap/click on the three dots (\u22ef) next to it.\n3. **Add an Exception**: Tap/click on \"Add Exception\" and enter the URL or domain you want to allow (e.g., Rachel's social media profile).\n4. **Choose the Exception Type**: Select whether you want to allow the entire domain (e.g., instagram.com) or a specific page (e.g., instagram.com/rachelinfluencer).\n5. **Save the Exception**: Tap/click \"Save\" to add the exception to your block session.\n\nBy adding exceptions, you can allow specific accounts or pages to bypass the block, ensuring you stay connected with important people or updates while still maintaining your focus and productivity.\n\n**Tips for Allowing Exceptions:**\n\n1. **Be Strategic**: Only allow exceptions for accounts or pages that are truly essential or bring value to your life.\n2. **Limit Exceptions**: Avoid adding too many exceptions, as this can defeat the purpose of blocking social media in the first place.\n3. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your exceptions to ensure they still align with your goals and priorities.\n\nBy setting realistic goals, allowing strategic exceptions, and reviewing your progress, you can maintain a healthy balance between staying connected and staying focused.\n\nHow do you plan to balance your social media usage with your self-care goals, and what other strategies have you learned from the workshop on February 27?",
