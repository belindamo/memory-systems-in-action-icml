  "content": "No worries about the mistake!\n\nGreat choice on considering a hair oil! Both argan oil and coconut oil are excellent options. \n\nWhen it comes to applying the oil, it's generally recommended to focus on the ends of your hair, as this is where hair tends to be driest and most prone to breakage. Applying oil to the ends can help:\n\n* Lock in moisture and reduce frizz\n* Nourish and protect the hair shaft\n* Add shine and softness\n\nHowever, if you have very dry or damaged hair, you may want to apply the oil all over your hair, from roots to ends. This can help provide an intense dose of moisture and nourishment.\n\nWhen applying the oil, remember to start with a small amount (about a quarter-sized amount) and work your way up as needed. You can always add more oil, but it's harder to remove excess oil from your hair.\n\nHere's a tip: Warm the oil in your hands before applying it to your hair. This can help the oil penetrate more easily and evenly distribute throughout your hair.\n\nWhich oil do you think you'll try first, argan or coconut?",
