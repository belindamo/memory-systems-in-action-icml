  "content": "Yes, some of the cafes in Kenilworth offer gluten-free options. Here are some of them:\n\n1. Talulah's Sippy Cow Cafe: They offer gluten-free bread, gluten-free wraps, and gluten-free waffles. 2. Sweet Idea Bakery & Cafe: They offer gluten-free cakes, cupcakes, and other baked goods. 3. Muffin House Cafe: They offer gluten-free muffins and sandwiches. 4. Kenilworth Bagels & Cafe: They offer gluten-free bagels and gluten-free bread. 5. Fleur De Lys Restaurant & Cafe: They have some gluten-free options on their menu, such as gluten-free crepes. However, please note that even though the cafes make an effort to avoid cross-contamination, there may be a risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients, as the kitchens are not strictly gluten-free. It's always best to inform the cafe of your dietary restrictions and ask about their preparation methods before ordering.",
