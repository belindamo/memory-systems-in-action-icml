  "content": "I apologize for the confusion, Yes it is a metaphor for the violent dreams and nightmares, it's a representation of a fear or a danger that's present even when the protagonist is supposed to be safe and comfortable in their own bed. It shows how fear or violence can be present in one's own mind even when you feel secure, and it could be interpreted as the protagonist's fear of losing control or falling into bad habits. The metaphor also gives a sense of claustrophobia, where the protagonist feels trapped by their own fears and nightmares even when in a place of supposed safety and privacy, their bed. The theme of razors in my bed is an important addition to the theme of nightmares, showing the protagonist's state of mind and his inner world.",
