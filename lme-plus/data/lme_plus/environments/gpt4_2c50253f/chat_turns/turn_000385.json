However, the repetition of the phrase \"some faces I know\" and the reference to various locations around the world suggest that the song is about encountering familiar faces or memories in different places. \"I see you\" could be interpreted as a recognition or acknowledgement of these faces or memories. It's also possible that the phrase has a more metaphorical or abstract meaning related to the theme of the song.",
