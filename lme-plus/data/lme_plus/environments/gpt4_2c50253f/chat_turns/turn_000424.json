  "content": "I'm trying to create a personalized morning routine that works for me. I've recently started going for a 30-minute walk before work, which has been great. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I've also started waking up 15 minutes earlier to meditate and practice some yoga poses, which has helped me feel more centered and calm. Can you suggest some healthy breakfast ideas that I can prep the night before to start my day on a good note?",
