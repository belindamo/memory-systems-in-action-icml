  "content": "The development of edible packaging is still in its early stages, and manufacturers are working to create materials that can withstand moisture and spills. Some edible packaging materials today are coated with a layer of wax or plant-based oil to provide a layer of protection, while others are made from starch-based materials that are water-resistant. Additionally, it is important to note that edible packaging is not meant for all types of food. It is most suitable for dry or semi-dry goods, such as snacks or confectionery products. So, while edible packaging has many sustainable benefits, it is important to test and develop it to ensure it is safe and effective for use.",
