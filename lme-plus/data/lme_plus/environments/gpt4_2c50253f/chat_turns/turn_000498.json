For instance, you enter into a contract when you buy a loaf of bread, negotiate a pay rise or buy a movie ticket.\n\nMost contract disputes arise when a party to the contract breaches a term that is written or implied in the contract.\n\nA breach of contract usually occurs through:\n\na failure to perform on time;\na failure to perform to an agreed standard; or\na refusal or inability to perform at all.\nA breach of contract can have a severe impact on people and businesses.
