The correct answer to the 3rd scenario-based multiple choice question about how trainers and teachers can apply the Socratic Method is c) When delivering a technical training that requires specific knowledge and skills.\n\nIn a technical training that requires specific knowledge and skills, it may be more appropriate for the trainer to present the information in a clear and concise manner rather than engaging in a discussion or using the Socratic Method. The Socratic Method may be more useful in situations that require critical thinking and analysis, such as brainstorming or team-building exercises.",
