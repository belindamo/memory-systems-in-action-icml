Both serums and oils can provide benefits, but they have some differences:\n\n**Hair Serums:**\n\n* Typically lightweight and non-greasy\n* Often contain silicones, which can help smooth the hair cuticle and add shine\n* Can help detangle and add manageability\n* May not provide as much moisture as oils, but can help lock in moisture from previous treatments\n\n**Hair Oils:**\n\n* Can be more nourishing and moisturizing than serums\n* Often contain antioxidants and fatty acids that can help repair and protect hair\n* Can be more effective at locking in moisture and reducing frizz\n* May weigh hair down if used excessively\n\nConsidering you've just done a deep conditioning treatment and hair mask, I'd recommend using a lightweight hair oil that won't weigh your hair down. A oil can help lock in the moisture and benefits from your treatments, while adding a touch of shine and softness.\n\nHere are some oil options you could consider:\n\n* Argan oil: Rich in antioxidants and fatty acids, argan oil can help nourish and protect your hair.\n* Coconut oil: A lightweight coconut oil can help lock in moisture and add shine, while being gentle on your hair.\n* Jojoba oil: Similar in composition to the natural oils produced by our scalp, jojoba oil can help balance and nourish your hair.\n\nApply a small amount of oil to the ends of your hair, working your way up to the mid-lengths. Avoid applying oil to the roots, as this can weigh your hair down.\n\nRemember to start with a small amount and adjust as needed, as oils can be rich and overpowering if used excessively.\n\nAfter applying the oil, you can style your hair as usual. If you want to add an extra layer of protection and shine, you could use a lightweight hair serum on top of the oil.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear about your hair care experience!",
