The Hilton Denver City Center**: This hotel is located in the heart of downtown Denver, within walking distance to the Colorado Convention Center, Larimer Square, and many restaurants and bars. The hotel features modern rooms, an outdoor pool, and a fitness center.\n\n**2. Hilton Garden Inn Denver Downtown**: This hotel is another great option in downtown Denver, with comfortable rooms, an indoor pool, and a fitness center. It's also close to the convention center and many attractions.\n\n**3. Conrad Denver Downtown**: If you're looking for a more luxurious Hilton experience, the Conrad is a great choice. This stylish hotel features modern rooms, a rooftop pool, and a fitness center. It's located in the LoDo neighborhood, close to Union Station and many restaurants.\n\n**4. Embassy Suites by Hilton Denver Downtown Convention Center**: If you're looking for a more spacious room with a separate living area, the Embassy Suites is a great option. This hotel features an indoor pool, a fitness center, and a free breakfast buffet.\n\n**5. Hilton Denver Inverness**: If you prefer to stay outside of downtown, the Hilton Denver Inverness is a great option. This hotel is located in the southern part of the city, near the Denver Tech Center, and features an outdoor pool, a fitness center, and a golf course.\n\nAll of these hotels offer a great Hilton experience, but if I had to pick one, I'd recommend the **Conrad Denver Downtown** for its luxurious amenities and great location.\n\nWhich one of these Hilton hotels in Denver sounds appealing to you?",
