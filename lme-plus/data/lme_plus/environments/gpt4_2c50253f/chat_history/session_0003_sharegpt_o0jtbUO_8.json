      "content": "If customers purchase the Video Marvels Ultimate Bundle, which includes the OTO2 - Video Marvels Elite Club with recurring monthly subscription, you can offer them a special deal on the recurring payments. There are a few ways you can approach this:\n\n1. Offer a discounted rate for the recurring subscription: If the standalone OTO2 has a recurring fee of $27-$47 per month, you could offer a discounted rate of $17-$37 per month for those who purchase the bundle. This provides an additional incentive for customers to buy the complete package.\n2. Include a certain number of months free: Offer customers who purchase the bundle a specific number of months of free access to the Video Marvels Elite Club. For example, you could provide 3 or 6 months of free membership, after which they would be charged the regular monthly rate.\n3. Offer a lifetime membership at a one-time fee: Instead of a recurring subscription for the Video Marvels Elite Club, you could provide a lifetime membership for those who purchase the bundle. This would be a one-time fee (already included in the bundle price) that grants customers permanent access to the Elite Club features, without any additional monthly charges.\n\nRemember to clearly state the terms of the deal for the OTO2 recurring subscription when customers purchase the bundle, so they are fully aware of the costs and benefits associated with their purchase."

      "content": "Option 3, offering a lifetime membership at a one-time fee for those who purchase the bundle, can be a good business decision if you consider a few factors:\n\n1. Attractiveness of the offer: By including a lifetime membership in the bundle, you're providing customers with an attractive incentive to buy the complete package. This can lead to higher sales and increased revenue for your product launch.\n2. Customer lifetime value: A lifetime membership can encourage long-term loyalty and engagement from your customers. This means that although they won't be paying recurring fees, they may be more likely to purchase other products or services from you in the future, increasing their overall lifetime value.\n3. Cost vs. revenue: Consider the costs associated with offering a lifetime membership (e.g., ongoing content updates, server maintenance, customer support) and weigh them against the potential revenue generated by the increased sales of the bundle. If the bundle's increased sales can offset the costs of providing lifetime access, it can be a viable business decision.\n4. Market competition: If your competitors are offering similar products with monthly subscription fees, a lifetime membership can give you a competitive edge and help you stand out in the market.\n\nKeep in mind that it's essential to evaluate your specific business model, target audience, and market competition before deciding if offering a lifetime membership is the best decision for your product."
