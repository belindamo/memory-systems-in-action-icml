Also, I don't have a specific time constraint, but I'd like to arrive with some time to spare before the meeting. By the way, I'm not familiar with the public transportation system in the city that well, as I just moved here recently, so any help would be great. I've been getting used to the new neighborhood, which has a lot more restaurants and shops within walking distance, but I haven't had a chance to explore much beyond that. Oh, and the commute should take around 45 minutes, if that helps."
