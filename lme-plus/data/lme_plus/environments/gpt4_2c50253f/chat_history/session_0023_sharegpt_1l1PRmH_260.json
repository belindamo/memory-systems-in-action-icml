Advice from the grant judge's mouth\nAlmost every grant agency staff person you speak to wants to read a clear and compelling application. One staffer explained to me how this works at the judging stage.\n\"What usually happens is we'll read a dozen or so, and a clearly-written application will make it to the \"next\" pile (for further consideration). Now having said that, the technology needs to be great as well. But you have to understand something. We are all busy volunteers. We want the application easy to understand.\"\nGrant Tip\nImpressive technology and clear writing create a winnable grant application. First, speak to the grant agency to confirm they love your innovation. If so, make sure the writing is good!\n76. Write shorter sentences\nYou do not need to be a professional writer to win grants, but you need the basics. The most common mistake I see in writing are sentences that span two or three lines. Stop!\nYou can have longer type sentences, but you should use short sentences as well. Give the reader a rest. A longer sentence followed by a shorter one helps the reader. Here is another place you can improve your writing: http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/free- guides.html\nGrant Story\nI've known grant agencies to help people they know who are terrible at writing with their applications.\n58\n77. Use active voice\nLearning to write in the active voice will help all your writing, not just your grants.\nAccording to Purdue University's excellent writing centre, \"Active voice is used for most non-scientific writing. Using active voice for the majority of your sentences makes your meaning clear for readers and keeps the sentences from becoming too complicated or wordy. Even in scientific writing, too much use of passive voice can cloud the meaning of your sentences.\"\nLook up the examples on that site. You can dramatically improve your writing with this one tip. https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general\\_writing/academic\\_writing/active\\_and\\_passive\\_voice/activ e\\_versus\\_passive\\_voice.html\n78. Dependent vs. independent clauses\nYou can dramatically increase many mistakes in your writing with this one rule \u2013 it's worth investing 15 minutes of your life! You will use this skill in nearly every email or document you write!\nUnderstand the difference between dependent and independent clauses.\nPurdue University's Writing Center provides clear definitions:\n\"An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought. An independent clause is a sentence. A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb but does not express a complete thought. A dependent clause cannot be a sentence.\"\nWhen the independent clause is before a dependent clause, you do not use a comma. Look below at this simple example. Once you master this concept, you take your writing skills from a five to a seven instantly.\n59\n\nDave is writing a book to help you win government grants. To help you win government grants, Dave is writing a book.\nDo not be discouraged by the technical nature of this rule. You can do it!\n79. Starting a sentence with the word \"This\"\nWhenever you start a sentence with the word \"this,\" you should put a subject after it. This tip will help you keep your reader's attention.\nGo back and re-read the last sentence. Read it without the word \"tip.\" See how much weaker the sentence becomes? When you are writing about a new subject, it becomes imperative to follow this advice.\n80. The word \"it\" can lose your reader\nWhen writing a grant, you need to ensure that you do not lose the writer.\nPeople often start sentences with the word \"it.\" Only use the word \"it\" when the reader\ncan easily discern what \"it\" refers to.\nE.g., The man created a drone that can deliver packages to businesses in less than 15 minutes. Four packages are shipped per minute, and the customers' satisfaction scores are favorable. Even when the weather is terrible, \"it\" is never late. You can replace \"it\" with deliveries or \"the drone\" to make the sentence stronger.\n60\n\nGRANT REALITIES\n81. The grant reality: accuracy over brilliance\nIn many cases, the grant agency's job is to ensure the application meets the funding criteria, not determine how successful your product will be. Focus on accuracy, not brilliancy.\nGrant Story\nIf you have the best idea but do not fill out the application correctly, you will most likely lose. Conversely, if you make the grant agency's life easy, your application will stand out.\n82. The secret sauce to winning grants: impact\nIf the government is going to invest in your project, you need to significantly impact many taxpayers' well-being.\nYou either need to show massive job creation, GHG emission reductions, significant potential tax revenue for the government, export potential, or survivability.\nTo successfully measure your grant application's impact, you need to look at the grant agency's mandate. Make sure your impact aligns with their impact.\nYour project \"needs to be cool,\" according to a high-level grant agency staffer. Grant Story\n\"Make sure your grant application hits all the points the grant agency is looking for,\" said a grant agency staffer at a recent conference.\n61\n\nRemember, you are writing the grant \"to help the grant agency achieve its mandate.\" You're not writing the grant application to \"enhance your mandate,\" although that will happen if you win.\n62\n\nWORKING WITH GRANT WRITERS\n83. Hiring grant writers - reasons for\nMost people do not want to write grant applications, so they consider hiring a grant writer.\nBefore we get into the complex rules of working with a grant writer, here are a few reasons why you should consider hiring one:\n1. You increase your chance of actually getting the grant submitted. In my experience, many people underestimate the necessary commitment to writing grants. Starting and stopping a detailed grant application slows the process dramatically. Hiring a writer for one specific grant can be smart.\n2. The learning curve can be dreadful.\n3. Grant writing is challenging. You need to be organized, get along with people, write clearly, and have incredible attention to detail. In my experience, finding an individual with these skill sets is rare. If you found one, hang on to this person!\nGrant Story\nI had a man email me with a question about grants. The grant maximum was $25,000, and his total budget came in just over. His application was automatically rejected because of this error. Grant trap!\n84. Hiring grant writers - reasons against\nHiring a grant writer brings some challenges as well.\n63\n\nFirst, sometimes the entrepreneur has everything in his or her head, including the go- to-market strategy, the intellectual property situation, competition, the export plan, and information for team biographies. You can work with a grant writer to help you answer all these questions, but you will need a great deal of one-on-one time with the writer to get this down on paper. In other words, your dream of \"delegating\" everything to the grant writer - especially on the first draft - is more likely a collaboration than a delegation.\nSecond, here is a secret: \"grant agency staff hate grant writers,\" said the boss of several front-line grant agency staff. When you meet the grant agency, you have to bring the owner or president to the first meeting. Don't insult the grant agency.\nGrant Tip: Don't ever send your grant writer FOR THE FIRST MEETING to the grant agency meeting alone. Ever! As a general \"rule of thumb,\" if a grant will take 40 hours to complete, the entrepreneur needs to contribute at least eight of those hours. The entrepreneur cannot delegate the entire process, especially the first grant application.\n85. Grant writers and the 100% commission model\nIf you are going to get into paying a grant writer, the inevitable question arises: \"can you take a percentage of the grant?\"\nFirst, you can't. Grants have \"eligible expenses,\" so the grant writer needs to be paid from the company's bank account. If the organization has NO MONEY, then you cannot work for 100% commission.\nSecond, when a grant writer starts to work with a company, the business obviously \"loves\" their technology. The grant writer probably likes it too, but neither of you knows if (1) the grant agency loves it, or (2) the agency just gave funding out for a similar project, and it has no interest in funding something similar at the moment.\nMany variables are outside of the grant writer's control.\n64\n\nTip for grant writers: You MUST be smart. You are a professional, so make sure your contract doesn't wholly rely on the business winning the grant.\nTrust me, many small entrepreneurs will try to get you to work for nothing, but you cannot. Your job is to write a clear proposal (no application yet) to the grant agency for a heck \"yes\" or \"no.\" You need to eat, so make sure you get some money upfront to cover your costs. If your compensation is 100% commission model, will they actually pay you in the end?\n86. Entrepreneurs and the 100% commission model\nThe major problem with paying someone 100% commission is that they may not be around to finish the job.\nConsider the cashflow of grants.\nWhen you engage a grant writer, it can take on average 4-8 weeks to write the grant.\nThe government can take 6-12 weeks (or way more!) to determine if you win.\nNext, grants are \"reimbursed.\" In other words, you need to spend money, and then you get the money back. That can take a minimum of three months, but it is more likely 4-6 months.\nThis independent grant writer could go one day to months without payment. It could be a year, and you might not win!\nWhile you might be thinking, \"I don't care.\" You should care because I have found\nthat many businesses hire grant writers \"on commission,\" and the grant writer does not stick around long enough to submit the grant. Now you are missing out on winning\nthe grant.\nGrant tip: In my experience, find a proven grant writer with references. If you have a \"heck ya\" from the grant agency, you should apply. You have mitigated your risk a\n65\n\ngreat deal. Paying a small amount upfront with an incentive, if successful, can be a long-term solution for both parties.\nRead more about incentives and commissions in another rule called \"The rules and regulations of grant commissions.\""
