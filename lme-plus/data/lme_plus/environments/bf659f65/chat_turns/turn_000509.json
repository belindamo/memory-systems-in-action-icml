  "content": "Yes, robots could eventually replace human workers in hazardous waste cleanup, especially in situations that are too dangerous or where human access is limited. Robots can perform tasks that are too risky for humans and are not affected by hazardous and toxic materials. They can also work for longer periods without the need for breaks or rest.\n\nThe use of robots for hazardous waste cleanup is not new. NASA, for example, has developed robots that can handle hazardous waste in space without putting human astronauts at risk. However, current robots have limitations, such as their ability to navigate certain terrains and distinguish between different types of hazardous materials. Nonetheless, with further development and refinement, robots could become a safer and more efficient option for hazardous waste cleanup.",
