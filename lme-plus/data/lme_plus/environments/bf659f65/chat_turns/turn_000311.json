I just wanted to know if you're happy with your current cleaning service.\"\n\nPain Point:\n\n\"I'm sure you're aware of the importance of maintaining a clean and healthy work environment for your employees and clients. But did you know that a dirty facility can also negatively impact your image and reputation? And that's not even considering the potential health hazards that come with dirty facilities.\"\n\nBenefit:\n\n\"We understand the importance of keeping your facility clean and we're here to help. We offer a range of commercial cleaning services that are tailored to your specific needs and budget. Our team is fully trained and equipped to handle any cleaning challenge.\"\n\nCall to Action:\n\n\"I'd like to schedule a free quote and consultation with you at your earliest convenience. Would you be available for a call next [day and time]? If not, I can also schedule an appointment for a different day and time that works for you.\"\n\nClosing:\n\n\"Great, I'll make sure to schedule that for you. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good day.\"\n\nThis script incorporates several key strategies used by Jordan Belfort, such as building rapport, identifying pain points, and highlighting the benefits of your service. It also includes a clear call to action, which encourages the prospect to schedule an appointment with you.
