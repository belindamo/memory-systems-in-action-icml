  "content": "I've actually been meaning to explore more foreign movies, and I recently started watching \"Roma\" on Netflix, a Mexican drama film directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. The cinematography is stunning, and the story is mesmerizing. I've only watched half of it so far, but I'm looking forward to finishing it this weekend. Do you have any other recommendations for foreign films or directors that I might enjoy?",
