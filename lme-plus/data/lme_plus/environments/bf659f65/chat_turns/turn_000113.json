I've been thinking about experimenting with different types of cheese and herbs to create unique flavor combinations for my savory tarts. I've been eyeing some goat cheese with chives and parsley, as well as a Parmesan and rosemary combination. I've also been considering using some caramelized onions and thyme for a sweet and savory tart.\n\nI think the key to creating unique flavor combinations is to experiment with different pairings and ratios of ingredients. For example, I might try pairing a strong, pungent cheese like blue cheese with some milder herbs like parsley or dill. Or, I might combine a tangy cheese like feta with some sweet caramelized onions and fresh thyme.\n\nI'm also curious to try using different types of herbs and spices to add depth and complexity to my savory tarts. For example, I might add some dried oregano or thyme to give my tart a Mediterranean flair, or some cumin and coriander to give it a Middle Eastern twist.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to start experimenting and seeing what delicious combinations I can come up with!",
