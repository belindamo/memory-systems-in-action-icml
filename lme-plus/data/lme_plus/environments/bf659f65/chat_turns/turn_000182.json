They're often found in:\n\n* Woodland edges\n* Brushlands\n* Old fields\n* Backyard gardens with dense shrubbery\n\nThey're omnivores, eating a variety of foods including:\n\n* Seeds (especially grasses and weeds)\n* Fruits (like berries and cherries)\n* Insects\n* Spiders\n* Small invertebrates\n\nWhite-throated Sparrows are social birds and often forage in small groups, especially during the winter months. They're also known to visit backyard bird feeders, especially if they offer seeds like millet, sunflower seeds, or suet.\n\n**Migration and year-round residency:**\n\nWhite-throated Sparrows are migratory birds, but their migration patterns vary depending on the region. In North America, they breed in the boreal forests of Canada and the northern United States, and migrate to the southern United States, Mexico, and the Gulf Coast for the winter.\n\nIn terms of year-round residency, it depends on your location:\n\n* In the northern parts of their range, they're summer residents and migrate south for the winter.\n* In the southern parts of their range, they're winter residents and may be present year-round, but in smaller numbers during the summer.\n* In areas with mild winters, like the southern United States, they may be present year-round, but with some movement and fluctuation in population numbers.\n\nIf you live in an area with a moderate climate, it's possible that White-throated Sparrows are present in your area during the winter months, but less common during the summer.\n\n**Can you tell me more about your location?**\n\nTo better understand whether White-throated Sparrows are likely to be present in your area, could you tell me:\n\n* Your city or state (or province, if you're in Canada)\n* Your approximate latitude (e.g., northern, southern, midwestern, etc.)\n\nThis will help me provide more specific information about the likelihood of White-throated Sparrows in your area.",
