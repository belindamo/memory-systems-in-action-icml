  "content": "I think Sarah Jones' writing style is quite unique, but if I had to compare, I'd say it's similar to a mix of literary fiction and adventure. I loved how she developed her characters and the way she wove the plot together. The event at the library was really great, by the way - I won tickets to it through a social media contest and got to meet her in person. During the Q&A, I asked her about her research process and she shared some fascinating insights. Anyway, back to the recommendations - do you think you could suggest some authors who write similar genre-bending fiction?",
