However, I have to confess that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or listen to music, so I haven't heard of \"The Whiskey Wanderers\" or any other bands. But I'm happy to chat with you about them!\n\nIt's great that you discovered a new band at a local festival! Folk-rock is an amazing genre, and it's always exciting to find artists who resonate with your musical tastes. \"The Whiskey Wanderers\" sounds like a fantastic name for a folk-rock band, by the way!\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what was it about their music that drew you in? Was it their lyrics, instrumentation, energy, or something else? I'm curious to know more about your musical preferences and what you're looking for in a live music experience.\n\nAlso, who knows? Maybe \"The Whiskey Wanderers\" will make an appearance at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival or another festival in the area. Wouldn't that be a great coincidence?",
