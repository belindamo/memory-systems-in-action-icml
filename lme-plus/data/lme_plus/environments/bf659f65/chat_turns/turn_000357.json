Now, let's talk about enticing Luna to navigate the course with toys and treats!\n\n**Toys:**\n\n1. **Wand Toys**: Use a wand toy with a feather, fabric, or other attachments to tease Luna through the course. Move the toy quickly and unpredictably to encourage her to chase.\n2. **Small Balls**: Roll small balls, such as ping-pong balls or small tennis balls, through the course to entice Luna to follow.\n3. **Interactive Toys**: Place interactive toys, like puzzle toys or treat-dispensing toys, along the course to challenge Luna's problem-solving skills.\n\n**Treats:**\n\n1. **High-Value Treats**: Use high-value treats, such as freeze-dried chicken or salmon, to motivate Luna to navigate the course.\n2. **Small Treats**: Place small treats, like kibble or treats specifically designed for agility training, along the course to encourage Luna to follow.\n3. **Treat Trails**: Create a treat trail by placing treats in a line leading through the course. This will help Luna associate the course with rewards.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Start with Familiar Items**: Begin with toys and treats that Luna is already familiar with to reduce stress and increase her confidence.\n2. **Vary the Rewards**: Mix up the toys and treats you use to keep the experience exciting and unpredictable.\n3. **Encourage Independence**: As Luna becomes more comfortable with the course, try placing toys and treats at the end of the course or hiding them inside the boxes to encourage her to problem-solve and navigate independently.\n\nRemember to always supervise Luna during playtime and ensure her safety. If you notice any signs of stress or discomfort, stop the activity and try to identify the cause.\n\nHow do you think you'll start? Will you use a combination of toys and treats or focus on one or the other?",
