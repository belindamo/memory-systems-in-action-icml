  "content": "Yeah! The music festival was amazing! \"The Whiskey Wanderers\" are a folk-rock band, and their live performance was incredibly energetic and engaging. I ended up buying their EP \"Midnight Sky\" at the festival merchandise booth, and I've been listening to it non-stop. They have a great sound that's perfect for fans of Mumford & Sons or The Lumineers. I'd definitely recommend checking them out!",
