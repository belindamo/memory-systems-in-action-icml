  "content": "While gimmicks and shock value may be effective short-term strategies for getting attention on social media and going viral, it's important to consider the long-term impact and sustainability of these strategies. \n\nWhile being noticed and standing out can certainly be a valuable asset for DIY musicians who are trying to make a name for themselves, building a dedicated fanbase and long-term career requires more than just attention-grabbing stunts. It's important to have a strong musical identity and message that resonates with your audience and makes a lasting impression. \n\nAdditionally, relying too heavily on gimmicks and shock value can create a culture where the music itself is devalued, and where the focus is more on viral stunts than on actual musical talent or creativity. This can lead to a situation where musicians feel pressure to constantly outdo each other in terms of shock value, rather than focusing on their actual music and message.\n\nUltimately, while going viral can certainly be a valuable asset for DIY musicians, it's important to consider the long-term impact and sustainability of your strategies. Building a sustainable career and a dedicated fanbase requires a focus on musical talent, creative vision, and genuine connections with your audience.",
