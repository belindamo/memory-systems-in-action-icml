Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n**Cleaning:**\n\n1. **Check the care label**: Before you start cleaning, always check the care label on your backpack for specific instructions. Some fabrics may require special care.\n2. **Brush off dirt and debris**: Use a soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth to remove any loose dirt, dust, or debris from the backpack's surface.\n3. **Mix a mild soap solution**: In a bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of mild soap (like Nikwax Tech Wash or Dr. Bronner's) with 1 quart of warm water. Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or conditioners that can damage the fabric.\n4. **Spot clean stains**: Dip a clean, damp cloth into the soap solution and gently blot any stains or dirty areas. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing, as this can damage the fabric.\n5. **Rinse thoroughly**: Use clean water to rinse the soap off the backpack. Make sure to remove any soap residue to prevent it from attracting dirt.\n6. **Air dry**: Allow the backpack to air dry away from direct sunlight. Avoid using a dryer or exposing it to high heat, as this can cause the fabric to degrade or shrink.\n\n**Conditioning:**\n\n1. **Use a fabric conditioner**: Once the backpack is dry, apply a fabric conditioner specifically designed for outdoor gear, such as Nikwax Fabric & Leather Proof or Sno-Seal Fabric & Fabric Protector. These products will help repel water, resist stains, and maintain the fabric's breathability.\n2. **Apply the conditioner**: Follow the product's instructions to apply the conditioner evenly to the backpack's fabric. Make sure to cover all surfaces, but avoid applying it to any non-fabric parts, such as zippers, buckles, or straps.\n3. **Allow it to dry**: Let the conditioner dry completely before using the backpack again.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals**, as they can damage the fabric or discolor the backpack.\n* **Don't machine wash or dry** your backpack, as the agitation and heat can cause damage.\n* **Store your backpack properly** when not in use. Keep it clean, dry, and away from direct sunlight to prevent fading or degradation.\n* **Regularly inspect and maintain** your backpack to ensure it remains in good condition.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to keep your new backpack from The North Face looking its best and extend its lifespan. Happy adventuring!",
