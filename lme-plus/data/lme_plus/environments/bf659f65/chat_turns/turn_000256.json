  "content": "It's great that you're monitoring Max's reaction to the new medication and making adjustments as needed.\n\nChewy.com is a fantastic online pet supply store, and they often have competitive pricing and fast shipping.\n\nSince you're currently using a 3-month supply, I'm assuming it's a topical treatment or an oral medication that provides prolonged protection. If you're happy with the current product, you might not need to switch. However, if you're open to exploring other options, I can certainly provide some suggestions.\n\nCan you tell me more about the reaction Max had to the old brand? Was it a skin reaction, digestive issue, or something else? This information can help me provide more targeted recommendations.\n\nAlso, what's the name of the current product you're using from Chewy.com? I can look it up and provide more information about its ingredients, efficacy, and potential alternatives.",
