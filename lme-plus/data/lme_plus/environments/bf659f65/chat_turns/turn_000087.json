  "content": "In the Philippines, businesses that are VAT-registered are required to include VAT in their invoices. VAT-registered businesses are those whose annual sales or gross receipts exceed PHP 3 million.\n\nThese businesses are required to charge VAT on their sales, and include it in the invoice they issue to their customers. They will also be required to file VAT returns and pay the VAT collected to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).\n\nHowever, businesses that are not VAT-registered, their annual sales or gross receipts are below PHP 3 million, are not required to charge and include VAT in their invoices.\n\nSo, not all stores need to include VAT in their invoices, it depends on the store's VAT registration status and the amount of their annual sales or gross receipts.",
