  "content": "write my story in an intriguing and engaging way: I started in Real Estate by accident when a friend told me about a way to purchase a property by using money from my 401K, but the amazing thing about it is after we purchased the property we were able to borrow money from the rental property using a equity line of credit and that is how we purchased our second property and third property. After 3 years we had acquired 14 doors and close to a million profolio. Then the amazing thing happened is I was introduced to Hotel investing by enrolling in a mastermind course with Davonne Reaves, this introduced me to a whole new world of investing and I was able to invest in a hotel. Being a part of Nassau Mastermind is expanding my view of what is possible with hotel and multi-family investing. I say all this to say just start and the universe with meet you where you are. Real Estate investing is providing me the opportunity to leave a legacy for my family, it changed my life and it can change yours too, let me know if you are interested in passively investing.",
