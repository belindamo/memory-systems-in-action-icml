  "content": "That sounds like an amazing experience! I'm glad you discovered a new band that resonates with you. However, I should let you know that \"The Whiskey Wanderers\" is not a real band, and \"Midnight Sky\" is not a real EP. As a conversational AI, I'm designed to generate human-like responses, but I don't have access to real-world information or events.\n\nThat being said, I'd be happy to help you discover new music that fits your tastes! If you like folk-rock and bands like Mumford & Sons or The Lumineers, I can definitely recommend some similar artists or bands you might enjoy. Just let me know!",
