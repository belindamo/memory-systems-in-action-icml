  "content": "I do not hold any personal opinion, but i can provide some insight into how relying heavily on gimmicks and shock value to get attention can affect both individual careers and the music industry as a whole.\n\nwhile gimmicks and shock value may be effective short-term strategies for getting attention on social media, they are unlikely to lead to sustainable long-term success in the music industry. this is because they tend to focus more on novelty and shock value than on the substance of the music itself. as a result, musicians who rely on gimmicks and shock value may find it difficult to build a dedicated fanbase of people who are passionate about their music and invested in their long-term success.\n\nfurthermore, relying too heavily on gimmicks and shock value can also have a negative impact on the music industry as a whole. it can create a culture where the music itself is devalued in favor of attention-grabbing stunts and gimmicks. it can also lead to a \"race to the bottom\" where musicians feel pressured to constantly outdo each other in terms of shock value and novelty, at the expense of their own creative integrity.\n\nultimately, while gimmicks and shock value can be effective strategies for getting short-term attention, they are unlikely to lead to sustainable success in the music industry over the long term. musicians who are seeking true success and longevity in the industry are better off focusing on developing their unique musical identity and cultivating an engaged fanbase through genuine connections and authentic interactions.",
