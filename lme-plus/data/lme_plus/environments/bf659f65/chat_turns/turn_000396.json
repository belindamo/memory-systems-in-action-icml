  "content": "The history of street art dates back to the early 20th century when graffiti was first introduced in cities such as New York and Philadelphia. In the 1960s, street art began to evolve as a form of protest during the civil rights movement and anti-war demonstrations.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s, street art became a form of self-expression for marginalized communities, such as those living in poverty and people of color. The rise of hip-hop culture also played a significant role in the development of street art as a form of expression.\n\nIn the 1990s, street art began to gain recognition as a legitimate art form, and artists such as Banksy, Shepard Fairey, and Keith Haring became well-known for their work.\n\nOver time, street art has been perceived differently in various societies. In some cultures, street art is seen as a form of vandalism and is therefore illegal, while in others, it is welcomed and even encouraged as a form of public art.\n\nIn recent years, street art has gained more mainstream recognition and has become a tourist attraction in cities such as New York, Berlin, and Melbourne. However, controversy still surrounds it, with some critics arguing that it is not true art and is instead a form of destruction.",
