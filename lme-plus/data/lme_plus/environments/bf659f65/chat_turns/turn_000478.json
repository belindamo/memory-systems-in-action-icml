Focus on the music itself, rather than your personal connection to it.\n3. **Provide context**: Give readers some background information about the artist, their previous work, and the genre they're working in.\n4. **Describe the sound**: Use vivid language to describe the music, including the instruments, vocal styles, and production quality.\n5. **Highlight standout tracks**: Identify the strongest songs on the album and explain why they stand out.\n6. **Discuss the lyrics**: Analyze the lyrics, themes, and messages conveyed by the artist.
