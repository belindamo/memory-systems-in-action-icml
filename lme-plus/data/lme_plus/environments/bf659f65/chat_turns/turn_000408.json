  "content": "As an AI, I don't have a personal opinion, but it's worth noting that the legality of street art has been a topic of debate in the art world. Some argue that the illegal nature of street art is what makes it rebellious and impactful, as it challenges the norms and conventions of the art world.\n\nHowever, as street art has gained mainstream recognition and acceptance, there has been a shift towards legal and commissioned works, which has made it more accessible to the public and less risky for the artists.\n\nWhile this shift may take away some of the rebellious edge of street art, it also offers new opportunities for artists to showcase their work and engage with communities in more positive ways. Additionally, legal street art can serve as a means of beautifying neighborhoods, reducing graffiti, and building stronger connections between artists and the public.\n\nTherefore, while the legality of street art may affect its impact and rebellious spirit to some extent, it also opens up new possibilities for the art form to evolve and make a positive contribution to society.",
