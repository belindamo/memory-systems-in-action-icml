Street artists must have expertise in various forms of art, such as painting, drawing, stencil making, and graphic design. They also need to be resourceful, adaptable, and able to work quickly under pressure.\n\nMoreover, many street artists use unconventional materials and techniques to create their works, such as spray paint, stickers, wheatpaste, and even garbage. They have to be innovative and think outside the box to create something that is eye-catching and thought-provoking.\n\nAdditionally, street artists often work collaboratively and share their ideas and techniques with others in the community, fostering a sense of creativity and community.\n\nTherefore, it's important to recognize the talent and dedication of street artists and celebrate their work as a legitimate form of art.",
