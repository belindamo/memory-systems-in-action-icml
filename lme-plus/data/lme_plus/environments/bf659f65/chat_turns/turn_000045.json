Due to the large numbers\nof stakeholders for the configuration control process, several training sessions were\ncarried out to reinforce the changes. Further, a requirement was made for all the R&D\nengineers who are first-time WP authors to take a class on the new configuration control\nprocess. Software tools were created to integrate the corrective actions stated in the\nSection 3.3 into a track-able system. Each functional area owners have been assigned to\nensure smooth implementation and quick response in case the systems are down. Such\ncontrols have made the changes permanent, not requiring the human glue to continue\ntheir implementation. The results of the LSS implementation in terms of the WP quality\nscore for technical content, the average time required to review the WPs, etc., were\nmonitored continuously through the quality tracking sheet. In addition, the quality\ntracking sheet is expected to quantify the \u201ccurrent\u201d state at any future time, thus making\nit easier to introduce measurable improvements.",
