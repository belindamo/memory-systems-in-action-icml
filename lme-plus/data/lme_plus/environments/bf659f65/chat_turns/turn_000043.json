  "content": "Summarize below text:\nFMEA was used to prioritize the improvement actions based on the higher RPN scores.\nThe analysis of such cause-effect table resulted in having an arbitrary number; each of\nthe process steps describing the impact of the process inputs on the customer\nrequirements identified in SIPOC. An arbitrary cutoff was chosen; where items above this level were targeted for improvement. The key item in this exercise was to come up\nwith wait time versus time required for the change based on the process map created by\nwalking the process. The corrective actions were intended to make the process flow\nsimple, reduce idle time and waste and better control the output variability. Following\naction items were identified as corrective actions as described in Table I.\n3.3.1 Not requiring the team of area experts to approve the change in the software\nsystem. This was a major improvement item, as it reduced the waiting time for the R&D\nengineer responsible for the manufacturing process change by 35 per cent. The area\nexperts work with the owner of the process change in writing the WP. The approval in\nthe software system by the area experts is thus a redundant activity that we were able\nto eliminate. This further simplified the initial process flow shown in Figure 2.\n3.3.2 WP quality and content feedback for the technical change prior to review. The\nteam added a new requirement of two-day prior feedback to the WP owners via the\nconfiguration control software system. The feedback covers the technical aspects\n(experimentation and simulations) and the WP quality of the change. Due to the global\nnature of R&D, the automated prior feedback helped facilitate the technical evaluations\nwhile reducing the communication time. We can thus use the \u201cfollow the sun\u201d model.\nAnother benefit of this corrective action was that the variation in the \u201chuman temper\u201d of\nthe members involved was minimized. The idle time reduction by this change was about\n9 per cent of the total time required for the WP cycle.\n3.3.3 Reduce the time difference between different levels of review forums. This\ncorrective action had to balance between the time required by the reviewers, and the\nwait times of the change/WP owners. Reviewer feedback and author feedback was\nconsidered when reducing the time between the meetings. The reduction in wait times\nhas helped the authors significantly in reducing the NVA time by 11 per cent.\n3.3.4 Consolidation of technical area experts/groups. The process map showed that\nthe change/WP owners spent several hours of time aligning with different members\nof the specific technical areas. Significant variation in technical recommendation\nwas observed due to multiple inputs from the members of the same technical team.\nTo reduce this variation, the team decided to assign a single point of contact for a\ngiven technical area for feedback to the change owner. For example, a single\nphysicist was assigned to address all the physics-related aspects of the change to\nIntel\u2019s manufacturing process. This arrangement also facilitates cross-program\nlearning. The reduction in NVA time was 4.5 per cent of the total time spent on WP\ncycle.\n3.3.5 System to reduce WP quality variation. We then decided to create WP quality\ntracking sheets. Such a sheet ranked the changes in terms of a set rubric such as\nquality of clarity, technical content, risk assessment, evaluation plan and change\nimplementation. Change owners with good score on this rubric were rewarded with\nrecognition, while a mentoring system along with manager notification was put in\nplace for those with poor scores. An immediate systemic improvement was observed\nwith a sharp reduction in the \u201crepeat offenders\u201d seen prior to the corrective action.\n3.3.6 Standardization of the WP templates. The team then worked with the\nautomation teams in the company to create universal WP templates for technical\nchanges across the organization. This simple improvement action significantly reduced\nthe confusion among authors and reduced the variability in the business process. This helped reduce the number of reworks needed (due to incorrect template usage) and also\nreduced the time needed to write WPs. The estimated time savings was about 0.5 per\ncent of the total time required for the WP cycle.\nThe improvement results are quantified in Table I. The first action of making the\nteam of area experts only as FYI in the software tool had the highest impact in terms\nof reducing the idle times. Note that a risk analysis was conducted by the team for\neach of the changes as shown in Table I. The risk mitigation required an\norganization-wide education and improving the collaboration between the authors\nof the configuration control technical experts. This was effectively done by\npresenting changes in relevant forums/meetings and developing a class that was\ndelivered to the WP authors and area experts of the nano- and micro-scale\nmanufacturing change control.\nThrough the above corrective action, the R&D configuration control process was\ngreatly simplified. A new process map was then drawn with simper flow and clear\nconnections (Figure 7). The direct result of these changes was multifold. First, the\nreduction of the idle time was achieved in the entire configuration control process that exceeded the target state. The idle time per change item in manufacturing reduced by 60\nper cent; freeing up the time of the R&D engineers into looking at technical aspects of the\nproblems rather than the business process. This translated into significant cost savings\nfor the company (not disclosed due to company confidentiality). Further,\nstandardizations in the process reduced the variation, making the change process more\npredictable and efficient without reducing the technical rigors of the science and\nengineering of the micro and nano manufacturing problems.",
