Brunel was a brilliant engineer, but his unconventional designs and methods often drew criticism from his contemporaries. Here are some of the major criticisms made:\n\n1. Lack of stability: Some of Brunel's designs, particularly his suspension bridges, were criticized for being unstable and dangerous. Many people feared that the bridges would collapse under their own weight or in high winds.\n\n2. Cost: Brunel's designs were often criticized for being too expensive, and some accused him of wasting public money on extravagant projects.\n\n3. Innovation over practicality: Brunel was known for his love of innovation and pushing the boundaries of engineering, but some criticized him for placing too much emphasis on novelty over practicality.\n\n4. Use of unproven technology: Brunel was not afraid to experiment with new technologies, but this sometimes led to failures and setbacks. His use of steam engines on ships, for example, was criticized for being untested and unreliable.\n\n5. Overestimating capabilities: Brunel was known for his ambition and confidence in his designs, but he sometimes overestimated his own capabilities and the capabilities of his technology. This led to some high-profile failures, such as the sinking of the Great Eastern.",
