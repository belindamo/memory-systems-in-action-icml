      "content": "Vegan lasagna is a delicious and satisfying dish. Here are some popular side dish ideas that would complement it well:\n\n1. **Garlic Bread**: A classic Italian-inspired option. Simply butter slices of bread with vegan butter or olive oil, sprinkle with minced garlic, and bake until crispy.\n2. **Roasted Vegetables**: Roasted vegetables like broccoli, zucchini, bell peppers, or Brussels sprouts are a tasty and healthy side dish that pairs well with the rich flavors of lasagna. Simply toss your chosen veggies with olive oil, salt, and your favorite herbs, and roast in the oven until tender and caramelized.\n3. **Green Salad**: A simple green salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a light vinaigrette dressing provides a refreshing contrast to the rich, cheesy lasagna.\n4. **Sauteed Spinach**: Quickly cooking a handful of spinach with garlic and lemon juice can make a delicious and nutritious side dish that complements the lasagna nicely.\n5. **Grilled or Roasted Vegetables Skewers**: Skewer cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions, brush with olive oil, and grill or roast until tender. This adds a pop of color and flavor to your meal.\n6. **Vegan Garlic Knots**: These are easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. Simply mix together flour, vegan butter, garlic powder, and water to form a dough, shape into knots, and bake until golden brown.\n7. **Marinated Vegetables**: Marinate sliced vegetables like cucumbers, carrots, or bell peppers in a mixture of olive oil, apple cider vinegar, and herbs, and serve as a refreshing side dish.\n8. **Vegan Breadsticks**: Similar to garlic bread, but in stick form! Perfect for dipping in your favorite marinara sauce.\n\nChoose one or two of these options to serve alongside your vegan lasagna, and I'm sure you'll have a well-rounded and satisfying meal!"
