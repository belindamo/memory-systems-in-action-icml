However, I have to inform you that I couldn't find any information about an author named Sarah Jones who has written a novel called \"The Lost City\". It's possible that the book or author is not well-known, or the event you attended was a local or private event.\n\nThat being said, I can try to help you find similar authors or books based on your interest in Sarah Jones' writing style. Can you tell me more about what you enjoyed about her writing? For example:\n\n* What genre was \"The Lost City\"? Was it fiction, mystery, fantasy, or something else?\n* What did you like about Sarah Jones' writing style? Was it her use of language, character development, plot twists, or something else?\n* Are there any specific themes or elements you're looking for in your next read?\n\nAny additional information you can provide will help me give you more tailored book recommendations."

I loved how she developed her characters and the way she wove the plot together. The event at the library was really great, by the way - I won tickets to it through a social media contest and got to meet her in person. During the Q&A, I asked her about her research process and she shared some fascinating insights. Anyway, back to the recommendations - do you think you could suggest some authors who write similar genre-bending fiction?"

      "content": "That's a great goal! Reading 50 books in a year is a challenging but achievable target. I'm happy to help you with tips on how to stay on track with your reading goals:\n\n1. **Create a reading schedule**: Break down your goal into smaller, manageable chunks. For example, aim to read 4-5 books per month, which translates to about 1-2 books per week.\n2. **Prioritize your reading time**: Identify the times of the day or week when you're most likely to have dedicated time to read. Make reading a habit by incorporating it into your daily routine.\n3. **Diversify your formats**: Don't limit yourself to physical books. Explore audiobooks, e-books, and graphic novels to mix up your reading experience and make it more accessible.\n4. **Track your progress**: You're already doing this with your spreadsheet, which is excellent! Seeing your progress can be a great motivator. Consider adding columns to track genres, ratings, and reviews.\n5. **Join a reading community**: Connecting with fellow readers can help you stay motivated. Join online book clubs, participate in reading challenges, or attend local book events to stay engaged.\n6. **Choose books that interest you**: Pick books that genuinely interest you, and you'll be more likely to stay engaged. Don't be afraid to DNF (did not finish) a book if it's not holding your attention.\n7. **Get recommendations**: Follow book bloggers, booktubers, or bookstagrammers to discover new titles and authors. You can also ask friends, family, or coworkers for recommendations.\n8. **Review and reflect**: Take time to reflect on the books you've read. Write reviews, even if it's just a brief summary, to help you process your thoughts and identify patterns in your reading preferences.\n9. **Be flexible**: Life can get in the way, and it's okay to adjust your goal if needed. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a week or two, but instead, focus on getting back on track.\n10. **Reward yourself**: Celebrate your progress along the way! Treat yourself to a new book, a reading-related accessory, or a fun experience when you reach certain milestones.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to enjoy the process of reading and discovering new stories. Good luck with your reading goal, and I hope you have a fantastic time exploring new books and authors!"
