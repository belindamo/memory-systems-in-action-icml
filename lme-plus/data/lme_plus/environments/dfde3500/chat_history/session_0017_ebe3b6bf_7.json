That can be really frustrating!\n\nTo help me better understand the issue, can you please tell me a bit more about your setup? For example:\n\n1. What device are you using to watch Netflix (e.g. smart TV, Roku, Chromecast, laptop, etc.)?\n2. What's your internet connection like? Are you using Wi-Fi or a wired connection?\n3. Have you noticed any error messages or codes when you experience the poor video quality or app crashes?\n4. Have you tried watching Netflix on a different device or network to see if the issue is specific to one device or your current connection?\n5. Have you recently updated your Netflix app or operating system?\n\nRegarding your music tastes, that's great! Indie and alternative playlists on Spotify can be really awesome! Do you have a favorite artist or band that you keep going back to?\n\nLet's focus on getting your Netflix issue sorted out first, and then we can chat more about music if you'd like!"

      "content": "Using your laptop to watch Netflix is a common setup, and Wi-Fi connectivity can sometimes be a culprit when it comes to video quality issues.\n\nNot seeing any error messages or codes makes it a bit more challenging, but we can still try to troubleshoot further.\n\nGreat idea to try watching Netflix on a different device or network to isolate the issue! Can you try the following:\n\n1. Try watching Netflix on a different device connected to the same Wi-Fi network (e.g., a smartphone, tablet, or another laptop). If the issue persists, it might be related to your Wi-Fi connection.\n2. If you have access to a different Wi-Fi network (e.g., a friend's or a public network), try watching Netflix on your laptop connected to that network. If the issue doesn't occur, it might be specific to your home Wi-Fi network.\n3. Restart your router and modem to ensure they're not causing any connectivity issues. Sometimes, a simple reboot can resolve connectivity problems.\n\nRegarding your Netflix app, have you tried:\n\n1. Closing and reopening the Netflix app on your laptop?\n2. Checking for any updates to the Netflix app or your laptop's operating system?\n3. Clearing the Netflix app's cache and data (if possible)?\n\nAs for Phoebe Bridgers, she's an amazing artist! Her music is so emotive and introspective. Do you have a favorite song or album of hers?\n\nLet me know the results of your troubleshooting attempts, and we can take it from there!"
