However, according to historical records, it is estimated that more than 600,000 foreign visitors traveled to Amsterdam during 1928 Olympic Games. The city of Amsterdam was well-prepared for this influx of tourists, with the increased construction of accommodation facilities such as hotels, hostels, and campgrounds. The city also made significant infrastructure investments to expand transportation networks and to better accommodate the high volume of visitors. These efforts contributed to a significant increase in tourism during the 1928 Summer Olympics."
