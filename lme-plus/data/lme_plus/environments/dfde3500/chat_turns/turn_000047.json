Here are some tips to help:\n\n1. **Keep the initial exploration short**: Start with short exploration sessions (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase the time as Luna becomes more comfortable.\n2. **Use positive reinforcement**: Reward Luna with treats and praise when she focuses on you or exhibits calm behavior in the presence of distractions.\n3. **Maintain a calm energy**: As the pack leader, it's essential to remain calm and composed. If you're anxious or excited, Luna may pick up on your energy and become more distracted.\n4. **Use verbal cues**: Use familiar verbal cues like \"walk,\" \"heel,\" or \"let's go\" to guide Luna and keep her focused on you.\n5. **Avoid overwhelming areas**: Steer clear of areas with high foot traffic, loud noises, or strong smells, which can be overwhelming for cats.\n6. **Keep the leash loose**: Avoid pulling or jerking the leash, as this can create anxiety and make Luna more distractible. Instead, let her set the pace and follow her lead.\n7. **Use visual cues**: If Luna becomes distracted, try using visual cues like holding a treat in front of her nose or showing her a toy to refocus her attention.\n8. **Take breaks**: Take regular breaks to give Luna a chance to relax and recharge. This will help her stay focused and engaged during the walk.\n9. **Practice desensitization**: Gradually expose Luna to new sights, sounds, and smells in a controlled environment (like your home) before taking her to the park. This will help her become more comfortable with new stimuli.\n10. **Be patient**: Remember that it's normal for cats to get distracted, especially in new environments. Be patient and don't scold or punish Luna if she gets distracted. Instead, calmly refocus her attention and reward good behavior.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help Luna stay focused and enjoy the park experience without getting too overwhelmed.\n\nHave a wonderful time at the park, and I hope these tips help!",
