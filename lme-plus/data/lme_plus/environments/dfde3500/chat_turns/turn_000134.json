  "content": "Yes, there have been recent examples where the IAEA has intervened to ensure the safe use of nuclear energy in member states. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Iran: In 2015, the IAEA played a key role in reaching a historic agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. As part of the agreement, the IAEA is responsible for monitoring and verifying Iran's compliance with its commitments under the deal.\n\n2. Japan: Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, the IAEA assisted Japan in assessing the environmental and health impact of the accident, and provided technical support for cleanup operations. The IAEA also reviewed Japan's nuclear safety regulations and made recommendations for improvement.\n\n3. Ukraine: The IAEA has been working closely with Ukraine to improve the safety and security of its nuclear facilities since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. In recent years, the IAEA has assisted Ukraine in constructing a new confinement structure over the damaged reactor at the Chernobyl site, and in strengthening its regulatory framework for nuclear safety and security.\n\nOverall, the IAEA's work to ensure the safe use of nuclear energy is ongoing, and it continues to provide technical support and assistance to member states as needed.",
