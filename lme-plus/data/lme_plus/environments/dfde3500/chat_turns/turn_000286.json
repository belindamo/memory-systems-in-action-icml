Here are some tips to help you showcase your wooden carving from Costa Rica:\n\n1. **Choose a prominent location**: Place your carving in a prominent location where it can be easily seen and admired, such as a coffee table, side table, or shelf.\n2. **Consider the lighting**: Wood carvings often look stunning in natural light, so try placing it near a window or under a skylight. If that's not possible, use soft, warm lighting to highlight the intricate details of the carving.\n3. **Select a suitable display stand or base**: A wooden or stone base can complement the natural beauty of your carving. You can also use a decorative plate, pedestal, or riser to elevate it and create visual interest.\n4. **Group with complementary items**: Create a vignette by grouping your carving with other items that share a similar theme or style, such as other wooden decorative pieces, Costa Rican artifacts, or tropical-inspired decor.\n5. **Balance and harmony**: Make sure the display is balanced and harmonious. Avoid overcrowding the area with too many items, as this can detract from the beauty of your carving.\n6. **Add some greenery**: Adding some greenery, like a potted plant or a vase with fresh flowers, can bring a touch of nature and complement the wooden carving.\n7. **Create a story**: Consider adding a small plaque or card with information about the carving, such as its origin, the type of wood used, or the artist's story. This can add a personal touch and make the display more engaging.\n8. **Experiment with angles**: Don't be afraid to experiment with different angles and positions to find the one that showcases your carving best.\n9. **Protect from direct sunlight**: While natural light is great, direct sunlight can cause the wood to fade or crack over time. Consider using UV-filtering window treatments or moving the carving slightly away from direct sunlight.\n10. **Enjoy and rotate**: Finally, enjoy your beautiful wooden carving and consider rotating it periodically to appreciate it from different angles and to prevent dust from accumulating in one spot.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to showcase your stunning wooden carving from Costa Rica in a way that does it justice. Happy decorating!",
