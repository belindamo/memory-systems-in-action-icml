I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal calendar or memories.\n\nYou might want to try checking your calendar, planner, or phone to see when you scheduled your meeting with Juan. If you're still unsure, you could try reaching out to Juan directly to confirm the day and time of your meeting.",
