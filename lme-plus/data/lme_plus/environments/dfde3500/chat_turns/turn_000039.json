However, it's still important to provide a variety of toys and stimulation to keep her mentally and physically active.\n\nWhile the laser toy is a great addition, it's essential to remember that cats can get bored with repetition, even with interactive toys. Rotating toys and providing new experiences will help keep Luna engaged and prevent boredom.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n* Use the Petcube Bites 2's laser toy as a supplement to your regular toy rotation.
