I had a great experience helping out at a charity bake sale last December, and I think I'd really enjoy working with animals. Do you know of any animal shelters in my area that need volunteers? Also, since I've had experiences with charity events, do you think my skills would be useful in organizing a fundraising event for the shelter?",
