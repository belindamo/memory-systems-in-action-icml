  "content": "The IAEA ensures that member states are complying with safety standards through a variety of mechanisms. These include:\n\n1. Safeguards: The IAEA has a safeguards program that verifies that nuclear material is being used for peaceful purposes and is not being diverted for military or other unauthorized purposes.\n\n2. Inspections: The IAEA conducts regular inspections of nuclear facilities to ensure that they are operating safely and in compliance with international safety standards.\n\n3. Reporting: Member states are required to submit regular reports to the IAEA on their nuclear facilities, activities, and safety and security measures.\n\nIf a member state is found to be in non-compliance with safety standards, the IAEA can take a range of measures, including:\n\n1. Reporting the non-compliance to the UN Security Council and other international organizations.\n\n2. Denying technical assistance or access to nuclear materials, equipment or technology.\n\n3. Reducing or suspending safeguards activities in the non-compliant state.\n\n4. Recommending that the international community take measures to sanction or otherwise pressure the non-compliant state to comply with safety standards.\n\nOverall, the consequences that non-compliant states face can be significant, as failure to comply with safety standards can pose a serious risk to both human health and the environment. Therefore, the IAEA takes its role in ensuring compliance very seriously and is committed to working with member states to ensure that they meet their obligations under international safety standards.",
