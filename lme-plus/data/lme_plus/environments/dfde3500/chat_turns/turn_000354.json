  "content": "Chris Pratt's performance in Passengers is quite impressive, and it shows a different side of him as an actor. While he's mostly known for his comedic timing and action hero roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he brings a more nuanced and dramatic performance to this film.\n\nPratt's character, Jim Preston, is a complex and relatable character, and he does a great job of conveying the emotional depth and vulnerability required for the role. He has to carry a significant portion of the film on his own, and he does an excellent job of making Jim a sympathetic and likable character.\n\nOne of the things that stands out about Pratt's performance is his ability to convey a sense of loneliness and isolation. Jim is a character who is awakened from hibernation 90 years too early, and he's stuck on a ship with no one to talk to. Pratt does a great job of showing the emotional toll this takes on Jim, and his scenes of desperation and despair are really affecting.\n\nOf course, when Jennifer Lawrence's character, Aurora, enters the picture, Pratt's chemistry with her is great, and their romance is believable and sweet. He also does a good job of conveying the moral complexity of Jim's decision to wake Aurora up, and the guilt and responsibility that comes with it.\n\nOverall, I think Pratt shows a lot of range in Passengers, and it's a great example of his ability to play more dramatic roles. He's not just a one-trick pony, and he's capable of bringing depth and nuance to his performances.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you excited to see Chris Pratt in a more dramatic role?",
