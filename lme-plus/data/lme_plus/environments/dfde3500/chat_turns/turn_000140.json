  "content": "The authority of the IAEA over member states with regards to regulating their nuclear energy programs is limited by its mandate as an intergovernmental organization. The IAEA has no legal authority to compel member states to comply with its safety standards or regulatory requirements. However, member states have voluntarily agreed to abide by the IAEA's standards and guidelines through the signing of international treaties and agreements.\n\nIf a member state chooses to ignore the safety standards set by the IAEA, it may face consequences through international pressure, such as negative media attention, economic sanctions, or diplomatic pressure from other member states. The international community also has the option to take action under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which allows for the use of force in the event of a breach of international peace and security.\n\nUltimately, it is up to individual member states to decide whether to comply with the IAEA's safety standards, but doing so is in their best interest since nuclear energy programs can pose significant risks to human health and the environment if not properly regulated. Most member states understand the importance of complying with the IAEA's standards and guidelines and work closely with the organization to ensure the safe and responsible use of nuclear energy.",
