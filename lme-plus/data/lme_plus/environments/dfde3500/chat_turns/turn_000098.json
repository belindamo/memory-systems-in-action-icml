Here's why I think it could work well:\n\n**White frames for neutral pieces:**\n\n* White frames can help the neutral pieces blend in and create a sense of calmness, allowing the bold print to take center stage.\n* White frames can also make the neutral pieces appear more crisp and clean, which can be beneficial if they have simple or minimalist designs.\n\n**Wood frame for the bold print:**\n\n* A wood frame can add warmth and texture to the bold print, which can help balance out its boldness.\n* Wood frames can also create a sense of nostalgia or timelessness, which can be fitting for a bold, eye-catching piece.\n\n**Combining white and wood frames:**\n\n* The contrast between the cool, clean white frames and the warm, natural wood frame can create a visually appealing combination.\n* By using a consistent frame width or style for the white frames, you can create a sense of continuity among the neutral pieces, while the wood frame can add a touch of uniqueness to the bold print.\n\nTo make this combination work, consider the following:\n\n* **Choose a wood tone that complements the bold print's colors**: If the bold print has warm, earthy tones, a wood frame with a similar tone can create a harmonious look. If the print has cool, bright colors, a lighter wood tone or a wood frame with a subtle grain pattern can help balance it out.\n* **Select a white frame style that complements the wood frame**: Opt for a white frame style that has a similar level of ornamentation or simplicity as the wood frame. This will help create a sense of balance and harmony between the two.\n* **Pay attention to the frame widths and profiles**: Make sure the frame widths and profiles are consistent or harmonious between the white and wood frames. This will help create a sense of cohesion and visual flow.\n\nOverall, I think combining white and wood frames can be a great way to add visual interest and create a unique look for your arrangement. By considering the tips above, you can ensure that the combination works harmoniously and showcases your beautiful pieces!",
