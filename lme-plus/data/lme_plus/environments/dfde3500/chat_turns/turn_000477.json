  "content": "David Bowie was influenced by a variety of musical genres and artists from a young age. He was first introduced to rock and roll music by his half-brother Terry, who played him records by artists such as Elvis Presley and Little Richard. \n\nAs he grew older, Bowie became a fan of British Invasion bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. He was also influenced by American soul and R&B acts such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Otis Redding, and he later incorporated elements of funk and disco into his music as well.\n\nBowie also had several idols and mentors in the music industry. One of his earliest influences was rock and roll pioneer Little Richard, whose flamboyant style and theatrical stage presence inspired Bowie's own performance style. He was also inspired by the music and fashion of the Velvet Underground, and he later became friends with their frontman Lou Reed.\n\nBowie was also heavily influenced by the music of the German electronic band Kraftwerk, as well as by the experimental avant-garde artists he encountered while living in Berlin in the late 1970s. Overall, Bowie's diverse musical influences and creative vision helped to shape his unique sound and make him one of the most innovative and influential artists in modern music history.",
