I'd be happy to help you plan your road trip to Grand Teton National Park from Illinois.\n\nSince you've already driven to Wyoming once, you might have a good idea of the general route, but I'll provide you with some suggestions to make your trip even more enjoyable.\n\n**Recommended Route from Illinois to Grand Teton National Park:**\n\n1. From Illinois, take I-80 W towards Omaha, Nebraska.\n2. Continue on I-80 W through Nebraska and into Wyoming.\n3. Take exit 161 (US-287/US-26 W) towards Lander, Wyoming.\n4. Stay on US-287/US-26 W for about 140 miles until you reach Moran Junction, Wyoming.\n5. Turn left onto US-26/US-89/US-191 N towards Grand Teton National Park.\n6. Follow the signs to the park's entrances, including the Moose Entrance (the most popular entrance) or the Granite Entrance.\n\n**Alternative Route:**\n\nIf you'd like to avoid the more crowded I-80, you can take US-30 W from Illinois to Wyoming. This route will take you through smaller towns and scenic countryside, but it might add some extra time to your journey.\n\n**Tips and Recommendations:**\n\n* Make sure to check road conditions and weather forecasts before you leave, especially during peak travel seasons (June to September).\n* Consider downloading a mapping app like Roadtrippers or Google Maps to help you navigate the route and find places to stop along the way.\n* Take breaks every few hours to stretch your legs, refuel, and enjoy the scenic views.\n* If you have time, consider stopping at attractions like Mount Rushmore, the Badlands National Park, or the town of Jackson Hole, which is just south of Grand Teton National Park.\n* Be prepared for varying elevations and possible mountain weather conditions within the park.\n* Don't forget to bring your camera, sunscreen, and insect repellent!\n\n**Approximate Distance and Drive Time:**\n\nFrom Illinois to Grand Teton National Park, the approximate distance is around 1,100-1,200 miles (similar to your Yellowstone trip), and the drive time is around 16-18 hours, depending on traffic and the route you take.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your road trip to Grand Teton National Park! If you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask.",
