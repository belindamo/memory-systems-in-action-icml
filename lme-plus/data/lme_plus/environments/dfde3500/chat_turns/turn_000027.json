However, I have to break it to you that Electric Storm is not a real band, and it's unlikely that you found a rare record by them. It's possible that the record is a misprint or a fake, or it could be a completely different band with a similar name.\n\nAs for your grandfather's vintage guitar amplifier, that's a great inheritance! Researching its value can be a fun and rewarding process. Here are some tips to help you determine its value:\n\n1. **Identify the make and model:** Look for the manufacturer's logo, model number, and serial number on the amplifier. This information can help you narrow down its origin and value.\n2. **Research online:** Check online marketplaces like eBay, Reverb, and Craigslist to see what similar amplifiers are selling for. You can also search for forums and online communities dedicated to vintage guitar amplifiers.\n3. **Consult with experts:** Reach out to music stores, vintage guitar shops, or online forums dedicated to guitar enthusiasts. They may be able to provide you with more information about your amplifier's value.\n4. **Get it appraised:** If you're still unsure about the value, consider getting your amplifier appraised by a professional. This can give you a more accurate estimate of its value.\n5. **Consider restoration:** If the amplifier is in poor condition, it may be worth restoring it to its original state. This can increase its value, but it's essential to do it correctly to avoid damaging the amplifier.\n\nRemember to be cautious when researching online, as there may be misinformation or scams. It's always a good idea to consult with multiple sources and experts to get a more accurate estimate of your amplifier's value.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy playing!",
