That can be really frustrating!\n\nTo help me better understand the issue, can you please tell me a bit more about your setup? For example:\n\n1. What device are you using to watch Netflix (e.g. smart TV, Roku, Chromecast, laptop, etc.)?\n2. What's your internet connection like? Are you using Wi-Fi or a wired connection?\n3. Have you noticed any error messages or codes when you experience the poor video quality or app crashes?\n4. Have you tried watching Netflix on a different device or network to see if the issue is specific to one device or your current connection?\n5. Have you recently updated your Netflix app or operating system?\n\nRegarding your music tastes, that's great! Indie and alternative playlists on Spotify can be really awesome! Do you have a favorite artist or band that you keep going back to?\n\nLet's focus on getting your Netflix issue sorted out first, and then we can chat more about music if you'd like!",
