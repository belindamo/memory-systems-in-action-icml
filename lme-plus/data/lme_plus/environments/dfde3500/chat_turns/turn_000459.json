  "content": "Overall, you received positive feedback for your teaching skills. You were noted for your ability to connect with your student and for your successful use of camera position C1 to help your student. However, it was suggested that you could improve by using more active verbs when instructing your students and avoiding using the word \"releasing.\" Additionally, you received specific feedback to be mindful of using different camera positions and gestures to give your students more verbal adjustments and feedback. Here is a summary of the feedback you received:\n\n* Good job teaching from C1 and helping your student.\n* Try to use a more active verb instead of \u201creleasing\u201d when you want your students to move: instead of \u201crelease your arm up\u201d, try something like \u201creach your arm up\u201d or \u201craise your arm up\u201d\n* Great at connecting with your student.",
