  "content": "I'm glad you found those resources helpful! I plan to start by conducting a thorough analysis of our current product line and identifying areas where we can improve sustainability. We'll be looking at material selection, product design, and end-of-life management to see where we can make changes to reduce waste and promote recyclability.\n\nOne area we're particularly interested in is designing products for longevity. We want to create products that our customers will love and use for a long time, rather than ones that will end up in landfills after a few years. We're considering implementing modular design principles to make our products more durable and easier to repair.\n\nWe're also looking into sustainable material selection and exploring options for using recycled materials in our products. We want to make sure that our products not only look great but also have a minimal environmental impact.\n\nAnother key area of focus is end-of-life management. We want to design our products in a way that makes it easy for customers to recycle or upcycle them at the end",
