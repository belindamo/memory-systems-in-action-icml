If you can provide me with more information about Electric Storm, such as their discography or any notable releases, I can try to help you verify their existence.\n\nRegarding your grandfather's guitar amplifier, I'm happy to help you with that! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about appraisers in your area. But I can suggest a few options to find a reputable appraiser:\n\n1. **Local music stores:** Reach out to local music stores or guitar shops in your area and ask if they know of any reputable appraisers or can recommend someone.\n2. **Online directories:** Look up online directories like the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) or the Guitar Appraisers Guild, which can provide you with a list of certified appraisers in your area.\n3. **Word of mouth:** Ask friends, family, or fellow musicians if they know of anyone who has had their gear appraised and can recommend a reputable appraiser.\n4. **Check credentials:** When selecting an appraiser, make sure to check their credentials, experience, and reviews from previous clients.\n\nRemember to get multiple appraisals if possible, and be wary of anyone who gives you an unrealistically high value for your amplifier. A reputable appraiser will provide you with a fair and accurate assessment of your grandfather's guitar amplifier.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance!",
