  "content": "Absolutely! The Royal Botanic Garden is a great spot for a picnic and is a popular spot for both locals and tourists. You can bring your own snacks from a local market or grab something from one of the many food kiosks located in the garden. The garden has plenty of picnic areas with benches and tables, as well as open grassy areas where you can spread out a blanket and enjoy the view of the harbor. It's a lovely place to relax and enjoy the scenery, and it's free to enter!",
