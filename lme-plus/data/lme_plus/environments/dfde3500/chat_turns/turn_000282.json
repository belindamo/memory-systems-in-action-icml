Most airlines offer free or low-fee changes or cancellations, depending on the fare type.\n\nHowever, if you're still hesitant, you could consider a compromise:\n\n1. **Book a refundable ticket**: If you're worried about finding a better deal, look for a refundable ticket option. This way, you can book a flight now and cancel or change it if a better deal becomes available.\n2. **Set up price alerts**: Set up price alerts for your desired route and travel dates to notify you of any price drops.
