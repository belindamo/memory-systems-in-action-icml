However, each of these destinations offers unique experiences that are worth exploring. So, it all depends on what you are interested in seeing and doing during your visit to Nice. If you enjoy history and architecture, then the Old Town would be a good choice. If you like hiking and outdoor activities, then Mont Boron could be an ideal destination for you. Or, if you are interested in beaches and luxury villas, then a visit to Cap Ferrat might be more your style. Ultimately, each of these destinations has its charm and appeal, and the decision about which one to visit depends on your personal interests and preferences.",
