  "content": "Overall, Margo received positive feedback for her teaching skills. She was noted for her ability to connect with her student and for her successful use of camera position C1 to help her student. However, it was suggested that Margo could improve by using more active verbs when instructing her students and avoiding using the word \"releasing.\" Additionally, Margo received specific feedback to be mindful of using different camera positions and gestures to give her students more verbal adjustments and feedback. Here is a summary of the feedback Margo received:\n\n* Good job teaching from C1 and helping your student.\n* Try to use a more active verb instead of \u201creleasing\u201d when you want your students to move: instead of \u201crelease your arm up\u201d, try something like \u201creach your arm up\u201d or \u201craise your arm up\u201d\n* Great at connecting with your student.",
