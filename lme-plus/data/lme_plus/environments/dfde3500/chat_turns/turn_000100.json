Here are some tips to help you arrange the pieces in a way that minimizes distractions while still creating a visually appealing display:\n\n**Minimizing distractions:**\n\n1. **Keep the bold print above eye level**: Place the bold print above the coffee table, but not directly at eye level. This will help you focus on your work without being constantly drawn to the artwork.\n2. **Use the neutral pieces as a buffer**: Place the neutral pieces between the bold print and your line of sight. This will create a visual buffer, allowing you to focus on your work without distraction.\n3. **Balance the arrangement**: Make sure the arrangement is balanced and symmetrical. An unbalanced arrangement can be distracting, so try to distribute the visual weight of the pieces evenly.\n\n**Creating a visually appealing display:**\n\n1. **Create a focal point**: Use the bold print as a focal point, and arrange the neutral pieces around it to create a sense of harmony.\n2. **Vary the heights and widths**: Mix up the heights and widths of the frames to add visual interest and create a sense of movement.\n3. **Play with negative space**: Don't be afraid to leave some negative space between the pieces. This will create a sense of breathability and make the arrangement feel less cluttered.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Consider the color palette**: Choose a color palette that complements the room's decor and won't distract you from your work. Stick to a consistent color scheme to create a sense of cohesion.\n2. **Avoid cluttering the coffee table**: Keep the coffee table clear of clutter to maintain a sense of openness and minimize distractions.\n3. **Experiment and adjust**: Don't be afraid to experiment with different arrangements and adjust as needed. You might need to make some tweaks to find the perfect balance between visual appeal and minimal distraction.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a beautiful and functional display that enhances your workspace without distracting you from your work.",
