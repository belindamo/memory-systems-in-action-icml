  "content": "Yes, the IAEA has faced challenges in ensuring the safe use of nuclear energy in countries with less developed infrastructure and resources. These challenges include a lack of trained personnel, inadequate safety culture, insufficient regulatory frameworks, and limited financial resources.\n\nTo address these challenges, the IAEA provides technical assistance, training, and capacity-building support to member states. This assistance can include the development of regulatory frameworks for nuclear safety, the creation of emergency preparedness and response plans, and the provision of training for personnel in the safe operation of nuclear facilities.\n\nOne of the ways the IAEA addresses these challenges is through its the Technical Cooperation (TC) Program, which is its main mechanism for providing technical assistance to member states. The TC Program focuses on assisting countries with developing and strengthening their nuclear infrastructure in various areas such as nuclear safety, radiation protection, waste management, and nuclear security. This program provides financial and technical assistance to countries, especially developing countries with limited resources, with the aim of helping them achieve their development goals in the field of nuclear science and technology while ensuring the highest standards of safety.\n\nIn addition, the IAEA has established regional and international networks of experts to provide additional support and resources to member states. These networks facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and best practices in nuclear safety among member states, and enables the sharing of resources and expertise.\n\nOverall, the IAEA recognizes the unique challenges faced by countries with less developed infrastructure and resources. The organization is committed to providing targeted support and assistance to these countries to help them develop and maintain safe and sustainable nuclear energy programs.",
