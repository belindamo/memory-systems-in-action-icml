  "content": "A pet camera sounds like a great idea! It's wonderful that you want to keep an eye on Luna and ensure she's happy and entertained while you're away.\n\nAs for pet camera recommendations, I've got some suggestions based on popular reviews and features:\n\n1. **Furbo Interactive Dog Camera**: Although it's marketed for dogs, it's also suitable for cats! It has a 1080p HD camera, night vision, two-way audio, and a treat dispenser that can be controlled remotely. You can even schedule treat dispensing to keep Luna engaged.\n2. **Petcube Bites 2**: This camera has 1080p HD video, night vision, and two-way audio. It also includes a built-in laser toy that can be controlled remotely, which might be a nice change of pace from the traditional laser pointer. You can also schedule playtime and receive notifications when Luna is active.\n3. **Wyze Cam Pan**: This is a more affordable option with 1080p HD video, night vision, and motion tracking. It's a great value for the price, but it doesn't have two-way audio or a treat dispenser.\n4. **Yi Dome Camera**: This camera has 1080p HD video, night vision, and motion tracking. It's also affordable and has a wide-angle lens, but it doesn't have two-way audio or a treat dispenser.\n\nWhen choosing a pet camera, consider the following factors:\n\n* Video quality and resolution\n* Night vision capabilities\n* Two-way audio for interaction\n* Motion tracking and alerts\n* Additional features like treat dispensers or built-in toys\n* Compatibility with your smartphone or tablet\n* Price and value\n\nRegarding Luna's boredom with her toys, it's not uncommon for cats to get tired of the same old toys. You might consider rotating her toys every few weeks or adding some new ones to keep things interesting. Here are some ideas:\n\n* Wand toys with feathers, strings, or other attachments\n* Interactive toys that challenge her problem-solving skills, like puzzle toys or treat-dispensing toys\n* Catnip toys or mice toys with catnip inside\n* Cardboard boxes or paper bags to provide hiding and seeking fun\n* Scratching posts or pads to keep her claws healthy and exercised\n\nRemember to supervise Luna when introducing new toys to ensure her safety and to prevent any potential choking hazards.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect pet camera and some new toy ideas for Luna!",
