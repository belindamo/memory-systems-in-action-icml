Leaving early can make a huge difference in avoiding traffic and making the most of your day. 5:00 AM is a great time to hit the road, as you'll likely beat the morning rush and have a more peaceful drive.\n\nPlus, driving during the early morning hours can be quite scenic, especially when the sun starts to rise over the horizon. You'll have a chance to enjoy the beautiful landscapes and maybe even spot some wildlife, like deer or antelope, along the way.\n\nSince you've done this before on your Yellowstone trip, you know it's doable and can be a great way to start your adventure. Just make sure to:\n\n1. **Get a good night's sleep** before your early departure to ensure you're well-rested and alert for the drive.\n2. **Pack snacks and coffee** to keep you fueled and energized during the early morning hours.\n3. **Take breaks** when needed, even if it's just a quick stop to stretch your legs or refuel.\n\nBy leaving early, you'll set yourself up for a successful and enjoyable drive to Grand Teton National Park. Safe travels, and I hope you have an amazing time exploring the park!",
