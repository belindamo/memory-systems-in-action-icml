  "content": "The IAEA ensures that member states are constantly improving and updating their regulations and safety standards to keep up with new technologies and changing risks through a variety of mechanisms. \n\nFirst, the IAEA creates and updates international safety standards and guidelines on a regular basis to address emerging safety issues and new technologies. Member states are expected to incorporate these standards into their own national regulations and safety frameworks and work with the IAEA to assess their safety and regulatory arrangements.\n\nSecond, the IAEA conducts safety reviews of nuclear facilities, research reactors and other nuclear installations to assess their compliance with safety standards, identify safety issues and make recommendations for improvement.\n\nThird, the IAEA provides technical assistance to member states to help them develop and enhance their nuclear safety infrastructure, including regulatory bodies, emergency response and communication systems, and safety culture. The IAEA also offers training and capacity-building programs to help member states develop the technical expertise necessary to implement and enforce modern safety standards.\n\nFourth, the IAEA engages with member states and other international organizations to promote the sharing of best practices and experiences in nuclear safety. By facilitating dialogue and knowledge-sharing, the IAEA helps member states learn from one another and continuously improve their safety and regulatory arrangements.\n\nOverall, the IAEA recognizes the importance of keeping safety standards current and relevant to changing technologies, and it is committed to working with member states to ensure that the highest standards of safety and security are maintained.",
