Partners have a shared vision, invest discretionary effort, and look to accomplish a vision together. Health care professionals should be treated as partners, never as employees (Schein, 2013).\n \n There are different types of partnerships. For example, horizontal partnerships occur on the same level of a process (e.g., a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals in the emergency department treating a trauma victim). Vertical integration partnerships involve distinct, sequentially related processes linked to the same final service (e.g., the relationship of affiliated physicians with the organization where they have privileges).\n \n When there is maximal trust and connectedness in horizontal and vertical organizational partnerships, social capital is optimized, and the organization is poised to deliver on its mission and vision.\n \n THE PRONOUN TEST AND SOCIAL CAPITAL\n \n Robert Reich, the former U.S. Secretary of Labor, uses a simple method for assessing the health of an organization. When he visits companies and talks with employees, he listens carefully for the pronouns people use. Do they refer to their organization and its leaders as we/us or they/them and I? Healthier organizations have employees who use first-person plural.\n \n The pronoun test is easy to apply to health care organizations. If you hear more of they/them or I, it\u2019s likely that there is some degree of disengagement and distancing between leaders and practicing professionals, whereas more of we/us suggests the opposite: an ideal culture where health care professionals feel they are a valued part of something special, meaningful, and larger than self or discipline (Figure 12.1). The use of first-person plural pronouns signals a spirit of cooperation with higher levels of trust and interconnectedness (i.e., social capital). Without social capital, there will be more competition and mistrust within the organization, neither of which are in the best interests of health care professionals or the patients they serve (Bezrukova et al, 2012).\n \n Us Cooperation \n Social \n capital \n Competition \n They/Them Mistrust \n \u00a9MAYO2019 I We \n \n Figure 12.1. The Pronoun Test. Organizations with employees that use first-\n person plural (we/\n \n us) are less competitive and more cooperative. They have high social capital.\n \n ORGANIZATIONAL PARTNERSHIP \n IN HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS \n \n How organizations are designed determines the level of partnership fostered. The following two analogies explain the different partnership models in health care organizations.\n \n The Farmers Market\n \n Many hospitals take a noncollaborative farmers market approach to partnering with their physicians. The farmers market offers alocation for independent merchants to sell their products for the mutual benefit of the market and the farmers\u2014but the arrangement is not aligned toward any type of shared mission (e.g., helping customers eat healthier). The organizer of the market has little control over those who sell products or the quality of those products. The organizer often just wants as many merchants as possible to gain the largest share of the market and fill all the stalls (Figure 12.2). Like a vendor in a farmers market, physicians in open-staff hospitals are affiliated but have independent practices. This arrangement has some benefits for hospitals because, for example, their overhead may be lower (i.e., no physician salaries) and advantageous for physicians because they have more independence and often have more income from owning their practice. But this relationship does not optimize and coordinate the best care and results for patients and, ultimately, is not in the best interest of the organization or the well-being of the organization\u2019s health care professionals. With the farmers market model, it is difficult to build high-trust multidisciplinary teams and to standardize care processes for safety\n \n and efficiency. The culture is by design not one of collaboration, cooperation, and consistency (Swensen et al, 2010). The farmers market model treats physicians as revenue centers, not partners, and the physicians most commonly use the words they and them, not we and us. Physicians\u2019 actions and behaviors under this approach are not necessarily aligned with the mission, strategy, and vision of the organization with whom they\n \n Farmers Market Partnership Market\n \n Mission Mission\n \n Vision\n \n Strategy Strategy \u00a9MAYO2019\n \n Figure 12.2. Farmers Market Model vs. Partnership Market Model. (Data from Swensen, et al. Cottage industry to postindustrial care: the revolution in health care delivery. N Engl J Med. 2010 Feb 4;362[5]:e12.)\n \n are affiliated. Rather, physician-hospital relationships are based on volume, with dedicated but independent practitioners focused on personal needs and preferences, not necessarily a patient\u2019s best interest. Independent practitioners often shun standardization, which, for the most part, yields the most reliable, high-quality care. In the farmers market model, hospital culture is often one of competition rather than coordinated care.\n \n Partnership Market\n \n Medical centers may be designed as partnership markets instead offarmers markets. In a partnership market arrangement, the culture is intentionally one of collaboration and cooperation. There is standard work instead of \u201cmarket-driven\u201d variation. Partnership market cultures have high levels of social capital because they function with higher levels of trust and interconnectedness. When physicians in the partnership market culture talk about the organization, they most commonly use the words we and us, not they and them. In a partnership market culture, physicians are hired, selected, and developed so that their behaviors and actions are aligned with the mission strategy and vision of the organization. Physicians are more likely to feel as though they are an important part of the organization, and they are dedicated and work together to promote the organization\u2019s mission, which is in contrast to the farmers market with its independent, competitive practitioners. To thrive, health care professionals need to feel a sense of ownership of the mission, vision, and values of the organization. They should view their relationship as a partnership, with the express goal of achieving the shared mission (Atkinson et al, 2011). We believe an organizational partnership structure is the most patient centered and addresses the well-being of health care professionals. A true partnership between professionals and leadership is a primary mitigating strategy for professional burnout. In a true we/us partnership, health care professionals have choices and own the organizational mission and values.\n \n BURNOUT AND THE FARMERS MARKET MODEL\n \n Hospitals organized like noncollaborative farmers markets are systems designed\n \n to fuel burnout. They are characterized by greater social isolation, less integration, and higher variation\u2014resulting in poorer quality and safety. In a farmers market model, clinicians must work harder to increase productivity. Compensation is strictly based on production\u2014a situation that burns out health care professionals. Physicians experiencing burnout order more tests and procedures, and they spend less time with patients and colleagues. There is more competition than collaboration (Swensen et al, 2010).\n \n In contrast, professionals in an integrated system (i.e., the partnership market model) partner with the organization and its leaders to improve producti\n[END CHUNK 1/2]\nReply with OK: [CHUNK x/TOTAL], don't reply anything else, don't explain the text!",
