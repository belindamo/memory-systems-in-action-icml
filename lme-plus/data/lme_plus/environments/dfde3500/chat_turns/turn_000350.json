Sometimes, a movie is just what you need to break up the binge-watching cycle.\n\nIn that case, I'd like to recommend a few more sci-fi movies from the past 10-15 years that might interest you:\n\n1. **Life (2017)**: A tense, alien-horror movie set in space, with a great cast and a lot of suspense.\n2. **Passengers (2016)**: A romantic sci-fi adventure starring Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, with a unique premise and beautiful visuals.\n3. **The Cloverfield Paradox (2018)**: A mind-bending, Netflix-exclusive movie that explores the consequences of playing with time and space.\n4. **Solaris (2012)**: A psychological sci-fi thriller based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, with a great performance by Chris Hemsworth.\n5. **Automata (2014)**: A visually stunning movie set in a world where robots are common and trusted, but one scientist's creation may hold the key to humanity's survival.\n\nThese movies offer a mix of action, suspense, romance, and thought-provoking themes to keep you engaged.\n\nLet me know if any of these catch your eye, or if you'd like more recommendations!",
