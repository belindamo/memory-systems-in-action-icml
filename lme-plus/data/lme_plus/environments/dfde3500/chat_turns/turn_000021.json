If your tank has high lighting, choose plants that can tolerate or require high lighting.\n2. **Introduce plants slowly**: Add plants gradually to your tank to prevent sudden changes in water chemistry.\n3. **Provide proper care**: Research the specific care requirements for your plants, including lighting, temperature, and fertilization needs.\n4. **Monitor plant health**: Keep an eye on your plants' health and adjust their care accordingly.\n5. **Trim and prune regularly**: Regular trimming and pruning can help maintain your plants' shape, promote healthy growth, and prevent them from overgrowing your tank.\n\nRemember, plants can be a great addition to your community tank, but they do require some care and attention.
