  "content": "Using your laptop to watch Netflix is a common setup, and Wi-Fi connectivity can sometimes be a culprit when it comes to video quality issues.\n\nNot seeing any error messages or codes makes it a bit more challenging, but we can still try to troubleshoot further.\n\nGreat idea to try watching Netflix on a different device or network to isolate the issue! Can you try the following:\n\n1. Try watching Netflix on a different device connected to the same Wi-Fi network (e.g., a smartphone, tablet, or another laptop). If the issue persists, it might be related to your Wi-Fi connection.\n2. If you have access to a different Wi-Fi network (e.g., a friend's or a public network), try watching Netflix on your laptop connected to that network. If the issue doesn't occur, it might be specific to your home Wi-Fi network.\n3. Restart your router and modem to ensure they're not causing any connectivity issues. Sometimes, a simple reboot can resolve connectivity problems.\n\nRegarding your Netflix app, have you tried:\n\n1. Closing and reopening the Netflix app on your laptop?\n2. Checking for any updates to the Netflix app or your laptop's operating system?\n3. Clearing the Netflix app's cache and data (if possible)?\n\nAs for Phoebe Bridgers, she's an amazing artist! Her music is so emotive and introspective. Do you have a favorite song or album of hers?\n\nLet me know the results of your troubleshooting attempts, and we can take it from there!",
