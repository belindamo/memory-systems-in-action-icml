However, based on the recipe, here are a few tips that you can follow to make it even better:\n\n1. Use leftover rice: Whenever you are making fried rice, it's always best to use leftover rice that has been refrigerated for at least a day. This will ensure that the rice is less sticky and clumpy, and will help in achieving the perfect texture for fried rice.\n\n2. Cook each ingredient separately: To get perfectly cooked and crisp vegetables, cook each vegetable separately before combining them in the fried rice. This will help to maintain the individual textures and flavors of each vegetable.\n\n3. High heat is the key: To get that smoky and charred taste of restaurant-style fried rice, use high heat when stir-frying the rice and vegetables. High heat will give the dish a nice crispy texture.\n\n4. Experiment with different sauces: If you like your fried rice on the spicier side, you can add some chili paste or Sriracha sauce to the stir-fry. Alternatively, you can add some hoisin sauce, sesame oil, or oyster sauce for a savory flavor.\n\n5. Customize with your favorite proteins: You can add your favorite protein to this fried rice recipe, including chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu, or egg. Just make sure to cook the protein separately before adding it to the rice.\n\nI hope you find these tips helpful! Enjoy making your Chinese fried rice and let me know how it turns out.",
