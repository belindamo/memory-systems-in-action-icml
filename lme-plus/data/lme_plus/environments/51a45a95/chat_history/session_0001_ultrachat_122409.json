      "content": "1. Active listening: listen to your friend's concerns without interrupting or judging, and acknowledge their feelings.\n\n2. Use \"I\" statements: focus on how the situation is making you feel, rather than placing blame on your friend.\n\n3. Avoid attacking language: use respectful and non-threatening language to avoid escalating the conflict.\n\n4. Empathize: try to see the situation from your friend's perspective and show understanding.\n\n5. Take responsibility: admit your part in the conflict and apologize if necessary.\n\n6. Compromise: work together to find a solution that works for both of you.\n\n7. Take a break: if the conflict becomes too intense, take a break and come back to it later when you both have had time to cool down.\n\n8. Seek professional help: if the conflict becomes unmanageable, consider seeking the help of a therapist or mediator."
