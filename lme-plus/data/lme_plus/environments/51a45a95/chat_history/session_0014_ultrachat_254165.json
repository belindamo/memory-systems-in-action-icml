      "content": "There have been changes to the criteria for receiving the Order of Australia over time, and these changes have impacted the recipients in various ways.\n\nOne significant change was made in 2015 when the criteria for the award of the Order of Australia were amended to include recognition of people who have made significant contributions in the areas of disability, Indigenous affairs, and LGBTI rights, among others. This change extended the recognition to individuals or groups who had previously been excluded from consideration, which resulted in a more diverse range of recipients.\n\nAnother change that has impacted the recipients is the introduction of categories within the Order of Australia, such as the Military Division and the General Division. These categories recognise specific areas of achievement, and provide a more targeted recognition of individuals' contributions.\n\nThe changes to the criteria for receiving the Order of Australia have generally had a positive impact, as they have allowed for a more inclusive and diverse range of recipients, and have recognised achievements that were previously overlooked. However, there is still room for further improvement in ensuring that the Order truly represents the diversity of Australia and its people."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure! One notable recipient of the Order of Australia after the criteria changes is Ms. Samantha Connor, a disability advocate and founder of the organisation 'Ability Links NSW'. In 2018, she was named as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in recognition of her significant contributions to people with disabilities, particularly her work in creating new opportunities for people with disabilities to access education, employment and social connections. Her recognition is an example of how the changes in the criteria have enabled the recognition of individuals like her who have made a significant impact to society but may not have been eligible for recognition in the past."

      "content": "Certainly! There are many notable recipients of the Order of Australia. One is Professor Michelle Simmons, who was awarded the Australian of the Year Award in 2018 for her pioneering work in quantum computing. She was also named as a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2019 in recognition of her significant contributions to physics and her leadership in the field.\n\nAnother noteworthy recipient is Dr. Fiona Wood, who developed the \"spray-on skin\" technique to aid in the treatment of burn injuries. Dr. Wood was named as a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2003 for her service to medicine and her contributions to improving burn treatment.\n\nDr. Catherine Hamlin is another notable recipient of the Order of Australia who was named as a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2014 for her significant contributions to gynecology and obstetrics. Dr. Hamlin co-founded the Hamlin Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia, which has provided life-altering care to thousands of women suffering from obstetric fistula.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many inspiring and accomplished individuals who have been recognised through the Order of Australia."
