I can suggest a few options to help you find a healthy spot to grab a bite near your yoga studio:\n\n1. **Google Search**: Open Google Maps on your phone or computer and type in \"healthy restaurants near me\" or \"healthy restaurants near [yoga studio name]\". You can also use online review sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor to find top-rated healthy spots in your area.\n2. **Ask Your Yoga Studio**: Reach out to your yoga studio and ask if they have any recommendations for healthy restaurants or cafes nearby. They might have some insider knowledge or partnerships with local businesses.\n3. **Explore Your Neighborhood**: Take a short walk around your apartment and yoga studio to see what options are within a few blocks. You might stumble upon a hidden gem or a new spot that just opened up.\n4. **Health-Conscious Chains**: Look for national chains that offer healthy options, such as Sweetgreen, Dig Inn, or Freshii. They often have locations in urban areas and offer nutritious meals.\n\nRemember to check reviews, menus, and hours of operation before heading to a new spot to ensure it fits your dietary needs and preferences. Happy eating!",
