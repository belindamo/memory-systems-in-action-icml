  "content": "There have been changes to the criteria for receiving the Order of Australia over time, and these changes have impacted the recipients in various ways.\n\nOne significant change was made in 2015 when the criteria for the award of the Order of Australia were amended to include recognition of people who have made significant contributions in the areas of disability, Indigenous affairs, and LGBTI rights, among others. This change extended the recognition to individuals or groups who had previously been excluded from consideration, which resulted in a more diverse range of recipients.\n\nAnother change that has impacted the recipients is the introduction of categories within the Order of Australia, such as the Military Division and the General Division. These categories recognise specific areas of achievement, and provide a more targeted recognition of individuals' contributions.\n\nThe changes to the criteria for receiving the Order of Australia have generally had a positive impact, as they have allowed for a more inclusive and diverse range of recipients, and have recognised achievements that were previously overlooked. However, there is still room for further improvement in ensuring that the Order truly represents the diversity of Australia and its people.",
