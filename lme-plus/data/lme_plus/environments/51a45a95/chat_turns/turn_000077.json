  "content": "I'm so glad to hear that you're enjoying your piano lessons! \"River Flows in You\" by Yiruma is a beautiful piece, and I'd be happy to recommend some similar beginner-friendly songs that you might enjoy learning. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Clair de Lune** by Claude Debussy - This piece has a similar dreamy, gentle quality to \"River Flows in You.\" It's a bit more challenging, but the arpeggio patterns and chord progressions are still accessible for beginners.\n2. **Moonlight Sonata (1st Movement)** by Ludwig van Beethoven - Another classic piece with a soothing, contemplative atmosphere. The first movement is a great place to start, as it's more accessible than the later movements.\n3. **Nuvole Bianche** by Max Richter - This piece has a similar minimalist, emotive quality to Yiruma's style. The slow, gentle arpeggios and chord progressions make it a great choice for beginners.\n4. **Hallelujah** by Leonard Cohen (arr. for piano) - This classic song has been arranged for piano in many different styles, but the slower, more contemplative versions are similar to \"River Flows in You\" in terms of mood and atmosphere.\n5. **Sleep** by Max Richter - Another piece by Richter, this one features a beautiful, slow melody with a simple, repetitive accompaniment that's easy to learn.\n\nAs for finding time to practice, I totally understand the struggle! Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n* **Set a specific practice schedule**: Try to set aside a specific time each day or week that works for you, and stick to it as much as possible.\n* **Start small**: Even 10-15 minutes of practice a day can be beneficial, especially if you're consistent.\n* **Make it enjoyable**: Choose songs you love, like the ones I recommended, and you'll be more motivated to practice.\n* **Use technology to your advantage**: There are many apps, like Piano Maestro or Yousician, that can help you practice and stay motivated.\n* **Break it down**: Break down difficult pieces into smaller sections and focus on one section at a time. This can make practice feel less overwhelming.\n\nI hope these recommendations and tips help you find some new songs to enjoy and stay motivated to practice!",
