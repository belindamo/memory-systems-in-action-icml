  "content": "I've been enjoying the Coursera courses so far. I've been working on them consistently, about 2-3 hours a week, and I've just completed the third module out of six. It's been a lot of fun learning new skills and I can already see how they're applicable to my field of study. Speaking of statistics, I'm currently working on a research paper for my literature class. I submitted it on February 25, and I'm still waiting to hear back from my professor about the grade. Fingers crossed I get a good grade!",
