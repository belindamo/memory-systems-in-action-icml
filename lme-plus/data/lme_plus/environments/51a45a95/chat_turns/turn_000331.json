It's great that you're providing Luna with a comfortable and stimulating environment.\n\nNow, about Luna's behavior: it's absolutely normal for cats to prefer the highest point in their territory. In the wild, cats often climb trees or perch on high grounds to observe their surroundings, feel safe, and even hunt. This natural instinct is still present in domesticated cats, which is why they often gravitate towards elevated areas.\n\nThe topmost hammock of the cat tower likely provides Luna with a sense of security, comfort, and a great view of her kingdom (your home). It's not uncommon for cats to claim the highest spot as their own, especially if it's cozy and provides a good vantage point.\n\nAdditionally, cats often prefer to rest and relax in elevated areas because it allows them to:\n\n1. Feel safe: Elevated areas can make them feel protected from potential threats or dangers.\n2. Observe their surroundings: From a high perch, Luna can keep an eye on her food sources, toys, and family members.\n3. Relax: Elevated areas can be calming and help reduce stress, as cats feel more in control of their environment.\n4. Survey their territory: Luna might be claiming the top spot as her own, marking it with her scent, and feeling like the queen of the castle.\n\nSo, don't worry; Luna's behavior is completely normal and natural. Enjoy watching her lounge around in her favorite spot, and make sure to provide her with plenty of attention, playtime, and treats to keep her happy and healthy!",
