I'll definitely start with those and see how it goes. I've also been meaning to practice my scales and arpeggios more regularly, so that's a good reminder.\n\nBy the way, I was thinking about my piano lessons and I was wondering if you had any advice on how to get the most out of them. I feel like I'm learning a lot, but sometimes I feel like I'm not retaining as much as I could be. Do you have any tips on how to make the most of my lessons?\"",
