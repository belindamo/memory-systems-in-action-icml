I'm really looking forward to catching up with Alex and Sarah, and a Marvel movie marathon is the perfect way to do it. By the way, I recently attended a birthday party for my colleague and friend, David, where we had a great time celebrating his special day. We played laser tag and sang karaoke, and it was impressive to see how many people showed up to support him.",
