Here are a few recommendations:\n\n**Geysers:**\n\n1. **Grand Geyser**: Located near Old Faithful, Grand Geyser is one of the largest and most predictable geysers in the park. It erupts about every 7-10 hours, shooting water up to 200 feet in the air!\n2. **Castle Geyser**: This geyser is part of the Upper Geyser Basin and erupts about every 10-12 hours. It's a great spot for kids to see a smaller, more frequent eruption.\n3. **Daisy Geyser**: Located in the Upper Geyser Basin, Daisy Geyser erupts about every 3-4 hours, shooting water up to 80 feet high. It's a fun spot for kids to watch and take photos.\n\n**Hot Springs:**\n\n1. **Mammoth Hot Springs**: This complex of hot springs is a must-visit, with its stunning travertine formations and colorful algae. The boardwalks and stairs make it accessible for families with strollers or little legs.\n2. **Norris Geyser Basin**: While not a traditional hot spring, Norris Geyser Basin is home to many hot springs, including the famous Porcelain Basin and the acidic Emerald Spring.
