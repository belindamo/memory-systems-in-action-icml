It's essential to remember that staying informed is important, but so is your mental and emotional well-being.\n\nFeeling guilty about not staying up-to-date on everything is a common phenomenon, especially in today's fast-paced, information-rich world.

By doing so, you'll be able to stay engaged with the topics that matter most to you, without feeling overwhelmed or guilty.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you all the best in your journey to stay informed, engaged, and balanced!",
