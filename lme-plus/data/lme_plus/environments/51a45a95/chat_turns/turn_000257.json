That's an impressive achievement, and it's great to hear that you're looking to shave off even more seconds with the Invidia Cat-Back Exhaust System.\n\nWith the system's ability to reduce backpressure, improve throttle response, and increase power output, it's definitely possible to see further improvements in your drag racing times. The added power and torque will likely help you launch harder off the line and maintain speed throughout the quarter-mile.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some potential benefits of the Invidia system for drag racing:\n\n* **Faster acceleration**: With the increased power and torque, you can expect to accelerate faster off the line, which can lead to quicker 60-foot times and faster quarter-mile times.\n* **Improved traction**: The added power can help you maintain speed and traction throughout the quarter-mile, especially in the higher gear ranges.\n* **Better throttle response**: The Invidia system's free-flowing design can provide a more responsive throttle, allowing you to make quicker shifts and stay on the gas longer.\n\nKeep in mind that the actual performance gains will depend on various factors, including your driving skills, the track conditions, and the overall setup of your vehicle. However, with the Invidia Cat-Back Exhaust System, you can expect to see some improvements in your drag racing times.\n\nRemember to stay focused, keep your skills sharp, and make adjustments as needed to optimize your performance.
