One approach you could consider is using touch-sensitive capacitive sensors.\n\nHere's a basic schematic for a touch-sensitive capacitive sensor that you can use to detect user input on the steering column stalks:\n```markdown\n   +Vcc                         +Vcc\n     |                             |\n    C1                             R1\n     |                             |\n    C2                             R2\n     |                             |\n    Pin                            Pin\n     |                             |\n    GND                            GND\n```\nIn this schematic, C1 and C2 are capacitors that are arranged in a capacitive sensing configuration. The pins are the touch-sensitive areas that the user will interact with to provide input.\n\nWhen the user touches a pin, their body forms a capacitor between the pin and ground, which changes the capacitance of the sensing circuit. This change in capacitance can be detected and used to trigger an input event.\n\nTo detect changes in capacitance, you can use an operational amplifier (op-amp) configured as a capacitance-to-voltage converter. Here's a schematic for an op-amp-based capacitance-to-voltage converter:\n```sql\n   +Vcc\n     |\n    C1\n     |\n   +INP---+\n     |    |\n    R1   C2\n     |    |\n   -INP---+\n     |    |\n    R2   R3\n     |    |\n    OUT  GND\n```\nIn this schematic, C1 is the capacitor that forms the capacitance sensing circuit, and C2 is a feedback capacitor that is used to convert changes in capacitance to changes in voltage.\n\nThe output voltage of the op-amp, OUT, is proportional to the change in capacitance. You can use this voltage as an input to a microcontroller or other digital logic circuit to trigger the desired action.\n\nTo use these circuits in your steering column stalks, you would need to integrate the capacitive sensing circuit and op-amp into the stalks themselves, and connect them to the body controller through a digital interface such as I2C or SPI. You would also need to program the microcontroller to interpret the input signals and trigger the appropriate actions.\n\nNote that the specific values of the capacitors and resistors in these circuits will depend on the requirements of your application and the specific op-amp you choose to use. Be sure to consult the datasheets for the components you select and perform any necessary calculations to choose appropriate component values.",
