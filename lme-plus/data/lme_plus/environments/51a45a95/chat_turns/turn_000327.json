  "content": "It is recommended to get to Presque Isle State Park at least 30 minutes before sunrise. You can check the exact sunrise time for the day you plan to visit, and be sure to add enough time to set up your equipment and find the perfect spot. Being early will give you plenty of time to prepare your shots or even scout the perfect spot the day before. It's also important to make sure you have appropriate lighting gear if you plan on taking photos in low light condition.",
