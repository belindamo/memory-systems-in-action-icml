I've been playing around with it for a few days now, and I'm really loving the versatility of the presets and effects. I've been experimenting with different sounds and styles, and it's been really fun. I've also been using the USB connectivity to record some ideas into my DAW, which has been really helpful.\n\nBut anyway, back to piano... I was thinking of learning some songs that might be a bit more upbeat and energetic than 'River Flows in You'. Do you have any recommendations for piano songs that might be a bit more lively and fun to play? Maybe something in the pop or rock genre?\"",
