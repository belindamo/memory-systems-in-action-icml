  "content": "I completely understand your point! Customizable notifications would be a fantastic feature for Cartwheel to implement. It would allow users like you to tailor the notifications to your specific needs and preferences, making the app even more useful and relevant.\n\nReceiving too many notifications can be overwhelming and might lead to fatigue, causing you to ignore or dismiss them altogether. By giving users the option to customize their notifications, Cartwheel could increase engagement and make the app more user-friendly.\n\nHere are some potential customization options that could be useful:\n\n1. **Expiration notifications:** As you mentioned, receiving notifications for offers that are expiring soon would be super helpful. This would ensure you don't miss out on savings and can plan your shopping trip accordingly.\n2. **Category-specific notifications:** Allowing users to select specific categories for notifications (e.g., groceries, household, baby products) would help them focus on the deals that matter most to them.\n3. **Favorite brand notifications:** Users could opt to receive notifications when their favorite brands have new offers or deals. This would be especially useful for loyal customers who want to stay up-to-date on their preferred brands.\n4. **Priority notifications:** Cartwheel could offer a feature to mark certain offers as \"high priority\" or \"favorite,\" and users would receive notifications only for those specific deals.\n\nBy implementing these customization options, Cartwheel could make the notification system more personalized and effective, leading to increased user satisfaction and engagement.\n\nI'll make sure to pass on your feedback to the Cartwheel team, and who knows, maybe they'll consider adding some of these features in the future!\n\nWhat do you think about Cartwheel's social features, such as the ability to share offers with friends and family? Do you use these features, or do you think they're not that useful?",
