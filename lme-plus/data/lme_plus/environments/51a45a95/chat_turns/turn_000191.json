Here's the breakdown of the follower count we expect from our influencers:\n\n1. Micro-influencers: 10,000 to 50,000 followers - These influencers often have a highly engaged, niche audience, and partnering with them can result in a more personal connection with potential customers.\n2. Mid-tier influencers: 50,000 to 250,000 followers - These influencers strike a balance between having a sizable audience and maintaining a reasonable level of engagement, offering good visibility and impact for our campaign.\n3. Macro-influencers: 250,000 to 1,000,000 followers - With a larger following, these influencers can significantly increase our brand awareness and reach a broader audience.\n\nBy working with influencers across these different tiers, we aim to create a diverse and effective influencer marketing campaign that resonates with a wide range of potential customers.",
