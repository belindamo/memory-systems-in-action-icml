By the way, I've been thinking about my own education and career path. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Michigan in 2012, and since then, I've taken a few online courses to enhance my skills in digital marketing. Speaking of which, I finished a certification program in Google Analytics last month, which took me about 6 weeks to complete. I've been meaning to pursue a Master's degree, but I haven't had the time to commit to a full-time program. Maybe I'll consider an online MBA program soon. Can you recommend any online MBA programs that are reputable and flexible?",
