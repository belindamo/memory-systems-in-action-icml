You can use vegetable scraps, poultry bones, and leftover meat to create delicious homemade stock.\n2. Try composting your food waste instead of throwing it in the landfill. Composting is a natural and efficient way to turn food waste into nutrient-rich soil.\n3. Be mindful of expiration dates, buy only what you need, and prioritize using the oldest products in your pantry and fridge first.\n4. Freeze leftover food to extend its shelf life. This can also come in handy for busy days when you don\u2019t have time to cook.\n5. Give away non-perishable food items that you won't use to neighbors and friends.\n6. Avoid buying food in bulk unless you know you'll use it all or can properly store it.\n7. Serve foods buffet-style or family-style, so guests can take only what they'll eat.\n8. Donate leftovers from large events to homeless shelters or soup kitchens.\n9. Use apps and meal planning guides to help you plan meals based on ingredients you have on hand.\n10. Be creative with leftovers! They can be transformed into delicious meals like stir-fries, casseroles, and sandwiches.",
