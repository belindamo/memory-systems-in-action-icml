I'm interested in exploring the \"Data Analysis\" course on Coursera by University of Colorado Boulder, as it seems to cover the process of data analysis, which I think will help me with my current work. By the way, do you have any information on online mentorship programs that pair professionals with underprivileged students who are interested in pursuing higher education? I've been considering volunteering for such a program to share my knowledge and experience with those who could benefit from it.",
