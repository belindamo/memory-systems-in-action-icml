Unfortunately, I'm still a large language model, I don't have access to your personal location or the specific area where your yoga studio is located. I don't have the ability to know the exact location of your apartment or the yoga studio.\n\nHowever, I can suggest a few options to help you find healthy restaurants or cafes near your yoga studio that are open late:\n\n1. **Ask Your Yoga Studio**: Reach out to your yoga studio and ask if they have any recommendations for healthy restaurants or cafes nearby that are open late. They might have some insider knowledge or partnerships with local businesses.\n2. **Google Search**: Open Google Maps on your phone or computer and type in \"healthy restaurants near me\" or \"healthy restaurants near [your neighborhood/apartment area]\". You can also use online review sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor to find top-rated healthy spots in your area that are open late.\n3. **Check Online Directories**: Websites like HappyCow or HealthyOut can help you find healthy restaurants and cafes in your area that are open late.\n4. **Check Social Media**: Follow local health food bloggers, wellness accounts, or foodie influencers on social media platforms like Instagram. They often share recommendations for healthy spots in your area.\n\nRemember to check reviews, menus, and hours of operation before heading to a new spot to ensure it fits your dietary needs and preferences. Enjoy your post-yoga meal!",
