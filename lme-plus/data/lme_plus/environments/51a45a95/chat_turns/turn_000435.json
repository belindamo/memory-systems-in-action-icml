You'll be able to grab a good spot, soak in the pre-show atmosphere, and check out the opening act.\n\nAccording to The Wilterhood's website, the opening act for The Neighbourhood's show on October 17th is **MUNA**. They're an indie pop-rock trio from LA, known for their catchy hooks, introspective lyrics, and high-energy live performances. They're a great fit to open for The Neighbourhood, and I'm sure they'll get the crowd pumped up for the main act.\n\nMUNA has been gaining popularity lately, especially with their singles \"Number One Fan\" and \"Stayaway\". They've also toured with acts like Harry Styles, Kacey Musgraves, and Billie Eilish, so they're no strangers to big stages.\n\nMake sure to arrive early enough to catch their set, as they're definitely worth checking out. You might even discover a new favorite band!\n\nAre you familiar with MUNA's music, or is this your first time hearing about them?",
