Cat-back systems replace the entire exhaust system from the catalytic converter back, while axle-back systems replace only the section from the rear axle back. Downpipe systems replace the section from the turbocharger to the catalytic converter (if equipped).\n* **Sound**: If you want a more aggressive sound, look for systems with a free-flowing design or a performance muffler. If you prefer a quieter ride, look for systems with a more restrictive design or a chambered muffler.\n* **Installation**: Consider the ease of installation and whether you'll need professional help or can do it yourself.\n* **Price**: Aftermarket exhaust systems can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.\n\nBefore making a purchase, research each option thoroughly and read reviews from other Honda Civic owners to find the best fit for your needs and budget.\n\nNow, about that 12.8-second quarter-mile time...
