He was the first European to explore much of the region, and his expedition played a significant role in the history of the Americas. De Soto and his men traveled through present-day Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, among other places. They encountered many Native American tribes and played a major role in the spread of diseases like smallpox and influenza, which had a significant impact on the indigenous population.",
