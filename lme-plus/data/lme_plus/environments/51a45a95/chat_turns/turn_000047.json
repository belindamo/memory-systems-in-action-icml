However, the Church teaches that artificial contraception goes against the natural order of human sexuality and disrespects the inherent dignity of the human person.\n\nSome proponents of natural family planning argue that it can be effective when used correctly and can also deepen the intimacy and communication between partners. Additionally, they argue that it promotes holistic and natural methods of family planning, rather than relying on artificial means to control contraception.\n\nUltimately, the decision on what methods of contraception to use is a personal one and may differ based on factors such as personal beliefs, health considerations and individual circumstances. Different people may choose to use different methods of family planning based on their individual needs and preferences.",
