  "content": "Pope Paul VI's encyclical Humanae Vitae, released in 1968, reiterated the Church's teachings on contraception and family planning. The encyclical prohibited the use of artificial contraception such as condoms and birth control pills, stating that they were \"intrinsically evil\" and went against God's will for procreation. \n\nInstead, the encyclical emphasized the use of natural family planning methods such as the rhythm method and abstinence during fertile periods. It also emphasized the importance of the family as a fundamental unit of society and reiterated the Church's teachings on the sanctity of human life.\n\nHumanae Vitae sparked controversy both within and outside the Church, with some Catholics opposing the encyclical's prohibition on contraception and advocating for the use of artificial birth control methods. However, the Church stood by its teachings on contraception and family planning, citing the encyclical's theological and moral justifications for its stance.\n\nOverall, Humanae Vitae remains a foundational document for the Church's teachings on contraception and family planning, and continues to be a source of debate and discussion within the Church and beyond.",
