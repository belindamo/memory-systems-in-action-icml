The Last Temptation of Christ (1988): Martin Scorsese's film about the life of Jesus Christ was met with protests and controversy upon its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was criticized for its depiction of Christ as a conflicted human being, rather than a divine figure.\n\n2. Antichrist (2009): Lars von Trier's film about a grieving couple's descent into madness was met with mixed reviews and controversy at the Cannes Film Festival. The film features graphic sex and violence, and some critics accused von Trier of misogyny.\n\n3. Blue is the Warmest Color (2013): Abdellatif Kechiche's film about a young woman's sexual awakening was met with widespread acclaim at Cannes, but also generated controversy due to its explicit sex scenes and the allegations of mistreatment from the film's lead actresses.\n\n4. Irreversible (2002): Gaspar No\u00e9's film about a woman's rape and her boyfriend's subsequent revenge was met with outrage and walkouts upon its premiere at Cannes.
