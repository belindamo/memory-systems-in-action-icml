The floor is usually packed, but it's not excessively crowded to the point where you can't move around. You'll likely be able to find a spot with a good view of the stage, and you can move around to get a better spot or grab a drink.\n\nHere are some tips to help you navigate the general admission floor at The Wiltern:\n\n* Arrive early to secure a good spot near the front of the stage.\n* Be prepared for a crowded and potentially sweaty environment, especially if you're closer to the stage.\n* Keep an eye on the crowd and be mindful of your personal space.\n* If you need some breathing room, you can try moving towards the sides or the back of the floor, where it's usually less crowded.\n* The Wiltern has a decent-sized bar area on the floor where you can grab a drink and take a break from the crowd.\n\nOverall, the general admission floor at The Wiltern is a great way to experience a live show, and I'm sure you'll have a blast at The Neighbourhood's concert!\n\nAre you planning to arrive early to soak in the pre-show atmosphere, or do you have other plans before the concert?",
