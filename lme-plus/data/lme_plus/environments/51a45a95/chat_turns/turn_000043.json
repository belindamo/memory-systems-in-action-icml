However, I think we've covered all the topics we needed to discuss regarding the Wildlife Management Association program and prescribed burning. You now have a good understanding of how the program works, its benefits, and the importance of prescribed burning in habitat management.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification on any of the topics, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you all the best with your inherited land in rural Texas, and I hope you're able to create a thriving wildlife habitat through the Wildlife Management Association program!",
