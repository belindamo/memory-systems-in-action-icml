It's great that you're taking advantage of the Cartwheel app to save money on your regular purchases. $20 in savings might not seem like a lot, but it adds up over time, and it's always nice to have some extra cash in your pocket.\n\nHousehold items, toiletries, and kids' clothes are all great categories to save on. With the Cartwheel app, you can often find offers on those types of items, which can help you stretch your budget further.\n\nHere's a tip to help you maximize your Cartwheel savings:\n\n**Stack your savings:** Remember to stack your Cartwheel offers with other discounts, like sales or manufacturer's coupons. This can help you save even more on the items you need. For example, if you have a Cartwheel offer for 10% off toilet paper and it's also on sale, you'll get an even better deal.\n\nAdditionally, keep an eye out for Cartwheel's \"Bonus Offers\" section, which often features exclusive deals on popular items. These offers can be a great way to score extra savings.\n\nSince you're a frequent Target shopper, you might want to consider signing up for their RedCard, which offers 5% off on all purchases, including online orders. This can be a great way to save even more on your regular purchases.\n\nWhat do you think about the Cartwheel app's user interface and features? Is there anything you'd like to see them improve or add?",
