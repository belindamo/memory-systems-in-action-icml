  "content": "Now for the darkest of the bunch: Path 3. In path 3 Marcus simply misses his gunshot meant to hit Surgey b3cause Surgey notices Marcus acting fishy. The stray bullet hits Dr. Penelope, causing her to bleeding out. In the commotion, Surgey responds by firing back on Marcus as well as the shocked Jillian, killing them both. Without the manpower to fight the zombies, nor the courage to face the US government after the death of three government officials at \"his hands\", Surgey simply runs. Without military contact the spread from the lab is uncontained, leading to immediate doomsday of continental America. B3cause the military was never alerted to the outbreak at the main lab, they also never check on the situations of the labs dotted throughout the rest of North and South America, leading to more sources of spread for the parasite as well as the zombie masses. As you can imagine, this cripples the America's to essentially an exclusion zone. Additionally, small parasite outbreaks begin being reported across the coasts of Africa, Europe and Russia as boats carrying hidden parasites or infected corpses cross while fleeing the carnage.\n\nMaps in this timeline would follow groups of survivours trying their best to piece together what they can of society while trying not to be eaten alive. Eventually, and rather miraculously, I imagine Surgey would meet a group of survivours while trapped in a bunker somewhere. He would likely have lost his mind at this point and would manipulate this group, telling them that there is a large settlement unaffected in Northern Canada and, if they follow his instructions, they can carpet bomb a border around this region to keep them safe from future hordes. In reality, these bombs would be filled with parasites and aimed at the USSR, a country that Surgey sees as having abandoned him in American hands and refusing to do anything to stop the parasite in the Americas. This, ultimately, results in apocalypse in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well, spelling the end kf the world.\n\nAnd that's all! It's not entirely fleshed out yet, but I'd love to hear your thoughts anyway:)",
