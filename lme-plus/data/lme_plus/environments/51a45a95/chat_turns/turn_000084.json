I've always loved the piano parts in 'Clocks' by Coldplay, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that level of complexity yet. Maybe I'll work my way up to it later.\n\nBy the way, do you have any tips on how to improve my hand coordination and dexterity for playing piano? I feel like my hands are still getting used to playing together in sync.\"",
