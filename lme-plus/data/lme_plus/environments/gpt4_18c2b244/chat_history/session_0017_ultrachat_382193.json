      "content": "I don't have access to steve aoki's personal preferences, creative process, or technical approach when producing electronic dance music (edm). however, i can offer some general information on how classical music features and techniques can be present in edm compositions:\n\n1. melodies: steve aoki, like many edm producers, often uses catchy melodies that are repetitive and easy to remember. some of these melodies may draw inspiration from classical music compositions, such as mozart or beethoven pieces, or even use samples from classical recordings. \n\n2. harmony: although edm music often relies on basic harmonic progressions, steve aoki has been known to experiment with more complex chord progressions, which can be found in classical music. his tracks often feature chord layers and arpeggios that create a sense of depth and richness in the sound.\n\n3. arrangement: many classical pieces feature a clear sense of structure and development, with different sections or movements that flow together to create a cohesive whole. similarly, edm tracks often follow a predictable structure of intro, buildup, drop, and outro, but creative producers like aoki can add their personal touch by modulating the intensity, changing the instrumentation, or adding unexpected elements.\n\n4. instrumentation: while classical music relies on acoustic instruments like strings, horns, and keyboards, steve aoki and other edm producers often use electronic instruments, synthesizers, and samplers to create their sound. however, some edm producers may also incorporate live instruments into their productions, such as pianos or guitars, which can be seen as a nod to classical music.\n\noverall, steve aoki and other artists in the edm genre can incorporate various elements of classical music into their compositions, whether it is through melody, harmony, arrangement, or instrumentation. these techniques can provide depth and interest to the music and open up a wider range of possibilities for experimentation and creativity."

      "content": "That makes sense. I always knew that EDM had some classical influences, but I didn't realize it could be so complex. Do you have any specific examples of Steve Aoki's songs that show these elements?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure, here are some examples of Steve Aoki's songs that incorporate classical music elements:\n\n1. \"Delirious (Boneless)\": This track features a catchy, repetitive melody that is reminiscent of classical music themes. The chords are also relatively complex, with a combination of major and minor chords that create tension and release.\n\n2. \"I Love It When You Cry\": In this collaboration with Moxie Raia, Steve Aoki uses a piano riff that sounds like it could be taken from a classical composition. The melody is also quite simple and memorable, which makes it easy for the listener to sing along.\n\n3. \"Back to Earth\": This song starts with a simple piano melody that slowly builds up with different elements, leading into a euphoric drop. The use of a real instrument like a piano adds a touch of classical music to the track and helps to create an emotional impact.\n\n4. \"Night Call\": In this collaboration with Migos and Lil Yachty, Steve Aoki uses a sample of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" melody, giving the track a haunting and dramatic edge. The use of samples from classical music is not uncommon among EDM producers, but Steve Aoki's creative use of the sample in this track is particularly effective.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but Steve Aoki has a lot of other songs that showcase his ability to blend classical music elements into his EDM productions."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. however, it's clear that the blend of classical and electronic music has already gained a significant following, and there's definitely a market for this type of music. this fusion of genres opens up new possibilities for both classical and electronic musicians and can introduce new audiences to both styles of music. in recent years, there has been a growth of edm festivals that incorporate orchestral elements with electronic music, demonstrating that the crossover of these two genres is becoming more mainstream. furthermore, with advancements in music production technology, it's easier than ever for producers to incorporate live instruments or orchestral samples into their tracks, which can contribute to classical music being more prominently featured in edm music. overall, there's definitely a potential for classical crossover music in the edm genre to continue to grow and evolve in the future, and it will be exciting to see how artists continue to push boundaries and experiment with these two styles of music."
