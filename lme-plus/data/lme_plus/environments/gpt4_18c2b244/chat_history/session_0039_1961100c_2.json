They can assess your chair's condition, provide guidance on the best restoration approach, and even perform the work if needed.\n\nRemember to always prioritize preservation over restoration. It's essential to maintain the chair's historical integrity and avoid using modern materials or techniques that could compromise its value or authenticity.\n\nGood luck with your project, and I hope these resources help you on your journey to restore your rare Chippendale chair!"
