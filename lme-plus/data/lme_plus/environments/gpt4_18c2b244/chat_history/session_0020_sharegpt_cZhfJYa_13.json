Some potential tables and relationships that could be included in the database are:\n\n* Customers table: This table could include information about individual customers, such as their names, contact information, and trading history.\n* Orders table: This table could include information about individual orders placed on the exchange, such as the order type, the quantity and price of the currency being traded, and the fees and commissions paid.\n* Currencies table: This table could include information about the different cryptocurrencies traded on the exchange, such as their names, symbols, and market caps.\n* Regions table: This table could include information about the different regions in which the exchange operates, such as the countries and continents.\n\nTo establish table relationships, you could create foreign keys in the Orders and Customers tables that reference the primary keys in the Currencies and Regions tables. This would allow you to link individual orders and customers to the currencies and regions they are associated with, enabling you to analyze data by currency type or geographic region.\n\nBy creating multiple tables and establishing table relationships, you can create a more comprehensive and flexible database that can be used to answer a wide range of questions about the cryptocurrency exchange."
