You can try searching for \"coffee shops on Main St between 5th and 6th Ave\" or \"coffee shops near Main St and 5th Ave\" to see if the new shop comes up in the search results.\n\nIf you're using Google Maps, you can also try using the \"Street View\" feature to take a virtual walk along Main St between 5th and 6th Ave to see if you can spot the coffee shop.\n\nAlternatively, you can also try checking review websites like Yelp or TripAdvisor to see if anyone has mentioned a new coffee shop in that area.\n\nIf you're still having trouble finding the coffee shop, feel free to provide more details or clarification, and I can try to help you further.\n\nOh, and don't forget to leave a little extra time in your morning routine to account for stopping at the coffee shop on your way to work!",
