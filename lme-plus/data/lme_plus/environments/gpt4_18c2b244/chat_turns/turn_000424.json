Using both a store-specific app and a general coupon app can definitely help you maximize your savings.\n\nRegarding tracking rewards points across multiple stores and programs, there are a few apps that can help you do just that. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **AwardWallet**: This app allows you to track your rewards points and miles across multiple loyalty programs, including grocery stores, airlines, hotels, and credit cards. You can add your loyalty program accounts, and AwardWallet will track your balances, expiration dates, and even alert you when points are about to expire.\n2. **Loyalty Card Manager**: This app helps you organize and track your loyalty cards, rewards points, and coupons across multiple stores and programs. You can add your loyalty cards, track your balances, and receive reminders when points are about to expire.\n3. **Fetch Rewards**: While primarily a receipt-scanning app, Fetch Rewards also allows you to link your loyalty cards from various stores, including grocery stores, gas stations, and restaurants. You can track your rewards points and balances, and even redeem points for cash or gift cards.\n4. **Checkout 51**: Similar to Fetch Rewards, Checkout 51 is a receipt-scanning app that also allows you to link your loyalty cards and track your rewards points and balances.\n\nThese apps can help you keep track of your rewards points across multiple stores and programs, making it easier to redeem your points and avoid expiration dates.\n\nBefore choosing an app, consider the following factors:\n\n* Which loyalty programs do you use most frequently?\n* Does the app support the specific programs you're interested in tracking?\n* How easy is it to add and manage your loyalty cards?\n* Are there any fees associated with using the app?\n* Do you prefer a simple, easy-to-use interface or a more detailed, feature-rich app?\n\nTake some time to explore these options, and you might find that one of them becomes your go-to app for tracking your rewards points!",
