  "content": "Oatmeal with fruit and nuts is a fantastic breakfast option that'll provide sustained energy and keep you full until your next meal.\n\nGiven your team meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it's a good idea to build some extra time into your morning routine on those days. Let's revisit your morning schedule to ensure you leave the house with plenty of time to spare:\n\n* 6:45 AM - Wake up (15 minutes earlier than usual)\n* 7:00 AM - Get ready (shower, dress, etc.)\n* 7:30 AM - Breakfast (oatmeal with fruit and nuts)\n* 7:50 AM - Finish getting ready (pack any remaining items, grab your bag, etc.)\n* 8:00 AM - Double-check everything (make sure you have all necessary materials, etc.)\n* 8:15 AM - Head out the door\n\nBy waking up 15 minutes earlier, you'll have some extra time to account for any unexpected delays or tasks that might come up. This should give you a comfortable buffer to arrive at your team meetings feeling calm and prepared.\n\nRemember to set your alarm clock accordingly, and try to establish a consistent wake-up time to help regulate your body's internal clock.\n\nDo you have any other questions or concerns about your morning routine, or is there anything else I can help you with?",
