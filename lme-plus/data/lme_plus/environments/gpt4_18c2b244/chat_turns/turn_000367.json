  "content": "I've been using quinoa in a lot of my lunches and dinners, often mixing it with the roasted vegetables I prepped on Sunday. I also used it in a chicken fajita recipe I found online, which turned out really well. Speaking of online recipes, I've been trying to get better at chopping vegetables more efficiently. Do you have any tips or resources for improving knife skills?",
