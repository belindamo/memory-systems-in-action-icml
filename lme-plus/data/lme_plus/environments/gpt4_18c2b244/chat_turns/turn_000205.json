  "content": "I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. however, it's clear that the blend of classical and electronic music has already gained a significant following, and there's definitely a market for this type of music. this fusion of genres opens up new possibilities for both classical and electronic musicians and can introduce new audiences to both styles of music. in recent years, there has been a growth of edm festivals that incorporate orchestral elements with electronic music, demonstrating that the crossover of these two genres is becoming more mainstream. furthermore, with advancements in music production technology, it's easier than ever for producers to incorporate live instruments or orchestral samples into their tracks, which can contribute to classical music being more prominently featured in edm music. overall, there's definitely a potential for classical crossover music in the edm genre to continue to grow and evolve in the future, and it will be exciting to see how artists continue to push boundaries and experiment with these two styles of music.",
