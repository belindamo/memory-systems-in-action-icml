HIIT workouts are great for busy mornings because they're efficient, effective, and can be done in a short amount of time.\n\nHere's a sample 30-minute HIIT workout you can try:\n\n**Warm-up (5 minutes)**\n\n* Jumping jacks: 30 seconds\n* Dynamic stretching: 20 seconds (leg swings, arm circles, etc.)\n\n**Circuit 1 (10 minutes)**\n\n* Burpees: 30 seconds\n* Mountain climbers: 30 seconds\n* Plank hold: 30 seconds\n* Rest: 30 seconds\n* Repeat for 10 minutes\n\n**Circuit 2 (10 minutes)**\n\n* Squat jumps: 30 seconds\n* Push-ups: 30 seconds\n* Lunges: 30 seconds (per leg)\n* Rest: 30 seconds\n* Repeat for 10 minutes\n\n**Cool-down (5 minutes)**\n\n* Static stretching: 20-30 seconds per muscle group (hamstrings, quads, chest, back, etc.)\n\nRemember to listen to your body and only do what feels comfortable and safe. You can always adjust the intensity and duration based on your fitness level and goals.\n\nIf you're new to HIIT workouts, you might want to start with shorter intervals (20-25 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you build endurance.\n\nTo fit this workout into your morning routine, you could try waking up 30-45 minutes earlier than usual. This would give you time to fit in the workout, shower, and still have some buffer time to grab your coffee and oatmeal before heading to the office.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you up for giving HIIT a try?",
