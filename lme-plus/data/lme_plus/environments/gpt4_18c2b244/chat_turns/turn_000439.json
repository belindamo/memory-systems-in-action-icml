  "content": "I'm looking for some information on restoring antique furniture. I recently inherited a rare Chippendale chair from the 18th century and I want to make sure I do it right. By the way, I've been doing some research on corrosion-resistant metals and I came across a type that's often used in high-quality watches, resistant to corrosion and all that. Would you happen to know any good resources on furniture restoration?",
