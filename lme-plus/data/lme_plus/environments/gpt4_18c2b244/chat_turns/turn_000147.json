Here are some tips to help you prioritize what you want to watch:\n\n1. **Categorize your shows:** Group your shows into categories, such as:\n\t* \"Must-watch\" shows: Your absolute favorites or shows you're highly invested in.\n\t* \"High-priority\" shows: Shows you really enjoy, but don't necessarily need to watch immediately.\n\t* \"Casual\" shows: Shows you enjoy, but can watch at a more relaxed pace.\n\t* \"New discoveries\" shows: Shows you've recently added or want to try out.\n2. **Set a \"next episode\" goal:** Identify the next episode you want to watch for each show. This helps you focus on the immediate next step, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the entire series.\n3. **Prioritize shows by platform:** If you have multiple shows on the same platform, consider watching those first to make the most of your subscription.\n4. **Consider the episode count:** Shows with fewer episodes per season or shorter seasons might be easier to fit into your schedule.\n5. **Balance new and ongoing shows:** Mix new shows with ongoing ones to keep your watchlist fresh and exciting.\n6. **Schedule watch sessions:** Allocate specific times for watching TV, and try to stick to those sessions. This helps you make progress on your watchlist and avoid binge-watching marathons.\n7. **Remove or pause shows:** Be honest with yourself \u2013 if you're not enjoying a show, consider removing it from your list or putting it on hold.\n8. **Take breaks and rotate shows:** If you're feeling overwhelmed or burnt out, take a break from a show and come back to it later. Rotate between shows to keep things interesting.\n9. **Make time for seasonal shows:** If you enjoy seasonal shows like \"Stranger Things\" or \"The Mandalorian,\" make sure to prioritize those during their release windows.\n10. **Review and adjust:** Regularly review your watchlist and adjust your priorities as needed. Life gets busy, and your priorities might change over time.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you'll be better equipped to manage your watchlist and make the most of your TV time.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a balance that works for you and your schedule. Don't be too hard on yourself if you can't watch everything at once \u2013 there's always time to catch up on your favorite shows!",
