I've been questioning my purpose and the meaning of life after a series of profound experiences over the past few months that have shaken my beliefs. I've had to re-examine my understanding of the world, and it's made me realize that I want more out of my career than just a paycheck. I want to do something that brings me fulfillment and makes a positive impact. As for my passions, I've always been interested in personal growth, wellness, and spirituality. I enjoy reading about these topics and attending workshops or retreats. I'm not sure how to translate these interests into a career, but I'm open to exploring possibilities.",
