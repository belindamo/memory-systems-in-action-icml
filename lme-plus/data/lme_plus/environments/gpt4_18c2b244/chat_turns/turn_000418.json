  "content": "As a ShopRite rewards member, you can definitely use digital coupons in addition to earning rewards points on your purchases.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Digital Coupons**: When you load digital coupons to your ShopRite rewards card, they're automatically applied at checkout when you purchase the qualifying items. These coupons are usually a fixed amount off (e.g., $1.00 off) or a percentage off (e.g., 10% off).\n2. **Rewards Points**: When you earn rewards points on your purchases, they're credited to your rewards account. You can redeem these points for discounts on future shopping trips.\n\nThe great news is that you can **stack** digital coupons with rewards points! This means you can use a digital coupon on an item and still earn rewards points on that purchase.\n\nFor example:\n\n* You have a digital coupon for $1.00 off a pack of diapers.\n* You purchase the diapers and earn 10 rewards points on that item.\n* At checkout, the digital coupon is applied, and you pay the discounted price.\n* You still earn the 10 rewards points on the purchase, which can be redeemed on a future shopping trip.\n\nJust remember to always scan your rewards card or enter your phone number at checkout to ensure you earn your rewards points and apply any digital coupons.\n\nBy combining digital coupons and rewards points, you can maximize your savings and get the best deals on the items you need. Happy shopping!",
