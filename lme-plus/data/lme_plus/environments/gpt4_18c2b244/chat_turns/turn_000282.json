But I can offer some general tips to help you find deals on diapers at Walmart:\n\n1. **Check Walmart's website**: Visit Walmart's website and navigate to their baby section. Look for a \"Deals\" or \"Rollbacks\" tab, where they often feature discounted prices on baby essentials, including diapers.\n2. **Sign up for Walmart's email newsletter**: By signing up, you'll receive exclusive offers, promotions, and sale notifications, including those on baby products.\n3. **Use Walmart's Savings Catcher app**: This app allows you to scan receipts and automatically applies any available savings or discounts to your account.\n4. **Look for in-store promotions**: When you visit Walmart, keep an eye out for in-store displays, banners, or signs advertising sales or promotions on diapers.\n5. **Stack coupons and sales**: Like you did with the Buy One Get One Free coupon on Luvs diapers, try combining manufacturer coupons with Walmart's sales or promotions for even greater savings.\n6. **Check competitor prices**: Walmart often price-matches competitors' prices. If you find a better deal on diapers at a nearby store, Walmart may match that price.\n7. **Consider Walmart's store brand**: Walmart's store brand, Parent's Choice, often offers affordable prices on diapers and other baby essentials.\n\nRemember to always check the prices and sales in your local store, as they may vary from online prices or promotions.\n\nI hope these tips help you find some great deals on diapers at Walmart this weekend!",
