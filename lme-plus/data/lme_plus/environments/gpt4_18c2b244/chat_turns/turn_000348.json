  "content": "It's understandable that you may not want to deal with the extra stress and complications that come with managing a credit card. If you prefer to keep things simple and avoid debt, using cash or a debit card can be a good option.\n\nHowever, if you do decide to use a credit card, it's important to keep track of your spending and pay off your balance on time each month to avoid late fees and interest charges. Many credit card issuers offer online tools and mobile apps that make it easy to monitor your account and manage your payments.\n\nAs for rewards and benefits, while they can be a nice perk, they are not essential. If you find that keeping track of rewards and benefits is too time-consuming or stressful, you can simply use your credit card as a convenient way to make purchases and pay bills, without worrying about the rewards.\n\nLiving within your means and avoiding debt is a smart financial goal, and there are many resources available to help you achieve it. It's important to create a budget, save for emergencies, and prioritize your spending to ensure that you are making the most of your income and avoiding unnecessary stress.",
