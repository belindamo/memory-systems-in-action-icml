  "content": "While there might be some overlap in offers, using multiple cashback apps can still be beneficial. Here's why:\n\n1. **Different offer portfolios**: Each app has its own set of offers, and they might not always overlap. By using multiple apps, you can increase your chances of finding cashback deals on the items you need.\n2. **Variety of retailers**: Different apps partner with different retailers, so you might find exclusive offers on certain apps. For example, Rakuten has a strong focus on online retailers, while Fetch Rewards has a strong presence in the grocery space.\n3. **Different cashback rates**: Apps may offer varying cashback rates for the same item or retailer. By using multiple apps, you can earn the highest cashback rate available.\n4. **Bonuses and promotions**: Apps often run promotions, bonuses, or special offers that can increase your earnings. By using multiple apps, you can take advantage of these opportunities.\n5. **Diversifying your rewards**: Spreading your cashback earnings across multiple apps can help you accumulate rewards faster and redeem them more frequently.\n\nThat being said, it's essential to consider the following:\n\n1. **App fatigue**: Managing multiple apps can be overwhelming, especially if you're not organized. Make sure you're comfortable with the number of apps you're using and can keep track of your earnings.\n2. **Offer duplication**: As you mentioned, some offers might overlap between apps. Be mindful of this and avoid redeeming the same offer on multiple apps to maximize your earnings.\n3. **Minimum redemption thresholds**: Some apps have minimum redemption thresholds, so make sure you're earning enough cashback to redeem rewards regularly.\n\nTo make the most of using multiple cashback apps, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Prioritize your apps**: Focus on the apps that offer the most value to you, based on your shopping habits and preferences.\n2. **Organize your apps**: Keep track of your cashback earnings, offers, and redemption thresholds using a spreadsheet, note-taking app, or a cashback aggregator like Cashback Monitor.\n3. **Rotate your apps**: Switch between apps regularly to take advantage of new offers, bonuses, and promotions.\n\nBy using multiple cashback apps strategically, you can increase your overall rewards earnings and maximize your savings.",
