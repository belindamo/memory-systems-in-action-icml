  "content": "Categorizing by genre can be a great way to prioritize your shows based on your current mood or preferences. Considering the genre can help you:\n\n1. **Match your mood:** As you mentioned, if you're in the mood for something light-hearted, a comedy might be a better fit than a drama.\n2. **Create a viewing flow:** Watching shows from the same genre or with similar tones can create a smooth viewing experience. For example, watching multiple sci-fi shows in a row can keep you in a similar mindset.\n3. **Take breaks from intense shows:** If you've been watching a heavy or intense drama, switching to a lighter genre can provide a nice break and help you recharge.\n4. **Explore new genres:** If you're feeling adventurous, you might prioritize shows from genres you don't typically watch, like trying out a romance or horror series.\n\nWhen considering genre, you can create sub-categories within your existing categories (e.g., \"Must-watch\" or \"High-priority\") or create separate lists for each genre. For example:\n\n* **Must-watch Comedies:** Shows like \"The Good Place\" or \"Schitt's Creek\" that you always make time for.\n* **High-priority Sci-Fi:** Shows like \"For All Mankind\" or \"Star Trek: Picard\" that you're highly invested in.\n* **Casual Dramas:** Shows like \"This Is Us\" or \"Grey's Anatomy\" that you enjoy, but don't need to watch immediately.\n\nBy incorporating genre into your prioritization strategy, you'll be better equipped to:\n\n* Cater to your current mood and preferences\n* Create a more enjoyable viewing experience\n* Take breaks from intense shows\n* Explore new genres and discover new favorites\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and your unique viewing habits. Experiment with different approaches, and don't be afraid to adjust your strategy as needed.",
