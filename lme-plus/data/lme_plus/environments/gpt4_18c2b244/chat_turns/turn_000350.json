The city is situated in a valley surrounded by mountains, which has made it an important strategic location for trade and communication. The following is a brief historic overview of the city's altitude and its impact on infrastructure:\n\n- Pre-Columbian period: The city was originally inhabited by the Quitu people who were skilled farmers and developed an extensive system of canals and terraces to cultivate crops. The high altitude and mountainous terrain provided natural protection and made it difficult for invaders to reach the city.\n\n- Spanish colonization: The Spanish arrived in Quito in 1534 and established it as the capital of the 'Kingdom of Quito' in the Andean region. The colonizers imposed their own infrastructure on the city which included the construction of churches, monasteries, and government buildings. The high altitude and rugged terrain made it challenging to build infrastructure and navigate through the mountains.\n\n- Independence period: In the 19th century, Quito became part of Gran Colombia, along with Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama. During this time, the city underwent significant changes, including the construction of the first public park, the opening of the first railway line, and the establishment of the first university. The altitude of the city made it a popular destination for international visitors seeking adventure, culture, and natural beauty.\n\n- Modern era: In the 20th century, Quito experienced rapid growth and urbanization due to population expansion, government policies, and economic development. The construction of highways, airports, and public transit systems has helped to connect the city with other parts of the country and the world. However, the high altitude and mountainous terrain have presented ongoing challenges for infrastructure planning and maintenance, including the risk of landslides, flooding, and erosion.\n\nIn summary, the altitude of Quito has been an important factor in shaping the city's history and infrastructure. While it has provided natural protection and scenic beauty, it has also posed significant challenges for development and maintenance. As the city continues to grow and evolve, it will need to find innovative solutions to address these ongoing challenges.",
