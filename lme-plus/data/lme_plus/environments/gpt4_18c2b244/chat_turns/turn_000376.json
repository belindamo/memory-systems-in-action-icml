  "content": "Yes, a lack of self-love can lead someone to attract toxic partners. When someone does not love themselves or have a strong sense of self-worth, they may seek validation and acceptance from others, even if those people are not good for them. This can lead them to lower their standards and accept behavior from a partner that is not healthy or respectful.\n\nAdditionally, people who lack self-love may be more likely to stay in toxic relationships because they do not believe they deserve better or because they fear being alone. This can lead to a pattern of repeated toxic relationships.\n\nIt's important for someone who lacks self-love to focus on building their own self-esteem and self-worth before entering into a relationship. They need to learn to love and accept themselves first so that they can attract partners who will treat them with the love and respect they deserve.",
