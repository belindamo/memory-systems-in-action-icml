Apple TV+ has some fantastic original content.\n\nNow, about organizing your watchlist: there are several ways to keep track of your TV shows across different platforms. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Spreadsheets:** Create a Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to log your shows. You can create columns for the show title, platform, current season, episode you're on, and a notes column for any additional comments.\n2. **TV Show Tracking Apps:**\n\t* **TV Time** (iOS, Android): A popular app that lets you track your watchlist, set reminders, and discover new shows.\n\t* **Trakt** (iOS, Android): Similar to TV Time, with a strong focus on community features and personalized recommendations.\n\t* **SeriesGuide** (Android): A simple, no-frills app for tracking your shows and receiving notifications.\n3. **Browser Extensions:**\n\t* **Watchlist** (Chrome): A minimalistic extension that lets you add shows from various platforms and set reminders.\n\t* **TV Show Tracker** (Firefox): Similar to Watchlist, but with a more detailed interface.\n4. **Note-taking Apps:**\n\t* **Evernote** (Web, iOS, Android): Create a note with a table or list to track your shows. You can also add tags and reminders.\n\t* **Trello** (Web, iOS, Android): Use boards, lists, and cards to organize your shows. You can add due dates, labels, and comments.\n5. **Pencil and Paper:** If you prefer a more analog approach, grab a notebook and create a table or list to track your shows. This method is simple, but it might not be as easily accessible as digital options.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and feel free to experiment with different tools until you find the one that suits your style.\n\nRemember, the key to keeping your watchlist organized is to:\n\n* Regularly update your list as you finish episodes or complete seasons.\n* Set reminders for new episode releases or season premieres.\n* Keep your list easily accessible, so you can quickly check what you need to watch next.\n\nHappy watching, and I hope you enjoy the rest of \"For All Mankind\"!",
