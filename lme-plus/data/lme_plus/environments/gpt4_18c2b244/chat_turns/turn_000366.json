Cooking a big batch of quinoa and roasted vegetables is a fantastic idea, as they're both so versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes.\n\nFrozen berries are a great ingredient to work with, and they're perfect for baking. They're just as nutritious as fresh berries, and they're available year-round. Plus, they're often cheaper than fresh berries, which is a bonus!\n\nIf you're looking for more recipes that use frozen berries, I'd be happy to suggest some. I've got a delicious recipe for a Frozen Berry Crisp that's perfect for a quick dessert or breakfast topping. And if you're looking for more meal prep ideas, I'd be happy to share some of those too!\n\nWhat's your favorite way to use quinoa? Do you have a go-to recipe or do you like to experiment with different flavors and ingredients?",
