I saw a post about a guy who's looking for a rare edition of \"The Name of the Rose\" by Umberto Eco. I think I might be able to help him out since I recently acquired a rare 1982 edition of that book. Do you know if there are any online marketplaces or forums where collectors can buy and sell rare books?",
