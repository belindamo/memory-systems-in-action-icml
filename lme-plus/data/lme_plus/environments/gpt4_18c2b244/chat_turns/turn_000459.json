By the way, I helped hide eggs and assisted the kids in finding them at the Easter Egg Hunt event organized by the Church of Christ last week. It was amazing to see the excitement on their faces. Can you tell me more about the significance of the Easter Vigil service and how it differs from the Easter Sunday Mass?",
