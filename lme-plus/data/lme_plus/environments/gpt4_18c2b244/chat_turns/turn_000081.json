Canada:\nThe Canadian healthcare system, known as Medicare, is predominantly publicly funded and administered at the provincial and territorial levels. It is built upon the principles of the Canada Health Act of 1984, which requires that healthcare services be publicly funded, universally accessible, comprehensive, portable, and delivered in a publicly administered manner.\n\nOver the last 20 years, some noteworthy policy decisions in Canada include:\n\na. The Romanow Report (2002): This report, formally titled \"Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada,\" emphasized the need to strengthen the public healthcare system and recommended increasing federal funding to ensure the sustainability of Medicare. It also focused on reducing wait times and increasing access to diagnostic services.\n\nb. The Health Accord (2004): As a response to the Romanow Report, the federal government and provincial/territorial governments agreed on a 10-year plan to reduce wait times and improve access to healthcare services. This accord led to increased federal investments in healthcare and the establishment of wait time benchmarks for certain procedures.\n\nc. Canada Health Transfer (2004): The federal government established the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) to provide long-term, predictable funding to provinces and territories for healthcare services. The CHT has continued to play a crucial role in supporting the Canadian healthcare system.\n\n1. United States:\nThe U.S. healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private payers and providers. While public programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provide coverage for specific populations, the majority of Americans receive coverage through private insurance, often employer-sponsored.\n\nKey policy decisions and legislation in the United States over the past 20 years include:\n\na. Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (2003): This legislation introduced Medicare Part D, which expanded prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. It was a significant expansion of public healthcare services for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nb. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (2010): The ACA, also known as Obamacare, aimed to increase healthcare access, improve affordability, and regulate the health insurance industry. The ACA introduced health insurance marketplaces, expanded Medicaid eligibility, and mandated that individuals obtain health insurance or face a penalty (the individual mandate was repealed in 2017). The ACA also prohibited insurers from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions and introduced essential health benefits that insurance plans were required to cover.\n\nc. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017): This legislation repealed the ACA's individual mandate, eliminating the penalty for not having health insurance. Although this change reduced the number of insured Americans, it allowed for more flexibility in the types of insurance plans available, contributing to the mixed nature of the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nIn conclusion, the policy decisions and legislation implemented over the past 20 years have solidified the differences between the Canadian and U.S. healthcare systems. Canada's focus on reinforcing and expanding its publicly-funded Medicare system has resulted in a more centralized and universally accessible model. In contrast, the United States has seen a mix of policies that have maintained and expanded the role of private insurance while also broadening public coverage for specific populations.",
