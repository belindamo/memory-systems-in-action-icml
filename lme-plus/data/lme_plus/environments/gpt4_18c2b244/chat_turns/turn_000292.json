Assuming you want to arrive a few minutes early, let's aim to leave your house by 8:15 AM.\n\nHere's a rough outline of your morning routine:\n\n* 7:00 AM - Wake up\n* 7:15 AM - Get ready (shower, dress, etc.)\n* 7:45 AM - Breakfast\n* 8:00 AM - Finish getting ready (pack any remaining items, grab your bag, etc.)\n* 8:15 AM - Head out the door\n\nNow, let's talk about breakfast options that'll give you sustained energy throughout the morning. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Oatmeal with fruit and nuts**: Steel-cut oats or rolled oats cooked with milk or water and topped with fresh fruit and nuts will provide a slow release of complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats to keep you fueled.\n2. **Avocado toast with scrambled eggs**: Whole-grain toast topped with mashed avocado, scrambled eggs, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper will give you a boost of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.\n3. **Greek yogurt with berries and granola**: Combine Greek yogurt with fresh or frozen berries and a sprinkle of granola for a protein-packed breakfast that'll keep you full and focused.\n4. **Smoothie bowl**: Blend together your favorite fruits, yogurt, and milk, then top with granola, nuts, and seeds for a nutrient-dense breakfast that's easy to prepare and packed with energy-boosting ingredients.\n\nChoose one of these options, and you'll be set for a morning of productivity and focus. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, feel free to let me know, and I can suggest alternative options.\n\nHow does this plan sound? Do you have any questions or would you like more breakfast ideas?",
