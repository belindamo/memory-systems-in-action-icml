Here are some tips to take your savings to the next level:\n\n1. **Stock up and buy in bulk**: Purchasing items like toilet paper, paper towels, and cleaning supplies in bulk can lead to significant savings. Consider buying larger packs or value-sized items to reduce your cost per unit.\n2. **Shop during sales cycles**: Keep track of your favorite items' sales cycles and plan your purchases accordingly. Many household essentials go on sale every 6-8 weeks, so try to stock up during these periods.\n3. **Use cashback apps**: Apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, and Checkout 51 offer cashback on various household essentials. While the savings might not be as high as manufacturer coupons, they can add up over time.\n4. **Combine coupons with sales**: Stack manufacturer coupons with store sales to maximize your savings. For example, if you have a $1 coupon for a toothpaste that's already on sale for 20% off, you'll save even more.\n5. **Look for digital coupons and offers**: Many stores, like Target and Walgreens, offer digital coupons and offers that can be loaded onto your loyalty card or mobile app. These can be used in addition to manufacturer coupons.\n6. **Buy store brands**: Store-brand products are often cheaper than name-brand products and are often of similar quality. This can be a great way to save on items like cleaning supplies, trash bags, and paper products.\n7. **Use price matching policies**: Some stores, like Walmart and Target, offer price matching policies. If you find an item cheaper at a competitor's store, they'll match the price.\n8. **Shop at discount stores**: Consider shopping at discount stores or dollar stores for non-essential items like paper products, cleaning supplies, or personal care items. These stores often offer lower prices than traditional retailers.\n9. **Use unit prices**: When comparing prices between different brands or sizes, check the unit price (price per ounce, pound, or count) to ensure you're getting the best deal.\n10. **Plan your shopping trip**: Make a list and stick to it to avoid impulse purchases. This will help you stay focused on the items you need and avoid buying unnecessary extras.\n11. **Use a price book**: Keep track of prices for your regular household essentials and note when they're at their lowest. This will help you identify the best times to stock up.\n12. **Shop with cashback credit cards**: If you have a cashback credit card, use it for your household essentials purchases to earn rewards or cashback.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can maximize your savings on household essentials like toiletries and cleaning supplies. Happy shopping!",
