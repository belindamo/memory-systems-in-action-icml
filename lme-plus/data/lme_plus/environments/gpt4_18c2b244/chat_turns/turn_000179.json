Try running the following command instead:\n```csharp\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/username-parveen/webgem.git\n```\nThis should add the remote repository URL to your local Git repository without any issues. Make sure to replace \"username-parveen\" with your actual GitHub username.\n\nAfter adding the remote repository, you should be able to push your local repository to GitHub using the following command:\n```perl\ngit push -u origin master\n```\nThis should push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.",
