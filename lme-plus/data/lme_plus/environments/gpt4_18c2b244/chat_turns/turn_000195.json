Don't worry, I've got some suggestions to help you set a stricter bedtime routine and stick to it:\n\n**Set a specific bedtime goal**: Decide on a realistic bedtime goal, such as 10:30 PM, and make it a priority.\n\n**Establish a pre-bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine that signals your body that it's time to wind down. This can include activities like:\n\nReading a book\nListening to calming music\nMeditation or deep breathing exercises\nYoga or stretching\nJournaling or writing\n\n**Create a phone-free zone**: Designate your bedroom as a phone-free zone to avoid the temptation of scrolling through your phone before bed. Charge your phone in another room or use a phone dock outside your bedroom.\n\n**Use apps that help you sleep**: Utilize apps like:\n\nFreedom: Blocks distracting websites and apps\nSelfControl: Helps you stay focused and avoid procrastination\nMoment: Tracks your screen time and sets reminders to put your phone away\n\n**Implement a \"no screens\" rule**: Set a rule for yourself to avoid screens (including TV, tablets, and phones) for at least an hour before bedtime.\n\n**Make your bedroom sleep-conducive**: Ensure your bedroom is:\n\nDark: Use blackout curtains or blinds\nQuiet: Use earplugs or a white noise machine\nCool: Keep your bedroom at a comfortable temperature\n\n**Get ready for bed**: Start getting ready for bed 30 minutes before your desired sleep time. This can include:\n\nBrushing your teeth\nChanging into PJs\nUsing the bathroom\n\n**Use a bedtime trigger**: Choose a specific activity or action that signals to your brain that it's time for sleep, such as:\n\nReading a book\nSaying a prayer\nDoing some gentle stretches\n\n**Create accountability**: Share your bedtime goals with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable.\n\n**Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it takes time to develop new habits. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Instead, focus on making progress and celebrating small wins.\n\n**Use a sleep tracker**: Wear a fitness tracker or use an app like Fitbit or Sleep Cycle to track your sleep patterns and identify areas for improvement.\n\n**Make mornings enjoyable**: Create a morning routine that you look forward to, which will make it easier to get out of bed and start your day.\n\nRemember, it may take some time for your body to adjust to a new bedtime routine.
