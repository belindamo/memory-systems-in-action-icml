I've been having trouble falling asleep before 11:30 PM, which affects my wake-up time. I've started winding down earlier by reading a book or listening to calming music, but I still find myself scrolling through my phone until late. Do you have any suggestions on how to set a stricter bedtime routine and stick to it?",
