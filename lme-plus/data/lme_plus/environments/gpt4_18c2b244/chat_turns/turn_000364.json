Here's a simple recipe for Blueberry Muffins using frozen blueberries:\n\n**Frozen Blueberry Muffin Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted\n* 1 cup milk\n* 2 large eggs\n* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n* 2 cups frozen blueberries\n* Confectioners' sugar (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

Simply place them in a single layer on a baking sheet, and once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container.
