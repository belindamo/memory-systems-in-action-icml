I'll also make sure to set specific deadlines for each task to keep myself accountable. As for staying organized, I'll be using a project management tool like Trello to keep track of my progress and notes. It's been a lifesaver for me so far!\n\nI've also been using a Pomodoro timer to help me stay focused and avoid burnout. It's amazing how much more productive I am when I work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a short break.\n\nHow about you? Do you have any favorite productivity tools or techniques that you'd recommend?",
