  "content": "Sure, here are some examples of Steve Aoki's songs that incorporate classical music elements:\n\n1. \"Delirious (Boneless)\": This track features a catchy, repetitive melody that is reminiscent of classical music themes. The chords are also relatively complex, with a combination of major and minor chords that create tension and release.\n\n2. \"I Love It When You Cry\": In this collaboration with Moxie Raia, Steve Aoki uses a piano riff that sounds like it could be taken from a classical composition. The melody is also quite simple and memorable, which makes it easy for the listener to sing along.\n\n3. \"Back to Earth\": This song starts with a simple piano melody that slowly builds up with different elements, leading into a euphoric drop. The use of a real instrument like a piano adds a touch of classical music to the track and helps to create an emotional impact.\n\n4. \"Night Call\": In this collaboration with Migos and Lil Yachty, Steve Aoki uses a sample of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" melody, giving the track a haunting and dramatic edge. The use of samples from classical music is not uncommon among EDM producers, but Steve Aoki's creative use of the sample in this track is particularly effective.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but Steve Aoki has a lot of other songs that showcase his ability to blend classical music elements into his EDM productions.",
