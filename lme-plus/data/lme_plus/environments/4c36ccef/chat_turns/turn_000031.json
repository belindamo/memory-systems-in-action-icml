  "content": "Peach tea sounds like a lovely choice!\n\n**Peach Tea Steeping Guidelines:**\n\nSince peach tea is a fruit-infused tea, the steeping time and temperature may vary depending on the specific brand and type of tea. However, here are some general guidelines to get you started:\n\n**Temperature:**\n\n* 190\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F (88\u00b0C to 93\u00b0C) is a good range for peach tea.\n\n**Steeping Time:**\n\n* For a light, fruity flavor: 3 to 5 minutes\n* For a stronger, more intense flavor: 5 to 7 minutes\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Use one teaspoon of loose-leaf tea or one tea bag for every 8 oz (237ml) of water.\n* Adjust the steeping time and temperature to your personal taste preferences.\n* You can also add a slice of fresh peach to the tea while it's steeping for added flavor and aroma.\n* If you're using a peach tea blend with black or green tea, follow the steeping guidelines for the base tea type.\n\n**Experiment and Enjoy:**\n\nRemember, the perfect steeping time and temperature may vary depending on the specific tea brand and your personal taste preferences. Feel free to experiment and find the combination that works best for you.\n\nI hope you enjoy your peach tea, and I'd love to hear about your experience!",
