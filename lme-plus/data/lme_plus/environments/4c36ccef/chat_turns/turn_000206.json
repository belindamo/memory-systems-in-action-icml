But I can suggest some ways for you to check the current traffic conditions:\n\n1. **Google Maps**: You can use Google Maps on your smartphone or computer to check the current traffic conditions. Simply enter your starting and ending points, and Google Maps will provide you with real-time traffic updates and suggest the best route.\n2. **Waze**: Waze is a GPS navigation app that provides real-time traffic information. You can download the app on your smartphone and check the current traffic conditions.\n3. **Traffic websites or apps**: Many cities and states have their own traffic websites or apps that provide real-time traffic updates. You can search for \"traffic conditions\" or \"traffic updates\" along with your city or state to find the relevant website or app.\n4. **Radio or TV traffic updates**: You can also tune into local radio or TV stations that provide traffic updates during rush hour.\n\nAs for your book, I'm thrilled to hear that it's making your daily commute more enjoyable! Reading can be a great way to pass the time during a commute, and it's wonderful that you're finding joy in it. What's the title of the book, if you don't mind me asking?",
