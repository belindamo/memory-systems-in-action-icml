  "content": "To find the true flag in the C:\\RumbleInTheJungle directory, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell\n2. Use the command `cd C:\\RumbleInTheJungle` to navigate to the RumbleInTheJungle directory.\n3. Use the command `dir /tw` to list the files in the directory and show the latest modified time. The `/tw` switch is used to sort files by the time they were last modified and show the latest time first.\n4. Look for the file that was modified most recently, it is likely to contain the true flag.\n5. Use the command `type flag.txt` (if the flag is a text file) or `notepad flag.txt` (if the flag is a text file and you want to open it in the notepad) or `start flag.jpg` (if the flag is a picture file) to open the flag file and view its contents.\n\nAnother way to achieve this is by using the command `dir /o:-d` this command will sort the files by the date they were last modified in descending order and show the latest modified first.\n\nIt is also important to note that some flags may be protected by permissions, in that case, you may not be able to access it if you are not an administrator.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is just an example and the flag's name and location may be different.",
