I think I'll focus on creating a city layout and some daily life scenarios, and incorporate some hands-on activities like making clay tablets and playing ancient Sumerian games. I'm also considering hiring some costumed interpreters to bring the exhibit to life. Do you have any suggestions on where I can find resources or information on Sumerian clothing and accessories?",
