  "content": "I'm happy to help you with your question! However, I have to clarify a few things.\n\nFirstly, the Ritz-Carlton in Battery Park is a great choice, and the views of the Statue of Liberty are indeed stunning.\n\nHowever, I have to inform you that the Ritz-Carlton is a part of the Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, not the Hilton Honors program. This means that your Hilton points cannot be redeemed for a free night at the Ritz-Carlton.\n\nIf you're interested in staying at the Ritz-Carlton, you would need to earn or purchase Marriott Bonvoy points to redeem for a free night. The number of points required for a free night at the Ritz-Carlton in Battery Park varies depending on the time of year and room type, but you can expect it to be around 60,000-80,000 points per night.\n\nIf you're loyal to the Hilton brand, you might consider staying at a Hilton property in New York City instead. There are several options to choose from, including the Hilton New York Midtown or the Conrad New York Downtown.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
