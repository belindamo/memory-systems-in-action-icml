  "content": "CI Integration - When designing a software system, it is important to ensure that the correct version of a service is deployed in each environment. Updating the service's Docker image for each environment can become cumbersome, which is why Facets has introduced the concept of \"CI Integration\".\n\nA CI Integration is an entity in Facets that provides a central repository for storing and managing Docker images for a service. The CI Integration can be of two types: environment or release stream. In other words, organizations can build images either for a specific environment or for a type of environment.\n\nOnce a CI Integration is created, it will have a separate bucket for each environment or release stream. The Docker images can be stored in these buckets through two mechanisms: by pushing the image directly via the Facets CLI or through a promotion process. The Facets CLI, known as facetctl, can be integrated with popular CI systems like CodeBuild, Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.\n\nPromotion Workflows - Organizations often need to promote builds from one environment to another, such as from a QA environment to a Staging environment, and finally to a Production environment. To make this process seamless and controlled, Facets has introduced the concept of promotion workflows.\n\nPromotion workflows in CI Integration can be of type environment or release stream and can be attached to similarly-typed CI Integration. This allows for clear and concise promotion paths for builds, making it easier for organizations to move their builds from one environment to another.\n\nBy using promotion workflows in CI Integration, organizations can ensure that builds are only promoted when they are ready and that the promotion process is well-defined and controlled. This helps to reduce the risk of errors and makes it easier for organizations to roll back if needed. Additionally, the promotion workflows in CI Integration include auditing information, such as who promoted which build, and when, providing a clear record of the promotion process for accountability and transparency purposes.\n\nOur current implementation of the Artifact CI or CI integration page presents a challenge for users who need to \n\nAttach a single promotion workflow to multiple Artifact CIs, which accounts for the majority (90%) of use cases. \n\nThe page's name itself may not accurately reflect its purpose and may cause confusion for users. \n\nThe current process of attaching promotion workflows to Artifact CI is a tedious and time-consuming task that requires users to edit each Artifact CI manually. \n\nThis can be a frustrating experience for users.",
