I think I'll start by researching the books and online resources you mentioned, and then reach out to some costumers or prop-makers for custom-made Sumerian clothing and accessories. I'm also considering reaching out to local historians or archaeologists to get their input on the exhibit and ensure accuracy. Do you have any suggestions on how I can effectively promote the \"Museum Day\" event and my Sumerian city-states exhibit to attract more visitors?",
