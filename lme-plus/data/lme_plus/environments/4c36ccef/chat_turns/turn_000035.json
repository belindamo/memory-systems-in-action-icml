Here are some color palettes and pattern suggestions that would complement your rug perfectly:\n\n**Color Palettes:**\n\n1. **Earthy Tones:** Stick to a natural color scheme by pairing the beige rug with earthy tones like terracotta, sienna, oatmeal, and moss green. These colors will create a harmonious and cozy atmosphere.\n2. **Desert Dreams:** Inspired by the Moroccan desert, combine the beige rug with warm, sun-kissed hues like golden yellow, burnt orange, and soft pink. This palette will add a vibrant and exotic touch to your room.\n3. **Soft Neutrals:** For a calming and serene atmosphere, pair the beige rug with soft neutrals like cream, pale gray, or taupe. This palette will create a soothing and relaxing space.\n\n**Patterns:**\n\n1. **Geometric Patterns:** Geometric patterns are a staple in Moroccan design. Consider pillows with geometric shapes like chevrons, hexagons, or triangles in earthy tones to create a cohesive look.\n2. **Tribal Prints:** Add a touch of Moroccan flair with tribal-inspired prints featuring intricate patterns, azulejo tiles, or Beni Ourain-inspired designs. These patterns will add depth and visual interest to your space.\n3. **Botanical Motifs:** Combine the natural beige rug with botanical motifs like florals, leaves, or trees in earthy tones. This will bring in a sense of organic elegance and whimsy.\n\n**Specific Pillow Ideas:**\n\n1. A terracotta-colored pillow with a subtle geometric pattern or a natural linen pillow with a subtle texture would complement the rug nicely.\n2. A golden yellow pillow with a Moroccan-inspired tile pattern or a burnt orange pillow with a subtle chevron design would add a pop of color and energy to the room.\n3. A cream-colored pillow with a delicate botanical print or a pale gray pillow with a subtle geometric pattern would create a soothing and calming atmosphere.\n\nRemember, when choosing throw pillows, consider the overall aesthetic you want to achieve in your living room.
