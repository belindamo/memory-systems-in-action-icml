  "content": "No, you cannot expect any therapist to fix all your problems. It's essential to understand that therapy is a collaborative process that requires active participation and engagement from both the therapist and the client. A therapist's role is to facilitate change by providing a safe, non-judgmental space and evidence-based techniques that can help clients identify and process thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that may be causing distress. However, lasting change and progress also depend on the client's willingness, open-mindedness, and effort to apply the skills and strategies learned in therapy to their daily life. Additionally, therapy is not a quick fix or a one-size-fits-all solution, and progress may take time and dedication. Therefore, finding the right therapist, setting realistic goals, and being committed to the therapy process are crucial for achieving the best outcomes. Remember that recovery is a journey, and no therapist can do the work for you.",
