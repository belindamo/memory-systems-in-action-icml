  "content": "Tim will look at himself in the mirror, noting the dampness of his boxers and the drool on his face left over from Samantha's dream. He'll reflect on how this makes him feel, noting the innocence of the situation and the comfort it brought to Samantha. He'll take note of the details, the way the drool glistens in the morning light and the way his boxers cling to his skin. He'll think about how he'll have to change and wash them before heading out for the day. He'll also think about how he'll have to clean his face and maybe take a shower before heading out for the day. He'll think about how he'll have to tell Samantha about this when she wakes up and how she might feel about it. He'll reflect on all these details innocently and with a sense of comfort.",
