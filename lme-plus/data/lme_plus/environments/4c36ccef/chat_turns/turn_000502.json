It's always a great feeling to complete a game, especially one as emotionally intense as that.\n\nGhost of Tsushima is an excellent choice to fill the void, and it's great that you've been meaning to play it for a while. The game's unique setting, beautiful visuals, and stealth-action gameplay make it a great choice for fans of The Last of Us series.\n\nIf you do decide to play Ghost of Tsushima, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it! The game's atmosphere, visuals, and combat mechanics are all highly praised, and it's a great opportunity to experience a unique blend of action, stealth, and exploration.\n\nThat being said, if you're not ready to commit to another long game just yet, you might want to consider some shorter experiences to tide you over. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **What Remains of Edith Finch**: A beautiful, emotional, and introspective game that's only about 2-3 hours long. It's a great palate cleanser between bigger games.\n2. **Firewatch**: A first-person narrative-driven game set in a Wyoming wilderness lookout tower. It's a short, thought-provoking experience (around 4-6 hours) with a strong focus on storytelling and character development.\n3. **Hyper Light Drifter**: A top-down action game with a beautiful art style and a touching narrative. It's a relatively short game (around 6-8 hours), and it's a great way to experience a unique blend of exploration and combat.\n\nThese games are all critically acclaimed, and they're short enough to fit into a shorter play session. They might help you scratch that gaming itch without committing to a longer experience like Ghost of Tsushima.\n\nLet me know what you decide to do! Are you going to dive into Ghost of Tsushima, or do you want to try something shorter?",
