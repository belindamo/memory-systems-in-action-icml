Since your gym is closer to your apartment, it makes sense to stop by your apartment to drop off your dance gear before heading to the gym.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend stopping by your apartment to drop off your gear. This will save you from having to carry it with you to the gym, and you can also freshen up or change into your gym clothes if needed.\n\nAfter your dance class, you can bike back to your apartment, drop off your gear, and then head to the gym. This should only add a short detour to your overall route, and it'll be more convenient than carrying your dance gear to the gym.\n\nHere's a rough outline of your updated plan:\n\n1. Dance class (2:00 PM)\n2. Bike back to your apartment ( approx. 20 minutes)\n3. Drop off dance gear and freshen up (10-15 minutes)\n4. Bike to the gym ( approx. 5-10 minutes)\n\nThis should give you a good break between your dance class and gym workout, and you'll be able to focus on your gym routine without worrying about your dance gear.\n\nHow does this revised plan sound?",
