Here's how it works:\n\n**Bed Bath & Beyond's Price Match Guarantee**:\n\n* If you purchase an item at Bed Bath & Beyond and find the same item at a lower price at a local competitor's store or on BedBathandBeyond.com within 20 days of purchase, they'll match that lower price.\n* To request a price match, you'll need to bring the item and the competitor's ad or proof of lower price to a Bed Bath & Beyond store.\n* If the price match is approved, you'll receive a refund for the difference in price.\n\n**Important Notes**:\n\n* The price match guarantee only applies to identical items, including brand, model, and features.\n* Online prices from retailers like Amazon or Walmart.com are not eligible for price matching.\n* Bed Bath & Beyond reserves the right to limit price matches to one per customer per item.\n\nWhile this policy doesn't exactly offer price protection in the classical sense, it does provide some protection against price drops within a 20-day window. If you're concerned about prices dropping after your purchase, you could consider the following:\n\n* Keep an eye on the price of the Cuisinart DCC-3200 at Bed Bath & Beyond and other retailers for 20 days after your purchase.\n* If you find a lower price, bring the item and proof of the lower price to a Bed Bath & Beyond store to request a price match.\n* If you're unable to find a lower price, you can still enjoy the peace of mind that you got a good deal with your 20% off coupon and College Savings Pass discount.\n\nBy combining these discounts and taking advantage of Bed Bath & Beyond's price match guarantee, you'll be well-protected and can enjoy your new Cuisinart DCC-3200 coffee maker with confidence!",
