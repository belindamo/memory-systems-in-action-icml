  "content": "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. It's great that you're thinking ahead and planning to make the most of your luggage space. Using shoe bags and stuffing them with small items is a fantastic way to keep your shoes protected and organized. And wearing your bulkiest shoes on the plane is a brilliant idea - it'll not only save space in your luggage but also reduce the weight of your bag.\n\nRemember to also consider the weather and activities you plan to do in Melbourne when packing your shoes. You might want to prioritize packing shoes that are comfortable and suitable for walking, as Melbourne is a great city to explore on foot.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a smooth and enjoyable trip to Melbourne, and happy packing!",
