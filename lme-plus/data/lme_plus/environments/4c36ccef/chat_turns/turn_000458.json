Here are some exercises and tutorials to help you improve your skills:\n\n**Wet-on-Wet Exercises:**\n\n1. **Wet-on-Wet Gradient**:\n\t* Mix a light wash of color (e.g., yellow ochre).\n\t* Paint a gradient on wet paper, starting from the top and working down.\n\t* Add more water to your brush as you go, creating a smooth transition from light to dark.\n2. **Wet-on-Wet Blobs**:\n\t* Mix a small amount of pigment with water to create a wet, juicy consistency.\n\t* Paint small blobs of color on wet paper, allowing them to merge and blend.\n\t* Observe how the colors interact and spread.\n3. **Wet-on-Wet Washes**:\n\t* Mix a wash of color (e.g., blue).\n\t* Paint a wash on wet paper, starting from one edge and working across.\n\t* Add more water to your brush as you go, creating a smooth, even wash.\n\n**Wet-on-Dry Exercises:**\n\n1. **Drybrushing**:\n\t* Mix a small amount of pigment with very little water (almost dry).\n\t* Paint a drybrush stroke on dry paper, using the tip of the brush.\n\t* Experiment with different brushstrokes and pressure.\n2. **Glazing**:\n\t* Mix a small amount of pigment with water to create a transparent wash.\n\t* Paint a glaze over a previously painted area (dry or wet).\n\t* Observe how the colors interact and deepen.\n3. **Edge Control**:\n\t* Mix a wash of color.\n\t* Paint a shape or line on dry paper, using a round brush.\n\t* Practice controlling the edge of the shape by varying the amount of water and pressure.\n\n**Tutorials and Resources:**\n\n1. **YouTube Tutorials**:\n\t* Search for watercolor tutorials by artists like Alvaro Castagnet, Joseph Zbukvic, or Anna Mason.\n\t* Look for tutorials specifically focused on wet-on-wet and wet-on-dry techniques.\n2. **Watercolor Books**:\n\t* \"The Art of Watercolor\" by Charles Reid\n\t* \"Watercolor: A Comprehensive Guide\" by David Lewis\n\t* \"The Watercolor Course You've Always Wanted\" by Leslie Frontz\n3. **Online Courses and Classes**:\n\t* Craftsy: \"Watercolor Essentials\" by Anna Mason\n\t* Skillshare: \"Watercolor Fundamentals\" by Emily Larkins\n\t* Artists Network: \"Watercolor University\" (various instructors)\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* Practice regularly to develop your skills and muscle memory.\n* Start with simple exercises and gradually increase complexity.\n* Use high-quality watercolor paper and brushes.\n* Observe and study the work of other watercolor artists.\n* Be patient and gentle when handling your brushes and paper.\n\nRemember, the key to mastering wet-on-wet and wet-on-dry techniques is to practice consistently and understand the behavior of water and pigment.
