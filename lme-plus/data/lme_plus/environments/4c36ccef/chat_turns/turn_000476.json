  "content": "After your dance class, you can head to the gym on your bike. Since I don't know the exact location of your gym, I'll need a bit more information from you.\n\nCould you please provide me with the name of your gym or its approximate location (e.g., intersection, neighborhood, or zip code)? That way, I can give you the most efficient bike route from your dance studio to the gym.\n\nAdditionally, I'll assume you're comfortable with riding on streets with moderate traffic and bike lanes. If you prefer a more scenic route or quieter streets, please let me know, and I'll try to suggest an alternative.\n\nOnce I have the gym's location, I can provide you with turn-by-turn directions, including the distance, estimated time, and any bike-friendly features like bike lanes or trails along the route.",
