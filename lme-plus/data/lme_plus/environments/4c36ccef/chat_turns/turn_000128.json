What a wonderful omen for your romantic getaway!\n\nI'm thrilled to hear you're excited about the horseback ride and wine tasting experience. The wine tastings included with the horseback ride are typically private or semi-private, depending on the company and the winery. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Private Wine Tastings:**\n\n* **Intimate Setting**: You and your partner will have a private wine tasting experience at the winery, often in a secluded area or a private room.\n* **Personalized Attention**: The winery staff or a private guide will provide personalized attention, answering your questions and sharing their expertise about the wines.\n* **Exclusive Selection**: You'll often have the opportunity to taste a selection of wines not available to the general public, including limited-production or reserve wines.\n\n**Semi-Private Wine Tastings:**\n\n* **Small Group**: You'll be part of a small group, typically 6-12 people, allowing for a more personalized experience than a large group tour.\n* **Guided Tasting**: A knowledgeable guide will lead the tasting, providing information about the wines and answering questions.\n* **Variety of Wines**: You'll typically taste a selection of 4-6 wines, including a mix of whites, reds, and possibly some dessert wines.\n\nSome horseback ride companies offer a more rustic, picnic-style wine tasting experience, where you'll enjoy a selection of wines and hors d'oeuvres in a picturesque setting, such as a vineyard or a scenic overlook.\n\nKeep in mind that the specific wine tasting experience may vary depending on the company and winery you choose. If you have a preference for a private or semi-private tasting, be sure to ask when booking your horseback ride and wine tasting experience.\n\nNow, let's get back to the romance... With the horseback ride and wine tasting experience, you'll have plenty of opportunities to enjoy quality time with your partner, surrounded by the beautiful Santa Barbara Wine Country scenery. Cheers to a wonderful romantic getaway!",
