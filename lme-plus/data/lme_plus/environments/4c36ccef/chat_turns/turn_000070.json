They wore sandals or went barefoot.\n* **Women's Clothing**: Long, flowing robes, often with intricate embroidery or other decorations. They wore their hair long and adorned with jewelry, such as beads or headpieces.\n* **Accessories**: Headpieces, jewelry (beads, pendants, etc.), sandals, belts, and cloaks.\n* **Fabrics**: Linen, wool, and possibly silk (although this is less certain).\n* **Colors**: Earth tones, such as beige, brown, and red, were common, as well as blues and whites.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and it's essential to consult with historians or archaeologists to ensure accuracy and authenticity. You may also want to consider consulting with costumers or prop-makers who specialize in historical costumes to get a better understanding of the materials, techniques, and designs used in ancient Sumeria.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on creating an authentic and engaging exhibit!",
