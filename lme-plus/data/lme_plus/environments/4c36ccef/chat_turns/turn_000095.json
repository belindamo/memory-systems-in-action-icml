  "content": "That's a great point about checking the coffee shop's website. I'll definitely do that to get a better sense of their roasting process and flavor profiles. By the way, speaking of flavor profiles, I've been experimenting with different creamers in my morning coffee. I've tried almond milk and oat milk, and I think I prefer the oat milk now. Have you come across any studies or articles about the effects of different dairy or non-dairy creamers on the flavor of coffee?",
