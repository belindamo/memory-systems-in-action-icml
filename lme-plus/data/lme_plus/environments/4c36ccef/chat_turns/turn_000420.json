  "content": "Geisha still perform traditional Japanese music with the shamisen today, but their art has evolved to include more contemporary forms of entertainment. Today, a geisha may perform a variety of arts, including singing, dancing, playing traditional instruments such as the shamisen, and performing contemporary music.\n\nWhile modern geisha still learn and perform traditional Japanese music with the shamisen and other instruments, they may also incorporate modern music styles and instruments into their performances to appeal to contemporary audiences. For example, some geisha may play western instruments like the piano or guitar.\n\nHowever, the traditional arts and culture of the geisha are still very much valued in modern times. Geisha continue to undergo many years of training in traditional arts and music to ensure that their performances stay true to the spirit of the geisha tradition. The use of traditional music with the shamisen in geisha performances remains an essential and recognizable part of the geisha tradition, even as it continues to evolve and change with modern times.",
