However, I can try to describe what the correct washes should look like and provide some tips on how to achieve them.\n\n**Wet-on-Wet Washes:**\n\nA good wet-on-wet wash should have the following characteristics:\n\n* Soft, blended edges: The color should gradually fade from dark to light, with no harsh lines or demarcations.\n* Even consistency: The wash should be smooth and even, with no streaks or blotches.\n* Transparency: The wash should be transparent, allowing the white of the paper to show through.\n\nTo achieve a good wet-on-wet wash:\n\n* Use a round brush with a good point, as it will allow you to control the amount of water and pigment on the paper.\n* Mix your pigment with plenty of water to create a thin, watery consistency.\n* Load your brush with the mixture and wipe off any excess on the rim of the water container.\n* Paint the wash in smooth, even strokes, starting from the top and working down.\n* Use gentle pressure and don't scrub the paper, as this can create streaks and texture.\n\n**Wet-on-Dry Washes:**\n\nA good wet-on-dry wash should have the following characteristics:\n\n* Crisp, sharp edges: The color should have a clear, defined edge, with no bleeding or feathering.\n* Texture and granulation: The wash should have a slight texture and granulation, giving it a sense of depth and dimension.\n* Opacity: The wash should be more opaque than a wet-on-wet wash, with less transparency.\n\nTo achieve a good wet-on-dry wash:\n\n* Use a brush with stiffer bristles, as it will allow you to apply more pressure and control the pigment.\n* Mix your pigment with less water than you would for a wet-on-wet wash, creating a thicker, more paste-like consistency.\n* Load your brush with the mixture and wipe off any excess on the rim of the water container.\n* Paint the wash in bold, confident strokes, using more pressure than you would for a wet-on-wet wash.\n* Use a gentle touch to build up layers of color, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next.\n\n**Resources:**\n\nIf you're still having trouble, I recommend checking out some online resources that provide visual demonstrations of wet-on-wet and wet-on-dry techniques. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n* YouTube Channels:\n\t+ Watercolor by Anna Mason: Anna is a talented watercolor artist who shares her techniques and processes in clear, easy-to-follow videos.\n\t+ The Art of Watercolor: This channel features a variety of watercolor artists and techniques, with a focus on wet-on-wet and wet-on-dry washes.\n* Watercolor Blogs:\n\t+ Doodlewash: This blog features a community of watercolor artists sharing their work, techniques, and tips.\n\t+ The Postman's Knock: This blog focuses on watercolor and mixed media, with plenty of tutorials and examples of wet-on-wet and wet-on-dry techniques.\n\nI hope this helps! Remember, practice is key to mastering wet-on-wet and wet-on-dry techniques. Don't be discouraged if it takes time to get the hang of it \u2013 with patience and persistence, you'll get there!",
