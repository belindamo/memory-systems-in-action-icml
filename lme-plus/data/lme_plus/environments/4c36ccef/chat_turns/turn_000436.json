The HotFixID is the code name of the patch, also known as the KB (knowledge base) number, and it will be in the format of KBXXXXXX.\n\nFor example, if the command returns the following:\n\nHotFixID InstalledBy InstalledOn Description\n\n---\n\nKB5003254 Administrator 3/2/2022 12:00:00 AM Security Update\n\nThe KB (knowledge base) number of the security patch is KB5003254.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the patches installed on the host may be different, and the format of the output may change depending on the version of PowerShell that you are using.",
