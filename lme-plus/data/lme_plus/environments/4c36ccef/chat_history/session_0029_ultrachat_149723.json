      "content": "Rouen's cuisine has evolved over time, influenced by a variety of factors. The city's position as an important port on the Seine river has made it a hub for trade and commerce, allowing it to incorporate different culinary traditions.\n\nDuring the medieval period, Rouen was renowned for its roast meats, such as beef and lamb, which were cooked on open spits over an open fire. This tradition continued into the modern era, with the popularity of dishes like gigot d'agneau (roast lamb leg) and boudin blanc (white pudding sausage).\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Rouen became a center of the dairy industry, and local cheeses like Neufch\u00e2tel and Livarot became popular. The city also developed a thriving pastry and dessert culture, with specialties like tarte Tatin, macarons, and mille-feuilles.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Rouen's cuisine was influenced by the influx of immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East, who brought with them new flavors and ingredients. Today, Rouen's culinary scene is a blend of traditional French cuisine, regional specialties, and international influences.\n\nOverall, Rouen's cuisine has evolved over time through a combination of local traditions, international influences, and changing tastes and trends."
