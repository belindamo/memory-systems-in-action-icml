  "content": "The Fresh Earth ecosystem uses a token-based economic model to incentivize and reward stakeholders for their participation in regenerative agriculture and sustainable food systems. The Fresh Earth Token (FET) is a verifiable science and technology-based token that measures the impact of regenerative practices using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, reduction in chemical use, and increase in food quality. The token is unique to each country and represents fractional ownership of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the food ecosystem business, allowing investors to participate in the growth and success of the ecosystem and share in the value generated.\n\nThe ecosystem also includes an expert community, which is an autonomous decentralised and transparent community-governed ecosystem with open sourced and independently verifiable measures of impact. It enables, improves and facilitates local collaborations to optimize each stakeholder in the supply chain and hence the overall system.\n\nThe retail marketplace is a four-sided ecommerce platform that connects Consumers with Farmers, Designers (programs) and Manufacturers (products) with supply chain (Packers, Drivers, Physical Stores). It is centred around the four players and allows for the creation and management of storefronts, inventory management, buying and selling of products, produce and programs, and end to end supply chain processes.\n\nThe Consumer Movement, also known as the Consumer App, allows consumers to create their own food health and farming system by building the community and an accurate demand profile, participating in information that allows the self-organisation of the ecosystem. It is a gamified impact adventure whereby users and the community have the ability to reverse global warming by participating in challenges, milestones and activities.\n\nThe Fresh Earth Impact Validation (FEIV) is a score related to a global standard of measurement against four KPIs: Health, Economy, Food Quality, and Environment. The FEIV uses the Guardian Authentication platform to source regulated and validated internal and external data, pulling it into an open-source development sandbox, using a visualisation tech and approved methodology to measure, quantify and value the data sets.\n\nThe Fresh Earth Rewards (FER) system is designed to redistribute tokens and wealth among stakeholders based on their impact, participation and ecosystem development, as an alternative to investor funding. The FER system uses a transparent ledger to keep the money within the ecosystem and encourages sharing of wealth between stakeholders and optimization of costs through participation and \"Data Comms\" nudging.",
