  "content": "Sure! One example of a plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with fungi is the majority of plants in a forest ecosystem. These plants form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi colonize the roots of these plants, forming an extensive network of hyphae (thin, thread-like structures). In return for plant-sourced carbon and energy, the mycorrhizal fungi provide the plant with essential nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium, which the plant might not be able to access otherwise. This association is beneficial for both partners as the plant benefits from nutrient uptake while the fungi receive carbohydrates from the plant.",
