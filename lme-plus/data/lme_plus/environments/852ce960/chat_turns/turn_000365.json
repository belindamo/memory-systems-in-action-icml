  "content": "Congratulations on your new home! I'm happy to help you with setting up cable and TV services.\n\nHowever, I need to clarify a few things. As a digital AI assistant, I don't have access to your personal information or previous conversations. I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't recall you getting pre-approved for a mortgage or any other personal details.\n\nTo provide you with accurate information on cable and TV service providers in your area, I'll need to know your location. Could you please share your zip code or city and state with me? That way, I can give you a list of available providers and their prices.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that prices may vary depending on the specific services you choose, such as internet speed, TV channel packages, and any bundles or promotions. I'll do my best to provide you with a general idea of what's available in your area.\n\nLet me know your location, and I'll get started on helping you find the best cable and TV services for your new home!",
