Mahatma Gandhi: Although he was not a Sikh himself, Mahatma Gandhi had a close relationship with the Sikh community and was deeply influenced by Sikh principles of equality, justice, and service. Gandhi's teachings on nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience were heavily inspired by the Sikh tradition of peaceful activism.\n\n2. Bhagat Singh: Bhagat Singh was a Sikh nationalist and socialist revolutionary who was active in the Indian independence movement in the early 20th century. He was a vocal critic of British colonialism and advocated for socialist reforms to empower the poor and marginalized.\n\n3. Harbhajan Singh Yogi: Harbhajan Singh Yogi, also known as Yogi Bhajan, was a Sikh yogi and spiritual teacher who founded the 3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization) movement. He was a pioneer in bringing yoga and meditation to the West and advocated for healthy living and spiritual growth.\n\n4. Jaswant Singh Khalra: Jaswant Singh Khalra was a human rights activist who worked to expose the human rights abuses committed by the Indian government against the Sikh community during the 1980s and 1990s. He was abducted and killed by Indian government forces in 1995, but his activism helped bring attention to the plight of the Sikh community and inspired others to continue fighting for social justice.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many Sikh figures who have made an impact on social justice movements. Sikhism's principles of equality, justice, and service continue to inspire individuals to work towards creating a more just and equitable world for all.",
