I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot and provide some tips to extend its battery life.\n\nBefore we dive into that, I'm glad to hear that your internet connection issue has been resolved! However, it's possible that the internet connection issue might have been related to your battery life problem. Sometimes, a poor internet connection can cause your laptop to consume more power than usual.\n\nTo troubleshoot and extend your laptop's battery life, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check your battery health**: Go to your laptop's manufacturer website and look for a utility tool that can check your battery's health. For example, if you have a Dell laptop, you can use Dell's Battery Meter. This will give you an idea if your battery is holding its charge properly.\n2. **Update your operating system and drivers**: Ensure your OS and drivers are up-to-date, as newer updates often include power management improvements. Go to your laptop's settings or control panel to check for updates.\n3. **Adjust your power settings**: Go to your Power Options in the Control Panel (Windows) or Energy Saver (macOS) and adjust the settings to optimize battery life. You can set the screen brightness to auto-adjust, turn off unnecessary devices, and adjust the power plan to \"Balanced\" or \"Power Saver.\"\n4. **Disable unnecessary startup programs**: Some programs might be running in the background and consuming power without your knowledge. Press the Windows key + R, type \"msconfig,\" and disable any unnecessary programs from starting up.\n5. **Turn off unnecessary devices**: Disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other devices when not in use to conserve power.\n6. **Check for resource-intensive programs**: Open the Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (macOS) to see which programs are consuming the most resources. Close any unnecessary programs or background applications.\n7. **Clean dust from your laptop's vents**: Dust can block airflow and cause your laptop to overheat, which can drain the battery faster. Use compressed air to clean out the vents and fans.\n8. **Calibrate your battery**: Calibrate your battery by letting it drain to 0% and then charging it to 100%. Repeat this process a few times to help the battery gauge its capacity more accurately.\n9. **Limit screen brightness**: Dimming your screen can significantly extend battery life. You can also adjust the auto-brightness setting to adapt to your surroundings.\n10. **Consider replacing the battery**: If your laptop's battery is old or has been used extensively, it might be time to replace it. You can check with the manufacturer or a authorized service center for guidance.\n\nTo further troubleshoot the issue, can you please provide me with some more information?\n\n* What is your laptop's make and model?\n* What is your operating system?\n* How old is your laptop and battery?\n* What are your typical usage patterns (e.g., web browsing, video streaming, gaming)?\n* Have you noticed any other symptoms or errors besides the battery drain?\n\nBy providing more details, we can narrow down the possible causes and find a solution to extend your laptop's battery life.",
