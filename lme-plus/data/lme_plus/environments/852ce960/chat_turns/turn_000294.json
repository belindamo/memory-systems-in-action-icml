Identifying and unfollowing accounts that don't add value to your feed is a crucial step in curating a Twitter experience that supports your goals and well-being.\n\nUsing Twitter's built-in features like Mute and Not Interested can also help you silence accounts that are noisy or irrelevant, reducing distractions and making it easier to focus on the content that matters to you.\n\nCategorizing accounts into lists is a fantastic way to organize your feed and ensure that you're seeing the content that's most important to you. By creating lists for specific topics, interests, or communities, you can easily find and engage with relevant content, and avoid getting overwhelmed by a cluttered feed.\n\nRemember, curating your Twitter experience is an ongoing process. As your interests and goals evolve, your Twitter feed should too. Regularly review your follows, and don't be afraid to unfollow or mute accounts that no longer align with your values or goals.\n\nNow that you have a plan in place, I'd like to challenge you to take it a step further. What if you were to use Twitter to actively pursue your thesis project goals? How could you leverage Twitter to connect with experts, find resources, or share your progress?\n\nThink about it, and let me know if you have any ideas or questions.",
