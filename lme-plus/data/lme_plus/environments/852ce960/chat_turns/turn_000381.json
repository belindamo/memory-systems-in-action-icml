For instance, his film \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" was criticized by some for its sympathetic portrayal of the Tahitian natives who rebelled against their British oppressors. Similarly, his film \"The Divine Lady\" was criticized for its portrayal of a working-class man who aspired to marry a wealthy woman.\n\nAdditionally, some of Lloyd's films were criticized for their portrayal of race. For instance, his film \"The Blackbird\" (1926) has been criticized for its stereotypical portrayal of African Americans. In the film, a white man disguises himself as a black man and poses as a janitor to infiltrate a criminal gang run by African Americans. The film was criticized for its racist caricatures and negative portrayals of African Americans.\n\nDespite these controversies, Lloyd's films were generally well-received by audiences and critics, and he is remembered as one of the most influential directors of his time.",
