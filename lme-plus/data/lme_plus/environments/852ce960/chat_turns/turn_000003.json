  "content": "As an AI model, I don't have the exact time frame of how long it takes to fact-check a news story at the Associated Press or anywhere else. However, the time it takes to fact-check a news story can depend on various factors like the complexity of the story, the number of sources involved, the availability of information, and the size and experience of the newsroom. Fact-checking a story can be done quickly, but at times it may require more time depending on the nature of the story. It is crucial to spend ample time ensuring that every detail and information presented in a story is accurate and from reliable sources, so it can take as long as necessary to do the fact-checking properly. Ultimately, the priority remains on delivering authentic and trustworthy news to the public.",
