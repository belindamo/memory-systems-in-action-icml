Here are some ideas to help you tame the chaos and create a more organized and peaceful living space:\n\n1. **Sort and Purge**: Start by removing everything from your coffee table and sorting items into categories (e.g., books, remotes, decorations, papers to file).

Label each basket to maintain organization.\n4. **Create a Charging Station**: Designate a specific area for charging your devices, such as a charging pad or a small tray with built-in USB ports.\n5. **Tiered Organization**: Use a tiered serving tray or a multi-level storage unit to create separate zones for different types of items, like books, decorations, or snacks.\n6. **Labelled Boxes**: Use decorative boxes or bins with labels to store items like batteries, cables, or craft supplies.
