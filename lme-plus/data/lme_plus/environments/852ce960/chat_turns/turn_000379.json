The film depicted the crew as sympathetic figures who were mistreated and oppressed by their British superiors. By highlighting the crew's struggles, the film serves as a commentary on issues of colonialism and the exploitation of native populations.\n\n2. In \"The Divine Lady\" (1929), Lloyd explored the class conflict between a working-class man and a wealthy woman in 18th century England. The film depicted the struggles of the working-class man, who was seen as a sympathetic figure struggling to gain social acceptance in a world dominated by the upper class.\n\n3. In \"The Last Command\" (1928), Lloyd portrayed the experiences of immigrants in the United States by exploring the story of a Russian general exiled to Hollywood after the Russian Revolution.
