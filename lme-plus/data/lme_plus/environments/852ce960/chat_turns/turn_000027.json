  "content": "Congratulations on your pre-approval!\n\nBased on your pre-approval amount of $350,000 and the purchase price of $325,000, I'll provide you with a more detailed estimate of your closing costs.\n\nAssuming you're getting a conventional loan from Wells Fargo, here's a breakdown of the estimated closing costs:\n\n1. **Title Insurance and Escrow Fees**:\n\t* Title insurance: 0.5% to 1.0% of the purchase price = $1,625 to $3,250\n\t* Escrow fees: $500 to $2,000 = $1,250 (avg.)\n\tTotal: $2,875 to $5,250\n2. **Loan Origination Fees**:\n\t* Origination fee: 0.5% to 1.0% of the loan amount = $1,750 to $3,500\n\t* Underwriting fee: $300 to $900 = $600 (avg.)\n\t* Appraisal fee: $300 to $1,000 = $650 (avg.)\n\tTotal: $2,700 to $5,050\n3. **Appraisal Fee** (already included in loan origination fees above)\n4. **Credit Report Fee**:\n\t* $15 to $30 = $22.50 (avg.)\n5. **Flood Determination Fee**:\n\t* $15 to $50 = $32.50 (avg.)\n6. **Inspection Fees** (optional):\n\t* Home inspection: $300 to $1,000 = $650 (avg.)\n\t* Pest inspection: $50 to $150 = $100 (avg.)\n\t* Septic inspection: $100 to $300 = $200 (avg.)\n\tTotal: $950 to $1,350\n7. **Attorney Fees** (optional):\n\t* $500 to $2,000 = $1,250 (avg.)\n8. **Recording Fees**:\n\t* $50 to $200 = $125 (avg.)\n9. **Transfer Taxes** (varies by state and locality):\n\t* 0.1% to 2.0% of the purchase price = $325 to $6,500 (avg. 0.5% = $1,625)\n10. **Other Fees**:\n\t* Courier fees: $20 to $100 = $60 (avg.)\n\t* Notary fees: $20 to $100 = $60 (avg.)\n\nTotal Estimated Closing Costs: $11,332 to $20,322\n\nAs a rough estimate, you can expect to pay around 3.5% to 6.2% of the purchase price in closing costs. Based on your purchase price of $325,000, that would be:\n\n* 3.5%: $11,375\n* 6.2%: $20,150\n\nKeep in mind that these are estimated ranges, and your actual closing costs may vary depending on your location, loan terms, and other factors. It's always a good idea to review your loan estimate and closing disclosure documents carefully to get a more accurate estimate of your closing costs.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your budget for your new home purchase!",
