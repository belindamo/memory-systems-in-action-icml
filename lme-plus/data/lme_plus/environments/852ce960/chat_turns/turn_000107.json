  "content": "A tray with a diameter of 12-15 inches can be a great size for a coffee table, depending on the overall scale and layout of your table and the items you plan to display. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Pros of a 12-15 inch tray:**\n\n* This size tray can hold a decent amount of items, such as a few books, a vase, and some decorative objects, without overwhelming the coffee table.\n* It's large enough to create a visually appealing vignette, but small enough to leave some negative space around it.\n* This size tray can be easily moved or rearranged on the coffee table to accommodate different gatherings or activities.\n\n**Cons of a 12-15 inch tray:**\n\n* If your coffee table is particularly small, a tray of this size might overwhelm the surface or leave little room for other items.\n* If you plan to display larger items, such as a large vase or a decorative centerpiece, a smaller tray might not provide enough space.\n* A larger tray might be more suitable if you want to create a bold, statement piece on your coffee table.\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n\n* **Smaller tray (8-10 inches):** A smaller tray can be ideal for a compact coffee table or if you want to create a more intimate, cozy atmosphere. It's also a great option if you only need to corral a few small items.\n* **Larger tray (18-20 inches):** A larger tray can make a bigger statement on your coffee table and provide more space for displaying larger items or creating a dramatic vignette.\n\nUltimately, the ideal tray size depends on your personal style, the scale of your coffee table, and the items you plan to display. If you're still unsure, consider the following:\n\n* Measure your coffee table and the items you want to display to get a sense of the ideal tray size.\n* Look at pictures of coffee tables with trays online or in decorating magazines to get inspiration and gauge the proportion of the tray to the table.\n* Consider starting with a smaller tray and adding more items or upgrading to a larger tray as needed.\n\nI hope this helps you make a decision!",
