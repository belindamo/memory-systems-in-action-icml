  "content": "Removing social media apps from your home screen and scheduling social media checks are excellent first steps.\n\nDeleting the Facebook and Instagram apps from your phone can be a great idea, especially if you find yourself mindlessly scrolling through them out of habit. By removing the apps, you'll make it more difficult for yourself to access them impulsively, which can help you break the habit.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Reduced temptation: By removing the apps, you'll reduce the likelihood of mindless scrolling and impulse checking.\n* Increased productivity: You'll be less likely to get sucked into social media during your work sessions, helping you stay focused on your thesis project.\n* Improved mental health: Reducing social media usage can lead to improved mental health, reduced anxiety, and increased self-esteem.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Inconvenience: You might need to access social media for legitimate reasons, like staying updated on industry news or communicating with friends and family.\n* Limited access: You might need to use a computer or another device to access social media, which could be inconvenient if you're used to checking your phone.\n\nIf you decide to delete the apps, you can always reinstall them later if you need to. It's not a permanent decision, and it might be a good experiment to see how it affects your productivity and mental health.\n\nHere's a compromise: You could delete the apps from your phone, but keep them on your tablet or computer. This way, you can still access social media when you need to, but it won't be as easily accessible on your phone.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you ready to take the leap and delete the apps, or do you want to try a different approach?",
