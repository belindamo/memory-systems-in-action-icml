Since you mentioned you're interested in tracking your energy usage, I was wondering if you've considered exploring other smart home devices that can help you monitor and control your energy consumption. For example, smart thermostats like Nest or Ecobee can learn your schedule and preferences to optimize your heating and cooling usage. Smart lighting systems like Philips Hue or LIFX can help you reduce energy waste by automatically turning off lights when not in use. Would you like some recommendations or more information on these types of devices?",
