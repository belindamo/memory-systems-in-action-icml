Here are some ideas for maps and events for each path:\n\nPath 1:\n\n* Map: A high-security military base where the player can find powerful weapons and gear, but must navigate through a maze of corridors and avoid traps set by the remaining military personnel guarding the facility.\n* Event: A massive horde of zombies attacks the player's safehouse, forcing them to quickly gather their supplies and escape before they are overwhelmed.\n\nPath 2:\n\n* Map: A major city in the midst of a full-scale zombie outbreak, with the player needing to navigate through streets teeming with hordes of undead while searching for the military base.\n* Event: The player discovers a group of survivors being held captive by a deranged cult that believes the zombie outbreak is a divine punishment, and must decide whether to risk rescuing them or leave them behind.\n\nPath 3:\n\n* Map: A remote research facility in the Arctic where the player discovers a group of scientists attempting to develop a cure for the zombie virus.\n* Event: The player stumbles upon a group of bandits who have taken over a fortified town and are terrorizing the local population, and must decide whether to confront them head-on or try to sneak in and sabotage their operations.\n\nI hope these ideas help!",
