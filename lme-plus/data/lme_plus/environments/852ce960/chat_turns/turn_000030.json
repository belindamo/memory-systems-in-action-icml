  "content": "I think I can try to negotiate with the seller to cover some of the closing costs, given the minor issues with the roof and plumbing found in the inspection report. Since we already agreed on a credit of $2,000 towards the closing costs, I was thinking of asking the seller to cover an additional 1% of the purchase price, which would be $3,250. Would that be a reasonable request, considering the inspection report findings and the local market conditions?",
