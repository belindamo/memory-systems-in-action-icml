These themes often appeared in his films, particularly in how they portrayed the struggles of immigrants and minorities. For example, in films like \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and \"The Divine Lady,\" Lloyd explored issues of social hierarchy and class conflict. In his films, Lloyd often portrayed immigrants as sympathetic figures who had to work hard to fit into American society. \n\nFurthermore, Lloyd's upbringing in Scotland may have influenced his portrayal of nationality in his films. He often dealt with themes of nationalism, particularly in films like \"The Patriot\" and \"The Last Command.\" In these films, he explored the tensions that arise when individuals are forced to choose between loyalty to their country and loyalty to their own personal beliefs.\n\nOverall, Lloyd's identity as an immigrant to the United States influenced his work by instilling him with a keen awareness of the issues facing minorities and immigrants in American society. His films often explored these themes in nuanced and thoughtful ways, offering audiences a glimpse into the complex struggles of those trying to build a new life in a new country.",
