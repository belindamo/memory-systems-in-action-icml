Avoid storing it near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight.\n3. **Layering**: Layer your trail mix ingredients in the container to prevent them from getting stale or crushed. Start with the nuts, followed by the seeds, dried fruits, and chocolate chips (if using).\n4. **Portion Control**: Divide your trail mix into smaller portions (about 1/4 cup or 1 ounce) and store them in individual bags or containers. This will help maintain freshness and prevent staleness.\n5. **Freezer Storage**: If you don't plan to consume your trail mix within a few weeks, consider storing it in the freezer. This will help preserve the freshness and flavor of the ingredients.

Simply spread them on a baking sheet and roast in a 350\u00b0F oven for 10-15 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned.\n3. **Dry Your Fruits**: If you're using dried fruits, make sure they're completely dry and not sticky.
