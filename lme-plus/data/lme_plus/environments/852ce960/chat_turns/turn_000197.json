  "content": "Yes, mycorrhizal fungi are found in many other types of ecosystems besides forests! They are present in grasslands, wetlands, deserts, and even in agricultural fields. In fact, most plant species form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, and these fungi are present in almost all soils. \n\nThere are two main types of mycorrhizal fungi: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize the roots of over 80% of all plant species, including grasses, legumes, and most crop plants. Ectomycorrhizal fungi, on the other hand, are mainly associated with woody plants and form symbiotic associations with trees and shrubs such as oaks, pines, birches, and willows. \n\nSo, mycorrhizal fungi are fundamental components of soil ecosystems and play a crucial role in the growth and survival of many plants in diverse ecosystems.",
