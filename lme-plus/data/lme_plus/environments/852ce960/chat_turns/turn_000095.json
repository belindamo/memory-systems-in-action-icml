  "content": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union (EU) regulation on data protection and privacy in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). It is designed to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business. The GDPR applies to any enterprise that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA, regardless of its location or the data subjects' citizenship or residence. It came into force on May 25, 2018, and provides flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states. The GDPR has influenced data protection laws in other countries, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It applies to data controllers, processors, and data subjects located in the EU and, under certain circumstances, to organizations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. It sets out specific rights for individuals with regards to their personal data, including the right to access, rectify, erase, object to processing, and data portability. It also imposes obligations on data controllers and processors, including the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data and to appoint a data protection officer in certain cases. The GDPR provides for penalties for non-compliance, including fines of up to 4% of a company's global annual revenue or \u20ac20 million (whichever is greater).",
