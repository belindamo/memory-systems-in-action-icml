  "content": "Thank you for clarifying.\n\nI'm happy to help you with that, but I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to directly contact the storage unit company or access their systems. However, I can guide you through the process of confirming the moving details with them.\n\nHere's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Contact the storage unit company**: Reach out to the storage unit company's customer service department via phone or email to confirm the moving details. Have your rental agreement or contract handy to reference your account information.\n2. **Confirm the moving date**: Verify the moving date and time with the company to ensure they're aware of when you need to access your stored belongings.\n3. **Truck size and equipment**: Confirm the size of the truck or container they'll provide, as well as any additional equipment you may need, such as dollies or blankets.\n4. **Labor assistance**: If you've arranged for labor assistance, confirm the number of movers and their estimated arrival time.\n5. **Review and confirm**: Double-check all the details with the company to ensure everything is accurate and to your liking.\n\nSome example questions to ask the storage unit company:\n\n* What is the moving date and time?\n* What size truck or container will be provided?\n* Will labor assistance be available, and if so, how many movers will be sent?\n* Are there any additional fees or charges I need to be aware of?\n* What is the process for accessing my stored belongings on the moving day?\n\nBy confirming these details, you'll be well-prepared for the moving day and can ensure a smooth transition to your new home.\n\nRemember to also take photos of your stored belongings before they're loaded onto the truck, and consider creating an inventory list to keep track of your items during the move.",
