Be sure to review your loan estimate and closing disclosure documents carefully to get a more accurate picture of your closing costs.\n\nRemember to also factor in any other expenses associated with buying a home, such as:\n\n* Down payment\n* Prepaids (insurance, taxes, interest)\n* Appraisal fee (if not included in closing costs)\n* Inspection fees (if not included in closing costs)\n* Any other expenses specific to your situation\n\nI hope this helps you plan your finances for the closing process!",
