  "content": "Yes, different types of plants tend to form associations with different types of mycorrhizal fungi. There are two major types of mycorrhizal fungi that plants form associations with: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and ectomycorrhizal fungi.\n\nArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi form associations with a wide range of plant species including crop plants, grasses, and many other types of plants. These fungi are found in the roots of many agricultural crops such as corn, wheat, and soybeans, and are also important for the growth and survival of many wild plant species.\n\nEctomycorrhizal fungi, on the other hand, form more specific associations with trees and shrubs, particularly with conifers like pines, firs, and spruces. These fungi are also found in hardwoods like oaks, birches, and beeches.\n\nThere are also differences in the way that different plant species interact with these fungi. For example, some plants can only utilize nutrients provided by mycorrhizal fungi, while others can access nutrients in the soil directly, and some can do both.\n\nOverall, mycorrhizal fungi and their associations with plants are incredibly diverse, and the specific associations that form can vary between different environments and ecosystems.",
