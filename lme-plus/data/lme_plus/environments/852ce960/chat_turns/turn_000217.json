  "content": "Yosemite is a fantastic place to explore on two wheels! While there are no bike trails within Yosemite National Park that allow personal bicycles, there are some great options for bike rentals and scenic bike paths in the surrounding areas. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Bike Rentals:**\n\n1. **Yosemite Valley Lodge Bike Rentals**: Rent bikes right in Yosemite Valley at the Yosemite Valley Lodge. They offer a variety of bikes, including hybrid, mountain, and children's bikes.\n2. **Yosemite Bike Rentals**: Located in the town of Groveland, just outside the park's west entrance, this shop offers a wide range of bikes, including electric bikes.\n3. **Half Dome Village Bike Rentals**: Rent bikes at Half Dome Village (formerly Curry Village) in Yosemite Valley, with options for hybrid, mountain, and children's bikes.\n\n**Bike Trails and Paths:**\n\n1. **Valley Floor Loop Trail**: A 13-mile paved path that takes you on a scenic tour of Yosemite Valley, with stunning views of El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall, and Half Dome. This trail is suitable for hybrid or mountain bikes.\n2. **Mirror Lake Trail**: A 4-mile paved path that takes you to Mirror Lake, with scenic views of surrounding cliffs and meadows.
