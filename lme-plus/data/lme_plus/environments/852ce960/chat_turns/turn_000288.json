Here are some tips to help you avoid getting sucked into social media:\n\n1. **Remove social media apps from your phone's home screen**: Move them to a folder or a secondary screen to reduce the temptation to mindlessly scroll.\n2. **Use website blockers or app blockers**: Tools like Freedom, SelfControl, or StayFocusd can block social media sites or apps during certain times of the day or for a set period.\n3. **Schedule social media checks**: Allow yourself to check social media only during specific times of the day, like during your scheduled breaks or after completing a task.\n4. **Use social media tracking tools**: Apps like RescueTime or Moment can track your social media usage, providing insights into how much time you're spending on each platform.\n5. **Replace social media with a more productive habit**: When you feel the urge to check social media, replace it with a more productive habit, like reading an article, taking a short walk, or doing a quick exercise routine.\n6. **Unfollow or mute distracting accounts**: Remove or limit your exposure to accounts that tend to distract you the most or make you feel bad about yourself.\n7. **Set a \"no social media\" rule during certain times**: Designate specific times of the day or week as \"social media-free,\" like during your morning routine or on Sundays.\n8. **Use social media with a purpose**: When you do check social media, have a specific goal in mind, like catching up with friends, staying updated on industry news, or seeking inspiration.\n9. **Create a social media-free zone**: Designate a specific area, like your workspace or bedroom, as a social media-free zone to help you stay focused.\n10. **Reward yourself for staying on track**: Set small rewards for yourself when you stay away from social media for a certain amount of time or complete a task without getting distracted.\n\nRemember, it takes time and practice to develop new habits, so be patient and kind to yourself. Start with small changes and gradually work your way up to more significant ones.\n\nHow do you think you'll implement these tips?",
