Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Apple Cider Braised Short Ribs with Mashed Sweet Potatoes**\n\n** Servings: 4-6 people**\n\n**Short Ribs:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 4 pounds beef short ribs\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 onion, diced\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 cup apple cider\n* 1 cup beef broth\n* 1 tablespoon tomato paste\n* 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n* 2 bay leaves (optional)\n\n**Mashed Sweet Potatoes:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 3-4 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1/2 cup heavy cream or half-and-half\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C).**\n2. **Season the short ribs:** Rub the short ribs with salt, pepper, and thyme.\n3. **Sear the short ribs:** Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the short ribs until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the ribs and set them aside.\n4. **Soften the onions:** Reduce the heat to medium and cook the diced onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.\n5. **Add the braising liquid:** Add the apple cider, beef broth, tomato paste, and bay leaves (if using) to the pot. Stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.\n6. **Return the short ribs:** Add the browned short ribs back to the pot, making sure they're mostly submerged in the braising liquid. Cover the pot with a lid.\n7. **Braise the short ribs:** Transfer the pot to the preheated oven and braise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falls off the bone.\n8. **Mash the sweet potatoes:** Boil the cubed sweet potatoes in salted water until tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the sweet potatoes and mash with butter, heavy cream or half-and-half, salt, and pepper.\n9. **Serve:** Serve the short ribs with the rich, flavorful braising liquid spooned over the top. Pair with mashed sweet potatoes and a side of roasted Brussels sprouts or saut\u00e9ed greens, if desired.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a slow cooker: If you prefer, you can cook the short ribs in a slow cooker for 8-10 hours on low or 4-6 hours on high.\n* Add some spice: Consider adding a cinnamon stick, a few cloves, or a pinch of nutmeg to the braising liquid for extra depth of flavor.\n* Make ahead: You can prepare the short ribs and braising liquid a day in advance, then refrigerate or freeze until ready to braise.\n\nEnjoy your delicious apple cider braised short ribs with your parents!",
