Anish Kapoor - Kapoor is a British-Indian sculptor who has created large-scale, abstract sculptures that often incorporate reflective surfaces and bright colors. He has used digital technologies to design and fabricate his sculptures, including computer-aided design (CAD) software and 3D printing.\n\n2. Daniel Arsham - Arsham is an American artist who creates sculptures that blur the line between art and architecture. He often uses digital technologies to create his works, including 3D scanning, printing, and rendering, as well as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\n3. Urs Fischer - Fischer is a Swiss artist who creates sculptures that are often humorous and subversive. He has used digital technologies to create sculptures that incorporate computer-generated imagery (CGI), as well as 3D printing and CNC (computer numerical control) milling.\n\n4. Neri Oxman - Oxman is an Israeli-American designer who works at the intersection of art, science, and technology. She has created sculptures that are inspired by natural forms and processes, using digital design tools and 3D printing to create intricate and organic shapes.\n\n5. Golan Levin - Levin is an American artist and educator who creates interactive sculptures and installations that respond to human movement and behavior. He often uses digital technologies, such as computer vision and machine learning, to create his works.\n\nThese are just a few examples of contemporary sculptors who have embraced technology in their work, but there are many more out there who are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in sculpture using the latest digital tools and techniques.",
