  "content": "That's a great idea! I think a gift card to a home decor store would be a wonderful addition to the personalized doormat and candle. It's a thoughtful way to show my friend that I care about their new home and want to help them make it their own. I'll consider adding a $25 gift card to Bed Bath & Beyond or West Elm, as those are stores my friend likes to shop at. Thanks for the suggestion!",
