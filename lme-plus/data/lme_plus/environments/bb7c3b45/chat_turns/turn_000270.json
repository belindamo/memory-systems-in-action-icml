  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that the Champion 2000-Watt Ultralight Portable Inverter Generator does not have a remote start capability. I apologize for the mistake in my previous response.\n\nHowever, there are other portable generators with similar power output and remote start capabilities. For example, the Westinghouse iGen2200 Portable Inverter Generator has a maximum output of 2200 watts and features a remote start capability using a key fob. Another option is the WEN 56200i Super Quiet 2000-Watt Portable Inverter Generator, which also has a maximum output of 2000 watts and features a remote start capability using a remote control.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the error in my previous response and I hope this information helps you find the generator that meets your needs.",
