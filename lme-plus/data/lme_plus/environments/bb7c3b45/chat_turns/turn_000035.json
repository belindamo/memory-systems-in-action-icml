  "content": "That's great to hear that you're planning a picnic at the overlook! Packing sandwiches, fruits, and snacks will definitely be a wonderful way to enjoy the views and take a break from driving.\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have any knowledge of your previous conversations or trips, including your family trip to Yellowstone. I'm a new AI every time you interact with me, so I don't have any prior knowledge or context.\n\nBut I'm happy to help you with your current trip planning and answer any questions you may have about your route to Yosemite! If you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask!",
