  "content": "What a great idea! A small wall hanging can be a wonderful addition to the gift, and a 12x12 inch design sounds like a perfect size.\n\nA 12x12 inch wall hanging is a great size for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Proportion**: It's a nice, compact size that will complement the quilt without overpowering it.\n2. **Design scope**: A 12x12 inch design gives you enough room to create a simple, yet visually appealing design that can feature some of the same fabrics and motifs as the quilt.\n3. **Hanging options**: A 12x12 inch wall hanging can be easily hung on a small wall or even on the back of a door, making it a versatile addition to any room.\n\nFor a wall hanging of this size, you'll need to consider the following fabric requirements:\n\n* **Top and Backing**: You'll need two pieces of fabric, each 12.5x12.5 inches (add 1/2 inch seam allowance around the edges). This will give you a total fabric requirement of:\n\t+ 1/4 yard of 42-inch wide fabric (you can use scraps from the quilt backing or additional fabric that matches)\n* **Batting**: You'll need a small piece of batting, approximately 12x12 inches. You can use a leftover piece from the quilt or purchase a small amount of batting specifically for the wall hanging.\n* **Binding**: If you choose to add a binding to the wall hanging, you'll need a small amount of fabric, approximately 1/8 yard of 42-inch wide fabric.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and your actual fabric requirements may vary depending on the design complexity and any additional features you want to include.\n\nOverall, a 12x12 inch wall hanging is a great size for a matching piece, and it will add a lovely touch to the gift. I think you're making an excellent decision!",
