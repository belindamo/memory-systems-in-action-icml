  "content": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. You are correct that the Honda Wireless Remote Start Kit is only compatible with the Honda EU3000is generator, not the EU2200i. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\n\nIf you are interested in a Honda generator with remote start capabilities, you may want to consider the Honda EU3000is. It has a maximum output of 3000 watts and features a TT-30R 30 amp RV outlet. The Honda Wireless Remote Start Kit is compatible with this generator, and can be purchased separately as an accessory.\n\nAlternatively, as I mentioned earlier, the Westinghouse iGen4500 and Generac GP2200i can also be paired with remote start kits as accessories.",
