Preventing Whiskers from chewing on your shoes requires a combination of deterrents, redirection, and environmental changes. Here are some tips to help you save your shoes and sanity:\n\n1. **Remove temptation**: Store your shoes in a closet or on a high shelf where Whiskers can't access them. Out of sight, out of mind!\n2. **Provide alternative chew toys**: Cats love to chew, so offer Whiskers plenty of appropriate chew toys, such as:\n\t* Catnip-infused toys or mice\n\t* Rawhide chews or bully sticks\n\t* Interactive toys with strings or feathers\n\t* Cardboard boxes or paper bags to shred\n3. **Make shoes unappealing**: Try these deterrents to make your shoes less appealing to Whiskers:\n\t* Spray shoes with a citrus-based spray or a commercial deterrent containing capsaicin (the active ingredient in chili peppers)\n\t* Place double-sided tape or aluminum foil on the shoes to create an unpleasant texture\n\t* Try using a bitter-tasting spray or powder on the laces\n4. **Keep Whiskers occupied**: Engage your cat in playtime activities, like laser pointer chases or feather teasers, to redirect her energy away from your shoes.\n5. **Supervise and intervene**: When you catch Whiskers attempting to chew on your shoes, calmly say \"no\" and redirect her to an appropriate toy. Consistency is key!\n6. **Consider a cat-proofing product**: There are various cat-deterrent products available, such as:\n\t* Shoe protectors with spikes or prickly surfaces\n\t* Lace protectors that make it difficult for cats to access the laces\n\t* Shoe trees or shoe stretchers with a bitter-tasting coating\n7. **Reward good behavior**: Positive reinforcement is essential. Praise and reward Whiskers when she ignores your shoes or chooses an appropriate toy.\n8. **Distract and redirect**: If you see Whiskers eyeing your shoes, try distracting her with a toy or treat to redirect her attention.\n9. **Be patient**: Changing behavior takes time, so don't get discouraged if Whiskers doesn't adjust immediately. Consistency and patience are key.\n10. **Consider a cat-proofing expert**: If Whiskers is persistent and you're at your wit's end, consult with a professional animal behaviorist or a certified cat behaviorist for personalized guidance.\n\nRemember, every cat is different, so it may take some trial and error to find the right combination of strategies that work best for Whiskers. Good luck, and I hope you're able to save your shoes!",
