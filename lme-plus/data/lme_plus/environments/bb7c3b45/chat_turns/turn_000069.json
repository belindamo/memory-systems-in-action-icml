  "content": "Scientists looked at how special cells called Adipose-derived stromal cells (AdSCs) affect prostate cancer cells. They found that AdSCs can stop the cancer cells from growing and can even make them die. They also tried using AdSCs in mice with prostate cancer and found that it slowed down the growth of the cancer. This means that AdSCs might be a good way to help people who have prostate cancer.",
