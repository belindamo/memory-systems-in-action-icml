  "content": "This study examines the effects of Adipose-derived stromal cells (AdSCs) on the proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. The results suggest that AdSCs have an inhibitory effect on the growth of both androgen-responsive and androgen-nonresponsive PCa cells and can cause them to die via the caspase3/7 signaling pathway. This study also shows that local transplantation of AdSCs in mice with PCa resulted in delayed tumor growth. These findings imply that AdSCs may be a promising tool in the treatment of prostate cancer.",
