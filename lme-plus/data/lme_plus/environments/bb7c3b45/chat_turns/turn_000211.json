Here are a few ideas:\n\n**Summer Events:**\n\n1. **Summer Festivals:** Many summer festivals, such as music festivals or cultural celebrations, rely on volunteers to help with event setup, ticket sales, and more. This could be a fun way to get involved in your community and meet new people.\n2. **Beach or Park Cleanups:** As the weather warms up, organizations often host beach or park cleanups to keep our outdoor spaces beautiful. This could be a great opportunity to get some exercise and make a tangible impact.\n3. **Summer Camps or Youth Programs:** Consider volunteering at a summer camp or youth program that focuses on education, sports, or the arts. You could help lead activities, mentor young people, or assist with administrative tasks.\n\n**Causes You've Supported Before:**\n\n1. **Children's Education:** Look for opportunities to volunteer at a local school, library, or educational organization. You could help with summer reading programs, tutoring, or even assist with administrative tasks.\n2. **Cancer Research:** Consider volunteering at a cancer research organization, hospital, or support group. You could help with fundraising events, administrative tasks, or even provide support to patients and families.\n3. **Animal Welfare:** If you enjoyed organizing the charity yoga event for the animal shelter, you might want to explore more opportunities to volunteer at the shelter itself. You could help with animal care, fundraising, or educational programs.\n\n**New Causes to Consider:**\n\n1. **Environmental Organizations:** As you've participated in a bike-a-thon and beach cleanup, you might be interested in volunteering with an environmental organization. This could involve helping with conservation efforts, educational programs, or advocacy campaigns.\n2. **Food Banks or Pantries:** Given your participation in the Walk for Hunger, you might want to explore volunteering at a food bank or pantry. You could help sort donations, assist with food distribution, or support fundraising efforts.\n3. **Disaster Relief:** Consider volunteering with an organization that provides disaster relief services. You could help with fundraising, administrative tasks, or even deploy to areas affected by natural disasters.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started. Remember to consider your interests, skills, and availability when selecting volunteer opportunities. You can search for opportunities on websites like VolunteerMatch, Idealist, or even social media platforms like Facebook.\n\nWhat do you think?
