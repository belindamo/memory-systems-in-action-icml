Yes, the scenic route to Yosemite can be quite winding and narrow in some areas, especially on Highway 120 (Tioga Road) and Highway 140 (Merced River Canyon Road). Here are some tips to help you navigate these roads safely and comfortably with your trusty old SUV:\n\n**Before You Leave:**\n\n1. **Check your vehicle's condition:** Make sure your SUV is in good working condition, with proper tire pressure, sufficient oil, and functioning brakes. Consider getting a quick check-up before embarking on your trip.\n2. **Familiarize yourself with the route:** Study the route ahead of time, including the road conditions, elevation changes, and potential hazards. You can use online resources like Google Maps, road condition websites, or park resources to get an idea of what to expect.\n\n**While Driving:**\n\n1. **Drive slowly and cautiously:** Take your time, especially on winding roads. Reduce your speed to match the road conditions, and be prepared for sudden stops or changes in traffic.\n2. **Use low gear:** If you're driving a manual transmission vehicle, use low gear when descending steep grades to maintain control and reduce brake wear.\n3. **Avoid sudden movements:** Sudden turns, braking, or acceleration can cause loss of traction, especially on narrow roads. Make smooth, gradual movements instead.\n4. **Keep a safe distance:** Leave plenty of space between you and the vehicle in front of you, in case you need to stop suddenly.\n5. **Be aware of weather conditions:** Weather can change quickly in the mountains. Be prepared for rain, snow, or fog, and adjust your driving accordingly.\n6. **Watch for pedestrians and wildlife:** Be mindful of pedestrians, bicyclists, and wildlife, such as deer or bears, which may be present on or near the road.\n7. **Take breaks:** Take regular breaks to rest, stretch, and enjoy the scenery. This will help you stay alert and focused on the road.\n\n**Specific Tips for Tioga Road (Hwy 120):**\n\n1. **Be prepared for steep grades:** Tioga Road has some steep inclines, so be prepared for slower going and potential delays.\n2. **Watch for rockfall and debris:** The road is prone to rockfall and debris, especially after rainfall. Be cautious of falling rocks and debris on the road.\n3. **Use the pull-outs:** There are designated pull-outs and parking areas along the road. Use these to let faster traffic pass or to take in the views.\n\n**About Your Trusty Old SUV:**\n\nI'm happy to help, but I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have any knowledge of your previous conversations or trips, including the family trip to Yellowstone six weeks prior to your departure. However, I'm here to provide general advice and guidance to help you prepare for your trip to Yosemite!\n\nBy following these tips and being mindful of your vehicle's capabilities, you'll be well-prepared to tackle the scenic route to Yosemite and enjoy the stunning views along the way!",
