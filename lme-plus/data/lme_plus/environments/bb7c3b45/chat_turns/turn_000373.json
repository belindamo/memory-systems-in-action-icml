  "content": "I've tried a few pea protein powders and they seem to work well for me. I'm thinking of trying a rice protein powder next, so thanks for the recommendations! I've also been experimenting with different milks to find one that I like. I've tried almond milk and oat milk, but I'm not a huge fan of the taste. Do you have any recommendations for other non-dairy milks that are good for smoothies?",
