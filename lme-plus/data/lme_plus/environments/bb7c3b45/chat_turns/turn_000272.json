  "content": "Yes, unfortunately, it seems that there are currently no portable generators with a TT-30R 30 amp RV outlet, a push-button start, and a weight of around 50 pounds or less. While there are several portable generators that offer one or two of these features, a combination of all three may not be currently available in the market.\n\nThe closest option might be the Champion 3100-Watt RV Ready Portable Inverter Generator that I mentioned earlier, which features a push-button start and a TT-30R 30 amp RV outlet, but weighs around 96 pounds. It is designed to be compact and portable with wheels and a folding handle for easy transportation, but it is still heavier than the weight range you mentioned.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I hope this information helps you in your search for a portable generator that meets your needs.",
