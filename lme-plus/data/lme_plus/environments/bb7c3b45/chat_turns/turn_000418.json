Inspiration and Concept: The first step is to come up with an idea or concept for the song. This could be based on personal experiences or emotions, or it could be a more abstract idea. The inspiration for \"This Side\" could be a feeling of loneliness or longing for connection.\n\n2. Music Composition: Once the concept is established, the next step is to create the music. This includes developing the melody, chord progressions, and instrumentation. The producer may start with a simple piano or guitar chord progression and build from there. The beat and tempo are also important considerations, as they can greatly influence the mood of the song.\n\n3. Songwriting: After the music is composed, it's time to write the lyrics. The songwriter will typically draw on the inspiration or concept for the song and create verses, a chorus, and a bridge that fit with the melody and instrumentation. The lyrics will often be refined over several drafts to ensure they flow well and convey the intended emotions.\n\n4. Recording: With the music and lyrics in place, the producer will record the instrumental tracks and vocal tracks. They may use live instruments or programming software to create the sounds they want. The vocal track will be recorded several times to create layers and harmonies.\n\n5. Mixing and Mastering: Once the recording is complete, the producer will mix the individual tracks to balance the volume and sound of each instrument and vocal. They may also apply various effects, such as reverb, echo, or distortion, to achieve the desired sound. Finally, the song is mastered to ensure it sounds good on various playback systems.\n\n6. Release and Promotion: After the final mix and master, the song is ready for release. The artist will typically upload the song to various digital distribution platforms, such as Spotify or Apple Music. They will also promote the song on social media and other channels to generate buzz and attract fans.",
