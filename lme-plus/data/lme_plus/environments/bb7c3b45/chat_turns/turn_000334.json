However, I have to clarify that I couldn't find any information on a poet named Maria Rodriguez with a collection called \"Wildflowers in the City\". It's possible that she's a local or emerging poet, or maybe the details are incorrect.\n\nBut don't worry, I'd be happy to recommend some poetry collections and poets that you might enjoy! Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **The BreakBeat Poets: New American Poetry in the Age of Hip-Hop**: This anthology features a diverse range of poets who are pushing the boundaries of contemporary poetry.\n2. **Warsan Shire**: A Somali-British poet, writer, and educator, Shire's poetry is known for its powerful exploration of identity, displacement, and feminism.\n3. **Ada Lim\u00f3n**: A Mexican-American poet, Lim\u00f3n's work explores themes of identity, family, and the American experience.\n4. ** Danez Smith**: A black, queer poet from Minnesota, Smith's work is known for its lyricism, humor, and exploration of identity, blackness, and queerness.\n5. **Nayyirah Waheed**: A poet and writer, Waheed's work is known for its concise, powerful exploration of identity, love, and feminism.\n6. **Rupi Kaur**: A Canadian poet and illustrator, Kaur's work is known for its accessible, Instagram-friendly style and exploration of identity, love, and trauma.\n7. **Morgan Parker**: An American poet and essayist, Parker's work explores themes of identity, pop culture, and blackness.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many more poets and collections to explore. You can also try searching online for poetry readings, open mic events, or workshops in your area to discover new poets and styles.\n\nRemember, poetry is a highly personal and subjective genre, so don't be afraid to explore and find what resonates with you!",
