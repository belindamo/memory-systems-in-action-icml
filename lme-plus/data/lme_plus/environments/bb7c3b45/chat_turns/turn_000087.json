  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions but I can outline some viewpoints.\n\nWhile technology has certainly opened up many new opportunities for sculptors, there are some potential downsides to this technological influence on contemporary sculpture. One of the biggest concerns is that technology can sometimes overshadow the concepts and ideas behind the artwork. There is a risk that art becomes too focused on the technical aspects and glosses over the artistic vision or meaning behind it.\n\nAnother potential downside is that technology can lead to a loss of human touch and craftsmanship in the creation of sculptures. As artwork becomes more digitized, there is a risk that it will become less tangible and more sterile, and that the process of creating sculptures will become more mechanical and less artistic.\n\nFurthermore, some may argue that the rise of digital technologies in contemporary sculpture could lead to a decline in traditional sculptural techniques and skills. As artists increasingly turn to digital tools and techniques, there is a risk that the traditional sculptural methods such as carving, casting, and welding are becoming less prevalent and valued.\n\nFinally, there is the concern that technology could create a further division between \u201chigh art\u201d and popular culture. As digital technology becomes more prominent in contemporary sculpture, art may become less accessible to those who do not have access to the technologies required to create or appreciate it.",
