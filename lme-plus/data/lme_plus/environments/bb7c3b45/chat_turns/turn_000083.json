One of the most significant changes brought about by technology is the use of new materials and techniques, such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and digital modeling. These technologies have allowed artists to create complex and intricate sculptures that were not possible before, and to experiment with new forms, textures, and colors.\n\nAnother significant impact of technology on contemporary sculpture is the way sculptures are exhibited and experienced. With the rise of digital technologies, artists can now share their works with a global audience through websites, online galleries, and social media platforms. This has greatly expanded the accessibility and visibility of contemporary sculptures for people from all over the world.\n\nThere have been several major turning points in the evolution of contemporary sculpture, some of which are:\n\n1. The rise of modernism: During the early 20th century, artists started experimenting with new forms of expression, challenging the traditional techniques and materials used in sculpture. This led to the emergence of modernism, which emphasized abstraction, minimalism, and reinterpretation of traditional forms.\n\n2. The exploration of materials: During the mid-20th century, artists began exploring non-traditional materials, such as plastics, fiberglass, and industrial materials, to create sculptures that were lightweight, durable, and easy to mass-produce. This led to the development of new techniques, such as casting, welding, and bending of metals and plastics.\n\n3. The impact of digital technologies: In the 21st century, digital technologies have revolutionized the way artists create, exhibit, and experience contemporary sculptures. With the advent of 3D printing and other digital modeling techniques, sculptors can now create complex shapes and structures that were once impossible to produce.\n\n4. The influence of globalization: With the growing interconnectedness of the world, contemporary sculptures reflect the diversity of cultures, ideas, and aesthetics from different parts of the world. This has led to the emergence of new forms, techniques, and themes that are both local and global in nature.",
