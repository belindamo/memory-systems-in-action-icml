It can help you prepare for how many people you'll be around and what kind of environment to expect.\n\n2. Wear comfortable clothing: Wear comfortable, breathable clothing and shoes, and dress for the weather. Avoid heavy, bulky or tight-fitting clothes that may hamper your movement in the crowds.\n\n3. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially if the festival takes place during hot weather conditions.\n\n4. Stay in control: It can be easy to get caught up in the excitement and get carried away by the crowd. Remain calm and focus on staying in control of your actions and movement.\n\n5. Plan your route: Check out maps and schedule ahead of time to have a good idea of which areas are most crowded or busiest. Plan your route accordingly, and avoid the most packed areas when possible.\n\n6. Avoid peak times: Consider attending the festival during daytime hours before the crowds become too intense, and fewer people may help you avoid the rush.\n\n7. Take breaks: Don't feel like you need to be \"on\" all the time. It's okay to take a break, find some shade and take a deep breath.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and enjoy the festival at your own pace. Take breaks when needed and enjoy the parts of the festival that make you feel comfortable. And if at any point, you do not feel comfortable, it is always okay to step away from the crowds for a bit.",
