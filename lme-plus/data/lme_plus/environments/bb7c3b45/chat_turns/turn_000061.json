  "content": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), specifically adipose-derived stromal cells (AdSCs), have the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types, making them a promising tool in regenerative medicine. However, the impact of AdSCs on cancer growth is not well understood. In this study, the effect of AdSCs on prostate cancer (PCa) cell proliferation was investigated. The results demonstrated that AdSCs inhibited the proliferation of both androgen-responsive and androgen-nonresponsive PCa cells, whereas normal human dermal fibroblasts promoted PCa cell proliferation. Additionally, AdSCs induced apoptosis in PCa cells, activating the caspase3/7 signaling pathway via the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Local transplantation of AdSCs also delayed the growth of PCa tumors in immunodeficient mice. Given the ease of isolating autologous AdSCs from adipose tissue, this study suggests that AdSC-based therapy could be a novel approach for PCa patients.",
