  "content": "Yes, there has been a growing trend towards embracing more tangible experiences in an increasingly digital world, and this could lead to an increased appreciation for traditional sculptural techniques. In fact, many people have started to seek out real-world experiences that engage their senses and offer a sense of connection to the physical world.\n\nSculpture created through traditional techniques has a unique ability to engage the senses, as it provides a tactile experience that connects the sculptor and the viewer to the materials and the process of creation. This experience satisfies a basic human need for connection and authenticity, which can be less readily fulfilled in a digital environment.\n\nFurthermore, as the world becomes more saturated with digital media, traditional sculptural techniques may become a way to escape the digital world and create a sense of solitude and focus on the present. Working with traditional techniques requires a certain level of concentration and commitment, which can lead to a meditative and calming experience, an antidote to the fast-paced, always-online realities of contemporary life.\n\nOverall, the trend towards valuing tangible, real-world experiences could lead to a renewed appreciation for traditional sculptural techniques, which offer a unique and rewarding way to engage with the creative process and the world around us.",
