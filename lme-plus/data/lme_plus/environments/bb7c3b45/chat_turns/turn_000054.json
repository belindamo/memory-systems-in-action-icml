  "content": "I think I'll go with the Voluspa 2-Wick Candle. I've heard great things about their candles, and I think the 2-wick design will provide a nice ambiance. By the way, speaking of ambiance, I recently got my mom some scented candles from Bath & Body Works, and she loves them. I got her three different fragrances - vanilla, lavender, and eucalyptus - and they cost around $20 each.",
