  "content": "What a thoughtful gesture! Including a gift card to a home decor store is a great idea! It's a wonderful way to show your friend that you care about their new home and want to help them make it their own.\n\nA gift card to a home decor store like Bed Bath & Beyond, West Elm, or Crate & Barrel would be an excellent addition to the personalized doormat and candle. It gives your friend the freedom to choose something they really need or want, which can be a more practical and meaningful gift in the long run.\n\nHere are a few benefits to consider:\n\n1. **Flexibility**: A gift card allows your friend to choose something that fits their personal style and decor, which can be more meaningful than a specific gift.\n2. **Practicality**: Your friend might have a specific item in mind that they need for their new home, and the gift card can help them purchase it.\n3. **Personalization**: By including a gift card, you're showing your friend that you care about their personal taste and want to help them make their new home special.\n\nWhen it comes to the amount, you could consider adding a $20-$50 gift card, depending on your budget and the type of store. This will give your friend a decent amount to work with and still allow them to choose something nice.\n\nRemember to include a thoughtful note or card with the gift, explaining why you chose the personalized doormat and candle, and how you hope the gift card will help them make their new home special. This will add a personal touch and make the gift even more meaningful.\n\nWhat do you think? Will you include a gift card with the personalized doormat and candle?",
