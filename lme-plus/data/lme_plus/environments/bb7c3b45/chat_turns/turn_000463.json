I'll check the prices on Amazon and Etsy to see which one has the best deal. Thanks for the suggestion!\n\nBy the way, I'm also planning to attend my colleague Michael's daughter Sophia's middle school graduation party next weekend. It's going to be a big backyard BBQ, and I'm looking forward to catching up with Michael and his family.",
