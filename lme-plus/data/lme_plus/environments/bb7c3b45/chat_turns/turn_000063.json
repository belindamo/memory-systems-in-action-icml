  "content": "Researchers studied the effects of stem cells, specifically adipose-derived stromal cells (AdSCs), on the growth of prostate cancer cells. They found that AdSCs inhibited the growth of both androgen-responsive and androgen-nonresponsive prostate cancer cells and caused them to die through a specific signaling pathway. The researchers also tested the use of AdSCs in mice with prostate cancer and found that they delayed tumor growth. These findings suggest that AdSCs may be a useful tool in treating prostate cancer.",
