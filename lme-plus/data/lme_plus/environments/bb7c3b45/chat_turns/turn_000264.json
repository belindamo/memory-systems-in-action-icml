  "content": "To calculate the watt hours for 200 amp hours at 24 volts, you can use the formula:\n\nWatt hours = Amp hours x Volts\n\nSo, for 200 amp hours at 24 volts, the calculation would be:\n\nWatt hours = 200 Ah x 24 V = 4,800 Wh\n\nTherefore, 200 amp hours at 24 volts is equivalent to 4,800 watt hours.",
