As a conversational AI, I don't have direct access to Blizzard's internal development processes, but I can provide some insights based on publicly available information and interviews with the developers.\n\nSojourn was announced at BlizzCon 2019, and her development was likely underway for some time before that. Blizzard's developers have mentioned that they wanted to create a hero who would fill a specific gap in the game's roster, and Sojourn's design was influenced by community feedback and playtesting.\n\nIn an interview with Game Informer, Geoff Goodman, the lead designer of Overwatch, mentioned that Sojourn was designed to be a \"high-skill, high-reward\" hero. The team wanted to create a hero who would appeal to players who enjoy playing aggressively and taking risks, but also require a high level of skill and strategy to play effectively.\n\nSojourn's railgun was a key part of her design, and the developers experimented with different versions of the weapon before settling on the final iteration. They wanted the railgun to feel powerful and rewarding, but also to have a high skill ceiling, so that players would need to practice and improve their aim and tracking skills to use it effectively.\n\nThe developers have also mentioned that Sojourn's abilities were designed to work together synergistically, with her swift strike and power slide abilities allowing her to quickly reposition and set up ambushes with her railgun. Her ultimate ability, Dragonstrike, was intended to be a game-changer in team fights, allowing Sojourn to deal massive damage and turn the tide of battle in her team's favor.\n\nOverall, Sojourn's development was likely a collaborative effort between Blizzard's designers, artists, and engineers, with a focus on creating a hero who would be fun to play, visually striking, and strategically interesting.",
