While YouTube doesn't provide a built-in feature to track time spent on a specific channel or type of content, there are a few workarounds to help you estimate the time you've spent watching ASMR videos or a particular channel:\n\n**Method 1: YouTube Analytics (Channel-level)**\n\nIf you're interested in tracking the time spent on a specific channel, you can use YouTube Analytics. Here's how:\n\n1. Sign in to your YouTube account.\n2. Go to the YouTube Studio ( youtube.com/studio ).\n3. Click on \"Analytics\" in the left-hand menu.\n4. Scroll down to the \"Reach\" tab.\n5. Click on \"Traffic source\" and then \"YouTube channels\" from the dropdown menu.\n6. Look for the channel you're interested in and click on it.\n7. You'll see a graph showing the watch time, views, and engagement metrics for that channel.\n\nThis method will give you an estimate of the total watch time for a specific channel, but it won't break it down by video type (e.g., ASMR).\n\n**Method 2: Third-Party Browser Extensions**\n\nBrowser extensions like Video Tracker (Chrome) or TubeBuddy (Chrome) can provide more detailed insights into your YouTube watch history, including time spent on specific channels or video types. These extensions can help you:\n\n1. Track time spent on a particular channel.\n2. Identify the most-watched videos on that channel.\n3. Categorize videos by type (e.g., ASMR, music, vlogs, etc.).\n\n**Method 3: YouTube Watch History**\n\nYou can also use YouTube's watch history to estimate the time spent on ASMR videos or a particular channel. Here's how:\n\n1. Follow the steps I mentioned earlier to access your YouTube watch history.\n2. Filter the results by date range, device, or type of content (e.g., ASMR).\n3. Look for the channel or video titles that interest you and calculate the total watch time.\n\nKeep in mind that this method requires manual calculation and might not be as accurate as using a third-party extension or YouTube Analytics.\n\n**Method 4: Screen Time Tracking Apps**\n\nSome screen time tracking apps, like Freedom, Moment, or Screen Time, can track your YouTube watch time across all your devices. These apps often provide more detailed insights into your screen time, including which apps and websites you use most. You can use these apps to track your overall YouTube watch time, but they might not provide channel-level or video-type-specific data.\n\nRemember that these methods might not provide an exact figure, but they can give you a good estimate of the time you've spent watching ASMR videos or a particular channel.",
