  "content": "The King Estate Pinot Noir will pair beautifully with the apple cider braised short ribs.\n\nFor dessert, I'd recommend something sweet and comforting to round out the meal. Here are a few ideas that would complement the flavors of the short ribs and Pinot Noir:\n\n1. **Apple Crisp**: A classic dessert that incorporates the same apple cider theme from the short ribs. The sweetness of the apples, oatmeal, and brown sugar will provide a nice contrast to the savory short ribs.\n2. **Pumpkin Spice Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e**: A seasonal dessert that incorporates the warm spices of fall. The creamy texture and caramelized sugar on top will add a luxurious touch to the meal.\n3. **Maple Pecan Pie Bars**: A twist on the classic pecan pie, these bars feature a maple syrup-infused filling and a crunchy pecan crust. The sweetness of the maple and the crunch of the pecans will provide a nice contrast to the tender short ribs.\n4. **Cranberry Oatmeal Cookies**: A sweet and tangy cookie that incorporates the flavors of fall. The cranberries will add a pop of color and flavor to the dessert course.\n5. **Vanilla Ice Cream with Caramel Sauce and Pecans**: A simple yet elegant dessert that will provide a nice cooling contrast to the rich short ribs. The caramel sauce and pecans will add a sweet and crunchy element to the dish.\n\nThese desserts will all pair nicely with the King Estate Pinot Noir, but if you want to try something a bit more adventurous, you could consider a **Tawny Port** or a **Moscato d'Asti** to pair with dessert. Both of these sweet wines will complement the flavors of the desserts and add a nice finish to the meal.\n\nWhich dessert option catches your eye, or do you have another dessert in mind?",
