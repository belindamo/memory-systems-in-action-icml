  "content": "With that information, I can help you calculate the fabric requirements for your backing.\n\nTo determine the backing fabric requirements, we'll need to add the extra trimming allowance to the quilt dimensions and then calculate the total fabric needed.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n1. Add the trimming allowance to the quilt dimensions:\n\t* Length: 60 inches + 4 inches + 4 inches = 68 inches\n\t* Width: 80 inches + 4 inches + 4 inches = 88 inches\n2. Calculate the total fabric needed:\n\t* Since you're using a single piece of fabric, you'll need a piece that's at least 68 inches x 88 inches.\n\t* To find the total yardage, divide the total inches by the fabric width (42 inches):\n\t\t+ 68 inches / 42 inches = 1.62 (round up to 2 yards for length)\n\t\t+ 88 inches / 42 inches = 2.1 (round up to 3 yards for width)\n3. Calculate the total yardage needed:\n\t* Since you need 2 yards for the length and 3 yards for the width, you'll need a total of:\n\t\t+ 2 yards x 3 yards = 6 yards of fabric for the backing\n\nSo, to be safe, you should purchase at least 6 yards of 42-inch wide fabric for the backing of your quilt. This will give you enough fabric to accommodate the trimming allowance and ensure a smooth, even backing.\n\nRemember to double-check your calculations and consider any additional fabric you might need for mistakes or adjustments during the quilting process. Happy quilting!",
