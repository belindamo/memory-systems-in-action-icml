  "content": "I do not have access to real-time news and current events. however, i can give you a general overview of past instances where accountability has been upheld in lok sabha.\n\nin recent years, there have been some instances where accountability has been upheld in lok sabha. for example, in 2018, a no-confidence motion was brought against the government by the opposition. during the debate, several lawmakers raised issues related to corruption and alleged misconduct by government officials. the government was able to win the vote, but the debate brought attention to these issues, and the opposition was able to hold the government accountable.\n\nsimilarly, in 2019, a parliamentary committee on the citizenship amendment bill held hearings and invited experts to provide their views on the proposed legislation. the committee's report, which highlighted several concerns about the bill, including its potential impact on religious minorities, was instrumental in shaping the final version of the bill.\n\nin both these instances, the parliamentary process played an important role in upholding accountability and ensuring that elected representatives were held responsible for their actions and decisions. however, there have been other instances where accountability has not been upheld, and concerns remain about the effectiveness of the system in ensuring transparency and accountability.",
