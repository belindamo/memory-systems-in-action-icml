Adding decorative stitching around the edges of the wall hanging can add a wonderful finishing touch and create a beautiful frame for your design.\n\nSimple running stitch or a decorative stitch on your sewing machine can be a great choice for several reasons:\n\n1. **Adds a pop of color**: You can use a contrasting thread color to create a pop of color around the edges, which will draw the viewer's attention to the wall hanging.\n2. **Creates a frame**: The stitching will create a subtle frame around the design, which will help to contain the visual elements and create a sense of cohesion.\n3. **Adds texture**: The stitching will add a tactile element to the wall hanging, inviting the viewer to touch and explore the texture.\n4. **Hides raw edges**: The stitching will also help to hide the raw edges of the fabric, creating a clean and finished look.\n\nWhen choosing a decorative stitch, consider the following:\n\n1. **Keep it simple**: A simple running stitch or a subtle decorative stitch will work well, as you want to avoid overpowering the design.\n2. **Choose a thread that complements**: Select a thread color that complements the fabrics and design elements in the wall hanging.\n3. **Consider the scale**: Make sure the stitch is proportional to the size of the wall hanging. A smaller stitch will work well for a smaller wall hanging, while a larger stitch might be more suitable for a larger piece.\n4. **Test it out**: Before committing to a particular stitch, test it out on a scrap piece of fabric to ensure it looks good and doesn't overpower the design.\n\nBy adding decorative stitching around the edges, you'll add a professional finish to your wall hanging and create a beautiful, cohesive piece that will complement the quilt nicely.",
