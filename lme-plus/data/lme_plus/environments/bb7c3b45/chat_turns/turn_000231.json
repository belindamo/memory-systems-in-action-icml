  "content": "Historical fantasy is a fantastic sub-genre, and I'd be happy to recommend some historical fantasy novels with diverse protagonists that you might enjoy.\n\nHere are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **The Gilded Wolves** by Roshani Chokshi: This novel is set in Paris in the late 19th century and follows a group of thieves and scholars as they try to steal a powerful artifact. The story features a diverse cast of characters, including an Indian prince, a French-Algerian thief, and a Haitian-French scholar.\n2. **The Poppy War** by R.F. Kuang: You mentioned you've already read this one, but I had to include it in the list! This historical fantasy novel is set in a world inspired by Chinese history and mythology and follows a young orphan named Rin as she enrolls in a prestigious military academy and discovers her latent powers.\n3. **The Black Tides of Heaven** by J.Y. Yang: This novel is set in a world inspired by Chinese culture and mythology and follows a young orphan named Mia as she discovers her powers and becomes embroiled in a rebellion against the ruling dynasty.\n4. **The House of Shattered Wings** by Aliette de Bodard: While I mentioned this novel earlier, it's also a great example of historical fantasy, set in a post-apocalyptic Paris inspired by French colonialism and Vietnamese culture.\n5. **The City of Brass** by S.A. Chakraborty: This novel is set in 18th century Cairo and follows a young con artist named Nahri as she discovers her magical heritage and becomes embroiled in the politics of the magical world.\n\nThese novels offer a mix of epic fantasy, adventure, and historical fantasy, all with diverse protagonists and a focus on mythology and magic. I hope you find something that interests you!\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., adult vs. YA, light vs. dark fantasy, etc.).",
