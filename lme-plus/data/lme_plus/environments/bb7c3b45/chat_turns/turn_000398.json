  "content": "Apple crisp is a classic dessert that's perfect for fall. The combination of tender apples, crunchy oatmeal topping, and sweet caramelized sugar is a match made in heaven. It's also a great way to use up any leftover apple cider from the short ribs recipe.\n\nHere's a simple recipe for an Apple Crisp that serves 6-8 people:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 6-8 medium-sized apples, peeled and sliced\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon cinnamon\n* 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup rolled oats\n* 1/2 cup brown sugar\n* 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix until the apples are evenly coated.\n3. Transfer the apple mixture to a 9x9-inch baking dish.\n4. In another bowl, mix together the rolled oats, brown sugar, and cold butter until crumbly.\n5. Spread the oat mixture evenly over the apple filling.\n6. Bake the apple crisp for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apples are tender.\n7. Serve warm, topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream if desired.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a mix of apple varieties, such as Granny Smith and Honeycrisp, for a nice balance of sweetness and tartness.\n* Don't overmix the oat topping, or it'll become tough and dense.\n* If you want a crisper oat topping, bake the apple crisp for an additional 5-10 minutes.\n\nI hope you enjoy the apple crisp! It's a perfect way to round out your fall-themed dinner party.",
