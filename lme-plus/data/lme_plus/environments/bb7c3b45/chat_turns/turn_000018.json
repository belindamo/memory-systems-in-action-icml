  "content": "Yeah, the demo I played was pretty challenging, but in a good way! It had that same sense of accomplishment when you overcome a tough section or defeat a difficult boss. The world felt really immersive, and the lore seemed really deep. I didn't get to experience too much of the story, but what I saw was really intriguing. The combat felt smooth, and the graphics were amazing. I ended up pre-ordering the collector's edition on the spot! Do you think it'll have any multiplayer elements, or will it be a single-player focused game like Sekiro?",
