Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah: A historical fiction novel set in France during World War II, it explores the lives of two sisters and their struggles during the war.\n2. \"The Alice Network\" by Kate Quinn: A historical fiction novel that follows the stories of a pregnant American socialite and a female spy from the Alice Network, a real-life espionage ring, during World War I.\n3. \"The Historian\" by Elizabeth Kostova: A sweeping historical novel that spans centuries, exploring the legend of Dracula and the connections between past and present.\n4. \"The Red Tent\" by Anita Diamant: A biblical historical fiction novel that retells the story of Dinah, a biblical figure, and her experiences in ancient Mesopotamia.\n5. \"The Paris Wife\" by Paula McLain: A historical novel that explores the life of Hadley Richardson, the first wife of Ernest Hemingway, set in 1920s Paris.\n6. \"The Song of Achilles\" by Madeline Miller: A historical fiction novel that reimagines the Trojan War from the perspective of Achilles' lover, Patroclus.\n7. \"The Other Boleyn Girl\" by Philippa Gregory: A historical novel that explores the lives of Mary and Anne Boleyn, sisters who both caught the eye of King Henry VIII.\n\nThese books share similar themes with \"The Lost City\" (whatever that book might be), such as rich historical settings, engaging characters, and compelling storytelling. I hope you find something that piques your interest!\n\nIs there a particular time period or geographic region you're interested in exploring through historical fiction?",
