Dublin: The growth of industries in Dublin has attracted people from other parts of the country and abroad, leading to an increase in the city's population. Dublin's population has increased from 250,000 in 1951 to over 1.4 million in 2021, largely due to industrialization.\n\n2. Kildare: Kildare has a long history of industrial development, including the establishment of the Curragh Camp military base in the 1850s and the creation of the Irish Ropes factory in Newbridge in the early 20th century. These developments attracted workers to the area, leading to an increase in the population.\n\n3. Louth: The development of the Drogheda Port and the creation of the Irish Steel plant in Dundalk in the mid-20th century led to an influx of workers and their families into the area, contributing to the growth of the population.\n\n4. Wicklow: The expansion of the Bray Head Hotel in the late 19th century and the opening of Powerscourt House in the early 20th century led to a growth in tourism in Wicklow. The development of the Avoca textile factory in the mid-20th century also attracted workers to the area.\n\nOverall, industrialization has played a significant role in the growth of the population in Leinster, attracting workers to the area and creating new jobs and opportunities for people.",
