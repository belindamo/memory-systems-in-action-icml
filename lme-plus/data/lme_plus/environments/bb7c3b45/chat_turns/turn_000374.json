You can make your own cashew milk by blending cashews with water and straining the mixture.\n3. **Hemp milk**: Hemp milk is a good source of protein and has a nutty flavor. It's a great option for those looking for a more substantial milk alternative.\n4. **Soy milk**: Soy milk is a classic non-dairy milk option and works well in smoothies.
