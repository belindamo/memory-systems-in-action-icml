I've been researching online, and I think I'll buy a Saris Bones trunk rack, which costs around $150. By the way, I just got a new bike helmet recently, which I bought on March 10th - it's a blue and white Bell helmet, and I got a good deal on it with a 10% student discount. Do you know if the Saris Bones trunk rack is compatible with my car model?",
