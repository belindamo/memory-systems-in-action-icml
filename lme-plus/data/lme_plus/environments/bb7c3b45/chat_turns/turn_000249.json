A matching pillowcase will add a nice finishing touch to your gift.\n\nTo calculate the fabric needed for a pillowcase, we'll need to consider the size of the pillow insert and the design of the pillowcase. Here's a general guide:\n\n**Standard Pillowcase Size:**\nFor a standard pillowcase, you'll want to make it about 1-2 inches larger on each side than the pillow insert. Let's assume a standard pillow insert size of 20x26 inches.\n\n**Pillowcase Dimensions:**\nFor a simple envelope-style pillowcase, you'll need two main pieces: the front and the back. Each piece will be approximately:\n\n* Front and Back: 21x27 inches (1 inch larger on each side than the pillow insert)\n\n**Fabric Requirements:**\nTo calculate the fabric needed, you'll want to add a 1/2-inch seam allowance around each piece. This will give you a total fabric requirement of:\n\n* Front: 21.5x27.5 inches\n* Back: 21.5x27.5 inches\n\nSince you want a matching pillowcase, you can use the same fabric as the quilt backing. For a pillowcase, you'll need about:\n\n* 1/2 yard of 42-inch wide fabric (this will give you enough fabric to accommodate the two main pieces and the seam allowances)\n\nIf you want a more elaborate pillowcase design, such as one with a cuff or a gathered top, you may need additional fabric. However, for a simple envelope-style pillowcase, 1/2 yard should be sufficient.\n\nRemember to add this to your overall fabric requirements, so you'll need:\n\n* 6 yards for the quilt backing\n* 1/2 yard for the pillowcase\n\nTotal fabric needed: 6.5 yards of 42-inch wide fabric.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
