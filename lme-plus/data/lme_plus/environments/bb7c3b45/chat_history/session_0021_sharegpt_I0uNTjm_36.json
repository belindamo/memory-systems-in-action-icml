They\u2019re letting me play with a cat.\n\nTherapist: Yes, they\u2019re with you in ways that support you in enjoying who you are and who you\u2019re discovering yourself to be. How does this affect your inner state?\n\nPatient: I\u2019m able to\u2014I have space to do what I want to do. I have a safety for exploring. I feel like they trust me. They\u2019re there to guide me, and help me, not form me.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: I feel safe enough. I feel I can express that, physically move to something new. It\u2019s a new feeling in myself, a kind of like courage, a feeling like, being held in a space where you are just safe, and feel willing to stretch, and reach out into the world. I have this confidence, I have a knowing, that they\u2019ll watch me, in a way they trust, that they don\u2019t need to contain me, that they\u2019ll give me the space to move forward.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: They\u2019re interested in the people I\u2019m interested in. They don\u2019t feel that people are threats to them. They want to support my own connections. They know how important that is.\n\nTherapist: They know how important that is. What effect does that have on your inner state? Patient: It makes me feel I can venture farther. I\u2019m not stealing myself from them. They think it\u2019s a healthy thing I want to go away. They\u2019re happy I can go away, and come back, and I\u2019m my own person.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: I can look around more. I\u2019m walking. I can go to places I didn\u2019t want to go to before, to new places. I don\u2019t have to worry about things.\n\nAnother:\n\nPatient: It\u2019s on the street, in a neighborhood where we live. I suggest walking together down the street. And we do. (Pause) And now I\u2019m walking ahead, and I know they\u2019re there behind me, even though I can\u2019t see them. There\u2019s just a weird sense of the neighborhood expanding; no, not the neighborhood expanding, but the comfort expanding, into the world.\n\nIn the expression below, a patient highlights what he experiences as a very significant change in his experience of relationship with his ideal parent figures. This change is clearly the emergence of an internalized secure base:\n\nIt feels like a meeting has taken place among the three of us . . . it feels very different than before . . . it feels like a starting point, like I can start to do things, and they can start to guide me and help me in ways that are right. It feels like the connection has become fully established, rather than becoming established. Up until now it felt like I was trying to feel connection with them . . . now it feels like that\u2019s been established. Now it\u2019s about me being more active, because I have the trust and connection with them now . . . I can do things and return to them . . . for interpretation of what it is I\u2019m doing . . . It\u2019s like a whole new approach to being in a way . . . fundamentally they\u2019re interested in me. I guess I can start to be me, with their guidance . . . they can help me with that . . . they can be supportive in ways I\u2019ve never experienced before.\n\nReinforcing the Internalized Secure Base\n\nWhen signs of a secure base are apparent in the patient\u2019s imagery, the therapist helps to extend, strengthen, and deepen that state by continuing to apply the principles of enhancing desired experiences. These include (1) mirroring, (2) bringing attention to felt experience, (3) amplifying positive states, (4) anchoring positive states in body experience, and (5) suggesting new scenes in which the desired state is also present. All of these appear in the example below:\n\n198 Patient: We\u2019re on a beach, a rocky beach. I can go and get rocks, and come back and give them to them, and they receive them. They pay attention to them, to the details, so we can look at things together.\n\nTherapist: Yes, you can go and get rocks, and then come back to them. Notice what it\u2019s like as you go off by yourself, really feeling that they\u2019re there for you. You can feel that secure feeling, can\u2019t you? Patient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: You can really tune in to that secure feeling now. Feel what that\u2019s like, as you experience the secure feeling right now. What\u2019s the secure feeling like?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like I can be myself, and do what I want. And even if I\u2019m not with my parents, I know that they\u2019re there for me, if I need them.\n\nTherapist: Yes, you can be yourself. And they\u2019re there for you, when and if you need them. . . . And now this scene fades away, and a new scene is about to appear. In this new scene, you\u2019re also with these parents, and you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling even more strongly. In this new scene, you\u2019re feeling the secure feeling so clearly, and you can be yourself, and do what you want, and you know deep down that these parents are there for you if you need them. As this new scene appears, you can say what\u2019s happening and what it\u2019s like for you.\n\nPatient: Well, we\u2019re at a playground, and I\u2019m playing with other kids. I know my parents are there, but they\u2019re letting me do what I want, playing, and I don\u2019t see them, but I know if I looked for them they\u2019d be there.\n\nTherapist: Yes. You can feel that they\u2019re there for you, while you\u2019re playing and enjoying yourself. Notice what you feel inside now.\n\nPatient: I feel happy. And there\u2019s like a confidence too.\n\nTherapist: You feel happy, and a confidence too. Really feel that happy feeling, and that confidence. And as you feel that, notice how you feel that in your body. What\u2019s it like to feel so happy, and confident, in your body?\n\nPatient: Well, there\u2019s an energy, a good-feeling energy. Like I can be me, and play. I\u2019m safe there. Therapist: Yes, you can be you, with that good-feeling energy, and you\u2019re safe. Feel that even more clearly in your body now. Even more in your body.\n\nYou can really feel it. Become even more familiar with this feeling, and what it\u2019s like as you experience it in your body. And the more you do that the more familiar you\u2019ll become with this goodfeeling energy, being you, being safe. And the more familiar you are with this, the more continuously you\u2019ll be able to feel it and hold it in your awareness. . . . You can really feel it now, can\u2019t you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: This safety, this safety. Really feel it, feel it in your body and through your whole being.\n\nWhen a patient is deeply immersed in the imagery, the sense of time can be expanded so that positive states can be experienced as having a longer duration than actual clock time. Time expansion (and contraction) is a common hypnotic technique and is very beneficial for supporting the development of familiarity and mastery of desired qualities. In the interaction with the above patient, the therapist introduced time expansion to reinforce the patient\u2019s experience of safety as follows:\n\nTherapist: And now, even though only a few moments of clock time will pass, it will seem like much longer time elapses, long enough for you to experience this safety in a way that makes it so very familiar to you. You have all the time it takes for this safety to become part of you, to experience it more and more as a foundation of who you are.\n\nWorking With Present Experience and Reducing the Frequency of IPF Sessions\n\nAs indications of internalized secure base appear more consistently and vividly in a patient\u2019s IPF experience, he or she will more and more frequently report signs of greater security in his or her current, day-to-day, between-sessions life. For example, a patient might say, \u201cI find myself sometimes actually enjoying when she touches me\u201d or \u201cWhen he said he was mad at me, I wasn\u2019t as worried that he\u2019d leave me\u201d or \u201cFinally I called a piano teacher and scheduled a first lesson.\u201d In response to these current life manifestations of security, the therapist delights in these new experiences and applies the same reinforcing methods that are used to support positive experiences in the IPF imagery: mirroring and amplifying the positive states and how they are experienced in the body. The IPF method of suggesting new scenes in which desired experiences are also present is modified to make it relevant to the patient\u2019s current life experience.
