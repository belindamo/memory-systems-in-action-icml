      "content": "I'm happy to help you with book recommendations! However, I have to clarify that there is no author named Emma Roberts who wrote \"The Lost City\". Emma Roberts is an American actress and singer, not an author. It's possible that you may be confusing her with another author or celebrity.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the book reading event, such as the genre, plot, or themes that you enjoyed, I'd be happy to suggest similar books that might interest you. Alternatively, you can also try asking the librarian who organized the event for recommendations, as they may have some insight into what you might enjoy.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try searching online for book recommendations based on your interests. Websites like Goodreads, Book Riot, and Literary Hub often feature lists of recommended books in various genres and categories. You can also check out online book clubs and forums, where readers discuss and recommend books.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm looking forward to hearing more about what you're looking for in a book!"
