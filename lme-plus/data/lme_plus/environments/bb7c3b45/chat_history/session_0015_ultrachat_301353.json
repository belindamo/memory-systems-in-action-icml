      "content": "Meghalaya's transportation situation can be challenging, particularly for visitors who prefer to travel independently. The state is largely covered with mountains and has mainly narrow, winding roads, making driving difficult for those who are not used to such terrain. The state does not have any rail connectivity, and there are only a few major highways connecting important cities and towns. \n\nTaxis, shared cabs and buses are available for those who want to travel between the towns but local transport can be sporadic and infrequent. Some towns have local buses or shared taxis, while in remoter areas people usually walk or hire private taxis.  \n\nTo explore the state's famous natural attractions, including waterfalls and parks, visitors may need to hire a private vehicle or take a local tour. The State Tourism department also offers packaged tours that include transportation, accommodation and tour guides. \n\nOverall, while public transportation is available, it can be limited, and visitors may need to rely on private transport or pre-booked tours depending on where they wish to visit. It is recommended that visitors plan their transportation options in advance to avoid any inconvenience."
