I also participated in the Bike-a-Thon for Cancer Research in late April, cycled 20 miles, and our team raised over $5,000. Additionally, I attended a fundraiser dinner on May 10th organized by \"Women Empowering Women\" and helped organize a charity yoga event in mid-May, which raised $600 for a local animal shelter. Oh, and I almost forgot - I walked 5 kilometers at the Walk for Hunger event on March 14th, raising $250 for local food banks."
