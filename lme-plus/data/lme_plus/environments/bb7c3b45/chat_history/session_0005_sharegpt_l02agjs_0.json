      "content": "Summarize at an MD Level:\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have generated a great deal of interest in the field of regenerative medicine. Adipose-derived stromal cells (AdSCs) are known to exhibit extensive proliferation potential and can undergo multilineage differentiation, sharing similar characteristics to bone marrow-derived MSCs. However, as the effect of AdSCs on tumor growth has not been studied sufficiently, we assessed the degree to which AdSCs affect the proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa) cell. Human AdSCs exerted an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-nonresponsive (PC3) human PCa cells, while normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) did not, and in fact promoted PCa cell proliferation to a degree. Moreover, AdSCs induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells and PC3 cells, activating the caspase3/7 signaling pathway. cDNA microarray analysis suggested that AdSC-induced apoptosis in both LNCaP and PC3 cells was related to the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Consistent with our in vitro observations, local transplantation of AdSCs delayed the growth of tumors derived from both LNCaP- and PC3-xenografts in immunodeficient mice. This is the first preclinical study to have directly demonstrated that AdSC-induced PCa cell apoptosis may occur via the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, irrespective of androgen-responsiveness. Since autologous AdSCs can be easily isolated from adipose tissue without any ethical concerns, we suggest that therapy with these cells could be a novel approach for patients with PCa."

      "content": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), specifically adipose-derived stromal cells (AdSCs), have the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types, making them a promising tool in regenerative medicine. However, the impact of AdSCs on cancer growth is not well understood. In this study, the effect of AdSCs on prostate cancer (PCa) cell proliferation was investigated. The results demonstrated that AdSCs inhibited the proliferation of both androgen-responsive and androgen-nonresponsive PCa cells, whereas normal human dermal fibroblasts promoted PCa cell proliferation. Additionally, AdSCs induced apoptosis in PCa cells, activating the caspase3/7 signaling pathway via the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Local transplantation of AdSCs also delayed the growth of PCa tumors in immunodeficient mice. Given the ease of isolating autologous AdSCs from adipose tissue, this study suggests that AdSC-based therapy could be a novel approach for PCa patients."

      "content": "Researchers studied the effects of stem cells, specifically adipose-derived stromal cells (AdSCs), on the growth of prostate cancer cells. They found that AdSCs inhibited the growth of both androgen-responsive and androgen-nonresponsive prostate cancer cells and caused them to die through a specific signaling pathway. The researchers also tested the use of AdSCs in mice with prostate cancer and found that they delayed tumor growth. These findings suggest that AdSCs may be a useful tool in treating prostate cancer."

They also tried using AdSCs in mice with prostate cancer and found that it slowed down the growth of the cancer. This means that AdSCs might be a good way to help people who have prostate cancer."
