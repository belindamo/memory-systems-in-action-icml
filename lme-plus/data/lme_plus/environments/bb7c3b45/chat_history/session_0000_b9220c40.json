The group performed at clubs, colleges, and festivals, blending hip-hop, jazz, and spoken word. This experience helped Miranda develop his skills in improvisation, rhyme, and storytelling.\n\n**College Years:** At Wesleyan University, Miranda wrote and composed music for several student productions, including a musical called \"In the Heights\" (not to be confused with the later Broadway show). This early version was a more traditional musical, with a book and score that explored themes of identity, community, and cultural heritage.\n\n**Influences:** Miranda's early influences were diverse and eclectic, reflecting his love of hip-hop, R&B, musical theater, and Latin music. Some key influences include:\n\n* Hip-hop artists like The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, and Jay-Z, who inspired his lyrical style and storytelling approach.\n* Musical theater composers like Stephen Sondheim, Jonathan Larson, and William Finn, who influenced his understanding of structure, character development, and songcraft.\n* Latin music legends like Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, and Gilberto Santa Rosa, who shaped his rhythmic sensibility and cultural heritage.\n\n**Early Songwriting:** Miranda wrote many songs during his college years, some of which would eventually become part of In the Heights. These early songs often dealt with themes of identity, community, and social justice, reflecting his experiences growing up in Washington Heights.\n\n**The Roots of In the Heights:** After college, Miranda continued to develop his songwriting skills, drawing inspiration from his community and personal experiences. He began to envision a musical that would capture the vibrant spirit of Washington Heights, blending hip-hop, Latin music, and traditional show tunes. This became the foundation for In the Heights, which would eventually premiere Off-Broadway in 2005.\n\n**Meeting Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes:** In 2002, Miranda met Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes, a playwright and screenwriter who would become his collaborator on In the Heights. Hudes brought a strong dramatic sensibility to the project, helping Miranda shape the story and characters into a compelling narrative.\n\nThe early days of Lin-Manuel Miranda's career were marked by a passion for creative experimentation, a willingness to take risks, and a deep connection to his community.
