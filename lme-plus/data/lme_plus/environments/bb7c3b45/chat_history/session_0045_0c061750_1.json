However, I can provide general guidance on brake pad replacement.\n\nThe frequency of brake pad replacement varies depending on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Riding conditions**: If you ride frequently in wet, muddy, or hilly terrain, your brake pads may wear out faster.\n2. **Riding style**: Aggressive riding, frequent braking, or carrying heavy loads can reduce brake pad lifespan.\n3. **Brake pad quality**: High-quality brake pads may last longer than lower-quality ones.\n4. **Bike type**: Different types of bikes, such as road bikes, mountain bikes, or hybrid bikes, may have varying brake pad replacement schedules.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, brake pads should be inspected regularly and replaced when they reach a certain wear level. Here are some common guidelines:\n\n* **Visual inspection**: Check your brake pads every 1,000 to 3,000 miles (1,600 to 4,800 km) for signs of wear, such as thinning, uneven wear, or excessive scoring.\n* **Wear indicator**: Many modern brake pads have a wear indicator that shows when the pad is worn down to a certain thickness. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for replacement.\n* **Average replacement interval**: As a rough estimate, brake pads may need to be replaced every 3,000 to 6,000 miles (4,800 to 9,600 km), depending on the factors mentioned above.\n\nIt's great that you're tracking your bike's maintenance on a spreadsheet! Consult your bike's owner's manual or speak with a local bike mechanic for specific guidance on brake pad replacement for your particular bike.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to brake safety. If you're unsure about your brake pads, it's best to have them inspected and replaced by a professional mechanic."
