      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal experience, but based on research, the National Film Board of Canada provides ongoing support to filmmakers after their project is completed. This includes distribution through various channels such as festivals, television broadcasts and online platforms, as well as marketing and promotion of the film. The NFB also offers post-production services, such as sound mixing and color correction, to ensure the film meets industry standards. Filmmakers may also receive funding for their next project through the NFB's various funding programs. The NFB also facilitates networking opportunities and mentorship for emerging filmmakers."

For example, the Indigenous Cinema program showcases Indigenous-made films, documentaries and animation, both in Canada and around the world. Another program, called Expositions, features works by artists from diverse cultural backgrounds, including Black and racialized artists. Additionally, the NFB's Documentary Program has a mandate to support diverse voices, and encourages submissions from filmmakers working in a variety of genres and formats. The NFB also runs mentorship and training programs specifically for underrepresented and emerging filmmakers. The focus on diversity and social justice is fundamental to the NFB's approach to filmmaking, as it seeks to represent a wide range of voices and perspectives through its programming."
