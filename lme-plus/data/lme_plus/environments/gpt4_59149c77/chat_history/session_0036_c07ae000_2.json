It's possible that it's a fictional book or author, or it might be a real book that I'm not trained on.\n\nHowever, I'm excited to discuss \"The Poppy War\" with you! The world-building in \"The Poppy War\" is indeed one of its strongest aspects. R.F. Kuang has created a rich, immersive, and detailed world inspired by Chinese history and mythology. The novel is set in a fictional world called the Nikan Empire, which is loosely based on ancient China during the Tang dynasty.\n\nThe world-building in \"The Poppy War\" is notable for its depth and attention to detail. Kuang has created a complex and nuanced world with its own history, politics, culture, and mythology. The novel is full of subtle references to Chinese culture, history, and folklore, which adds to the world's authenticity and depth.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of the world-building is the way Kuang incorporates elements of Chinese mythology and folklore into the story. The novel features a range of fantastical creatures, gods, and magical systems that are inspired by Chinese mythology, but also feel fresh and original.\n\nThe world-building in \"The Poppy War\" is also notable for its cultural sensitivity and awareness. Kuang has taken care to avoid stereotypes and clich\u00e9s, and has instead created a rich and nuanced portrayal of Chinese culture and identity. The novel explores themes of colonialism, imperialism, and cultural erasure, which adds depth and complexity to the world-building.\n\nOverall, the world-building in \"The Poppy War\" is one of its strongest aspects, and it's a major part of what makes the novel so compelling and immersive. I hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts on the novel as you read it!"
