If you're looking for high-quality audio, here are some music streaming platforms that cater to audiophiles:\n\n1. **Tidal**: Tidal is a popular choice for audiophiles, offering lossless, high-fidelity audio (FLAC/ALAC) at 1411 kbps or 44.1 kHz. They have a vast library of music, including lo-fi hip hop and electronic genres.\n2. **Qobuz**: Qobuz is a French music streaming service that offers high-resolution audio (up to 24-bit/192 kHz) and a vast classical music library. They also have a strong selection of electronic and hip hop music.\n3. **Deezer HiFi**: Deezer's HiFi tier offers lossless audio (FLAC) at 1411 kbps or 44.1 kHz, making it a great option for those who want high-quality sound without breaking the bank.\n4. **Amazon Music HD**: Amazon's high-definition music streaming service offers lossless audio (HD) at 24-bit/44.1 kHz or 24-bit/192 kHz, depending on the track.

Additionally, some of these services may have higher subscription fees or requirements for high-quality audio playback.\n\nIf you're looking for a more affordable option, you can also consider services like:\n\n1. **Bandcamp**: While not a traditional streaming service, Bandcamp allows artists to upload high-quality audio files (up to 24-bit/96 kHz) for fans to purchase and download.\n2. **SoundCloud Go+**: SoundCloud's premium tier offers high-quality audio (256 kbps AAC) and offline playback, making it a great option for those who want higher quality audio without breaking the bank.\n\nI hope this helps you find a music streaming platform that meets your audio quality standards!",
