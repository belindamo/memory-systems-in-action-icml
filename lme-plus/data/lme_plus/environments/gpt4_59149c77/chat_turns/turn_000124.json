  "content": "I'm happy with my aquarium's progress so far. I've got a mix of neon tetras and harlequin rasboras, and they seem to be thriving. I did have a bit of an issue with algae growth on the decorations last week, but I was able to remove it by scrubbing the decorations with a magnetic algae scraper. I've also been using an algae-preventing supplement, which seems to be helping. What do you think about canister filters? I recently set one up on my tank to improve water circulation and oxygenation, and I've noticed a significant reduction in algae growth on the glass walls.",
