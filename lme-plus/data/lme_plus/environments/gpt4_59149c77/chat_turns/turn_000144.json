Here's a revision with dialog:\n\nFor the rest of the Christmas break, Jack found himself unable to focus on anything but getting back to see the mirror again. He spent hours each day wandering the halls of the museum and skipping social events to go to the library and research anything related to the mirror.\n\n\"Hey Jack, are you coming to the party tonight?\" asked his classmate, Matt.\n\n\"I can't, I have to study for a test,\" Jack replied, feeling a pang of guilt. In truth, he had no interest in going to the party. All he wanted was to get back to the museum and see the mirror again.\n\n\"You're always studying, man. You should come out and have some fun,\" Matt said.\n\n\"I'll think about it,\" Jack replied, already knowing that he would spend the evening at the museum instead.\n\nThe next day, his mother found him hunched over a stack of books in the library, surrounded by notes and sketches. \"Jack, honey, it's time to take a break,\" she said, touching his shoulder.\n\n\"I can't, Mom. I need to figure this out,\" Jack replied, his eyes fixed on the pages in front of him.\n\n\"Jack, I'm worried about you,\" his mother said gently. \"I know how much the museum means to you, but you can't spend all your time there. You need to take care of yourself, too.\"\n\n\"I know, Mom. I'm sorry,\" Jack said, looking up at her with tired eyes. \"I just need to see the mirror again. I need to know what it means.\"\n\n\"I understand, honey. And we'll figure it out together, okay?\" Susan said, pulling him into a hug. \"But for now, let's take a break and go get some lunch. You need to eat something.\"\n\nReluctantly, Jack packed up his books and followed his mother out of the library. The museum would have to wait for now.",
