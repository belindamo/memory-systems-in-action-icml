Vinyl collecting is a wonderful hobby, and it's amazing what treasures you can find at garage sales and thrift stores.\n\nNow, regarding local camera shops or vintage camera stores, I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to your location, but I can suggest a few ways to find local resources that might be able to help you:\n\n**Local Camera Shops:**\n\n1. **Google Search**: Type in \"vintage camera stores near me\" or \"camera shops near me\" and see what comes up. You can also try searching for \"used camera equipment\" or \"camera repair shops\" in your area.\n2. **Yelp**: Check Yelp for camera shops in your area and filter the results by rating, distance, and categories like \"vintage\" or \"used equipment.\"\n3. **Local Photography Clubs**: Look for local photography clubs or meetups in your area. Members might know of camera shops or individuals selling vintage gear.\n\n**Vintage Camera Stores:**\n\n1. **The Camera Store**: This is a chain of camera stores with locations in the US and Canada. They often carry a selection of vintage cameras and lenses.\n2. **Mike's Camera**: Mike's Camera is a California-based camera store with multiple locations. They have a used department that might carry vintage lenses.\n3. **KEH Camera's Store Locator**: KEH Camera has a store locator on their website that can help you find local used camera equipment dealers.\n\n**Other Resources:**\n\n1. **Craigslist**: Check your local Craigslist for people selling vintage camera gear. Be cautious when transacting with individuals, and make sure to inspect the equipment carefully before purchasing.\n2. **Local Classifieds**: Look for local online classifieds or community boards where people might be selling vintage camera gear.\n3. **Vintage Camera Collector Groups**: Search for local or regional vintage camera collector groups on Facebook or Meetup.com. Members might know of individuals selling vintage lenses or have leads on local resources.\n\nWhen visiting local camera shops or vintage stores, don't be afraid to ask the staff if they know of anyone selling a 1950s-era Zeiss Planar lens or if they have any leads. They might have connections with other collectors or dealers who can help you find what you're looking for.\n\nGood luck in your search, and I hope you find that elusive lens!",
