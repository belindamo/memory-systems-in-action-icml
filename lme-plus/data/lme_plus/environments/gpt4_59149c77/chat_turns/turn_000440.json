I wrote my first short story, \"The Quantum Prophecy\", during a weekend getaway, and it was a sci-fi piece. Now, I'm trying to write a romance piece, \"Love in the Time of Lockdown\", and it's proving to be a bit more challenging. Do you have any tips on how to switch between genres and adapt to different tones?",
