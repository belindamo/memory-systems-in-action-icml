I'm particularly interested in the American Museum of Natural History, as I've heard their dinosaur exhibits are amazing. I've also been meaning to visit the Brooklyn Museum, as I've heard great things about their collection of ancient artifacts. Do you know if any of these museums offer guided tours or special programs for adults?",
