  "content": "Yes, in Guangxi, there is a unique custom called \"Sitting on the bridal bed.\" This can happen either during the wedding or after the couple is sent off to their honeymoon. The groomsmen would place a red veil over the bed, and the bride and groom are seated on it. Then, the groomsmen would throw nuts, seeds, and soybeans on the bed. The bride and groom have to pick up as many as they can. This is done for good luck as the nuts, seeds, and soybeans are associated with fertility, abundance, and prosperity.\n\nAnother custom in Guangxi is the \"Six Dragon and Phoenix Ball.\" This refers to six red China balls decorated with golden dragon and phoenix motifs that are hung above the bridal bed. This is believed to bring good luck, happiness, and prosperity to the couple.\n\nLastly, there is a tradition called \"Zuo Tang,\" which means to sit in the hall. During this ceremony, the bride and groom sit together in the bridal chamber as family and friends visit them to offer congratulations and gifts. This is also a chance for the bride and groom to exchange greetings and receive blessings from relatives and guests.",
