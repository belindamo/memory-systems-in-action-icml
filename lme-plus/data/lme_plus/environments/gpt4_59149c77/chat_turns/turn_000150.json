  "content": "Sure, let's pick up from there:\n\nAs Jack made his way to the library, he couldn't shake the feeling that someone was following him. He turned a corner and saw Matt a few feet behind him, looking curious.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Jack asked, trying to sound casual.\n\n\"I wanted to talk to you,\" Matt said, falling into step beside him. \"You've been acting really weird lately. Skipping parties, spending all your time in the library... What's going on?\"\n\nJack hesitated, unsure of how to respond. He had never talked to anyone about the mirror or his father, and he wasn't sure he was ready to start now.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" he finally said, hoping to brush it off.\n\n\"It doesn't seem like nothing,\" Matt replied, his voice softening. \"If you ever want to talk about anything, I'm here for you, man.\"\n\nJack felt a pang of emotion. He had always liked Matt, and it was hard to keep everything bottled up inside. Maybe it was time to open up to someone.\n\n\"I saw something,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"In the museum, over Christmas break. I saw my dad in a mirror.\"\n\nMatt looked at him skeptically. \"Are you serious?\"\n\nJack nodded. \"I know it sounds crazy. But it was real, I swear.\"\n\nMatt was silent for a moment, taking it all in. \"I believe you,\" he finally said. \"But you can't keep doing this to yourself, Jack. You need to find a way to move on.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Jack said, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. \"But I just can't let go of it.\"\n\nMatt put a hand on his shoulder. \"I'll help you, okay? We'll figure this out together.\"\n\nAs they made their way into the library, Jack felt a sense of comfort knowing that he had someone on his side. He still didn't know what the mirror was or how to see his father again, but he knew he wasn't alone.",
