  "content": "I've got an Eheim canister filter, and I'm using a combination of mechanical and biological media. I've got a coarse foam pad for mechanical filtration, followed by a biological media chamber with ceramic rings and bio balls. I've also added some activated carbon to help remove any impurities and odors from the water. So far, I'm really happy with its performance, and I've noticed a big improvement in water clarity and circulation.",
