  "content": "Some common practices in Vodou spirituality include the use of sacred drums, singing, and dancing in ritual ceremonies, the invocation of ancestral spirits, and the veneration of deities or lwa. Offerings of food, rum, tobacco, and other items are often made to the spirits in exchange for their assistance and protection. Divination and healing are also important aspects of Vodou practice.\n\nCompared to other African diasporic religions, such as Santeria or Candomble, Vodou's focus on ancestral spirits and the lwa sets it apart. Additionally, Vodou often incorporates elements of Catholicism, such as the veneration of saints and the use of candles, which is less common in other African diasporic religions.",
