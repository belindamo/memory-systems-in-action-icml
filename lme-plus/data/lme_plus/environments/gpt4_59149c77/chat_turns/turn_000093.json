Good luck with whatever you have planned.\"\n\nAs you continue through the city, you overhear a conversation between two locals about a powerful mage who has taken up residence in the city. They mention that the mage is looking for someone to help him with an experiment involving magical energies.\n\nYou find the mage's tower on the outskirts of the city, and after introducing yourself to the mage, he explains that he is researching a new form of magical energy that could revolutionize the practice of magic. He needs someone with magical aptitude to help him test his theories and gather data.\n\nThe mage offers to pay you for your services, and also promises to share his findings with you once the experiment is complete. Will you accept his offer, or do you have other plans in mind?",
