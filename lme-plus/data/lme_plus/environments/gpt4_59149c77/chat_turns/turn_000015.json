  "content": "Yes, film scores often incorporate themes or motifs from classical music pieces. This is a technique known as \"temp tracking\" or \"temping\". Filmmakers will often use temporary music, including classical music pieces, as a placeholder while editing the movie. If the director and composer agree that the temporary music works well for the scene, then the composer may be asked to incorporate and adapt that music into the film score.\n\nFor example, the soundtrack for the 1968 film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" by Stanley Kubrick prominently features several pieces of classical music, including Johann Strauss II's \"The Blue Danube\" waltz and Richard Strauss's \"Also sprach Zarathustra\". Additionally, composer John Williams has also famously incorporated themes from classical music pieces in his film scores, such as Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" in the soundtrack for \"A Clockwork Orange\".\n\nOverall, incorporating themes or motifs from classical music pieces is a common practice in film music composition, and can add depth and richness to a film score.",
