I'd like to focus on SingHealth for now and try to set up a meeting with Associate Professor Tan Cher Heng, Head of the Department of Diagnostic Radiology at Singapore General Hospital. Can you help me craft an email introduction and pitch that highlights the benefits of our AI-powered medical imaging software solutions and how they can improve patient outcomes and reduce costs for SingHealth? Additionally, can you suggest a few potential dates and times for the meeting, taking into account the upcoming Healthcare Innovation Summit Asia 2023?",
