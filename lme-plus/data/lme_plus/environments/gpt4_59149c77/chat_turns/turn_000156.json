  "content": "Yes, the tributes are seen as pawns of the Capitol in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl tribute from each of the twelve districts are chosen to compete in a televised battle to the death. The tributes are viewed by the Capitol and the citizens of the districts as entertainment rather than human beings with their own lives and families. The Capitol manipulates the tributes by controlling the rules of the games and encouraging them to fight to the death, and by providing them with gifts and resources to influence their actions. The tributes themselves are also often forced to use their own story to create sympathy or admiration in the eyes of the viewers, serving as a tool for the Capitol to maintain their power and control over the districts.",
