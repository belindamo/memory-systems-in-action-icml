However, it's possible that the fertilization might be contributing to the yellowing leaves. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Overfertilization**: Peace lilies don't require a lot of fertilizer, and overfertilization can cause yellowing leaves. If you're fertilizing too frequently or using too much fertilizer, it might be burning your plant's roots. Check the instructions on your fertilizer package to ensure you're not overdoing it.\n2. **Fertilizer burn**: Some fertilizers can cause a rapid growth spurt, which can lead to yellowing leaves. This is especially true if you've recently switched to a new fertilizer or started fertilizing more frequently.\n\nOther potential causes of yellowing leaves on a peace lily include:\n\n1. **Overwatering**: Peace lilies prefer well-draining soil and can be susceptible to root rot if the soil is too wet. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it feels wet, wait a few days before watering again.\n2. **Underwatering**: On the other hand, peace lilies need consistent moisture to thrive. If the soil is too dry for an extended period, the leaves might start to yellow.\n3. **Lighting issues**: Peace lilies prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate low light conditions. If your plant is not getting enough light, the leaves might turn yellow.\n4. **Temperature fluctuations**: Peace lilies prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C). If your plant is exposed to drafts, extreme temperatures, or sudden changes, it might cause yellowing leaves.\n5. **Pests or diseases**: Check your plant for any signs of pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale. Fungal diseases can also cause yellowing leaves, especially if the soil is too wet.\n6. **Nutrient deficiencies**: Peace lilies require a balanced diet of nutrients. If the soil lacks essential micronutrients, it can cause yellowing leaves.\n7. **Age**: As peace lily leaves age, they naturally turn yellow and eventually die off as new growth emerges. This is a normal part of the plant's life cycle.\n\nTo address the issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Adjust your fertilization schedule**: Consider reducing the frequency or amount of fertilizer you're using to avoid overfertilization.\n2. **Check your watering schedule**: Ensure you're not overwatering or underwatering your plant. Stick to a consistent watering schedule based on the soil moisture.\n3. **Inspect your plant**: Look for any signs of pests, diseases, or nutrient deficiencies.\n4. **Prune the yellow leaves**: Remove any yellow or damaged leaves to prevent the spread of disease and encourage healthy growth.\n\nIf you're still unsure about the cause or the problem persists, feel free to provide more details about your plant's environment, care routine, and any changes you've made recently. I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot the issue!",
