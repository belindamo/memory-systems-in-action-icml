  "content": "As Christmas break drew to a close, Jack found himself dreading the return to school. He had barely been able to focus on his studies over the break, his mind consumed by the desire to see the mirror again. But as he settled back into his routine, he found himself slipping back into old habits.\n\nOne day, Matt approached him in the hallway between classes. \"Hey, Jack, I heard there's going to be a party this weekend. You should come with me.\"\n\nJack hesitated. He knew that going to the party would mean being around people, and he was still struggling with his grief and his obsession with the mirror. But something in Matt's tone made him feel like he should say yes.\n\n\"Okay, sure,\" he said, trying to sound more enthusiastic than he felt.\n\n\"Great!\" Matt said, clapping him on the back. \"It'll be fun, I promise.\"\n\nAs Jack walked away, he felt a sense of trepidation creeping over him. He wasn't sure if he was ready to be around people, to pretend like everything was okay when he felt like he was falling apart inside. But he knew that he couldn't keep hiding forever. Maybe, just maybe, it was time to start facing his grief and finding a way forward.",
