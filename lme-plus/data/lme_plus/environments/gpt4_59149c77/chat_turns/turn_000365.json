  "content": "I'm thrilled that you're excited to read \"The Poppy War\"! It's a fantastic novel that explores the cost of war and cultural identity in a unique and thought-provoking way.\n\nHowever, I must correct you again - I'm afraid there is no Emma Taylor or novel called \"The Lost City\" that I'm aware of. It's possible that it's a fictional book or author, or it might be a real book that I'm not trained on. If you could provide more information about the book, such as the publisher or release date, I might be able to help you find more information about it.\n\nThat being said, if you're interested in exploring cultural themes in fantasy novels, I'd be happy to recommend more books that might fit the bill. For example, you might enjoy \"The Gilded Wolves\" by Roshani Chokshi, which is a fantasy adventure novel that explores themes of colonialism, identity, and cultural heritage in a world inspired by Indian and French mythology.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any other questions about \"The Poppy War\" or fantasy novels in general!",
