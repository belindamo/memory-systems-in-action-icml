  "content": "Yes, precision medicine is expected to become more common in the future as technology advances and it becomes easier and more affordable to sequence an individual's DNA. The cost of genetic testing has already decreased significantly over time, making it more accessible to patients.\n\nAs precision medicine continues to become more common, it is likely that it will become more affordable as well. With advances in technology and increased competition in the market, the cost of genetic testing and personalized treatments is expected to decrease, making it more accessible for patients who may not have had access to such treatments in the past.\n\nAdditionally, many healthcare providers and policymakers are recognizing the potential benefits of precision medicine and are investing in initiatives to promote its development and adoption. For example, the US government launched the Precision Medicine Initiative in 2015, aiming to accelerate the development of personalized treatments and make them more accessible to patients from all walks of life.\n\nOverall, while Precision medicine is still in its early stages, as it continues to develop and become more widespread, it has the potential to transform healthcare and improve patient outcomes by providing tailored and cost-effective treatments for a wide variety of diseases.",
