Please note that exhibitions are subject to change, so it's always a good idea to check the museums' websites or call ahead to confirm:\n\n**Environmental Art Museum:**\n\n* **Current Exhibition:** \"Ephemeral Landscapes\" by Maria Cristina Finucci\n\t+ This exhibition features large-scale, site-specific installations that explore the intersection of nature and human impact. Finucci uses natural materials like soil, water, and plant life to create immersive environments that raise awareness about environmental degradation and the fragility of our ecosystems.\n\t+ The exhibit includes interactive elements, such as a \"seed bomb\" station where visitors can create their own seed-filled balls to take home and plant, promoting reforestation and biodiversity.\n* **Upcoming Exhibition:** \"Climate Chronicles\" (opening in two weeks)\n\t+ This exhibition will feature a collection of photographs, videos, and mixed media works by various artists, documenting the effects of climate change on different parts of the world. The exhibition aims to raise awareness about the urgent need for climate action and encourage visitors to take personal responsibility for their carbon footprint.\n\n**Recycled Art Gallery:**\n\n* **Current Exhibition:** \"Rebirth\" by the collective \"Trash to Treasure\"\n\t+ This exhibition showcases a diverse range of artworks created from discarded materials like plastic waste, old electronics, and repurposed fabric. The collective, consisting of local artists, designers, and activists, aims to challenge our perceptions of waste and consumption.\n\t+ The exhibition includes interactive pieces, such as a \"design-your-own-upcycled-jewelry\" station and a \"recycling relay\" game that educates visitors about the recycling process.\n* **Upcoming Exhibition:** \"Waste Not\" (opening in a month)\n\t+ This solo exhibition by local artist Rachel Lee will feature sculptures and installations created from plastic waste, highlighting the impact of single-use plastics on our environment. Lee's work often incorporates found objects and community engagement, encouraging visitors to reflect on their own relationship with plastic.\n\nBoth exhibitions offer thought-provoking and visually striking experiences that align with your interest in environmental art and recycled materials. I hope this information helps you plan your visit!",
