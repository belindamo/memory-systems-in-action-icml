She studied fine arts at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome and later earned a master's degree in environmental design from the University of California, Berkeley. Her early work as an architect and urban planner influenced her later artistic practice, which focuses on the intersection of human activity and the natural environment.\n\n**Inspirations and Themes:**\n\nFinucci's artistic vision is shaped by her deep concern for the environment, social justice, and the human condition. Her work is inspired by:\n\n1. **Ephemeral Nature:** Finucci is fascinated by the transient and fragile nature of life, which is reflected in her use of natural materials that decay, change, or disappear over time.\n2. **Environmental Activism:** Her art often serves as a platform to raise awareness about ecological issues, such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution.\n3. **Cultural Heritage:** Finucci draws inspiration from her Italian roots and explores the relationship between cultural identity, tradition, and the natural environment.\n4. **Technology and Innovation:** She frequently incorporates cutting-edge technologies, like sensors, robotics, and data visualization, to create interactive and dynamic installations that engage audiences.\n\n**Artistic Style and Techniques:**\n\nFinucci's artistic style is characterized by:\n\n1. **Immersive Environments:** She creates large-scale installations that surround and engage viewers, often using natural materials like soil, water, and plants.\n2. **Mixed Media:** Her work combines traditional art materials with innovative technologies, found objects, and natural elements.\n3. **Ephemeral and Interactive:** Finucci's installations often change over time, inviting viewers to participate and become an active part of the artwork.\n\n**Awards and Recognition:**\n\nFinucci has received numerous awards and recognition for her work, including the prestigious Prix Ars Electronica, the International Sculpture Award, and the environmental art award, \"The Green Prize.\"\n\n**Ephemeral Landscapes:**\n\nThe \"Ephemeral Landscapes\" exhibition at the Environmental Art Museum is a prime example of Finucci's artistic vision.
