However, I have to correct you - I'm a large language model, I don't have personal knowledge or opinions, and I don't have information about a specific author named Emma Taylor or her novel \"The Lost City\". It's possible that it's a fictional book or author, or it may be a real book that I'm not trained on.\n\nThat being said, I'd be happy to provide you with some general recommendations based on popular authors and books in various genres. If you're interested in exploring new authors, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1.
