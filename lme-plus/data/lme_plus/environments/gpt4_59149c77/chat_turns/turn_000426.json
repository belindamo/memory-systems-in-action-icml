  "content": "I'm definitely excited to check out more of Jinsang's music. I'll start with \"In Flight\" and \"Soulection White Label\" to hear his earlier, more jazzy sound. Then, I'll explore his more experimental projects like \"Panacea\" and \"Inflight, Vol. 2\". And finally, I'll give \"Petal\" a listen to see how his sound has evolved over time.\n\nBy the way, have you heard about the new Arctic Monkeys album, \"The Car\"? I recently got the vinyl and it's been on repeat.",
