But then he remembered his mother's words, and the concern in her eyes when she had seen how obsessed he had become.\n\n\"Actually, I think I'll pass,\" he said, surprising both Matt and himself. \"I've got some other stuff I need to take care of.\"\n\nMatt shrugged. \"Suit yourself. But I think you're missing out.\"\n\nJack watched as his friend walked away, and then turned and made his way to the library. He had work to do, and a plan to make. He had to find a way to see the mirror again, no matter what. And this time, he wouldn't let anything stand in his way.",
