With those new scores, here are your ability modifiers:\n\n* Strength: +0\n* Dexterity: -1\n* Constitution: +2\n* Intelligence: +1\n* Wisdom: +2\n* Charisma: +2\n\nWith a Charisma score of 15, you now have a +2 Charisma modifier, which will be very helpful for casting spells as a sorcerer. And with an Intelligence score of 13, you have a +1 modifier, which will come in handy for skills like Arcana and History.\n\nNow, back to your sorcerous origin - which one do you prefer?",
