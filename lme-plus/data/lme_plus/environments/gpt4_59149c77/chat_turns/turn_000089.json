  "content": "Great choice! As a Wild Magic sorcerer, your magic is unpredictable and can sometimes have chaotic results. You'll have access to a range of spells that allow you to damage your enemies, protect yourself and your allies, and manipulate the environment.\n\nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips and two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You can cast any spell you know without preparing it ahead of time, and you have a number of spell slots that you can use to cast spells. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma, and your spell save DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.\n\nAs a Wild Magic sorcerer, you also have the following abilities:\n\n* Wild Magic Surge: After you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to see if a random magical effect occurs.\n* Tides of Chaos: Once per long rest, you can gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw of your choice. After you use this ability, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.\n\nAre you ready to start your adventure in Skyrim as a Wild Magic sorcerer?",
