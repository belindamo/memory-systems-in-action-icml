He spent hours each day wandering the halls of the museum, lost in thought and distracted from everything else.\n\nOne day, when he was sitting in his English class, his mind wandered to the museum. He leaned over to his classmate and whispered, \"Hey, do you want to hear something cool?\"\n\n\"What?\" she asked.\n\n\"I found a secret room in the museum. And in that room, there's a mirror that can show you your loved ones who've passed away,\" Jack said, his eyes sparkling with excitement.\n\n\"Really? That sounds kind of creepy,\" his classmate said, wrinkling her nose.\n\n\"It's not creepy, it's amazing. You can see them like they're really there, and talk to them,\" Jack insisted.\n\nHis classmate rolled her eyes. \"Okay, whatever you say. But aren't you supposed to be studying for the English test?\"\n\nJack shook his head, unable to concentrate on anything but the image of his father in the mirror.\n\nLater that week, when he was having dinner with his mother, he brought up the subject of the mirror again.\n\n\"Mom, I really need to see that mirror again. I have to know what it does,\" he said, his eyes pleading.\n\n\"Jack, we've been over this. The security guards won't let you into the restricted area,\" Susan said, setting down her fork. \"And besides, I'm not sure it's healthy for you to be so fixated on this.\"\n\n\"But Mom, I have to see it again. I need to understand what's happening to me,\" Jack insisted.\n\n\"I understand that you're curious, but you have to let it go,\" Susan said firmly. \"You're getting too caught up in this, and I'm worried about you.\"",
