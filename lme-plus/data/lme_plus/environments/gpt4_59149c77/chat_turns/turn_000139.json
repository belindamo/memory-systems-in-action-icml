You might find some great deals on products you need or want to try. Don't forget to check the prices and calculate the discount with your $5 off coupon to maximize your savings.\n\nIf you have the Target app, you can also check for Cartwheel offers, which can give you an additional 5-50% off select items. And, if you have a Target RedCard, you'll get an extra 5% off your entire purchase, including sale items.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to read reviews and check the ingredients, especially when trying new skincare products. And, if you're unsure about a fragrance, you can always ask for a tester or try a smaller size before committing to a larger bottle.\n\nHave fun shopping, and I hope you find some great deals!",
