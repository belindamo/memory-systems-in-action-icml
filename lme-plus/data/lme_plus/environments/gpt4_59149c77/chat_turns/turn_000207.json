While peace lilies can tolerate a range of temperatures, sudden or extreme changes can cause stress, leading to yellowing leaves.\n\nMorning chilliness might not be the primary cause, but it's possible that it's contributing to the issue. Peace lilies prefer temperatures above 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C), and a consistent temperature between 70\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (21\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C) is ideal.\n\nHere are a few questions to help us narrow down the temperature factor:\n\n1. **How cold does your apartment get in the mornings?** If the temperature drops below 60\u00b0F (15\u00b0C), it might be causing stress to your plant.\n2. **How long does the apartment stay cold?** If the temperature remains low for an extended period, it could be affecting your plant's health.\n3. **Is your peace lily near a drafty window or door?** If it's exposed to cold air or drafts, it could be causing the leaves to yellow.\n4. **Have you recently moved the plant to a new location?** If so, it might be adjusting to a different temperature range or microclimate.\n\nTo mitigate temperature fluctuations, you can try:\n\n1. **Move the plant to a warmer location**: If possible, place the peace lily in a spot that maintains a consistent temperature above 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C).\n2. **Use a space heater (carefully)**: If you have a space heater, you can place it near the plant to maintain a warmer temperature. However, be cautious not to overheat the plant or create a hot spot.\n3. **Insulate the pot**: Wrap the pot with a towel or cloth to help retain warmth and reduce heat loss.\n\nKeep in mind that temperature fluctuations might not be the only cause of the yellowing leaves. It's still possible that other factors, such as lighting, humidity, or nutrient deficiencies, could be contributing to the issue.\n\nIf you're still unsure or the problem persists, feel free to provide more information about your plant's environment and care routine. I'm here to help you troubleshoot!",
