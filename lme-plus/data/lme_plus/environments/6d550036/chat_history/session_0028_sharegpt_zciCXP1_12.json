In the last year, we have seen a growing community. More people are involved in projects, more people are getting on board and maybe the best part, most people are walking with strong core values about the ecosystem. \n\nLast year we had two big events in the country. ETHMexico, run by ETHGlobal and Blockchainland, run by a private entity. Both events got more than 700 attendees.\n\nThis year, the only big event confirmed about blockchain is BlockchainLand, so we, as the Ethereum M\u00e9xico Community Team, believe that the most important event about Web3 should not be a private one. We aim to make an event created by the community for the community, with workshops and talks about how Ethereum and all the protocols built on it could bring new tools and opportunities for the people.\nHow does your project differ from similar ones?\\*\nWe would answer this question from the perspective of what is happening in Mexico.

      "content": "To improve the answer to the question, \u201cHow does your project differ from similar ones?\u201d the following could be added:\nOur project differs from similar ones in Mexico in several key ways. Firstly, unlike the two big events held in the country last year, which were run by ETHGlobal and a private entity, respectively, our event is being created by the Ethereum Mexico Community Team, with a focus on community building and education. We believe that the most important event about Web3 should be created by the community for the community, and that workshops and talks about how Ethereum and all the protocols built on it could bring new tools and opportunities for the people are essential.\nSecondly, our event aims to highlight the strong core values of the Ethereum ecosystem in Mexico. In the past year, we have seen a growing community of people who are involved in projects and getting on board with the Ethereum ecosystem. We believe that our event will provide an opportunity for attendees to network and collaborate with others who share their passion and values for Ethereum.\nLastly, our event is focused on accessibility and affordability for the Mexican people. We recognize that many individuals in Mexico are interested in learning about the Ethereum ecosystem but cannot afford to attend events in other parts of the world. By hosting an event in Mexico City, we are providing a more accessible and affordable option for individuals who want to learn about Ethereum and its potential to transform industries beyond finance."

      "content": "1. What are your plans after the grant is completed?\nAfter the grant is completed, we plan to continue organizing community events, workshops, and talks to further promote the Ethereum ecosystem and its potential in Mexico. We aim to strengthen our network of builders, developers, and enthusiasts and create more opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing. We also plan to continue our partnership with the Ethereum Foundation and explore additional funding opportunities to support our community-building efforts.\n1. How do you aim to be sustainable after the grant? Alternatively, tell us why this project doesn\u2019t need to be sustainable!\nTo be sustainable after the grant, we plan to explore additional funding opportunities and revenue streams to support our ongoing community-building efforts. We aim to build long-lasting partnerships with other organizations and individuals who share our values and vision for the Ethereum ecosystem in Mexico. Additionally, we plan to establish a self-sustaining community that can continue to grow and thrive without relying solely on external funding. Finally, we believe that our project is sustainable in its own right because it is focused on community building and education, which will have long-term benefits for the Ethereum ecosystem in Mexico. By fostering a strong community of builders, developers, and enthusiasts, we believe that we can contribute to the growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem in a sustainable and meaningful way."

      "content": "To improve the answer to the question, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t work on this project, what would you work on instead?\u201d the following could be added:\nWhile we would continue to organize small community events across the country, we recognize that these events have limitations in terms of reach and impact. Without the opportunity to offer a larger, high-quality event like Ethereum Mexico, we would miss out on the chance to bring together builders, developers, and enthusiasts from across Mexico to network, collaborate, and share knowledge. We believe that Ethereum Mexico is a unique opportunity to create a lasting impact on the Ethereum ecosystem in Mexico, and without it, we would be limited in our ability to contribute to the growth and development of the ecosystem. Therefore, we are fully committed to making Ethereum Mexico a success and believe that it is the best use of our time and resources."

If you're considering reapplying, we recommend signing up for Office Hours first before restarting the application process.This is the first time we applied for an IRL event of this magnitude! In the past, we applied to host events during The Merge, we hosted 3 events in 3 different cities for 80-100 people each one."

In the past, we applied for funding to host events during The Merge and successfully hosted three events in three different cities, with attendance ranging from 80-100 people at each event. While these events were successful, they were much smaller in scale than Ethereum Mexico, which is our largest event to date. We believe that Ethereum Mexico has the potential to make a significant impact on the Ethereum ecosystem in Mexico and are excited to bring together builders, developers, and enthusiasts from across the country to network, collaborate, and learn. While some aspects of our previous events may inform our approach to Ethereum Mexico, we are approaching this project with a fresh perspective and are committed to making it a success."

While the grant amount is important, what is most important to us is making Ethereum Mexico a reality and creating a valuable experience for the attendees. We believe that this event has the potential to make a significant impact on the Ethereum ecosystem in Mexico, and we are committed to making it happen regardless of the grant amount."
