According to this view, science deals with empirical facts and the natural world, while religion deals with moral and spiritual questions. Gould, who proposed this idea, believed that the two domains of knowledge were non-overlapping and therefore could not conflict with each other. He saw this as a way of reconciling the perceived conflict between science and religion, allowing each to address different questions without interfering with the other."

Pope Benedict, in his book \"Introduction to Christianity\", refers to the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and identifies two planes of human thought: \"calculating thought,\" which seeks to understand the world through measurement and prediction, and \"reflective thought,\" which considers the meaning and significance of our existence. Benedict argues that religion is primarily concerned with the latter, and that it provides a framework for reflecting on the ultimate meaning of life."
