Here are some key things to watch out for:\n\n1. **Distracting backgrounds**: A cluttered or distracting background can take attention away from your subject. Try to find a clean and simple background that complements your subject's attire and the overall mood of the shot.\n2. **Harsh lighting**: Avoid harsh direct sunlight, especially during peak hours (usually between 11 am and 3 pm). Instead, opt for soft, indirect light or use a reflector to soften the light.\n3. **Unflattering angles**: Avoid shooting from unflattering angles, such as directly above or below your subject. Experiment with different angles to find the most flattering one.\n4. **Poor composition**: Pay attention to composition rules like the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing. A well-composed shot can make a huge difference in the overall impact of the image.\n5. **Inconsistent focus**: Make sure your subject's eyes are sharp and in focus. If you're using a shallow depth of field, ensure that the area you want to be in focus is indeed sharp.\n6. **Overposing**: Avoid overposing your subject. Instead, encourage them to relax and be themselves. Capture natural moments and expressions for a more authentic look.\n7. **Not paying attention to details**: Pay attention to details like clothing, accessories, and hair. Encourage your subject to dress appropriately for the setting and avoid distracting elements.\n8. **Not being prepared**: Come prepared with the right gear, batteries, and memory cards. Also, scout the location beforehand to know the best spots and times for shooting.\n9. **Rushing the shot**: Don't rush the shot. Take your time to compose, focus, and capture the moment. A rushed shot can result in a mediocre image.\n10. **Not respecting your subject's boundaries**: Always respect your subject's boundaries and personal space. If they're uncomfortable with a particular pose or shot, respect their wishes and move on.\n\nWhen capturing candid moments in a natural environment, be mindful of the following:\n\n1. **Be discreet**: Try not to draw attention to yourself or your camera. This can help your subjects feel more comfortable and relaxed.\n2. **Anticipate moments**: Anticipate moments and reactions to capture the best candid shots.\n3. **Keep a low profile**: Avoid using flash or making sudden movements that might startle your subjects.\n4. **Capture in between moments**: Some of the best candid shots are captured in between moments, like when your subjects are laughing, talking, or interacting with each other.\n5. **Respect the environment**: Respect the environment and the people in it. Avoid disrupting the natural flow of the event or activity.\n\nBy being aware of these common mistakes and taking steps to avoid them, you'll be well on your way to capturing stunning portraits and candid moments in a natural environment.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about portrait photography or capturing candid moments?
