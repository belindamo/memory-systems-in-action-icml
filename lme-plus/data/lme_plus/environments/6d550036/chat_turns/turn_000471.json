That's a great habit to get into.\n\nRegarding your moisturizer, it's excellent that you're thinking of switching to a lighter one for the warmer months. You're right; a lighter moisturizer can help your skin breathe better in the heat.\n\nHere are some recommendations for lighter moisturizers:\n\n1. **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel**: This is a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that provides long-lasting hydration without feeling greasy.\n2. **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid**: This moisturizer is formulated for sensitive skin and is extremely lightweight, making it perfect for warm weather.\n3. **EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46**: This moisturizer not only provides hydration but also offers excellent sun protection, which is essential for the warmer months.\n4. **Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream (Lightweight Formula)**: This is a fragrance-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer that's gentle and won't clog pores.\n\nSome general skincare tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Exfoliate regularly**: Exfoliating 1-2 times a week can help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, revealing brighter, smoother skin.\n2. **Use sunscreen daily**: Even on cloudy days, UV rays can cause damage. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and reapply every 2 hours.\n3. **Don't over-wash**: Washing your face too much can strip your skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation. Stick to your twice-daily routine.\n4. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.\n5. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep to help your skin regenerate and repair itself.\n\nAnd, yay for your new glass cleaner! It's great that it's working well for you. Streak-free mirrors and countertops can make a big difference in the overall cleanliness and appearance of your bathroom.\n\nRemember, consistency is key in both skincare and bathroom cleaning!",
