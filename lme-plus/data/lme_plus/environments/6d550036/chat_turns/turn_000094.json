  "content": "Macaque and MK were in the middle of their prayer when the sound of staggering footsteps and drunken laughter interrupted them. They looked up to see Wukong, who was clearly inebriated, swaying on his feet as he stumbled towards them.\n\n\"What's this? A little prayer circle?\" Wukong sneered. \"How cute. But let me tell you something, you two. The Jade Emperor is scared of me. He wouldn't dare mess with the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!\"\n\nMacaque glared at Wukong, annoyed at the interruption. \"Leave us be, Wukong. We're in the middle of something important.\"\n\nWukong just laughed, stumbling closer to the cage. \"Important? Hah! You two are just a couple of weaklings, praying to your little gods because you can't do anything to stop me.\"\n\nMK tried to speak up, but his voice was shaky with fear. \"P-please, Wukong, leave us alone. We just want to be left in peace.\"\n\nWukong ignored him, reaching out to grab the bars of the cage. \"I could break you out of there any time I want, you know. But where's the fun in that?\"\n\nMacaque continued to pray, ignoring Wukong's taunts as best he could. But his anger was simmering just beneath the surface, and he knew that it wouldn't take much to push him over the edge.\n\nMeanwhile, MK huddled in the corner of the cage, trembling with fear as Wukong continued to mock and threaten them.",
