  "content": "It can be difficult to distance oneself from friends who do not prioritize self-care, especially if they do not understand why it is important. Here are some steps you could take:\n\n1. Communicate: Try to communicate with your friends why self-care is important to you. Explain how it affects not only your physical health, but also your mental well-being. Encourage them to try some self-care practices with you, so they can see the benefits for themselves.\n\n2. Set Boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries with your friends if they are always engaging in behaviors that you feel are detrimental to your self-care. Explain that you may not be able to join them for certain activities or events, or that you may leave early to prioritize your own self-care.\n\n3. Seek Support: It's important to have a support system, so seek out individuals who share your values and priorities regarding self-care. Join a class or a group where you can meet like-minded individuals who can support you and offer encouragement.\n\n4. Practice Self-Care: The most important step is to prioritize your own self-care. When you engage in healthy practices and prioritize your own well-being, you will become better equipped to handle any challenges or resistance from your friends.\n\nRemember, taking care of your own needs is not selfish. It's important to prioritize your own well-being, and surround yourself with people who will support and encourage you, even if they don't understand why self-care is important to you.",
