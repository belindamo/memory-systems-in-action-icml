  "content": "Perfect timing! I'm glad to hear that you've already found a new table lamp with a USB port from IKEA! It's great that you're enjoying the convenience of being able to charge your devices while watching TV.\n\nIKEA is known for their affordable and functional designs, and it sounds like you've found a great option that fits your needs. Having a USB port on your table lamp is super handy, especially in a high-traffic area like a coffee table.\n\nNow that you've got your new lamp set up, I'm curious: what do you think of the design and functionality of the lamp? Is there anything you particularly like or dislike about it?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any differences in your daily routine or habits now that you have a convenient charging spot on your coffee table?",
