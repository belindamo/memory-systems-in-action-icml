  "content": "Yes, that's a good way to think about it. Ordinary differential equations are used to describe the behavior of systems with one independent variable, such as population growth, radioactive decay, or the motion of a single particle. Partial differential equations are needed when the system being studied depends on more than one independent variable, such as the heat distribution in a room or the motion of fluid through a pipe. Partial differential equations are often more difficult to solve than ordinary differential equations but are necessary for a wide range of applications in physics, engineering, and other fields.",
