  "content": "a. Pope Benedict, in his book \"Introduction to Christianity\", refers to the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and identifies two planes of human thought: \"calculating thought,\" which seeks to understand the world through measurement and prediction, and \"reflective thought,\" which considers the meaning and significance of our existence. Benedict argues that religion is primarily concerned with the latter, and that it provides a framework for reflecting on the ultimate meaning of life.",
