And great job on the bathroom cleaning too!\n\nNow, let's focus on maintaining your bathroom sink drain to prevent future clogs. Here are some tips to help you do so:\n\n1. **Be mindful of what you put down the drain**: Avoid pouring grease, oil, or food waste down the sink, as they can solidify and cause clogs. Instead, dispose of them in the trash or recycling.\n2. **Use a drain screen or strainer**: Installing a drain screen or strainer can catch hair and other debris before they go down the drain, preventing clogs. Clean the screen regularly to ensure it doesn't get clogged itself.\n3. **Run hot water regularly**: Running hot water through the drain on a regular basis can help dissolve any built-up residue and prevent clogs.\n4. **Use a natural drain cleaner**: Consider using a natural drain cleaner, like baking soda and vinegar, to clean your drain every 1-2 months. This can help break down any buildup and prevent clogs.\n5. **Don't overload the drain**: Avoid washing large amounts of hair or other debris down the drain at once, as this can cause clogs. Instead, wash them in smaller amounts or use a drain-safe hair catcher.\n6. **Check your drain for mineral buildup**: If you live in an area with hard water, mineral buildup can occur in your drain. Check your drain for signs of mineral buildup and clean it regularly to prevent clogs.\n7. **Consider using a drain maintenance product**: There are various products available that can help maintain your drain and prevent clogs. Look for products that contain enzymes, which break down organic matter and prevent buildup.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help prevent clogs and keep your bathroom sink drain flowing freely.\n\nAnd, by the way, I'm glad to hear that your new glass cleaner worked well on the mirrors and countertops!",
