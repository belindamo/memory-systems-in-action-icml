His words during the panel discussion must have been truly inspiring, especially given his own experiences as a writer and his commitment to exploring diverse perspectives in his work.\n\nColson Whitehead's books, such as \"The Underground Railroad\" and \"The Nickel Boys\", are powerful examples of how literature can shed light on the complexities of human experience, particularly for marginalized communities. His writing is a testament to the importance of empathy, understanding, and social justice.\n\nIt's great that you got to hear him speak and were inspired by his words. Sometimes, hearing authors talk about their work and their passions can be a powerful motivator to read more widely and explore different perspectives.\n\nDid Colson Whitehead share any insights or advice during the panel discussion that resonated with you?
