  "content": "Differential equations are mathematical equations that describe the relationships between a function and its derivatives. They can be classified as either ordinary or partial, depending on whether they involve one or several independent variables. \n\nPartial differential equations are a kind of differential equation that involves partial derivatives. They are used to model physical phenomena that depend on several independent variables, such as time and space. Partial differential equations are commonly used in fields such as physics, engineering, and finance.\n\nIn summary, while differential equations in general describe relationships between functions and their derivatives, partial differential equations specifically involve the use of partial derivatives and are used to model certain physical phenomena.",
