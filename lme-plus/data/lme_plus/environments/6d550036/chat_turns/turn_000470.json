  "content": "I'm also looking for some advice on skincare routines. I've been trying to establish a more consistent routine, washing my face twice a day in the bathroom. I've been using a new moisturizer that's been working well, but I think I might need to switch to a lighter one for the warmer months. Do you have any recommendations for lighter moisturizers or any other skincare tips? By the way, I cleaned the bathroom mirrors and countertops with a new glass cleaner I bought last Tuesday, and it left them streak-free.",
