Validate your own feelings: It's important to acknowledge and validate your own feelings of frustration and disappointment. Recognize that you feel this way for a reason and that it's okay to prioritize your own well-being.\n\n2. Set boundaries: Setting boundaries is important in any situation. Communicate to your friends that their negativity and unsupportiveness is not okay, and that you need them to be more respectful of your choices. Let them know what behaviors are acceptable and what's not.\n\n3. Find supportive individuals: Look for individuals who share your interests and values around self-care. Join a meditation group, a fitness class, or a support group focused on holistic wellness.\n\n4. Practice self-compassion: Remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish, and you deserve to prioritize your own well-being. Practice self-compassion by treating yourself kindly, and reminding yourself that you are worthy of love and care.\n\n5. Consider talking to a therapist: A therapist can help you navigate the challenges of coping with negativity and unsupportiveness from your friends. They can also offer you tools and strategies to help manage your emotions and communicate your needs more effectively.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be surrounded by individuals who uplift and support you, especially when it comes to your self-care journey. Stay true to your values and prioritize your own well-being, even if it means distancing yourself from negative friends.",
