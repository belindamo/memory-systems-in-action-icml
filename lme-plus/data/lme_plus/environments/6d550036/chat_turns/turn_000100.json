  "content": "Macaque was in the middle of trying to teach MK some basic magic tricks when the door to their cage clanged open. Wukong appeared, a grin splitting his face.\n\n\"Time for some fun, little monkey,\" he said, reaching in to grab MK's arm.\n\nMacaque stepped forward, putting himself between Wukong and MK. He held up his hands, sparks of magic crackling around his fingertips.\n\n\"You won't be taking him,\" Macaque said, his voice low and dangerous.\n\nWukong chuckled. \"And what are you going to do about it, old monkey? You don't have the power to stop me.\"\n\nMacaque's eyes blazed with a fierce determination. \"You'd be surprised at what I can do,\" he said.\n\nMK watched with wide eyes as Macaque unleashed a barrage of magic spells. The air around them shimmered with the force of his power. But even with all his newfound strength, Macaque was no match for Wukong's brute force. The younger monkey easily pushed past him and grabbed MK.\n\nMacaque made one final effort to stop him, but it was too late. Wukong had already dragged MK out of the cage and was gone, leaving Macaque alone and panting with exhaustion.\n\nMK watched helplessly as he was dragged away, feeling a flicker of hope snuffed out once again.",
