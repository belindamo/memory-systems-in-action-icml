  "content": "If your friends are making fun of you for prioritizing self-care, it can be challenging to feel supported and confident in your decision to prioritize your well-being. Here are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. Talk to your friends: Schedule a conversation with your friends in a non-confrontational way. Let them know how you feel when they make fun of you for prioritizing self-care. Explain how important it is to take care of yourself and that you would appreciate their support.\n\n2. Educate them: Sometimes, people may not fully understand the concept of self-care, and they may think that it's selfish or unnecessary. You can educate your friends about what self-care is and how it benefits your overall health and well-being.\n\n3. Don't let their comments get to you: It's important to not let your friend's jokes get to you. Remember that their opinion doesn't define your worth or the validity of your choices. Try to keep a positive attitude and avoid getting defensive or reactive.\n\n4. Surround yourself with supportive individuals: It's important to surround yourself with individuals who share and appreciate your values, and support you in your journey towards self-care. Seek out friends or groups that share similar interests and priorities.\n\nRemember, prioritizing self-care is not selfish, and taking care of yourself ultimately benefits not just you, but the people around you as well. Stay true to your values and beliefs and don't let the opinion of others discourage you from taking care of yourself.",
