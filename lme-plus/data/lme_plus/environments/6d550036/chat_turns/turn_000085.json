Don't be afraid to try out new things and iterate on your visualizations until you get the insights you need.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that visualization is not just about creating pretty pictures; it's about communicating insights and telling a story with your data. Make sure your visualizations are clear, concise, and easy to understand, and that they support your analysis and conclusions.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your analysis, and I hope you uncover some valuable insights from your customer data!\n\n(And don't forget to validate your clustering results with multiple methods and metrics to ensure that your findings are robust and reliable.)",
