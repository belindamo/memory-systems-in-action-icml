  "content": "Safety goggles are indeed essential for alabaster carving, and I strongly recommend wearing them whenever you're working with power tools or hand tools that can generate flying debris.\n\nWhile alabaster is a relatively soft material, it can still produce fine dust and small particles when carved. These particles can be harmful if they get in your eyes, causing irritation, itchiness, or even infection. Additionally, when using hand tools like chisels and gouges, there's a risk of accidental slippage or breakage, which can send sharp fragments flying towards your face.\n\nThe tutorials you've seen where the carver isn't wearing goggles might be exceptions rather than the rule. It's possible that the carver is experienced and has developed a technique that minimizes the risk of flying debris. However, it's still not recommended to follow their example, especially if you're a beginner.\n\nWearing safety goggles provides a layer of protection for your eyes, which are one of your most valuable assets. It's always better to err on the side of caution and take preventive measures to ensure your safety.\n\nHere are some tips for choosing the right safety goggles for alabaster carving:\n\n1. **Look for goggles with impact-resistant lenses**: Make sure the lenses are made of a shatter-resistant material, such as polycarbonate or Trivex.\n2. **Choose goggles with good optical clarity**: You want to be able to see clearly while carving, so opt for goggles with lenses that provide good optical clarity.\n3. **Select goggles with a comfortable fit**: You'll be wearing the goggles for extended periods, so choose a pair that fits comfortably and doesn't obstruct your vision.\n4. **Consider goggles with ventilation**: Ventilation can help prevent fogging and keep your eyes cool during long carving sessions.\n\nRemember, safety goggles are a small investment compared to the potential risks of eye damage. Always prioritize your safety and wear goggles when working with alabaster or any other material that can generate flying debris.\n\nDo you have any other questions about safety gear or alabaster carving in general?",
