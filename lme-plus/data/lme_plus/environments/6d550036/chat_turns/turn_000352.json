  "content": "It can be frustrating when our friends make fun of us or judge us for the ways we choose to take care of ourselves. Here are a few tips to help you manage this situation:\n\n1. Explain why you practice meditation and yoga: Talk to your friends about why you practice these self-care practices. Explain the health benefits, such as stress relief or improved focus, and why they are important to you.\n\n2. Educate your friends: Sometimes people may judge or make fun of something because they don't fully understand it. Try educating your friends about meditation and yoga, so they can see the benefits for themselves.\n\n3. Set boundaries: If your friends continue to make fun of you or judge you, then set clear boundaries. Let them know that it's not okay to make fun of your self-care practices, and that you expect them to respect your choices.\n\n4. Find supportive friends: If your current group of friends is not supportive, then find new friends who share your interests and values around self-care. Join a yoga class or meditation group, where you will be surrounded by individuals who understand and appreciate the importance of these practices.\n\nRemember, taking care of yourself is important, and you have the right to do so without fear of judgment or criticism. Stay true to your values, communicate your needs clearly, and surround yourself with supportive individuals who will uplift you in your self-care journey.",
