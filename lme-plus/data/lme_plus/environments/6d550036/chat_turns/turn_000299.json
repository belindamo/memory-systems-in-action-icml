  "content": "Answer the following quesiton in a better way.\nHow does your project differ from similar ones?\\*\nWe would answer this question from the perspective of what is happening in Mexico. In the last year, we have seen a growing community. More people are involved in projects, more people are getting on board and maybe the best part, most people are walking with strong core values about the ecosystem. \n\nLast year we had two big events in the country. ETHMexico, run by ETHGlobal and Blockchainland, run by a private entity. Both events got more than 700 attendees.\n\nThis year, the only big event confirmed about blockchain is BlockchainLand, so we, as the Ethereum M\u00e9xico Community Team, believe that the most important event about Web3 should not be a private one. We aim to make an event created by the community for the community, with workshops and talks about how Ethereum and all the protocols built on it could bring new tools and opportunities for the people.\nHow does your project differ from similar ones?\\*\nWe would answer this question from the perspective of what is happening in Mexico.
