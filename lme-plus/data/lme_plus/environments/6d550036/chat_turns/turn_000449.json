Directing people in a natural setting can be a bit more challenging, but with the right approach, you can get amazing results. Here are some tips to help you direct people in a natural environment without making them feel awkward or posed:\n\n1. **Blend in**: Before taking out your camera, blend in with the crowd and observe the scene. Get a feel for the atmosphere and the people's behavior. This will help you anticipate and capture natural moments.\n2. **Be discreet**: Try to be as discreet as possible when taking photos. Avoid drawing attention to yourself or your camera, as this can make people feel self-conscious and stiffen up.\n3. **Use a small camera or lens**: A smaller camera or lens can be less intimidating and allow you to move around more easily in a crowded space.\n4. **Look for natural moments**: Instead of trying to direct people, look for natural moments where they're interacting with each other or their environment. These moments can be incredibly candid and revealing.\n5. **Capture from a distance**: Shoot from a distance to capture people in their natural state. This can help them feel less self-conscious and more comfortable.\n6. **Use available light**: Make the most of the available light in the environment. Natural light can create beautiful, soft portraits that feel more authentic.\n7. **Shoot in bursts**: Shoot in short bursts to capture quick moments and reactions. This can help you get a sense of the energy and atmosphere of the scene.\n8. **Don't ask them to pose**: Avoid asking people to pose or smile for the camera. Instead, encourage them to continue doing what they're doing, and capture the moment naturally.\n9. **Use the environment to your advantage**: Use the environment to your advantage by incorporating props, colors, and textures into your portraits. This can add depth and context to your images.\n10. **Be respectful**: Always be respectful of people's boundaries and personal space. If someone doesn't want to be photographed, respect their wishes and move on.\n\nSome specific direction techniques you can try in a natural environment include:\n\n* Asking someone to \"just talk to your friend over there\" or \"show me what you're doing,\" to capture a natural interaction.\n* Suggesting they \"take a sip of their drink\" or \"adjust their hair,\" to create a natural, relaxed pose.\n* Encouraging them to \"keep doing what they're doing\" and \"ignore the camera,\" to capture a candid moment.\n\nRemember, the key to capturing natural portraits in a natural environment is to be observant, patient, and respectful. Blend in, stay discreet, and let the moments unfold naturally.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about capturing portraits in a natural environment or directing people in a more candid setting?",
