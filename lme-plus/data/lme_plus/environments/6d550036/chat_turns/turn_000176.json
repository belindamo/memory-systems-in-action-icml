Congratulations on participating in the case competition, by the way!\n\nThere are many excellent data visualization tools out there, and I'd be happy to recommend some popular and easy-to-use ones. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Tableau**: Tableau is a powerful and user-friendly tool that's widely used in the industry. It offers a free trial, and its drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to connect to various data sources and create interactive dashboards.\n2. **Power BI**: Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities. It's also user-friendly and offers a free version with limited features.\n3. **D3.js**: D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a popular JavaScript library for producing interactive, web-based data visualizations. It's a bit more technical, but there are many online resources and tutorials to help you get started.\n4. **Google Data Studio**: Google Data Studio is a free tool that allows you to create interactive, web-based dashboards with data from various sources, including Google Analytics and Google Sheets.\n5. **Plotly**: Plotly is an open-source platform for creating interactive, web-based visualizations. It offers a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of chart types.\n6. **Easel.ly**: Easel.ly is a simple, web-based tool that allows you to create custom, interactive charts and graphs without any coding knowledge.\n7. **Sisense**: Sisense is a cloud-based business intelligence platform that offers a range of data visualization tools and a user-friendly interface.\n8. **QlikView**: QlikView is a business intelligence platform that provides interactive, visual analytics and reporting capabilities.\n9. **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: These are Python libraries for creating static, 2D, and 3D plots. They're great for creating custom visualizations, but require some programming knowledge.\n10. **Visme**: Visme is a design platform that offers a range of data visualization tools, including interactive charts, graphs, and maps.\n\nBefore choosing a tool, consider the following factors:\n\n* Your level of technical expertise\n* The type of data you're working with (e.g., structured, unstructured, big data)\n* The type of visualizations you want to create (e.g., interactive, static, 2D, 3D)\n* The size and complexity of your dataset\n* The time you have available to learn and create your visualizations\n\nFor a case competition, you might want to focus on tools that are easy to use, offer interactive visualizations, and can be easily shared with others. Tableau, Power BI, and Google Data Studio are great options to consider.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with data visualization for your case competition presentation!",
