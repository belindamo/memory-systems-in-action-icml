  "content": "We are requesting a grant of 20k USD from the Ethereum Foundation, but we are open to discussing different grant amounts that align with our project goals and budget. While the grant amount is important, what is most important to us is making Ethereum Mexico a reality and creating a valuable experience for the attendees.
