  "content": "To improve the answer to the question, \u201cHave you previously applied to ESP with this same idea or project?\u201d the following could be added:\nWhile we have previously applied for funding from ESP to host events, this is the first time we have applied for an IRL event of this magnitude. In the past, we applied for funding to host events during The Merge and successfully hosted three events in three different cities, with attendance ranging from 80-100 people at each event. While these events were successful, they were much smaller in scale than Ethereum Mexico, which is our largest event to date. We believe that Ethereum Mexico has the potential to make a significant impact on the Ethereum ecosystem in Mexico and are excited to bring together builders, developers, and enthusiasts from across the country to network, collaborate, and learn. While some aspects of our previous events may inform our approach to Ethereum Mexico, we are approaching this project with a fresh perspective and are committed to making it a success.",
