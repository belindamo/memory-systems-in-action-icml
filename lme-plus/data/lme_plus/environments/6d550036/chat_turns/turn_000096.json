Suddenly, a ball of bright light appears in his palm, and he smiles in satisfaction.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" Macaque opens his eyes and turns to MK, his excitement palpable. \"I can feel my powers returning, little by little. We might have a chance after all.\"\n\nMK's face lights up with hope. \"That's great, Macaque! Can you try again?\"\n\nMacaque nods and closes his eyes once more. This time, a gust of wind swirls around them, rustling the leaves in the nearby trees. He opens his eyes and grins. \"I can control the wind again! Maybe we can use it to our advantage somehow.\"\n\nMK nods eagerly. \"That's amazing, Macaque. Keep going, let's see what else you can do.\"\n\nMacaque nods and focuses his energy. A small flame appears on his fingertip and he flicks it off, grinning. \"Fire too. My powers are definitely returning.\"\n\nMK feels a surge of hope and gratitude towards Macaque. \"Thank you, Macaque. I don't know what I'd do without you.\"\n\nMacaque smiles warmly. \"I'll always be here for you, little one. Now, let's keep experimenting. Who knows what other powers I might still have?\"",
