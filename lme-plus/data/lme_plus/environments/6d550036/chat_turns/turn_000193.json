  "content": "I think I'll go with a drum-shaped shade. I want to make sure the hallway feels bright and spacious, and I think that shape will help achieve that. Plus, it's a more traditional choice, so it will fit in with the rest of my decor. I'm really excited to get the new shade and see how it transforms the hallway! By the way, speaking of lighting, I've been meaning to adjust the timing on my smart light bulbs in the living room. Do you have any tips on how to do that?",
