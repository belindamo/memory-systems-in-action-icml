  "content": "b. Karl Marx did not say \"The idea of rights should be completely wiped out\". In fact, Marx wrote about the importance of human rights and criticized the ways in which capitalist societies violated those rights. However, some of Marx's followers and later Marxist regimes have been criticized for their treatment of individual rights and freedoms.\n\nIt is worth noting that none of the three individuals mentioned in the question (Feuerbach, Marx, and Comte) are known for advocating the abolition of human rights.",
