  "content": "David Paulides listens intently as you update him on your recent experiences and plans. He nods thoughtfully as you explain your intention to meet with Robert Bigelow and assemble a team of experts to investigate further.\n\nWhen you ask him if he would be interested in joining the team, he looks at you with a mixture of curiosity and concern.\n\n\"Well, I'm definitely interested in the subject matter,\" he says. \"But I'm not sure if I'm the right person for the job. I don't have any expertise in UFOs or aliens, and my focus has always been on missing persons cases.\"\n\nHe takes a sip from his water bottle and looks out at the stunning view from the trail.\n\n\"But,\" he continues, \"if you think I could be of help in any way, I'm happy to listen and see what I can do.\"\n\nYou thank him for his honesty and tell him that you think his expertise in missing persons cases could be valuable to the team, especially given the potential connections between disappearances and extraterrestrial activity.\n\nAs you continue on the hike, you both discuss potential strategies for approaching Robert Bigelow and assembling a team of experts. By the time you reach your campsite for the night, you feel a renewed sense of purpose and determination.",
