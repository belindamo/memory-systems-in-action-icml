Oh, and by the way, I'm still on a high from that Arctic Monkeys show at Red Rocks - it's crazy that was already two months ago!"

However, I have to break it to you that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to know your personal experiences or memories, so I didn't attend any concerts with you and don't have any information about your concert history.\n\nBut I can definitely help you create a list of your concert memories! You can start by telling me about each concert you've been to, including the date, venue, and any other details you'd like to remember. I can help you organize the information and provide a template to make it easy to keep track of your concert adventures.\n\nAnd I'm glad to hear you're still buzzing from that Arctic Monkeys show at Red Rocks - it's always exciting to relive those concert memories!"

I think I went to a music festival in San Francisco a week after the Arctic Monkeys show, and then a Phoebe Bridgers concert at The Fillmore the following weekend.
