One thing you could consider is seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor who can provide a neutral and supportive environment for both of you to work through your issues and improve your communication skills. It's also important to take care of yourself and practice self-care during this time, as it can be emotionally draining to navigate difficult situations within a relationship."

It's also important to communicate your own feelings and needs in a respectful and honest way, so that you can work together to find solutions that work for both of you. Additionally, you could offer to help with tasks or responsibilities that she may be feeling overwhelmed by, such as household chores or caring for your children. Small gestures of support and kindness can go a long way in showing that you care and are there for her."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It sounds like Madelyn is still holding onto her anger and is not ready to let go yet. It can be challenging to deal with this kind of response when you're expressing your love and trying to repair the relationship.\n\nOne approach you could take is to continue showing your love and affection for Madelyn without expecting an immediate response from her. Let her know that you understand she's still upset and that you're willing to give her space and time to work through her feelings.\n\nIn the meantime, you can focus on being patient and supportive, and continue to work on yourself and your relationship with Madelyn. It may take time, but with persistence and effort, you can hopefully reach a point where Madelyn feels comfortable and ready to reciprocate your love and affection."

During this time, you can reflect on the situation and your own feelings and try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. When you are ready to communicate, it may be helpful to approach the situation with a willingness to listen and understand Madelyn's perspective, as well as a willingness to express your own feelings and needs in a non-confrontational manner. It may also be helpful to seek the assistance of a couples therapist or mediator if the stalemate persists."
