As a child, he was very interested in art and began painting and drawing at a young age. Tito was largely self-taught but also attended the Art Students League of New York after completing high school. Throughout his life, he continued to hone his craft and explore new techniques and styles. His upbringing in Spanish Harlem and his experiences as a Puerto Rican in the United States had a significant influence on his art, which often dealt with themes of identity, culture, and social justice."
