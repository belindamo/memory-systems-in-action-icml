(Top 3 Catalonia, Madrid, Andalusia) - INE\n88% of the population has a mobile device, and 94.6% use it as their preferred device instead of a computer.\nSpanish the only available language when others like Catalan, English or other native languages aren't available at all.\nNo real-time, and easy-to-exploit system for others to hijack and resell their appointments on the black market.\nFails to address some of the A11y tests and recommendations.\nUsers don\u2019t have any sense of trust or that this service comes from an authority.\nHard to navigate, due to its overcomplicated user flow and poor IA.\nNot friendly for foreigners despite this being the only available platform, and they have to go through it.

The Frustrated User: This archetype represents users who experience frustration when interacting with the Cita Previa website. They may feel overwhelmed or stressed by the process, and may fear missing out on an appointment or losing valuable time. They may also feel lack of feedback or empathy from the website, which contributes to their frustration.\n2. The Skeptical User: This archetype represents users who have concerns about the trustworthiness or security of the Cita Previa website. They may fear that the website is a scam or that their personal information is at risk, and may need additional reassurance or evidence of its reliability before they are willing to proceed.\n3. The Time-Constrained User: This archetype represents users who have limited time to spend on the Cita Previa website. They may be looking for a quick and efficient way to book an appointment, and may be frustrated by any delays or obstacles that prolong the process. This archetype includes older users, users with disabilities, and users who prefer to use mobile devices. It also includes foreigners who may be unfamiliar with the website or who do not speak Spanish, as well as tech-savvy users who may have high expectations for the user experience."

      "content": "Personas and archetypes are both tools that designers and researchers use to represent the characteristics, goals, and needs of their target users. Both personas and archetypes are fictional characters that are based on real data and research about users, and both are used to help designers and researchers better understand the perspectives and motivations of their users.\n\nThe main difference between personas and archetypes is that personas are more detailed and specific, while archetypes are more general and broad. Personas typically include detailed information about a user's demographic characteristics, behavior patterns, goals, motivations, and pain points, as well as quotes and stories that illustrate their experiences and perspectives. Archetypes, on the other hand, are more general representations of groups of users who share common characteristics, goals, or needs.\n\nThere is no one \"right\" choice between personas and archetypes, and the best approach will depend on your specific goals and needs. If you need to create detailed and nuanced representations of your users that capture their individual characteristics and needs, personas may be the better choice. If you are looking for more general representations of user groups that highlight common characteristics or needs, archetypes may be a better fit. Ultimately, the key is to choose the approach that best fits your needs and helps you gain a deeper understanding of your users."

      "content": "Overall, these archetypes seem well-constructed and relevant to the Cita Previa website. They capture a range of different user emotions and challenges, and provide a clear understanding of the different types of users who may be interacting with the website.\n\nOne potential improvement might be to add more detail or examples to each archetype to help bring them to life and make them more relatable. For example, you might include specific quotes or stories from user interviews that illustrate the experiences and perspectives of each archetype, or provide more detailed information about their demographic characteristics or behavior patterns. This can help make the archetypes more concrete and easier for designers and researchers to refer to and understand."
