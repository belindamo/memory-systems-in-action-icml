      "content": "The recommended oil change interval for a Honda Civic varies depending on the model year, engine type, and driving conditions.\n\n**Traditional Oil:**\n\n* For 2001-2011 Honda Civics, the recommended oil change interval is every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km) with traditional oil.\n* For 2012-2015 Honda Civics, the recommended oil change interval is every 7,500 to 10,000 miles (12,000 to 16,000 km) with traditional oil.\n\n**Synthetic Oil:**\n\n* For 2016 and newer Honda Civics, the recommended oil change interval is every 10,000 to 15,000 miles (16,000 to 24,000 km) with synthetic oil.\n* Some Honda models, like the Civic Hybrid, may have different recommended oil change intervals. Be sure to check your owner's manual or consult with a Honda dealership or trusted mechanic for specific guidance.\n\n**Severe Driving Conditions:**\n\n* If you drive in extreme temperatures, tow a trailer, or drive in stop-and-go traffic, you may need to change your oil more frequently (every 5,000 to 7,500 miles).\n\nRemember to always check your owner's manual or the manufacturer's website for specific recommendations for your vehicle. Additionally, keep in mind that regular oil changes are essential for maintaining your car's engine health and performance.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
