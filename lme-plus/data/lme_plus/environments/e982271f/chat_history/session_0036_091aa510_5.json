The drive takes around 1.5 hours via the M4 motorway. This option gives you more flexibility to explore the area at your own pace.\n3. **Guided Tour**: Book a guided day tour that includes transportation from Sydney. This is a convenient option if you prefer not to worry about logistics and want to focus on enjoying the scenery.\n4. **Private Transfer or Taxi**: If you prefer a more personalized and hassle-free experience, you can book a private transfer or taxi service from Sydney to the Blue Mountains.\n\nOnce you arrive in the Blue Mountains, there are plenty of things to see and do:\n\n* **Three Sisters**: A iconic rock formation and a must-visit attraction.\n* **Scenic World**: A popular attraction that offers stunning views, cable cars, and a scenic railway.\n* **Echo Point**: A viewpoint that offers breathtaking views of the Jamison Valley.\n* **Wentworth Falls**: A beautiful waterfall that's easily accessible via a short hike.\n* **Bushwalking**: The Blue Mountains offer numerous hiking trails for all skill levels, from easy strolls to more challenging climbs.\n\nBefore you head to the Blue Mountains, make sure to check the weather forecast and plan accordingly.
