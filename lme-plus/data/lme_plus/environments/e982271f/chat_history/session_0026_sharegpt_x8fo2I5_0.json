      "content": "Jump Cancel is a technique used in Cars speedrunning that allows the player to maintain their speed when transitioning from a driving section to a flying section. This technique is commonly used in the \"Boostin' with Fillmore\" and \"Sarge's Off-Road Challenge\" levels.\n\nTo perform a Jump Cancel, the player must first build up speed on the ground and then jump into the air. As the car is in mid-air, the player must switch to the flying mode, and then immediately switch back to the driving mode. This cancels the jump animation and allows the car to maintain its speed while transitioning back to driving mode.\n\nTo perform a Jump Cancel in Cars speedrunning, follow these steps:\n\n1. Build up speed on the ground.\n2. Jump into the air.\n3. While in mid-air, switch to the flying mode.\n4. Immediately switch back to the driving mode.\n\nIt may take some practice to get the timing right, but mastering the Jump Cancel technique can save valuable seconds during speedruns."
