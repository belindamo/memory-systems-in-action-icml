  "content": "Chemical engineers are exploring several future trends in sustainable materials for medical or energy applications. Some of the significant trends include:\n\n1. Bioplastics: Bioplastics are a type of material that biodegrades naturally after use. Chemical engineers are exploring the use of bioplastics in medical device manufacturing, packaging, and drug delivery. Bioplastics made from renewable sources, like corn or algae, could reduce the carbon footprint and dependence on petroleum-based plastics.\n\n2. Advanced materials: Chemical engineers are exploring advanced materials like graphene and nanofibers, which offer high strength, flexibility and are lightweight. These materials have potential applications in energy storage, filtration, tissue engineering, and drug delivery.\n\n3. Sustainable energy sources: Chemical engineers are exploring renewable and sustainable energy sources like biofuels, hydrogen, and photovoltaics. Sustainable energy sources like these will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on non-renewable energy sources.\n\n4. Smart materials: Chemical engineers are developing smart materials that can respond to stimuli like light, heat, or pressure. These materials can be used in responsive drug delivery, diagnostics tools, and tissue engineering.\n\n5. Bio-inspired materials: Chemical engineers are using insights from natural materials like protein, enzymes, and biominerals to create advanced and sustainable materials for medical or energy applications.\n\nThese future trends show how chemical engineers continue to contribute towards the development of sustainable materials that meet global health, energy and economic objectives. Facing new global challenges, chemical engineers will have to continue to develop and explore these new and innovative methods to balance cost-effectiveness, technology and efficiency with ecological sustainability.",
