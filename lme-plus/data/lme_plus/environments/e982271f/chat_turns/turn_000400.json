  "content": "I plan to focus on capturing Emily's personality and facial expression in the sculpture. I think that's what will make the piece truly special and personalized to her. I've noticed that she has a very warm and kind smile, so I want to make sure to get that just right. I'm also considering having her pose in a way that's natural and relaxed, like she's sitting in her studio, surrounded by her art supplies. That way, the sculpture will not only capture her likeness but also her personality and spirit.",
