  "content": "I'm looking for some skincare product recommendations. I recently got a skincare set from Drunk Elephant at the new Sephora store, and I'm loving it. By the way, speaking of shopping, I visited the local outlet mall with my friends and spent the entire day there, scoring amazing deals at the Coach outlet store and Banana Republic outlet, and having lunch at the food court today. Do you have any suggestions for a good moisturizer for combination skin?",
