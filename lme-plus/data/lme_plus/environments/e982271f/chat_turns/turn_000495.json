  "content": "That's a great question! The authorities at the Shrine have recognized the importance of sustainable waste management practices and have taken several steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of their waste management system. \n\nFirstly, they have introduced waste segregation at the source, which involves separating different types of waste into specific bins. This helps in the efficient sorting and recycling of waste materials. The waste segregation practice is also encouraged among pilgrims to reduce the amount of waste generated.\n\nSecondly, the authorities have established a comprehensive recycling program that handles different types of waste materials such as plastics, paper, glass, and metal. The recyclable waste is sorted, and then it is sent to various recycling facilities to convert the materials into useful products.\n\nThirdly, the authorities have implemented a system of waste-to-energy, where the non-recyclable waste is processed to generate energy. The energy produced from this process is used to power various facilities in the Shrine, reducing dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nFinally, the authorities are also investing in awareness campaigns and education programs to encourage pilgrims to adopt sustainable behaviors and practices around waste management. These campaigns aim to reduce the waste generation and increase recycling practices among visitors.\n\nBy adopting these and other sustainability measures, the authorities are working to ensure the continued sustainability of their waste management system in the long run.",
