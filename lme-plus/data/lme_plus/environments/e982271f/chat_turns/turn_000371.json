The ESI prides itself on its interdisciplinary approach to research, and many of its events are designed to bring together researchers, students, and professionals from a variety of fields to explore topics related to environmental sustainability.\n\nAttending these events can be a great way to learn more about the latest research in this field and to network with other students and professionals who share your interests. You may also have opportunities to meet faculty members and researchers and to learn about potential research opportunities.\n\nSome events hosted by the ESI may be targeted toward specific fields or research areas, but even in these cases, the events are usually open to students from other fields who are interested in learning more.\n\nOverall, I would encourage you to attend as many ESI events as you can, regardless of your major or field of study.
