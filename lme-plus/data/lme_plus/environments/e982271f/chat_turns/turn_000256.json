  "content": "I'm mainly interested in freshwater fishing, and I'm open to traveling a bit. I'd love to catch some trout, but I'm not picky, and I had a nice smallmouth bass on my last solo trip. I prefer rivers and streams, but I'm also up for lakes or ponds if they're known for good fishing. As for amenities, a boat launch would be nice, but it's not necessary.",
