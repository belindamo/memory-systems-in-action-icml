  "content": "Exciting news about the exhibition! I'd be happy to help you prepare your miniature fantasy creature sculpture for display.\n\n**Title and Description:**\n\nYes, it's a great idea to add a title and description to your piece. This will help viewers understand the context and inspiration behind your sculpture. Consider the following:\n\n* **Title:** Choose a title that's catchy and descriptive, but not too long. This will help grab the viewer's attention and give them an idea of what your sculpture is about.\n* **Description:** Write a brief description (around 1-2 sentences) that provides context about your sculpture. This could include the inspiration behind the piece, the materials used, or any symbolism or themes you've incorporated.\n\n**Display Requirements:**\n\nCheck with your local art studio for specific requirements, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n* **Pedestal or base:** Ensure your sculpture is securely attached to a pedestal or base that's stable and proportional to the piece.\n* **Labeling:** Attach a label or plaque with your name, title, and description to the pedestal or nearby wall.\n* **Lighting:** Consider the lighting in the exhibition space and how it might affect your sculpture. If necessary, ask about lighting options or bring a small spotlight to highlight your piece.\n* **Insurance and security:** Check with the studio about insurance and security measures in place for the exhibition. You may want to consider insuring your piece against damage or loss.\n* **Size and weight:** Ensure your sculpture fits within the studio's size and weight restrictions.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Cleanliness:** Make sure your sculpture is clean and free of dust or debris.\n* **Photography:** Take high-quality photos of your sculpture from multiple angles. This will help you document your work and provide images for promotional materials.\n* **Artist statement:** Prepare a brief artist statement (around 1-2 paragraphs) that discusses your inspiration, creative process, and artistic vision. This can be displayed alongside your sculpture or included in the exhibition catalog.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well-prepared to showcase your miniature fantasy creature sculpture at the exhibition. Good luck, and I hope you receive plenty of positive feedback and interest in your work!",
