  "content": "If Madelyn creates a stalemate, it may be helpful to try and deescalate the situation by taking a break and allowing both of you to cool down. During this time, you can reflect on the situation and your own feelings and try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. When you are ready to communicate, it may be helpful to approach the situation with a willingness to listen and understand Madelyn's perspective, as well as a willingness to express your own feelings and needs in a non-confrontational manner. It may also be helpful to seek the assistance of a couples therapist or mediator if the stalemate persists.",
