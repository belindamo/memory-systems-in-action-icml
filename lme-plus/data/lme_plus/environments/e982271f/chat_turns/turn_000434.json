  "content": "I think I'll start with the books, maybe \"Monet: The Master of Light\" or \"Claude Monet: Life and Art\". I'd like to learn more about his life, especially his relationships and struggles. Speaking of struggles, I was wondering if you know anything about the current exhibits at the City Art Museum. I was there last Saturday with my colleague Rachel from work, and I was impressed by the \"Impressionist Masters\" exhibit. Are there any new exhibits coming up that I should check out?",
