Here's an overview of some common types of dental chews and what makes them effective:\n\n1. **Mechanical chews**: These chews are designed to physically remove plaque and tartar from your cat's teeth through chewing. They often have a rough texture or ridges that help scrub the teeth clean. Examples include rawhide chews, bully sticks, and dental chew toys.\n2. **Enzymatic chews**: These chews contain enzymes that break down proteins and help destroy bacteria in the mouth, reducing plaque and tartar formation. They may also help freshen breath and reduce gingivitis.\n3. **Antimicrobial chews**: These chews contain ingredients that inhibit the growth of bacteria, yeast, and fungi in the mouth, helping to prevent infections and reduce bad breath.\n4. **Abrasive chews**: These chews have a mild abrasive quality that helps remove plaque and tartar from the teeth. They may contain ingredients like silica or calcium carbonate.\n5. **Chews with antimicrobial peptides**: These chews contain short chains of amino acids that have antimicrobial properties, helping to reduce bacteria and promote a healthy oral microbiome.\n6. **Chews with omega-3 fatty acids**: These chews contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce gum inflammation and promote healthy gums.\n7. **Chews with antioxidants**: These chews contain antioxidants like vitamin E or CoQ10, which help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation in the mouth.\n\nWhat makes dental chews effective in promoting oral health?\n\n1. **Regular removal of plaque and tartar**: Dental chews help remove plaque and tartar, which can lead to gingivitis, periodontitis, and other oral health issues if left unchecked.\n2. **Reducing bacteria and inflammation**: Many dental chews contain ingredients that help reduce bacteria, yeast, and fungi in the mouth, which can contribute to bad breath, gum disease, and other oral health problems.\n3. **Promoting healthy gums**: Some dental chews contain ingredients that help reduce inflammation and promote healthy gums, which is essential for maintaining good oral health.\n4. **Freshening breath**: Many dental chews contain ingredients that help freshen breath and leave your cat's mouth smelling fresh and clean.\n\nRemember to always choose a dental chew that's appropriate for your cat's age, size, and oral health needs. It's also essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions for use and to introduce new dental chews gradually to prevent digestive upset.\n\nI hope this information helps you make an informed decision when selecting dental chews for Luna!",
