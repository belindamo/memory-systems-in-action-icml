  "content": "It sounds like Madelyn is still holding onto her anger and is not ready to let go yet. It can be challenging to deal with this kind of response when you're expressing your love and trying to repair the relationship.\n\nOne approach you could take is to continue showing your love and affection for Madelyn without expecting an immediate response from her. Let her know that you understand she's still upset and that you're willing to give her space and time to work through her feelings.\n\nIn the meantime, you can focus on being patient and supportive, and continue to work on yourself and your relationship with Madelyn. It may take time, but with persistence and effort, you can hopefully reach a point where Madelyn feels comfortable and ready to reciprocate your love and affection.",
