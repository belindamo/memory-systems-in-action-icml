  "content": "Sure, here are three revised archetypes that take a more detailed and specific approach:\n\nThe Frustrated User: This archetype represents users who experience frustration when interacting with the Cita Previa website. They may feel overwhelmed or stressed by the process, and may fear missing out on an appointment or losing valuable time. They may also feel a lack of feedback or empathy from the website, which contributes to their frustration. For example, one user we interviewed said, \"I felt lost at one point, and there was no way to reach out for help. I just had to keep going and hope for the best.\"\n\nThe Skeptical User: This archetype represents users who have concerns about the trustworthiness or security of the Cita Previa website. They may fear that the website is a scam or that their personal information is at risk, and may need additional reassurance or evidence of its reliability before they are willing to proceed. One user we interviewed said, \"I had to check twice to make sure this was the right website. It just didn't feel secure to me.\"\n\nThe Time-Constrained User: This archetype represents users who have limited time to spend on the Cita Previa website. They may be looking for a quick and efficient way to book an appointment, and may be frustrated by any delays or obstacles that prolong the process. This archetype includes older users, users with disabilities, and users who prefer to use mobile devices. It also includes foreigners who may be unfamiliar with the website or who do not speak Spanish, as well as tech-savvy users who may have high expectations for the user experience. One user we interviewed said, \"I just wanted to get this over with as quickly as possible, but the website kept asking for more and more information. It felt like a waste of time.\"",
