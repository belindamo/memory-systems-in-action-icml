  "content": "The tone of John Keats' \"Bright Star\" is one of longing and yearning. The speaker of the poem expresses a deep desire to be as constant and unchanging as the star, while recognizing that his own life is filled with change and uncertainty. The speaker also expresses a sense of awe and reverence towards the star and nature. Additionally, there is a hint of melancholic and nostalgic throughout the poem, as the speaker speaks of the passing of time and the transience of life.",
