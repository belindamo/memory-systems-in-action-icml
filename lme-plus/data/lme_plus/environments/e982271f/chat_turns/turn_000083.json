  "content": "It's great that you want to support Madelyn. One of the most important things you can do is to listen to her and validate her feelings. When she expresses her concerns or frustrations, try to understand where she's coming from and let her know that you hear her. It's also important to communicate your own feelings and needs in a respectful and honest way, so that you can work together to find solutions that work for both of you. Additionally, you could offer to help with tasks or responsibilities that she may be feeling overwhelmed by, such as household chores or caring for your children. Small gestures of support and kindness can go a long way in showing that you care and are there for her.",
