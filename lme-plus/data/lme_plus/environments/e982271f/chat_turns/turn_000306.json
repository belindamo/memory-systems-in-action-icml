  "content": "Sure, here are some important quotes from Husserl's works on the topics of intentionality and the method of reduction:\n\nOn intentionality:\n\n* \"Every mental act is directed toward an object, every mental act intends something.\" (Logical Investigations, 1900-1901)\n* \"Consciousness is essentially intentional, meaning that it is always directed towards some object or content.\" (Ideas I, 1913)\n\nOn the method of reduction:\n\n* \"To the things themselves! Back to the things themselves!... We must be brought back to the most basic and primordial way of apprehending things, which is the way of pure intuition.\" (Ideas I, 1913)\n* \"The method of phenomenological reduction ... involves setting aside all assumptions about the objective reality of the world and focusing instead on the subjective experiences that give rise to our knowledge of that world.\" (Ideas II, 1952)\n* \"The goal of phenomenological reduction is to arrive at the essence of consciousness, which is the transcendental ego, the ultimate source of all meaning and intentionality.\" (Cartesian Meditations, 1931)",
