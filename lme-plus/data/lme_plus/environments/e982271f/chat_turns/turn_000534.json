  "content": "\"Bright Star\" is a sonnet written by John Keats in 1819. The poem is often considered one of Keats' most beautiful and expressive works, and is known for its themes of love, beauty, and the transience of life. The poem's speaker addresses a star, asking it to remain constant and unchanging, while the speaker's own life is filled with change and uncertainty. The poem concludes with the lines \"Bright Star! would I were steadfast as thou art\u2014 / Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night, / And watching, with eternal lids apart, / Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite, / The moving waters at their priestlike task / Of pure ablution round earth's human shores, / Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask / Of snow upon the mountains and the moors\u2014 / No\u2014yet still steadfast, still unchangeable, / Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast, / To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, / Awake for ever in a sweet unrest, / Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, / And so live ever\u2014or else swoon to death.\"",
