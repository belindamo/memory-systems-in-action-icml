  "content": "That's a great idea! I think creating a Facebook Group or online community would be a fantastic way to connect with like-minded individuals and share resources and ideas. I'd love to create a space where people can share their own stories, experiences, and perspectives on social activism, and discuss topics related to homelessness, social justice, and community development.\n\nBefore I create the group, I just wanted to ask: do you think I should make the group public or private? I want to make sure that everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences, but at the same time, I want to make sure that the group remains a safe and respectful space.",
