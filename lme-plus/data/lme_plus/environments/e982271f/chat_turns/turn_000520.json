  "content": "The frequency of yoga practice to see results can vary depending on the individual and their goals. However, practicing yoga 2-3 times a week is a good starting point to see some benefits.\n\nIf you're looking to manage your stress levels, consistency is key. By practicing yoga regularly, your body and mind will become more accustomed to the practice, and you can build upon the benefits over time.\n\nIf you're new to yoga, I recommend finding a beginner-level class or tutorial to learn the basics and get started. As you become more comfortable with the practice, you can gradually increase the frequency and duration of your yoga sessions.\n\nRemember, yoga is a personal practice, so it's important to listen to your body and go at your own pace. Start slow and be patient - with time and practice, you'll start to feel the physical and mental benefits of yoga.",
