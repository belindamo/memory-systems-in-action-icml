  "content": "Yes, here are some tips for dealing with group members who are not contributing or distracting others during the study session:\n\n1. Address the behavior directly: One effective approach is to address the issue directly by speaking with the person privately or in a respectful manner during the session. Explain how their behavior is affecting the group's focus and progress. 2. Assign specific tasks: Sometimes, a person may not know how to contribute to the studying process, and assigning specific tasks can help them be more involved. Assign a task to the non-contributing member. 3. Set ground rules: Before starting the group studying session, set ground rules for participation, such as no phones during the session, and everyone must contribute. This way, every member of the group knows what is expected of them. 4. Avoid confrontations: Avoid confrontations or criticizing others. Keep the discussion without being judgmental. 5. Split the group: If the behavior continues to persist, it may be necessary to split the group and continue studying separately. This way, members who want to study can continue without distractions. Each group is unique, so the approach that works may differ depending on the group dynamics. However, these are some effective strategies for dealing with non-contributing or distracting group members.",
