Here are some tips on what to check and replace to help you get back to 30 miles per gallon in the city:\n\n**Air Filter:**\nA dirty air filter can decrease fuel efficiency by up to 20%. Check and replace your air filter if it's dirty or clogged. A new air filter can improve your gas mileage by up to 10%.\n\n**Spark Plugs:**\nWorn out spark plugs can decrease fuel efficiency and engine performance. If your spark plugs are old or fouled, consider replacing them with new ones. Spark plug replacement can improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.\n\n**Fuel Filter:**\nA clogged fuel filter can restrict fuel flow, leading to decreased fuel efficiency. Check and replace your fuel filter if it's dirty or clogged.\n\n**Tire Pressure:**\nProperly inflated tires can improve fuel efficiency by up to 3%. Check your tire pressure at least once a month, and before long trips. Use a tire pressure gauge to ensure the pressure matches the recommended level, as specified in your owner's manual.\n\n**Oil Change:**\nRegular oil changes are essential for engine health and fuel efficiency. Make sure to use the recommended oil type and viscosity for your vehicle. A dirty engine can decrease fuel efficiency, so consider a fuel injector cleaning or engine flush if you haven't had one recently.\n\n**Belts and Hoses:**\nCracked or worn-out belts and hoses can cause engine damage and decrease fuel efficiency. Inspect your serpentine belt, timing belt, and hoses for signs of wear. Replace them if necessary.\n\n**Oxygen Sensor:**\nA faulty oxygen sensor can cause your engine to run rich, decreasing fuel efficiency. If your oxygen sensor is old or faulty, consider replacing it.\n\n**Fuel System Cleaning:**\nA fuel system cleaning can help remove deposits and dirt that can decrease fuel efficiency. You can use a fuel injector cleaner or have a professional mechanic perform a fuel system cleaning.\n\n**Idle Time:**\nIf your car is idling for extended periods, it can decrease fuel efficiency. Try to avoid idling for more than 30 seconds, and consider turning off your engine if you're going to be stopped for an extended period.\n\n**Driving Habits:**\nYour driving habits can significantly impact fuel efficiency. Here are some tips to improve your driving habits:\n\n* Accelerate smoothly and avoid sudden acceleration.\n* Maintain a consistent speed, especially on the highway.\n* Avoid carrying extra weight in your car.\n* Use cruise control (if available).\n* Combine errands and avoid short trips.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure your gas cap is tight to prevent fuel evaporation.\n* Remove any unnecessary accessories that can decrease fuel efficiency, such as roof racks or bike carriers.\n* Consider using fuel-efficient driving modes (if available) or adjusting your driving style to improve fuel efficiency.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to improve your car's fuel efficiency and get back to 30 miles per gallon in the city. Remember to always refer to your owner's manual for specific recommendations and guidelines for your vehicle.",
