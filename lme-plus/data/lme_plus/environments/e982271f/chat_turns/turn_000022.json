  "content": "Yeah, Alex's feedback was super helpful! I was able to work on my cornering and braking techniques, and I noticed a big improvement in my lap times towards the end of the day. I was also able to carry more speed through the turns and feel more confident in my car's abilities.\n\nAs for the track itself, Sonoma Raceway is an amazing facility! The elevation changes were definitely challenging, but it was a lot of fun to drive. I especially enjoyed the carousel turn and the esses section. The track has a great flow to it, and it's a lot of fun to push your car to the limit.",
