Here's more information to help you prepare:\n\n**Hike Details:**\n\n* **Distance:** The hike is approximately 2-3 miles round-trip, depending on how far upstream you want to go.\n* **Elevation Gain:** You'll gain about 500-700 feet in elevation, which can be challenging, especially with gear.\n* **Terrain:** The trail is a mix of moderate to steep inclines, with some rocky and uneven terrain. You'll need to navigate through dense forest, cross small streams, and climb over rocks and logs.\n* **Time:** Plan for 2-4 hours to complete the hike, depending on your pace and how much time you spend fishing.\n\n**Gear Recommendations:**\n\n* **Hiking Boots:** Sturdy, waterproof hiking boots with good tread are essential for this hike. You'll encounter rough terrain, and ankle support is crucial.\n* **Waders or Wading Boots:** If you plan to wade in the stream, bring waders or wading boots with good grip to prevent slipping on rocks.\n* **Fishing Gear:** Pack light, but bring the essentials: rod, reel, line, lures or flies, and a net. Consider a collapsible rod or a tenkara rod to make hiking easier.\n* **Backpack:** Bring a comfortable backpack with enough space for your gear, water, snacks, and layers. Look for one with hip belt pockets for easy access to your gear.\n* **Clothing:** Dress in layers, as the temperature can drop significantly in the mountains. Bring a waterproof jacket, insulating layers, and a hat.\n* **First Aid Kit:** A small first aid kit with essentials like bandages, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers is always a good idea.\n* **Water and Snacks:** Bring enough water and snacks to keep you energized throughout the hike and fishing session.\n* **Map and Compass:** Even with a GPS device, it's always a good idea to bring a map and compass as a backup.\n* **Sunscreen and Insect Repellent:** Protect yourself from the sun and insects with SPF 30 or higher sunscreen and DEET-based insect repellent.\n\n**Tips and Precautions:**\n\n* **Physical Condition:** Make sure you're physically prepared for the hike. If you're new to hiking or have health concerns, consider shorter, easier trails or consulting with a doctor.\n* **Weather:** Check the weather forecast before you go and be prepared for changing conditions. Avoid hiking during thunderstorms or heavy rain.\n* **Stream Conditions:** Be mindful of the stream's water level and flow. Avoid wading during high water or strong currents.\n* **Private Property:** Be respectful of private property and posted signs. Make sure you're fishing in public areas or have permission to access private land.\n* **Leave No Trace:** Practice responsible outdoor ethics by taking out what you bring in, respecting the environment, and not disturbing the natural habitat.\n\nBy being prepared and taking necessary precautions, you'll be able to enjoy a fantastic fishing experience in the mountain stream. Remember to stay safe, have fun, and respect the environment!",
