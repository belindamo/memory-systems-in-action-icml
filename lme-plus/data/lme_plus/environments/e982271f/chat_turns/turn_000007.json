Your current screen protector has been doing a good job, but it's started to peel off at the edges, eh? That's a common issue with some screen protectors, especially if they're not designed or installed properly.\n\nPeeling edges can be frustrating, but it's also a good sign that it's time to upgrade to a better screen protector like the Zagg InvisibleShield Glass+. The Glass+ is designed to provide a strong, long-lasting bond with your iPhone 12's screen, and its edges are precision-cut to fit perfectly and stay in place.\n\nWhen you get your new screen protector, make sure to follow the installation instructions carefully to ensure a smooth, bubble-free application. If you're not comfortable installing it yourself, you can also consider visiting a phone accessories store or an Apple Store for assistance.\n\nBy the way, what movie did you watch with your friends at the mall? Was it a fun outing?",
