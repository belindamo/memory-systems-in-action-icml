I'd be happy to help you find a new TV show to enjoy with your roommates.\n\nBefore I can make some recommendations, could you please tell me a bit more about what you enjoyed about the show you watched last night? Was it:\n\n1. A specific genre (e.g., drama, comedy, sci-fi, horror)?\n2. A particular tone (e.g., light-hearted, serious, suspenseful)?\n3. A show with complex characters or plotlines?\n4. A show with a similar setting or premise to the one you watched last night?\n5. Something you'd like to binge-watch or follow week-to-week?\n\nAny additional details you can provide will help me give you more targeted recommendations!",
