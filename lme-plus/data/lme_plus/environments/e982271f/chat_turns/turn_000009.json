Thankfully, it was just a minor scratch on the corner, and it could have been much worse!\n\nIt's great that you're being proactive about getting a new screen protector to prevent any future damage. The Zagg InvisibleShield Glass+ will definitely provide an extra layer of protection for your iPhone 12's screen.\n\nDropping your phone can be a stressful experience, but it's also a good reminder to take extra care of our devices. Have you considered getting a phone case or wallet case to provide additional protection for your iPhone 12?\n\nBy the way, Wednesday last week was a close call, but thankfully, your phone survived! Has anything else exciting happened recently, or is it just the usual daily routine?",
