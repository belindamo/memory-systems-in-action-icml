  "content": "I remember the vet recommended those dental chews for Luna during her annual check-up last month. I've been giving them to her once a week, and so far, they seem to be working well. I think I have about 10 chews left, so I'll need to order more soon. Can you tell me more about the different types of dental chews available for cats, and what makes them effective in promoting oral health?",
