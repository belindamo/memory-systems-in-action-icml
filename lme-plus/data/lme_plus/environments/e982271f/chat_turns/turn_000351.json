  "content": "Chemical engineers can ensure that new materials they develop are safe and environmentally sustainable while meeting the needs of medical or energy applications by following these steps:\n\n1. Starting with green chemistry principles: Chemical engineers can use green chemistry principles while designing materials that are safe, environmentally sustainable, and cost-effective. These principles focus on using environmentally friendly materials and reducing the use of hazardous chemicals.\n\n2. Conducting thorough environmental and safety assessments: Chemical engineers must conduct comprehensive environmental and safety assessments before introducing new materials into the market. These assessments analyze the potential environmental and health impacts of the materials and evaluate their sustainability.\n\n3. Compliance with regulatory standards: Chemical engineers must ensure that their new materials meet all technical, environmental, and health requirements and comply with regulatory standards established by the government and industry.\n\n4. Collaborating with interdisciplinary teams: Chemical engineers must collaborate with teams of environmental scientists, toxicologists, and other professionals to ensure that their materials are safe for human and environmental health.\n\n5. Life cycle analysis: Chemical engineers analyze the life cycle of their materials, including raw material sourcing, production, and eventual disposal or recycling, to ensure sustainable practices across the entire life cycle.\n\nBy following these steps, chemical engineers can ensure that new materials they develop are safe, environmentally sustainable, and meet the needs of medical or energy applications.",
