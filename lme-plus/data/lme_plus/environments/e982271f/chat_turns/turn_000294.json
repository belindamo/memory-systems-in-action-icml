  "content": "The food! It was actually the combination of flavors and the variety of options they had. They had a mix of classic Asian dishes with some modern twists, and everything we ordered was delicious. The portions were also really generous, so we ended up sharing a few dishes and trying a bit of everything. The atmosphere was also really lively and fun, it was a great spot to hang out with friends.",
