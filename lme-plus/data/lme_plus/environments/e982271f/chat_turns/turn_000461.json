  "content": "Yes, there have been some measures taken to rectify the situation of the Chicago Parking Meter Lease Deal, but it has been challenging to navigate fully.\n\nTo address the adverse effects of the PPP deal, the City of Chicago renegotiated with private investors in 2013, impacting the parking meters' operational structure. Under the new agreement, the city had more control over free parking zones and reducing parking fines. The deal was also made public so that residents could see the details of the agreement.\n\nThe City of Chicago's decision to renegotiate the lease deal in 2013 was an attempt to strike a better deal for the people. However, the renegotiated deal still faced criticism as it lacked sufficient public input in the negotiation process, and it did not ameliorate the adverse effects of the original lease.\n\nTo make matters worse, the City of Chicago faced challenges when it tried to repurchase the lease. In 2017, the city council approved the purchase of the parking meter assets for $1.3 billion, but the consortium of private investors challenged the purchase price in court. While this process was eventually resolved, the prolonged court battle resulted in Chicago taxpayers having to pay millions of dollars in legal fees.\n\nIn conclusion, while there have been attempts to rectify the situation of the Chicago Parking Meter Lease Deal, it has not been an easy process as PPPs involve complex contractual arrangements. The situation emphasizes the need to carefully evaluate and design PPPs before entering into them, and the necessity for transparency and public consultation in the negotiation process.",
