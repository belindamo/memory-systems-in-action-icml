It's a modern classic, and many people's gateway to the world of modern board gaming.\n\nAzul is a fantastic game for many reasons. The gameplay is easy to learn, but it has a lot of depth and strategy. The mechanic of collecting and placing tiles to create beautiful mosaics is very engaging, and the game has a great balance of short-term and long-term planning.\n\nIf you enjoyed Azul, you might also like other games that share similar qualities. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Sagrada**: Another tile-laying game, but this time with a dice-drafting mechanic. You build a beautiful stained-glass window by drafting and placing dice.\n2. **Star Realms**: A space-themed deck-building game where you compete against your opponents to destroy their fleets. Easy to learn, but with a lot of depth.\n3. **Pandemic**: Work together with your friends to stop the spread of diseases and save the world. A great cooperative game that's all about teamwork and strategy.\n4. **Carcassonne**: A classic tile-laying game where you build a medieval landscape, placing tiles to create roads, cities, and fields.\n5. **7 Wonders**: A card-drafting game where you build up your civilization by collecting cards that represent different structures, technologies, and military units.\n\nThese games all have a similar feel to Azul in terms of their accessibility and depth. Of course, there are many more games out there, but these are some popular ones that are easy to learn and fun to play.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you interested in exploring more games like Azul, or do you have a different direction in mind?",
