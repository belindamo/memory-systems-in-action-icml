Here are some pros and cons of each option to help you make an informed decision:\n\n**Public Group:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Increased visibility**: A public group is visible to everyone on Facebook, making it easier for people to find and join.\n2. **Easy to share**: Members can easily share the group with others, which can help grow the community.\n3. **Transparency**: A public group can demonstrate your commitment to transparency and openness.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Lack of control**: You may have less control over who joins the group and what content is shared.\n2. **Trolling or spam**: Public groups can be vulnerable to trolls or spammers, which can create a negative environment.\n3. **Privacy concerns**: Members may be hesitant to share personal stories or experiences in a public forum.\n\n**Private Group:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Control over membership**: You can control who joins the group and ensure that only like-minded individuals are part of the community.\n2. **Safe space**: A private group can provide a safe space for members to share their thoughts and experiences without fear of judgment or retribution.\n3. **Moderation**: You can moderate the content and ensure that the group remains a respectful and positive environment.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Limited visibility**: A private group is not visible to everyone on Facebook, which can make it harder for people to find and join.\n2. **Invitation-only**: Members need to be invited to join, which can limit the group's growth.\n\nConsidering your goals and the sensitive nature of the topics you'll be discussing, I would recommend creating a **private group**. This will allow you to maintain a safe and respectful space for members to share their thoughts and experiences. You can always adjust the group settings to allow members to invite others or share the group with their networks, while still maintaining control over the membership and content.\n\nAdditionally, you can set up a clear set of guidelines and rules for the group, such as:\n\n* Respectful dialogue and engagement\n* No hate speech or discriminatory language\n* No self-promotion or spamming\n* Confidentiality and discretion when sharing personal stories\n\nBy setting clear expectations and maintaining a private group, you can create a safe and supportive community for like-minded individuals to share their thoughts and experiences.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards creating a public or private group for #MakeADifferenceMV?",
