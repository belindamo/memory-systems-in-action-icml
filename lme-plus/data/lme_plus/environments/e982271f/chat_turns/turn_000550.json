Here are some advice to help you apply the medication with ease:\n\n1. **Choose a quiet and comfortable spot**: Find a quiet, comfortable spot where Max feels relaxed and secure. This will help reduce stress and make the application process easier.\n2. **Prepare everything in advance**: Have the medication, applicator, and any other necessary supplies ready to go before starting the application process.\n3. **Use treats and praise**: Reward Max with treats and praise during and after the application process to associate it with positive experiences.\n4. **Apply at the right spot**: Make sure to apply the medication at the correct spot, usually between the shoulder blades or at the base of the neck, depending on the product's instructions.\n5. **Use the correct technique**: Follow the product's instructions for application, and use the correct technique to ensure the medication is applied evenly and effectively.\n6. **Be gentle and patient**: Move slowly and gently when applying the medication, and be patient with Max if he gets anxious or uncomfortable.\n7. **Distract and redirect**: If Max starts to get anxious or tries to lick the application site, distract him with a treat or toy, and redirect his attention.\n8. **Make it a routine**: Try to apply the medication at the same time every month, so Max gets used to the routine and it becomes a normal part of his care.\n\nSome popular flea and tick prevention products come in different forms, such as topical treatments, oral medications, or collars. Be sure to follow the product's instructions and consult with your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your veterinarian to choose the right flea and tick prevention medication for Max and to ensure you're using it correctly.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.
