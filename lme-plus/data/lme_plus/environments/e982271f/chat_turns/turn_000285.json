  "content": "I apologize for not quite hitting the mark with my previous suggestions. Here are some more unconventional and alternative attractions in Savannah:\n\n1. Starland District - This up-and-coming neighborhood is known for its artsy vibe, vintage shops, and hip bars and restaurants. Check out the Starlandia Supply art store and the Wormhole music venue.\n\n2. The Graveface Museum - This museum showcases the weird and macabre, with exhibits on taxidermy, vintage horror films, and oddities.\n\n3. Ghost Coast Distillery - Visit this distillery for a behind-the-scenes tour, a tasting of their award-winning spirits, and a delicious meal at their accompanying restaurant, The Skeleton Key.\n\n4. The DeSoto Savannah Rooftop Bar - Enjoy a drink while taking in the stunning views of Savannah from this stylish rooftop bar. Check out their weekly events, including live music and rooftop yoga.\n\n5. The Savannah Bee Company - Yes, I already mentioned this honey shop, but did you know they also offer mead tastings and classes? Mead is an ancient alcoholic beverage made from honey and water that's gaining popularity as a craft drink.\n\n6. Savannah's Street Art - Take a self-guided tour of Savannah's street art scene, with colorful murals and graffiti art on buildings and walls throughout the city.\n\n7. The Escape Company - Another escape room experience, but this one offers virtual reality and augmented reality elements for an even more immersive experience.\n\nI hope one of these suggestions is more to your liking!",
