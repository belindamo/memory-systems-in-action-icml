I've heard the Blue Mountains are a must-visit, but I'm not sure how to get there from the city. Can you help me with that? By the way, I'm planning to take a red-eye flight, so I'm glad I've developed a habit of packing a small pouch of essentials like eye mask, earplugs, and melatonin to help me sleep better.",
