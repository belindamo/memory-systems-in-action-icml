  "content": "The adjustments outlined in my previous answer match several key business-cycle stylized facts.\n\nFirstly, the immediate increase in output following a positive TFP shock matches the observed fact that output tends to rise during expansions and fall during recessions.\n\nSecondly, the delayed response in consumption matches the observed fact that consumption tends to be smoother than output, as consumers adjust their spending gradually in response to changes in income.\n\nThirdly, the increase in investment and hours worked matches the observed fact that investment and hours tend to be procyclical, rising during expansions and falling during recessions.\n\nHowever, the adjustments do not fully capture other important business-cycle stylized facts, such as the fact that the volatility of output tends to be higher than the volatility of other macroeconomic variables, or the fact that the labor market tends to exhibit stickiness in terms of both wages and employment.",
