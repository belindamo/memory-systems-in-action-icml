By the way, I recently attended a meetup at the local autoshop, called \"Racking Up the Miles\", where we discussed our experiences and shared tips on car maintenance. I met a mechanic who offered to give me some pointers on fine-tuning my engine, and I've been meaning to follow up with him to schedule a meetup. Do you think it's a good idea to get a professional's input on fine-tuning my engine before taking it to the track?",
