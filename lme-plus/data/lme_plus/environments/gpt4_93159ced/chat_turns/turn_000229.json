  "content": "The assumption of habit formation in consumption in the RBC model is that individuals' current consumption levels are affected by their past consumption levels, and not just their current income. This implies that individuals have a preference for consumption smoothing, and are averse to large and sudden changes in their consumption. Specifically, the RBC model assumes that individuals have a utility function that is a function of both current consumption and past consumption levels, with the weight on past consumption being determined by a parameter that captures the degree of habit formation.",
