  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot speak for individual developers or their motives. It is safe to assume that developers are interested in making a profit from the development of the site, but it does not necessarily mean that they do not care about preserving the solemnity of the site. Developers should balance the commercial development of the site with the preservation of the memory of the victims of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nFurthermore, there are several stakeholders involved in the development of the World Trade Center district, including the families of the victims, survivors, and local residents, who contribute to the planning process to ensure that the appropriate balance between commemoration and commercial development is maintained. Ultimately, the success of the site will depend on the ability to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders and create a new space that both honors the victims of the 9/11 attacks while also being a positive economic and social asset for the city.",
