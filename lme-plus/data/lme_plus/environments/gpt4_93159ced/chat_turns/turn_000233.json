  "content": "The \"catching up with the Joneses\" effect assumes that an individual's utility depends not only on their own consumption but also on the consumption of others in their reference group. While this assumption may have some basis in reality, it is not typically included in the standard RBC model. The RBC model assumes that agents are rational and forward-looking, but their utility function depends only on their own consumption and leisure choices, not on the consumption choices of others. Therefore, the \"catching up with the Joneses\" effect is not a standard assumption in the RBC model, and its inclusion would require modifying the basic model. However, some extensions to the RBC model have been proposed to incorporate social comparisons and relative consumption effects.",
