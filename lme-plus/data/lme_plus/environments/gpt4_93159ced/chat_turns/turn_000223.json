  "content": "The adjustments in your answer capture several important business-cycle stylized facts. First, the immediate increase in output following the TFP shock is consistent with the fact that output tends to increase sharply in the early stages of a business cycle expansion. Second, the delayed response in consumption is consistent with the observation that consumption is smoother than output over the business cycle. Third, the increase in investment and hours worked are consistent with the fact that investment and hours worked tend to be procyclical, meaning they rise in the expansion phase of the business cycle. Fourth, the temporary nature of the TFP shock and the eventual return to a new steady state are consistent with the fact that business cycles are typically characterized by short-lived fluctuations around a long-run trend. However, the adjustments do not capture all of the stylized facts of business cycles, such as the fact that recessions tend to be deeper and more prolonged than expansions, or the fact that output tends to be more volatile than other macroeconomic variables.",
