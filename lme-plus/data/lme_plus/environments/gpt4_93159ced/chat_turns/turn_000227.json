  "content": "The presence of habits in consumption is expected to dampen the impact of a positive TFP shock on output in the short run. The permanent income hypothesis suggests that consumers smooth their consumption over time, based on their permanent income rather than their transitory income. Therefore, if income increases due to a TFP shock, consumers will only gradually adjust their consumption patterns, leading to a delayed and less pronounced response of consumption to the shock.\n\nThis delayed response in consumption dampens the effect of the TFP shock on output because the increase in investment and output is partly driven by increased consumption. When consumption does not respond immediately to the shock, the increase in output will be smaller than it would be in the absence of habits.\n\nAdditionally, habits in consumption imply that consumers are more sensitive to changes in permanent income than to changes in transitory income. Therefore, the dampening effect of habits on output is expected to be more significant in the short run than in the long run, as the transitory increase in output and consumption resulting from the TFP shock will eventually fade away, leaving only the permanent increase in output that will be reflected in higher consumption levels.",
