  "content": "The \"catching up with the Joneses\" effect is not typically included in the standard RBC model, even with the presented utility function. This is because the RBC model assumes that all agents have the same preferences and that they maximize their own utility given the available resources and constraints. The assumption of homogeneous agents with identical preferences is a simplifying assumption made to make the model more tractable and easier to solve.\n\nThe presented utility function, which includes the consumption of the reference group, introduces heterogeneity in preferences across agents. This makes the model more complex and difficult to solve. Therefore, while the presented utility function may be more realistic in some sense, it is not commonly used in the standard RBC model.",
