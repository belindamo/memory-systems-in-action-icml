  "content": "I plan to approach this project by first collecting and preprocessing the data, then feature engineering, followed by model development, evaluation, and deployment. I have some experience working with EHRs during my research internship at UC Berkeley, but I've never worked with wearable device data before. I'm excited to explore this new aspect and learn more about it.\n\nBefore we dive deeper into the project, I'd like to ask: What are some common challenges when working with EHRs and wearable device data, and how can we address them?",
