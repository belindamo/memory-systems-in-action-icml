  "content": "I'm planning to incorporate these plyometric exercises into my strength training routine, focusing on 2-3 times a week. I'll make sure to start with lower heights and progress gradually, while also focusing on quick turnaround and explosive movement. I'll also prioritize proper landing techniques to reduce the impact on my joints. Do you have any recommendations for how to structure my strength training routine, in terms of the exercises, sets, reps, and rest days?",
