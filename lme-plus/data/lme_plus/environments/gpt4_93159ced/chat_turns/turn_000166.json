  "content": "Yes, South Africa has faced some other trade policy challenges regarding AGOA in recent years. \n\nIn 2018, the Trump administration announced that it would review South Africa's AGOA eligibility due to concerns over its land reform policies. The US was concerned that a proposed constitutional amendment allowing expropriation of land without compensation could negatively affect American investors' property rights in South Africa. This led to uncertainty about South Africa's continued eligibility for AGOA benefits.\n\nIn response, the South African government reiterated its commitment to property rights and clarified its plans for land reform. These efforts alleviated concerns, and in 2019, the US government renewed South Africa's eligibility under AGOA.\n\nThis situation highlights how changes in trade policies can be influenced by political and social factors in addition to purely economic considerations.",
