  "content": "While treating everyone equally is a noble concept, the reality is that it\u2019s not always practical, achievable, or fair. In an ideal world, people of all races and backgrounds would receive equal treatment, opportunities, and access to resources. Unfortunately, that is not the case in our society.\n\nSystemic racism refers to deeply ingrained biases and policies that were initially created to promote and benefit one race or group of people while marginalizing others. These biases and policies have created intergenerational disparities that continue to impact people of color today. Inherited poverty, undervalued labor, and debt through education are but a few examples.\n\nEven when we offer equal opportunities to everyone, our biases and inherent stereotypes impact our judgment, as has been proven by a massive number of studies over the years in hiring practices, promotions, academic opportunities, and salaries.\n\nWhen we focus on race, we can identify where disparities exist and work together to create solutions to address them effectively. It is necessary to understand how our current and historical policies have impacted people of color to recognize the different layers of privilege and oppression we all carry into our social interactions consciously or unconsciously. Employing strategies like diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, education, and training programs can help break down a system of structural disadvantages that people of color face.\n\nIn conclusion, treating everyone equally and letting \"meritocracy rule\" is an ideal, but it's far from the reality in which we live. To address systemic racism effectively, we must face our inherent biases around race and make a conscious commitment to create policies, goals, and initiatives that help to encourage a more inclusive and equitable society.",
