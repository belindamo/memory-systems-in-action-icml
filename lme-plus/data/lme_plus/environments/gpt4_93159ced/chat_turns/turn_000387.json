Apple News and The Skimm are both excellent options for staying informed without getting overwhelmed.\n\n**Setting a specific time to check the news:**\n\nSetting a specific time to check the news can be a great strategy for several reasons:\n\n1. **Reduces mindless scrolling**: By designating a specific time to check the news, you're less likely to mindlessly scroll through social media or news apps throughout the day.\n2. **Helps establish a routine**: Checking the news at the same time every day can become a habit, making it easier to stay informed without feeling overwhelmed.\n3. **Allows for focused attention**: When you dedicate a specific time to checking the news, you can give it your full attention, rather than trying to quickly scan headlines while doing other things.\n\n**Pros of checking in whenever you feel like it:**\n\n1. **Flexibility**: Checking the news whenever you feel like it can be convenient and flexible, especially if you have a busy schedule.\n2. **Reduced anxiety**: If you're worried about missing important news or updates, checking in whenever you feel like it can help alleviate that anxiety.\n\n**Ultimately, it's up to you:**\n\nYou can experiment with both approaches and see what works best for your lifestyle and preferences. If you find that you're constantly worrying about missing news or feeling anxious about staying informed, setting a specific time to check the news might be a better approach. On the other hand, if you prefer a more flexible schedule and don't mind checking in whenever you have a few minutes, that can work too.\n\n**Tips for setting a specific time to check the news:**\n\n1. **Choose a consistent time**: Pick a time that works for you, such as during your morning coffee, lunch break, or right before bed.\n2. **Set a reminder**: Set a reminder on your phone or put it in your calendar to ensure you don't forget.\n3. **Keep it brief**: Limit your news-checking time to a specific duration, such as 15-30 minutes, to avoid getting sucked into a news rabbit hole.\n4. **Take breaks**: Consider taking breaks from the news on weekends or days off to give yourself a mental break.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a approach that works for you and your mental health. Experiment, adjust, and prioritize self-care!",
