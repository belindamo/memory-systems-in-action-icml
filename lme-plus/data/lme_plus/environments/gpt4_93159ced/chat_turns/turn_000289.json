The Korean independence movement was a significant period in Korean history, spanning from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. During this time, Korea was occupied by Japan, and the Korean people fought for independence and self-governance.\n\nThe movement was marked by various struggles, including:\n\n1. **Resistance against Japanese colonial rule**: Koreans resisted Japanese occupation through armed rebellions, protests, and civil disobedience.\n2. **Nationalist movements**: Korean nationalists sought to promote Korean culture, language, and identity, which were suppressed by the Japanese.\n3. **International support**: The Korean independence movement gained international support, particularly from the United States, China, and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe movement ultimately led to Korea's independence on August 15, 1945, when Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers. This date is celebrated as Liberation Day in Korea.\n\nYour volunteer experience at the cultural center will likely provide you with a deeper understanding of this period in Korean history and its significance in shaping the country's identity and culture.\n\nRemember to ask questions, be open-minded, and soak up as much knowledge as possible during your volunteer experience. It will undoubtedly enrich your trip to Korea and your connection to your heritage.",
