Here are some options to consider:\n\n1. **Beeswax wraps:** Beeswax wraps are a popular alternative to plastic wrap.

You can use them to cover bowls, wrap snacks, and store leftovers.\n2. **Reusable silicone bags:** Silicone bags are a great option for storing food and snacks. They're flexible, easy to clean, and can be used multiple times. Look for ones made from food-grade silicone and BPA-free materials.\n3. **Glass containers:** Glass containers are a fantastic alternative to plastic containers. They're non-porous, easy to clean, and can be used for both hot and cold foods. Pyrex and Mason jars are popular options.\n4. **Mason jars with reusable lids:** Mason jars are a great option for storing dry goods, and reusable lids made from silicone or stainless steel can replace traditional plastic lids.\n5. **Stainless steel containers:** Stainless steel containers are durable, non-toxic, and easy to clean.

They're reusable and can be washed and dried multiple times.\n7. **Compostable bags:** Compostable bags made from plant-based materials like cornstarch or sugarcane are biodegradable and compostable. They're a great option for storing food waste or wrapping snacks.\n8. **Parchment paper:** Parchment paper is a sustainable alternative to plastic wrap for wrapping food. Look for unbleached and non-waxed parchment paper.\n9. **Reusable snack bags:** Reusable snack bags made from materials like cotton, mesh, or nylon are perfect for packing snacks on-the-go.\n10. **Food Huggers:** Food Huggers are silicone covers that fit over bowls and containers to keep food fresh.
