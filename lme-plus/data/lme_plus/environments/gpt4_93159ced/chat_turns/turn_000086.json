Great to hear that you have a positive experience with online learning.\n\nThere are many excellent online resources for deep learning, and I'd be happy to recommend some highly rated platforms and courses by professionals in the field. Here are a few:\n\n**Platforms:**\n\n1. **Coursera**: Partnered with top universities like Stanford and University of Michigan (go Blue!), Coursera offers a wide range of deep learning courses, including Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.\n2. **edX**: Founded by MIT and Harvard, edX offers a variety of deep learning courses, including those from leading institutions like MIT, Stanford, and UC Berkeley.\n3. **Udemy**: While not exclusively focused on deep learning, Udemy has a large collection of courses on the topic, with many highly rated options.\n4. **fast.ai**: Founded by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas, fast.ai offers a range of deep learning courses, including the popular \"Deep Learning for Computer Vision\" course.\n\n**Courses:**\n\n1. **Deep Learning Specialization** (Coursera): Taught by Andrew Ng, this specialization covers the basics of deep learning and is a great starting point.\n2. **Deep Learning for Computer Vision** (fast.ai): This course focuses on computer vision applications of deep learning and is known for its practical, hands-on approach.\n3. **Deep Learning with Python** (DataCamp): This interactive course teaches deep learning using Python and the Keras library.\n4. **Deep Learning A-Z** (Udemy): This course covers a wide range of deep learning topics, from basics to advanced techniques.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n1. **Kaggle**: A platform for machine learning competitions and hosting datasets, Kaggle also offers tutorials, courses, and a community forum for deep learning enthusiasts.\n2. **TensorFlow Tutorials** (Google): Official tutorials for TensorFlow, a popular open-source deep learning framework.\n3. **PyTorch Tutorials** (Facebook): Official tutorials for PyTorch, another popular deep learning framework.\n4. **Deep Learning Book** (Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville): A free online book that provides a comprehensive introduction to deep learning.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Start with the basics: If you're new to deep learning, begin with courses that cover the fundamentals, such as Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course or the Deep Learning Specialization.\n2. Practice is key: Deep learning requires hands-on experience, so make sure to practice with projects and exercises.\n3. Join online communities: Participate in online forums like Kaggle, Reddit (r/MachineLearning and r/DeepLearning), and GitHub to connect with other learners and stay updated on the latest developments.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your deep learning journey!",
