  "content": "The highest mountain peak in Baja California is Picacho del Diablo, which stands at 10,157 feet (3,096 meters) tall. The time it takes to hike to the summit varies depending on the route, experience level, and physical fitness of the hiker. Generally, it takes around 2-3 days to reach the peak and return to the starting point. The most common route is the \"standard\" route which starts from Rancho Meling and takes around 16-20 hours round trip. It is recommended to hire a local guide, and to bring plenty of water and appropriate gear for the harsh terrain and weather conditions.",
