  "content": "The Alpine Pedal Path is a wonderful route for a family ride.\n\nFor bike rentals and services, I highly recommend **Bear Valley Bikes** in Big Bear Lake. They're a local, family-owned shop with a great reputation for friendly service and knowledgeable staff. They offer a wide range of bike rentals, including hybrid, mountain, and kids' bikes, as well as trailers and tag-alongs for younger riders.\n\nBear Valley Bikes is conveniently located near the North Shore Recreation Area, where the Alpine Pedal Path starts. They're open seven days a week during the summer season, and you can reserve bikes online in advance to ensure availability.\n\nIf you need any bike repairs or adjustments, their mechanics are experienced and can get you back on the trail quickly.\n\nSome other bike shops in the area include:\n\n* **Big Bear Lake Bike Shop**: Located in the heart of Big Bear Lake, they offer bike rentals, sales, and service.\n* **Chain Gang Bike Shop**: In nearby Fawnskin, they offer bike rentals, sales, and service, as well as guided bike tours.\n\nHowever, Bear Valley Bikes is my top recommendation due to their excellent customer service and convenient location.\n\nBefore you head to the bike shop, I recommend calling ahead to confirm their hours, availability, and rental options. You can also ask about any discounts or packages they might offer for families or longer rentals.\n\nNow that you have a route and a bike shop, you're all set for a fantastic family bike ride in Big Bear Lake! Enjoy your ride and the beautiful scenery!",
