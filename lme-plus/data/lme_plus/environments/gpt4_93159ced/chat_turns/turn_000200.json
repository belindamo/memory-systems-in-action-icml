The specific documents needed may vary depending on the provider, but here are some common ones:\n\n1. **Government-issued ID with your new name**: Your updated driver's license with your new name, Emily Joy Thompson, is a great start! If you have a passport, you can also use that.\n2. **Court order or marriage certificate**: If your name change is due to marriage, divorce, or a court-ordered name change, you may need to provide a certified copy of the relevant document.\n3. **Social Security Administration (SSA) documentation**: You may need to provide proof that your name has been updated with the SSA, such as a new Social Security card or a receipt showing your name change is in process.\n\nIt's a good idea to check with your student loan provider directly to confirm their specific requirements. You can contact their customer service department via phone, email, or online chat (if available). They may have an online portal where you can upload the required documents or provide additional guidance on what to submit.\n\nWhen you reach out, be prepared to provide your:\n\n* Old name (if it's still on file with the loan provider)\n* New name (Emily Joy Thompson)\n* Loan account number or identification number\n* A brief explanation of the reason for the name change (e.g., marriage, divorce, court-ordered name change)\n\nOnce you've submitted the required documents, your student loan provider will update your account with your new name.\n\nRemember to also update your name with other relevant institutions, such as your bank, credit card company, and any other creditors or service providers.",
