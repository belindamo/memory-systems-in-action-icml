Our ecosystem includes a B2B marketplace that connects regenerative farmers with businesses, a B2C marketplace that encourages innovation and collaboration among stakeholders, a Project Management Platform, and a Data Managment Platform that uses data to measure and validate the impact of regenerative practices. Our Fresh Earth Token represents fractional ownership of the ecosystem and is valued based on the assets of the ecosystem and the impact of regenerative projects. This creates a positive feedback loop where the success of the ecosystem drives more investment, leading to more impact and greater value for the token holders. Join us in our mission to create a regenerative food system that benefits \n\nExecutive Summary\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is a revolutionary solution for transforming the agri-food industry and addressing the pressing issues of climate change, health, and food security. At the core of the ecosystem is the Fresh Earth Token, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the food ecosystem business. The token represents fractional ownership of the ecosystem, and is valued based on both the value of the ecosystem's assets and the future impact of regenerative projects on the environment and society. The Fresh Earth ecosystem is designed to incentivize participation and engagement through a variety of different Incentive Drivers and includes a B2B and B2C marketplace, a Project Management Platform, a Data Managment Platform, and a Rewards System. The ecosystem aims to provide a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume, while also promoting sustainable practices and addressing the pressing issues of climate change, health, and food security.\n\n1.

Background\nContext: Agrifood-health-environment\nThe world is currently facing a number of pressing interlinking issues including climate change, health, and food security. \n\nClimate change and environmental degradation are causing extreme weather events and altering growing conditions, threatening to cross tipping points for the biosphere and the continuance of civilization as we have known it. Industrial agriculture by itself is the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, pollution, biodiversity loss, and decline in soil health and water availability. This is resulting in reduced crop yields and increased food insecurity, which is putting added pressure on farmers to produce more food using conventional, industrial agricultural practices that accelerate degrade the environmental degradation. \n \n\nOn the health front, the agri-food industry is facing challenges as a result of soil degradation and chemical inputs, leading to a decrease in nutritional density of food and an increase in food-borne illnesses and food toxicity. Furthermore, the current industrial agriculture system is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, contributing to air and water pollution, and negatively impacting the health of farmers and rural communities.\n\nThe current food system is inadequate in addressing food security issues, with millions of people suffering from hunger and malnourishment. It is estimated that around 33% of global food production is lost or wasted, while around 800 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition. The industrial agriculture system is designed for maximum efficiency and profit, rather than for the benefit of communities and the environment. This has led to monoculture farming, overuse of chemicals, and a lack of diversity in the food system, all of which contribute to poor health and food insecurity. \n\nConsumers are becoming aware of these environmental and heath problems and are increasingly demanding high-quality, sustainably produced food, and the market for organic and functional food is growing rapidly. To address these challenges, there is a growing movement towards regenerative agriculture practices, which focus on regenerating soil health, water availability, and biodiversity while producing food in a sustainable manner. \n\nHowever, the lack of coordination and fragmentation in the agricultural industry makes it difficult for small farmers and regenerative agriculture projects to access the capital needed to transition to sustainanble and regenerative practices, and scale up their operations.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem aims to address these issues by promoting regenerative agriculture practices and creating a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume.\n\nThe deep problems - the economic system\nExternalization of costs\nThe current economic system, which prioritizes capitalism and consumerism, fails to account for the true cost of industrial agriculture, or commerce generally, on the environment and human health. Farmers who want to grow crops using sustainable methods have to invest in the transition only to find they are is outcompeted by industrial practices that have not internalised their true costs to environment and health. This leads to unsustainable practices, such as monoculture and heavy use of chemical inputs, that degrade the soil, reduce biodiversity and increase greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. These externalised costs are effectively subsidised by the individuals of the society who ultimately bear the cost of damages to environment and health. On a true free market baiss, with all costs accounted for, the regenerative and degenerative methods can compete on an equal basis. The degenerative methods with their burden of environmental, health and expensive inputs costs (fertiliser, pesticides etc) are no longer competitive with regenerative practices that do not have these costs. Additionally in a world where regeneration is valued it can become an additional source of income, ultimately making the regenerative products cheaper. This highlights the need for a comprehensive accounting of natural capital and internalization of environmental and health costs in order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system.\n\nThe Monetary system\n\nThe monetary system, which is based on fractional reserve banking and debt-based money creation, also exacerbates this issue by creating a cycle of debt repayment. The root of this problem lies in the way that money is created and the lack of accounting for natural capital. Most money is created by commercial banks originating loans (\u201cPromises to Repay\u201d), which creates an increase in deposit accounts (\u201cMoney\u201d). This creates a cycle of loan repayment that must come from some form of commerce, predominatly based based on fossil fuel energy. Because there is no accounting for natural capital, the ultimate source of the repayment is a reduction in natural capital assets, i.e. the destruction of environmental and health assets. This is seen in IMF loans to third world countries that are permanently indebted and required to mine their natural capital, even their food, to pay the interest.\n\nFurthermore, this would be the case even if the energy source were some form of non-polluting, free energy. Greenhouse gas damage is only a fraction of the total environmental and health cost of the commerce systema. As long as the destruction of nature is free of cost, and money is debt based withotu regard to social value, the competitive race to the bottom will ensure that nature and health are destroyed even faster. This highlights the need for a comprehensive accounting of natural capital and the internalization of environmental and health costs in order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system.\n\nIn short, our current economic system is not taking into account the true cost of industrial agriculture and or other commerce on the environment and human health. This results in farmers and industry being incentivized to adopt practices that are not sustainable in the long term. Additionally, a lack of coordination and fragmentation in the agricultural industry makes it difficult for small farmers and regenerative agriculture projects to access the capital they need to scale up their operations. The root of this problem lies in the way that money is created and the lack of accounting for natural capital. In order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system, we need to take into account the comprehensive accounting of natural capital and the internalization of environmental and health costs.\n\nEconomic Costs of the degenerative system\nThe degenerative industrial agriculture industry is facing a multitude of challenges that threaten global food security, economic stability, and human health. These issues, if left unaddressed, will result in staggering economic and health costs for society.\n\nIt's difficult to put a precise monetary value on the costs associated with the degenerative food industry as they can vary greatly depending on the specific impact and location, and many of these costs are not immediately visible and can accumulate over time. However, some estimates have been made on certain aspects of the industry. \n\nEconomic impact of food insecurity, including loss in GDP in developing countries due to micronutrient deficiencies is up to 2% of GDP according to Global Hunger Index 2014)\n\nGlobal loss in economic productivity due to macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies is over 2-3% of GDP\n\nThe total cost of climate change is estimated to be around 2-4% of global GDP by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. (Greenhouse gas emissions from the food sector are estimated to be around 25% of global emissions.)\n\nExternalized damages of the $1T US food industry is estimated in a 2021 Rockerfeller Report at $2.1T\n\nAnnual healthcare costs globally due to diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease is estimated by World Health Organization at $2 trillion.\n\nDeforestation caused by industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $2-5 trillion annually in lost ecosystem services.\n\nLoss of biodiversity caused by industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $500 billion annually.\n\nThe use of chemical inputs in industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $5.2 billion annually in health costs in the US alone.\n\nWater pollution caused by agricultural activities is estimated to cost around $452 billion annually.\n\nIn a $100 trillion Global GDP, these estimated costs aggregate to $11-17 trillion.",
