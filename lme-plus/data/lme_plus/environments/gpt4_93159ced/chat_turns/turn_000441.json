  "content": "The Sabarimala Temple case refers to the legal battle over the practice of banning women of menstruating age (between 10 and 50 years) from entering the Sabarimala Temple, located in the state of Kerala in India. The temple is dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, who is considered celibate in mythology.\n\nThe tradition of preventing women of certain age groups from entering the temple dates back to ancient times and is based on the belief that menstruating women are impure and may defile the temple's sanctity. It is believed that Lord Ayyappa is a celibate deity and allowing women of menstruating age in the temple would be disrespectful to his vow of celibacy.\n\nHowever, the ban was challenged in 2018 by a petition filed by a women's rights group in the Supreme Court of India. The petition argued that the ban was discriminatory and violated the constitutional rights of women. In September 2018, the Supreme Court lifted the ban on women's entry into the temple, stating that discrimination on the basis of gender violated the Constitution of India.\n\nThis decision was met with a lot of protests and violence from the devotees of the temple. The state government tried to implement the decision and provide security to women who wanted to enter the temple. Finally in November 2019, a review petition was filed in the Supreme Court, seeking to review the decision allowing women's entry into the temple. However, in February 2020, the Supreme Court once again upheld the decision to allow the entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala Temple.",
