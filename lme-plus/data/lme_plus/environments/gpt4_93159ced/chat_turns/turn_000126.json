Preserve and incorporate the existing memorials: Ensure that existing memorials in the area are preserved and incorporated into the evolving space to maintain the site's identity as a tribute to the victims of the 9/11 attacks.\n\n4. Educate visitors and the public: Provide educational opportunities and resources for visitors to learn about the significance of the site, including its history, significance, and role in the ongoing healing process.\n\n5. Maintain a respectful tone: Developers should consider the atmosphere of the site by carefully selecting appropriate architecture, landscape designs, and street plans that maintain a respectful tone that acknowledges the gravity of the tragedy. \n\nOverall, it is vital to maintain a balance between the memory of the tragedy and commercialization of the area in order to ensure that the site remains a solemn and respectful tribute to those who lost their lives on 9/11.",
