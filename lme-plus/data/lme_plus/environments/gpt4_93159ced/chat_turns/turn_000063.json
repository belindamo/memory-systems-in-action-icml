Ask your followers questions related to your content, and use their responses to create new content or start a conversation.\n\n**4. Utilize the \"poll\" sticker:**\nThe \"poll\" sticker allows you to ask your followers to vote on a topic. This can help you gather feedback, opinions, or even decide on future content.\n\n**5. Share behind-the-scenes content:**\nGive your followers a sneak peek into your life, work, or creative process. This can help build a deeper connection with your audience.\n\n**6. Drive traffic to your other social media profiles:**\nUse Instagram Stories to drive traffic to your other social media profiles, like Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube.

Utilize the \"swipe-up\" feature:**\nIf you have over 10,000 followers, you can use the \"swipe-up\" feature to drive traffic to your website, blog, or other social media profiles.

This can help create a sense of community and encourage engagement.\n\n**13. Create a \"Story Series\":**\nCreate a series of stories that tell a story, showcase a tutorial, or provide a tutorial.
