  "content": "I'm thinking of serving the grilled asparagus and Thai Basil Chicken with some steamed jasmine rice and a simple salad with fresh herbs from my kitchen windowsill garden. Speaking of which, I planted basil, cilantro, and parsley seeds in a small herb garden on the kitchen windowsill about a month ago, and they've been growing steadily. Do you have any suggestions on how to incorporate the fresh herbs into the salad, or maybe even use them as a garnish for the dish?",
