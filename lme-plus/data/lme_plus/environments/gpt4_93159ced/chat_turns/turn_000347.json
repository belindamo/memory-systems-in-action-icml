  "content": "Orthodox Judaism is characterized by strict adherence to traditional Jewish laws (halakha) and customs. Orthodox Jews believe that halakha is binding and unchanging. Many Orthodox Jews only eat foods that are certified kosher, pray three times a day, and observe the Sabbath and Jewish holidays strictly. Women generally have a lesser role than men in Orthodox communities.\n\nConservative Judaism emerged in the late 19th century as a response to the growing secularization of Western society. Conservative Jews believe in a balance between tradition and modernity. They largely adhere to Jewish law but also believe it can be interpreted to fit modern times. Conservative Jews are more vocal about integrating women into prayer services and leadership positions.\n\nReform Judaism originated in Germany in the early 19th century. Reform Jews believe that the Torah is a human document reflecting the culture and values of the time it was written, not the word of God. They believe in a progressive interpretation of Jewish law that changes to reflect modern times. Women have full equality with men in Reform synagogues. There is no dress code, and mixed gender seating is common.\n\nAll three movements have evolved over time. Orthodox Judaism has become more conservative and less likely to adopt changes in Jewish law. Conservative Judaism has become more liberal in some ways, such as ordaining women as rabbis, while still adhering to traditional practices. Reform Judaism has continued to evolve, often reflecting the changing norms of society.",
