This might be more cost-effective than booking separate flights for each leg. I found a multi-city flight option that could work for you:\n\n* Fly from your hometown to Chicago (ORD) on a Tuesday or Wednesday, then from Chicago to Denver (DEN) on a Friday or Saturday, and finally return from Denver to your hometown on a Tuesday or Wednesday. This itinerary could cost around $350-$450.\n\n**Accommodations:**\n\nFor budget-friendly options, I've searched for hostels and Airbnb listings in both cities. Here are some options:\n\n* **Chicago:**\n\t+ Hostel: You can find dorm rooms in Chicago hostels for around $30-$40 per night. Private rooms start from around $60-$80 per night.\n\t+ Airbnb: Shared rooms in Chicago start from around $25-$35 per night. Entire apartments or private rooms in a shared apartment start from around $40-$60 per night.\n* **Denver:**\n\t+ Hostel: Dorm rooms in Denver hostels start from around $25-$35 per night. Private rooms start from around $45-$65 per night.\n\t+ Airbnb: Shared rooms in Denver start from around $20-$30 per night. Entire apartments or private rooms in a shared apartment start from around $35-$55 per night.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be flexible with your travel dates to get the best deals on flights.\n* Book your accommodations in advance to ensure availability and get the best prices.\n* Consider staying in a hostel or Airbnb outside of the city center to save money.\n* Look for budget-friendly neighborhoods in each city, such as Wicker Park in Chicago or Capitol Hill in Denver.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your trip!
