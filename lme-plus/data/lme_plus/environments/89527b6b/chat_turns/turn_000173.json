In fact, combining yoga with strength training can be a great way to improve your overall fitness and running performance.\n\n**Benefits of Combining Yoga and Strength Training:**\n\n1. **Improved flexibility and range of motion**: Yoga can help increase your flexibility and range of motion, which can reduce your risk of injury and improve your running form.\n2. **Enhanced recovery**: Yoga can aid in recovery by reducing muscle tension and improving circulation, which can help your body recover from strength training and running.\n3. **Increased strength and balance**: Strength training can improve your overall strength and balance, which can help you maintain good form and reduce your risk of injury during yoga.\n4. **Cross-training benefits**: Combining yoga and strength training can provide a great cross-training effect, which can help reduce the risk of overuse injuries and improve your overall fitness.\n\n**Tips for Combining Yoga and Strength Training:**\n\n1. **Start slow**: If you're new to yoga or strength training, start with gentle classes or sessions and gradually increase the intensity and frequency as you build up your endurance.\n2. **Listen to your body**: Pay attention to your body and take rest days as needed. If you're feeling fatigued or experiencing muscle soreness, consider taking an extra day off or modifying your workouts.\n3. **Focus on different muscle groups**: Try to focus on different muscle groups on your yoga and strength training days. For example, if you're doing strength training on Tuesdays and Fridays, focus on lower body exercises on Tuesdays and upper body exercises on Fridays. This can help reduce the risk of overtraining and allow for adequate recovery time.\n4. **Make time for both**: Prioritize both yoga and strength training, and make time for both in your schedule. Even if it's just 20-30 minutes of yoga on Sundays and 30-45 minutes of strength training on Tuesdays and Fridays, it's better than nothing!\n\n**Sample Schedule:**\n\nHere's an updated sample schedule that incorporates yoga on Sundays:\n\n* Monday: Easy run (30 minutes)\n* Tuesday: Strength training (lower body, 30-45 minutes)\n* Wednesday: Rest day\n* Thursday: Interval run (30 minutes)\n* Friday: Strength training (upper body, 30-45 minutes)\n* Saturday: Long slow run (45 minutes)\n* Sunday: Yoga (20-30 minutes)\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust the schedule as needed.
