Make sure to take a stroll through the beautiful Lurie Garden in Millennium Park, and don't miss the free outdoor concerts and events they often host.\n\nIn Denver, the Denver Art Museum is an amazing cultural attraction, and Larimer Square is a great spot to explore for shopping, dining, and people-watching. You'll find plenty of unique boutiques, art galleries, and restaurants to discover.\n\nWhen it comes to craft beer, Denver is a paradise! You'll have no shortage of options to try.
