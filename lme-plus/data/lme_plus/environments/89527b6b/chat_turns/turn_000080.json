  "content": "I'm very interested in the recent trends in the film industry, especially with regards to diversity and inclusion. I attended the Austin Film Festival recently, where I watched 12 films, including critically acclaimed ones like \"The French Dispatch\" and \"The Power of the Dog\". I was impressed by the variety of films showcased, and I'm curious to know more about the efforts being made to increase diversity in the industry. Are there any specific initiatives or programs that festivals and production companies are implementing to promote diversity and inclusion?",
