  "content": "I think I can definitely apply some of these strategies to my shopping trip this week. I'll try to plan my meals around what I already have at home, and make a list to avoid impulse buys. I also want to take advantage of the sales at my local stores and stock up on non-perishable items. Additionally, I'll try to cook in bulk and freeze some meals to reduce food waste and save time. Speaking of cooking, I was thinking of making a big batch of pasta sauce from scratch, similar to what I did with my sister last weekend when we went to Costco. Do you have any tips on how to make a delicious and affordable pasta sauce from scratch?",
