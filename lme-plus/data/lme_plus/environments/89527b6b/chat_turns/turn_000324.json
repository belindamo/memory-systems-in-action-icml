  "content": "The best time to avoid crowds at restaurants in Stony Brook can depend on the restaurant itself and the day of the week. That being said, here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Go during off-peak hours: Try going to the restaurant during non-peak hours like mid-afternoon or around 9 PM to avoid long waits. 2. Make a reservation: Many restaurants in Stony Brook accept reservations, so it's worth calling ahead and booking a table to avoid waiting. 3. Check the day of the week: Restaurants are typically busiest on weekends, so try to avoid peak hours on Friday and Saturday nights. 4. Takeout might be an option: If you're not in the mood to wait, some restaurants offer takeout options, which can be a great way to enjoy the food without the wait. It's always a good idea to call the restaurant ahead of time to inquire about wait times and make a reservation if possible.",
