To keep them fresh and perky throughout the market event, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Cut the stems:** Trim the stems of the sunflowers at an angle before placing them in the vase or container. This helps the stems absorb water better and prevents them from sitting flat at the bottom of the vase.\n2. **Use a clean vase:** Make sure the vase or container is clean and free of any bacteria or debris. Wash it with soap and water, and then rinse thoroughly.\n3. **Change the water:** Replace the water in the vase every few hours to prevent bacterial growth. You can also add a floral preservative to the water to help extend the life of the sunflowers.\n4. **Keep them cool:** Sunflowers prefer cooler temperatures, so try to keep them out of direct sunlight, especially if it's a hot day. If possible, position your display in a shaded area or provide some shade for the sunflowers.\n5. **Monitor the temperature:** Avoid placing the sunflowers near any heat sources, such as radiators, heaters, or direct sunlight, which can cause them to wilt quickly.\n6. **Avoid drafts:** Keep the sunflowers away from drafts or strong winds, which can cause them to dry out and wilt.\n7. **Mist them:** Gently mist the sunflowers with water throughout the day to keep them hydrated and fresh. Be careful not to get water on your jam labels or packaging!\n8. **Use floral foam:** Consider using floral foam in the vase to help keep the stems in place and provide additional support. This can be especially helpful if you're using a larger vase or have multiple stems.\n9. **Prepare for the end:** Be prepared to replace the sunflowers if they start to wilt or droop during the market event. You can also have some backup flowers on hand, just in case.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your sunflowers fresh and beautiful throughout the market event. Good luck, and I hope you have a fantastic time showcasing your delicious homemade jams!",
