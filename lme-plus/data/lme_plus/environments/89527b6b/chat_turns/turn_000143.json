If you have oily skin, choose a lightweight, oil-free option.\n* Consider a moisturizer with SPF 30 or higher for daily sun protection.\n* Don't be afraid to try a smaller size or a travel-sized version of a moisturizer before committing to a full-size product.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect moisturizer for your skin type and budget!",
