Resistance from colonial authorities - The British government was initially reluctant to grant independence to the island nation and put up stiff resistance.\n\n2. Internal division and political instability - There was a lack of unity among various political parties and organizations pursuing independence, which caused political instability and hampered progress towards independence.\n\n3. Economic challenges - The country's economy was heavily reliant on the sugar industry, which was in decline. This made it difficult for Saint Kitts and Nevis to sustain its economy and develop its own infrastructure and industries.\n\n4. Social unrest and crime - There were instances of social unrest and crime, which posed a challenge to maintaining law and order during the independence struggle.\n\n5. External pressures - The international community was largely divided on the issue of Saint Kitts and Nevis' independence, which further complicated the process.
