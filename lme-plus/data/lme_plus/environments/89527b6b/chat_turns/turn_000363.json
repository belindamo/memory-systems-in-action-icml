  "content": "The research group meetings were really helpful in identifying potential gaps in my research and providing feedback on my methodology. One of the most valuable insights I received was from my supervisor, Dr. Smith, who suggested I reconsider my sampling strategy to ensure it was more representative of the population I was studying. That feedback really helped me strengthen my research design.\n\nAs for preparing for my thesis proposal defense, I'd say it was a mix of both stress and preparation. I had been working on my research for months, so I felt relatively prepared, but there was still a sense of uncertainty about how the defense would go. In the end, it was a huge relief to have it done, and I'm glad I was able to present my research confidently.\n\nMoving on, I was thinking of exploring some online resources to stay updated on the latest developments in my field. Do you have any recommendations for academic blogs or websites that might be relevant to my research interests?",
