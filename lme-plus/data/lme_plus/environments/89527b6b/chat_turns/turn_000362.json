  "content": "Revisiting your data collection process and reorganizing your notes can be a great way to get a fresh perspective on your research.\n\nAnd it's wonderful that you had regular meetings with your research group leading up to your thesis proposal defense! Regular check-ins with your team can be incredibly valuable in refining your ideas, addressing potential gaps, and staying on track.\n\nIt's also great that you have a specific date for your thesis proposal defense - February 10th. Having a deadline can help you stay focused and motivated.\n\nNow that you've mentioned your research group meetings, I have to ask: What were some of the most valuable insights or feedback you received from your research group during those meetings? Were there any specific suggestions or critiques that really helped you refine your research?\n\n(Also, if you don't mind me asking, how did you find the experience of preparing for your thesis proposal defense? Was it stressful, or did you feel relatively prepared?)",
