  "content": "Retail banking systems can be used for cross-border payments, but they are typically not the most efficient or cost-effective option. Retail banking systems are designed primarily for domestic transactions and may not have the necessary capabilities or infrastructure to handle international payments.\n\nFor cross-border payments, specialized services such as SWIFT network, correspondent banking, and international payment processors are often used. These services offer greater speed, security, and efficiency for cross-border transactions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n* Yes, but it's not the most efficient or cost-effective option.",
