This will help guests who might not be as crafty or need a little guidance.\n2. **Design ideas:** Display a few onesies with simple designs or phrases that guests can use as inspiration. For example, you could have onesies with phrases like \"Little Peanut\" or \"Tiny Tot,\" or designs like a onesie with a baby footprints or a cute animal.\n3. **Blank onesies:** Offer blank onesies for guests to start from scratch.
