Academics: First and foremost, consider the academic programs offered at each university and make sure they align with your academic goals and interests. Remember, while soccer is important, your education is also crucial. 2. Athletic program: Consider the competitiveness of the soccer program, coaching staff, facilities and resources available to student-athletes, and the style of soccer played by the team. 3. Location: Think about the location of the university, both in terms of proximity to home and the surrounding community. Do you want to be in a big city, a small town, or somewhere in between? 4. Cost: Take into consideration the cost of tuition, room and board, and other expenses, and whether or not the university offers scholarships or financial aid to student-athletes. 5. Campus culture: Visit the campuses or attend virtual information sessions if possible to get a feel for the university's cultural values and community, and see if it's a good fit for you. By considering these factors, you can narrow down your choices and make an informed decision about which university and soccer program is the best fit for you.",
