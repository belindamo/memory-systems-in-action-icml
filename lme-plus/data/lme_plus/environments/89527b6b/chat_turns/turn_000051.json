Allocating a bigger budget for gifts makes sense, as they're often the most important part of the holiday season. Now, let's dive into creating a realistic budget for each person on your list.\n\nHere are some tips to help you determine a realistic budget for each person:\n\n1. **Consider their interests and preferences**: Think about the person's hobbies, interests, and preferences. This will help you narrow down gift ideas and determine how much you're willing to spend.\n2. **Reflect on past gifts**: Think about what you've spent on gifts for this person in the past. Has it been around $20, $50, or $100? Use this as a starting point and adjust based on your current budget.\n3. **Set a price range**: Decide on a price range for each person, such as $20-$50, $50-$100, or $100-$200. This will help you stay focused and avoid overspending.\n4. **Research gift ideas**: Look up gift ideas online or browse stores to get an idea of prices. This will help you determine what you can get within your budget.\n5. **Consider the relationship**: The closer the relationship, the more you might want to spend. For example, you might spend more on a spouse or child than on a coworker or acquaintance.\n6. **Be realistic about your budget**: Don't feel pressured to spend more than you can afford. Be honest with yourself about what you can realistically spend, and adjust your expectations accordingly.\n\nHere's a rough guideline to help you get started:\n\n* For close family members (spouse, children, parents): $50-$200\n* For extended family members (siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins): $20-$100\n* For close friends: $20-$50\n* For coworkers or acquaintances: $10-$20\n\nRemember, these are just rough estimates. You know your relationships and financial situation best, so adjust accordingly.\n\nTo make it more concrete, let's say you have the following people on your list:\n\n* Spouse: $100\n* Children (2): $50 each = $100\n* Parents: $50 each = $100\n* Close friends (2): $30 each = $60\n* Coworkers (3): $15 each = $45\n\nTotal gift budget: $405\n\nNow, you can adjust this budget based on your overall budget and priorities. If you need to cut back, consider reducing the amount for each person or cutting back on the number of gifts.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to create a realistic budget for each person on your list and stick to it. Happy budgeting!",
