It's great that you're looking to prioritize your own health and fitness despite the challenges. I'd be happy to help you find some low-impact exercises that are gentle on your knee.\n\nBefore we dive in, please keep in mind that it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider or a medical professional before starting any new exercise routine, especially with a knee injury. They can provide personalized guidance and recommendations based on your specific condition.\n\nThat being said, here are some low-impact exercises that are often suitable for people with knee injuries or concerns:\n\n1. **Water-based exercises**: Swimming, water aerobics, or simply walking in the water can be fantastic low-impact options. The buoyancy of water reduces the impact on your knee joints.\n2. **Cycling**: Stationary cycling or using a recumbent bike is a low-impact way to improve cardiovascular fitness without putting excessive strain on your knee.\n3. **Yoga or Pilates**: Modified yoga or Pilates exercises can help improve flexibility, balance, and strength without high-impact movements. Many yoga and Pilates exercises can be modified to accommodate knee injuries.\n4. **Resistance band exercises**: Resistance bands are lightweight, portable, and can be used to work on strengthening your upper body, lower body, and core without putting excessive stress on your knee.\n5. **Seated exercises**: Chair-based exercises, such as seated leg lifts, seated marching, or seated leg press, can be done while sitting comfortably, reducing the impact on your knee.\n6. **Short, gentle walks**: If your knee can tolerate it, short walks with a gentle pace can be a good way to maintain cardiovascular fitness. You can start with short distances and gradually increase as your knee allows.\n7. **Bodyweight exercises**: Gentle bodyweight exercises like wall squats, wall push-ups, or leg raises can be modified to reduce the impact on your knee.\n8. **Tai chi or qigong**: These low-impact, slow-moving exercises can help improve balance, flexibility, and strength while reducing stress on your knee.\n\nSome specific exercises you can try:\n\n* Seated leg lifts: Sit comfortably with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one leg off the floor, keeping it straight, and hold for a few seconds. Slowly lower it back down. Repeat on the other side.\n* Wall squats: Stand with your back against a wall and your feet shoulder-width apart. Slowly slide your back down the wall, keeping your knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Hold for 10-15 seconds and stand up. Repeat.\n* Seated marching: Sit comfortably with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one leg off the floor and march in place, keeping your knee straight. Hold for a few seconds and lower it back down. Repeat on the other side.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain or discomfort.\n* Warm up before exercising with some light stretching or gentle movements.\n* Start slowly and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your exercises as your knee allows.\n* Consider working with a fitness professional or physical therapist who can provide personalized guidance and modifications based on your specific needs.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on finding exercises that work for you and your knee. Don't forget to prioritize your overall health and take breaks when needed, especially while caregiving for your mom.",
