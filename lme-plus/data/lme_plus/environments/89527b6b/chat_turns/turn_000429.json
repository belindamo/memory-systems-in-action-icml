Cooking and storing scrambled eggs for meal prep can be a bit tricky, but I've got some tips to help you out:\n\n**Cooking Scrambled Eggs for Meal Prep:**\n\n1. **Whisk and cook in bulk**: Whisk together a large batch of eggs (6-12 eggs) with a fork or whisk, adding a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Cook the eggs in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until they're just set.\n2. **Use a thermometer**: Cook the eggs to an internal temperature of 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n3. **Cool quickly**: Remove the eggs from the heat and let them cool quickly by spreading them out on a plate or tray. This will help prevent overcooking and make them easier to store.\n\n**Storing Scrambled Eggs for Meal Prep:**\n\n1. **Portion control**: Divide the cooled scrambled eggs into individual portions (e.g., 1/4 cup or 1/2 cup). This will make it easy to grab-and-go in the morning.\n2. **Airtight containers**: Store the portioned eggs in airtight containers, such as glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. You can also use zip-top bags or freezer bags.\n3. **Refrigerate or freeze**: Store the containers in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days or freeze for up to 2-3 months.\n\n**Reheating Scrambled Eggs:**\n\n1. **Microwave**: Reheat individual portions in the microwave for 10-15 seconds, or until warmed through.\n2. **Pan**: Reheat the eggs in a pan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until warmed through.\n3. **Oven**: Reheat the eggs in the oven at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for 5-7 minutes, or until warmed through.\n\nTips for Meal Prepping Breakfast Burritos:\n\n* Cook and store scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon, and cheese separately to assemble burritos in the morning.\n* Add other ingredients like black beans, salsa, and avocado to the burritos for added flavor and nutrition.\n* Use whole wheat or whole grain tortillas for a nutritious breakfast option.\n* Consider adding some diced veggies like bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms to the scrambled eggs for added flavor and nutrition.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy delicious breakfast burritos all week long!",
