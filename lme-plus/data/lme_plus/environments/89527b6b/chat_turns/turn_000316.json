Lobster Roll - A classic seafood item, Stony Brook has some of the best lobster rolls that are freshly made with chunks of sweet and succulent lobster meat.\n\n2. Rice Pudding - This creamy dessert is a must-try delicacy that can be found in the Stony Brook area.\n\n3. Long Island Clam Chowder - Different from the regular clam chowder found all around the United States, this dish is made with local clams, potatoes, and a tomato-based broth.\n\n4. Black and White Cookie - While this cookie is a common item in New York City, it is not often found elsewhere. It is a soft vanilla and chocolate cookie with a hint of lemon flavor.\n\n5. Bagels - There is a variety of bagel shops in Stony Brook, so it's definitely worth trying some fresh and delicious bagels, which are a staple breakfast item in New York.",
