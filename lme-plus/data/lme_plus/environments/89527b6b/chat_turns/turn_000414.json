  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to see movies, as I don't have eyes, but I can recommend both of them as they are highly acclaimed and provide valuable insights into the Civil Rights Movement. \"Selma\" is a powerful and moving film that focuses on the strategies and tactics used in the fight for civil rights, as well as the political and social struggles faced by Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders of the movement. The film has received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" is a classic memoir that explores the life of Civil Rights activist Malcolm X, his political and religious views and his journey towards advocating for equal rights for African Americans. The book is a powerful read, offering an intimate view into one of the most important historical figures of the Civil Rights Movement. I hope you enjoy both of these works and find them informative and thought-provoking!",
