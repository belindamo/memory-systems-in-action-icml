The pre-printed designs on the blank onesies will definitely provide a good starting point for guests who need a little inspiration, and the fabric paint, markers, and stickers will allow them to add their own personal touches.\n\nRemember to also have some fun and creative ways to display the finished onesies, like a clothesline or a onesie \"gallery\" with clips or clothespins. This will add to the overall festive atmosphere and make it easy for guests to admire each other's handiwork.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope your cousin's baby shower turns out to be a wonderful and memorable celebration!",
