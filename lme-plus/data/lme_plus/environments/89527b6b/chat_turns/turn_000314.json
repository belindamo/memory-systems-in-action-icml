  "content": "You raise a valid concern. While technology can be a powerful tool to help mitigate the impact of sea-level rise, there are potential drawbacks to relying too much on it.\n\nOne of the main risks of becoming too reliant on technology is the potential loss of human oversight and involvement. For example, we must be cautious about relying solely on AI and big data analysis to forecast the impact of sea-level rise. Computer models can help us to make better predictions and decisions based on the data available, but there is always a risk of errors or oversights that human observation can help correct. Sometimes, the data inputs we use for AI risks the limitations of human observation.\n\nAnother potential risk of relying too much on technology is the cost of implementing and maintaining advanced systems. Technology solutions can sometimes be costly, which could result in inequalities in the distribution of resources and services, making it out of reach for some communities or making it less cost-effective.\n\nFinally, relying too much on technology can result in people becoming complacent about personal responsibility and ignoring the larger environment. It can turn communities into passively rather than actively managing their environment by leaving it to remote management systems. \n\nWhile technology can be beneficial in addressing the impact of sea-level rise, it is essential to remember that it is only a tool. The best results in mitigating the impact of sea-level rise can be achieved through a combination of technology and human-focused approaches. This solution brings to the table the expertise and knowledge of both communities and technology development.",
