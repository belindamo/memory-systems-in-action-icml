  "content": "That's a great idea! Providing both inspiration and creative freedom will definitely make the onesie decoration station more engaging and fun for the guests. I think I'll also have some blank onesies with a few pre-printed designs, like cute animals or baby blocks, to give guests some ideas to start with. And, of course, I'll have plenty of fabric paint, markers, and stickers available for them to get creative with. Thanks for the suggestions!",
