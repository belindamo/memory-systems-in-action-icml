For storing tops like your new white blouse, a more delicate shelving solution might be a better fit.\n\nHere are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Delicacy**: Elfa shelves are sturdy and great for holding heavier items, but they might be too robust for lightweight tops like blouses. You might want a shelf that's specifically designed for garments that require a bit more care.\n2. **Space**: Elfa shelves are often wider and deeper than you might need for storing tops. You might end up with wasted space or have to fold your blouses to fit them on the shelf, which could lead to wrinkles.\n3. **Accessibility**: Elfa shelves can be quite high, which might make it difficult to reach your tops without a stool or ladder. You might want a shelving solution that allows you to easily access your blouses without straining.\n\nFor storing tops, you might consider the following options:\n\n1. **Stackable cubbies**: These are great for storing folded items like blouses, and they often have individual compartments to keep each item separate and organized.\n2. **Tiered shelves**: These are designed specifically for storing garments and usually have multiple levels of shelving to maximize storage space. They're often narrower and more compact than Elfa shelves, making them perfect for smaller items like tops.\n3. **Folding shelves**: These are lightweight, easy to assemble, and can be folded up when not in use. They're a great option if you have limited space or want a temporary shelving solution.\n\nSome popular brands for shelving tops include:\n\n* Whitmor: Known for their stackable cubbies and tiered shelves, Whitmor offers a range of affordable and stylish storage solutions.\n* Seville Classics: This brand offers a variety of shelving options, including folding shelves and tiered shelves, that are perfect for storing tops.\n* Songmics: Songmics offers a range of affordable and stylish shelving solutions, including stackable cubbies and tiered shelves, that are great for storing tops.\n\nWhen choosing a shelving solution, make sure to consider the following factors:\n\n* **Size**: Measure your closet space and the size of your tops to ensure the shelf fits comfortably and can hold all your items.\n* **Material**: Look for shelves made from sturdy, durable materials that can support the weight of your tops.\n* **Style**: Choose a shelf that fits your personal style and complements your closet's aesthetic.\n* **Adjustability**: Consider shelves with adjustable heights or compartments to accommodate items of different sizes.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect shelving solution for your new Zara blouse and other tops!",
