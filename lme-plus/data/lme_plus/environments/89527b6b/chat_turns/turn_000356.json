  "content": "Congrats on your internship! Finding affordable accommodations near a top-tier university can be challenging, but I'm here to help. Here are some recommendations and websites to get you started:\n\n**Websites to search for affordable accommodations:**\n\n1. **Sublet.com**: A popular platform for short-term rentals, including apartments, houses, and rooms.\n2. **Craigslist**: Be cautious when using Craigslist, but it's a good resource for finding affordable options. Just make sure to exercise caution when dealing with strangers and inspect the property before signing a lease.\n3. **Airbnb**: While not always the cheapest option, Airbnb can be a good choice for short-term rentals. Look for apartments or rooms with a lower price point.\n4. **Student.com**: A website specializing in student accommodation, offering a range of options from shared apartments to studios.\n5. **Homestay**: If you're open to living with a host family, Homestay can be a great way to find affordable accommodation.\n6. **Booking.com**: While primarily a hotel booking site, Booking.com also lists apartments and guesthouses, which can be a more affordable option.\n7. **University resources**: Check your university's website or contact their housing department to see if they offer any affordable accommodation options, such as summer housing or intern housing.\n\n**Other options to consider:**\n\n1. **Roommate hunting**: Post on social media or use websites like Roomster or Roommates.com to find a roommate to split the cost of an apartment.\n2. **Hostels or guesthouses**: If you're okay with shared facilities, hostels or guesthouses can be a budget-friendly option.\n3. **Couchsurfing**: While not ideal for an entire summer, Couchsurfing can be a great way to find free accommodation for a few nights while you get settled.\n4. **Local classifieds**: Check local online classifieds, such as Facebook Marketplace or Letgo, for people renting out rooms or apartments.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Book early**: The earlier you start looking, the better your chances of finding affordable accommodations.\n2. **Be flexible**: Consider staying a bit farther from the university or looking at apartments with a longer commute to find cheaper options.\n3. **Negotiate**: If you're renting a room or apartment, don't be afraid to negotiate the price, especially if you're committing to a longer stay.\n4. **Read reviews**: Always research the accommodation and landlord/property manager before making a decision.\n\nI hope these resources and tips help you find affordable accommodations near your top-tier university!",
