  "content": "Several languages from the same time period have survived in written form as well. These include:\n\n1. Akkadian: Akkadian was a Semitic language that was widely used in Mesopotamia, particularly during the Babylonian and Assyrian Empires. It was the first Semitic language to be written in cuneiform, and many important works, such as the Code of Hammurabi, were written in Akkadian.\n\n2. Egyptian: Ancient Egyptian is one of the oldest and most well-preserved languages in the world. It was written in hieroglyphics, a system of symbolic writing that was used from around 3200 BC to 400 AD. Egyptian texts cover a wide range of topics, including religious beliefs and practices, literature, and history.\n\n3. Hittite: Hittite was an Indo-European language that was spoken in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) during the Hittite Empire. It is one of the oldest known Indo-European languages and was written in cuneiform.\n\n4. Old Hebrew: Old Hebrew was the language of the Hebrews in the early part of the first millennium BC. The earliest inscriptions in Hebrew date back to the 10th century BC, and the Hebrew Bible, written in Hebrew, is one of the most important texts in Judaism and Christianity.\n\nThese ancient languages and their surviving texts offer a unique window into the world of our ancestors and help us to better understand their cultures, beliefs, and ways of life.",
