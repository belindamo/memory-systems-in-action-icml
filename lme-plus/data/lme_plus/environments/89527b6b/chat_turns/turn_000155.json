Pay attention to your body: One way to determine if visualization is working for you is to pay attention to how your body feels during and after your practice. If you feel more relaxed, calm, and centered after visualizing, it is a sign that it is working for you.\n\n2. Check for changes in your mood: Visualizations can help us regulate our emotions and reduce stress and anxiety. So if you find yourself feeling less overwhelmed and more positive after visualizing, it may be an indication that it's working for you.\n\n3. Monitor changes in behavior: Visualizations can also help us access our inner wisdom, which can guide us towards making positive changes in our lives. If you find yourself taking action towards your goals and feeling more empowered after visualizing, it may be a sign that it is working for you.\n\n4. Be mindful of your thoughts: Visualizations can also help us become more aware of the thoughts and beliefs that may be limiting us. If you find yourself gaining insights into your thought patterns and feeling more open to new possibilities after visualizing, it may be an indication that it is working for you.\n\n5. Give it time: It can take time to see the full benefits of visualization practice. Be patient and continue to work with your chosen visualization regularly to determine if it is truly effective for you.",
