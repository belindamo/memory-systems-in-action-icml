  "content": "The layover in Chicago will depend on the specific flight schedule and airline, but I can give you an idea of what to expect.\n\nAssuming you book a multi-city flight itinerary, your layover in Chicago could be anywhere from 2-6 hours, depending on the airline and flight schedule. Here's a possible scenario:\n\n* Fly from your hometown to Chicago (ORD) on a Tuesday, arriving in the morning (e.g., 10:00 AM)\n* Layover in Chicago for 3-4 hours\n* Fly from Chicago (ORD) to Denver (DEN) on the same day, departing in the afternoon (e.g., 2:00 PM)\n\nKeep in mind that layovers can vary, and you should check the flight details carefully before booking. Some airlines might offer shorter or longer layovers, so it's essential to review the itinerary before confirming your purchase.\n\nHere are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* A shorter layover can save you time and minimize the risk of delays.\n* You'll have some time to grab a meal, stretch your legs, or explore a bit of Chicago before heading to Denver.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* A shorter layover might leave you with limited time to deal with any potential delays or issues.\n* You'll need to collect your baggage and re-check in for your next flight, which can take some time.\n\nIf you're concerned about the layover duration or have specific requirements, you can try the following:\n\n* Filter your flight search results by layover duration to find options that suit your needs.\n* Consider booking a longer layover (e.g., 6-8 hours) to give yourself more time to relax or explore Chicago.\n* Look into airlines that offer shorter or more convenient layovers, such as a same-terminal connection.\n\nOnce you've booked your flights, make sure to check the airline's baggage policy, as some may have specific rules for multi-city itineraries.\n\nHow does this sound? Do you have any other questions about the layover or flight itinerary?",
