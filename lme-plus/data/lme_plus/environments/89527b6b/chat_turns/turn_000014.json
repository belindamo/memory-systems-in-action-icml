  "content": "I'm located in the city, and I'm pretty open to various genres, but I've been leaning towards indie and rock lately. I've had a great experience at the Outdoors Pavilion, but I'm also interested in smaller, more low-key venues like the Coffee House on Main Street, where I attended a singer-songwriter night recently. Oh, and I also volunteered at the Music for a Cause benefit concert at the Community Center earlier in April, which was a great event.",
