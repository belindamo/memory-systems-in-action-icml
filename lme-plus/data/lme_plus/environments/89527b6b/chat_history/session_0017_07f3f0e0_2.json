About a week before I attended Emily's baby shower, I picked up a few things for her, and I think the soft colors would have fit perfectly with the gifts I got her - the baby clothes and soft toy from Baby Gap, and the personalized baby blanket from Etsy. Do you have any suggestions for pastel-colored tablecloths and napkins that would match the theme?"
