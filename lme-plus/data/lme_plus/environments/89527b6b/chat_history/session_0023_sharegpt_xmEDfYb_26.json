It does not transfer money directly, but it facilitates the transfer of funds between banks by transmitting payment instructions and settlement messages.\n\nWestern Union, on the other hand, is a financial services company that specializes in person-to-person money transfers and other payment services, such as bill payments and money orders. It operates a global network of agents and locations, allowing customers to send and receive money across borders and currencies.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n* Yes, both transfer money."

      "content": "Retail banking systems can be used for cross-border payments, but they are typically not the most efficient or cost-effective option. Retail banking systems are designed primarily for domestic transactions and may not have the necessary capabilities or infrastructure to handle international payments.\n\nFor cross-border payments, specialized services such as SWIFT network, correspondent banking, and international payment processors are often used. These services offer greater speed, security, and efficiency for cross-border transactions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n* Yes, but it's not the most efficient or cost-effective option."
