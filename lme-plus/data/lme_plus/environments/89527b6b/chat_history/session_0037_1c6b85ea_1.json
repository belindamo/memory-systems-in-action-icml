It's great that you're making progress with website blockers and scheduling social media breaks, but addressing the habit of phone checking requires a different approach. Here are some strategies to help you break the habit:\n\n1. **Identify your triggers**:\n\t* Reflect on when and where you tend to check your phone out of habit.

Once you're aware of your triggers, you can develop strategies to address them.\n2. **Replace phone checking with a new habit**:\n\t* Choose a new behavior to replace phone checking, such as taking a few deep breaths, stretching, or doing a quick exercise. This can help you break the automatic response of reaching for your phone.\n3. **Use physical barriers**:\n\t* Place your phone in a designated spot, like a phone dock or a specific area of your desk, to create a physical barrier between you and your phone.\n\t* Consider using a phone case or wallet with a built-in timer or lock that limits your access to your phone during certain times.\n4. **Implement the \"1-minute rule\"**:\n\t* When you feel the urge to check your phone, wait 1 minute. Often, the urge will pass, and you'll realize it was just a habitual response.\n5. **Practice mindfulness and self-awareness**:\n\t* Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions when you reach for your phone. Ask yourself if you're truly needing to check something or if it's just a habitual response.\n\t* Use mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or journaling, to increase your self-awareness and better understand your motivations.\n6. **Set up phone-related goals and challenges**:\n\t* Set a goal to reduce your phone usage by a certain amount each day or week.

Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Instead, acknowledge the setback and gently refocus on your goals.\n\nRemember, breaking the habit of mindless phone checking is a process.
