You can also repurpose old items to create new accessories or outfits.\n8. **Swap with friends**: Organize a clothes swap with friends or family members to refresh your wardrobe without spending a dime.\n9. **Rent or borrow**: Consider clothing rental services like Rent the Runway or Vestiare Collective for special occasions, or borrow from friends for a one-time event.\n10. **Style your existing pieces**: Get creative with what you already own!
