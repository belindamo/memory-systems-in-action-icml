Here's what I found out:\n\n**Storage Instructions:**\n\nFreshly meals are shipped in insulated boxes with ice packs to keep them cool during transit. Once you receive your meals, it's essential to store them properly to maintain their quality and safety:\n\n* **Refrigerate**: Store meals in the refrigerator at a temperature of 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below within 2 hours of delivery.\n* **Freezer-safe**: If you don't plan to consume a meal within 3-4 days, you can store it in the freezer for up to 3 months. When you're ready to eat, simply thaw overnight in the refrigerator or reheat from frozen.\n\n**Reheating Instructions:**\n\nFreshly provides reheating instructions for each meal, which can be found on the meal label or on their website. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* **Microwave**: Reheat meals in the microwave on high for 1-2 minutes, or until the meal reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n* **Oven**: Reheat meals in a preheated oven at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for 10-15 minutes, or until the meal reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n* **Stovetop**: Reheat meals on the stovetop over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the meal reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n\n**Maintaining Probiotic Benefits:**\n\nTo preserve the probiotic benefits, Freshly recommends the following:\n\n* **Refrigerate promptly**: Store meals in the refrigerator at 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below to slow down the growth of bacteria and preserve the probiotics.\n* **Avoid overheating**: When reheating, avoid overheating the meal, as high temperatures can kill the beneficial bacteria.
