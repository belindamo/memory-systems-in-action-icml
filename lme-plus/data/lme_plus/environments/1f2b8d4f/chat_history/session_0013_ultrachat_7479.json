Cost: Creating and maintaining parks and gardens in urban areas can be expensive due to the high cost of land and resources.\n\n3. Pollution: Air, noise, and water pollution are major challenges for parks and gardens in urban areas, which can affect plant health and the well-being of visitors.\n\n4. Vandalism and crime: Parks and gardens in urban areas can be vulnerable to vandalism and other types of crime, which can damage facilities and discourage visitors.\n\n5.
