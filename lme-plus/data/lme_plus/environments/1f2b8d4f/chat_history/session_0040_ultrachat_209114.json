The council's website features maps and guides to help you find safe and enjoyable routes.\n\n2. Check the weather: Make sure to check the weather forecast before you set out and dress appropriately for the conditions. Wear comfortable shoes, breathable clothing, and a waterproof jacket if necessary.\n\n3. Be visible: If you're cycling, wear high-visibility clothing and use lights and reflectors to make yourself more visible to other road users. Some of the cycle hire bikes in Lambeth come equipped with lights.\n\n4. Follow the rules of the road: When cycling, follow the Highway Code and obey traffic signals and signs. Pedestrians should use designated crossing points and walk on the pavement wherever possible.\n\n5. Join a community: Joining a walking or cycling community or club in Lambeth can be a great way to meet like-minded people and discover new routes and trails.\n\n6. Consider trying an electric-assist bike: If you want to cycle more but are concerned about the distance, you may want to try an electric-assist bike. These bikes provide a boost of power to help you tackle hills and headwinds more easily, making cycling more accessible to more people.\n\nRemember, cycling and walking are great ways to stay active, save money, and reduce your carbon footprint. With the right equipment, planning, and safety measures, these activities can be both enjoyable and sustainable."
