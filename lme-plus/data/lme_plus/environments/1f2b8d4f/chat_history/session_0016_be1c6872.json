      "content": "Congratulations on your 10-year milestone as a naturalized US citizen!\n\n**Reporting OCI Card to US Authorities:**\n\nAs a US citizen, you are required to report any changes to your citizenship status or obtainment of a foreign passport to the US Department of State. Since you've obtained an OCI card, which is not a passport, you don't need to report it to the US Department of State. However, it's essential to update your US passport with your new OCI card details.\n\n**Updating Your US Passport:**\n\nTo update your US passport, you'll need to apply for a replacement passport with the new OCI card information. You can do this by mail or in person at a Regional Passport Agency or Center. Here's how:\n\n1. **Form DS-82:** Fill out Form DS-82, \"Application for a Passport by Mail,\" and submit it with your current passport, a photocopy of both sides of your OCI card, and a photocopy of your proof of citizenship (e.g., naturalization certificate or birth certificate).\n2. **Fee:** Pay the applicable fee, currently $110 for a passport book or $40 for a passport card, with a $35 execution fee.\n3. **Submit:** Mail your application to the address listed on the form or submit it in person at a Regional Passport Agency or Center.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to use the correct form (DS-82) and follow the instructions carefully to avoid delays.\n* If you have any issues or questions, you can contact the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 or [npic@state.gov](mailto:npic@state.gov).\n* It's a good idea to keep a digital copy of your OCI card and other important documents in a secure location, in case you need to access them later.\n\n**Celebrating 10 Years of US Citizenship:**\n\nCongratulations again on this milestone! It's a testament to your hard work and commitment to your new country. Take time to reflect on your journey and the opportunities that US citizenship has brought you. Here's to many more years of growth, exploration, and making the most of your dual citizenship!"

I'd be happy to guide you through the process of applying for a visa for your aunt.\n\n**Visa Options:**\n\nSince your aunt is waiting for her green card application to be processed, she may be eligible for a non-immigrant visa, such as a B2 visitor visa or a K-3/K-4 visa.

      "content": "I'd be happy to clarify the differences between the K-3/K-4 visa and the B2 visitor visa.\n\n**K-3/K-4 Visa:**\n\nThe K-3/K-4 visa is a non-immigrant visa for spouses and unmarried children under 21 of US citizens or permanent residents who are waiting for their immigrant visa petition to be processed. This visa allows them to enter the US while their immigrant visa petition is pending.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Spouse or child of a US citizen or permanent resident:** The K-3/K-4 visa is specifically for spouses and unmarried children under 21 of US citizens or permanent residents who have filed an immigrant visa petition (Form I-130) and are waiting for it to be processed.\n* **Pending immigrant visa petition:** The K-3/K-4 visa is a temporary solution for families who want to be reunited while the immigrant visa petition is pending.\n* **Multiple entries:** K-3/K-4 visa holders can enter the US multiple times while their immigrant visa petition is pending.\n* **Work authorization:** K-3/K-4 visa holders are eligible for work authorization in the US.\n* **Path to permanent residency:** Once the immigrant visa petition is approved, the K-3/K-4 visa holder can apply for an adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident.\n\n**B2 Visitor Visa:**\n\nThe B2 visitor visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals who want to enter the US for a specific period (typically up to 6 months) for tourism, visiting family and friends, or medical treatment.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Temporary stay:** B2 visa holders are allowed to stay in the US for a specific period (typically up to 6 months) and must depart the US before the expiration of their authorized stay.\n* **No work authorization:** B2 visa holders are not eligible for work authorization in the US.\n* **No path to permanent residency:** The B2 visa is a non-immigrant visa and does not provide a direct path to permanent residency.\n\n**Choosing the Right Option:**\n\nConsidering your aunt is waiting for her green card application to be processed, the K-3/K-4 visa might be a more suitable option. This visa allows her to enter the US while her immigrant visa petition is pending, and she can apply for work authorization and eventually adjust her status to become a lawful permanent resident.\n\nHowever, if your aunt only wants to visit you in the US for a short period (typically up to 6 months) without intending to work or pursue permanent residency, the B2 visitor visa might be a better option.\n\n**Consultation:**\n\nTo ensure you choose the right option for your aunt, I recommend consulting with an immigration attorney or expert who can assess your aunt's specific situation and provide personalized guidance.\n\nI hope this clarifies the differences between the K-3/K-4 visa and the B2 visitor visa.
