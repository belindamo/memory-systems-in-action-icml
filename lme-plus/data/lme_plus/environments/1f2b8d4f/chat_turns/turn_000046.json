  "content": "I'm glad you found the tips helpful! I think it's a great idea to do a major clean-out of your bag, especially after a trip. It's a good way to get rid of any unnecessary items and make sure everything is still organized.\n\nI actually did a similar clean-out of my own bag recently, and I was surprised at how much junk I had accumulated. I ended up donating some old books and a spare umbrella to a local charity, which felt great.\n\nBy the way, have you thought about getting your bag repaired? You mentioned earlier that one of the straps was starting to fray, and I think it's a good idea to get it fixed before it gets worse.",
