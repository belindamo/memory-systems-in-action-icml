  "content": "The balance of payment on the current account is a measure of a country's net trade in goods and services. It is calculated by subtracting the value of a country's imports from the value of its exports. In the case of Nigeria, the country's reliance on petroleum exports means that fluctuations in the global price of oil can have a significant impact on its balance of payment on the current account.\n\nOne of the pros of having a strong balance of payment on the current account is that it can lead to an overall surplus in the country's balance of payments. This can be beneficial because it indicates that the country is earning more from its exports than it is spending on its imports. This surplus can then be used to pay off foreign debts or to invest in other sectors of the economy.\n\nHowever, there are also some potential downsides to relying heavily on a single export commodity like Nigeria does with petroleum. For example, if the global price of oil were to decline, as it did in 2014, this could lead to a significant decline in Nigeria's exports and a corresponding decline in its balance of payment on the current account. This could lead to a decline in the value of the country's currency, making imports more expensive and potentially leading to economic difficulties.\n\nAdditionally, relying heavily on a single export commodity can also make a country vulnerable to shifts in global demand. If the world were to shift towards using alternative energy sources, for example, this could lead to a decline in demand for oil and a corresponding decline in Nigeria's exports.\n\nIn conclusion, while a strong balance of payment on the current account can be beneficial for a country like Nigeria, relying heavily on a single export commodity like petroleum can also leave the country vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. It is important for Nigeria to diversify its economy and exports in order to mitigate these risks and ensure long-term economic stability.",
