Here are some tips to help you make the most out of your new backpack's features:\n\n1. **Categorize and group similar items**: Divide your belongings into categories like school/work supplies, tech gadgets, snacks, water bottle, and personal items. This will help you decide which compartment to use for each group.\n2. **Assign a home for each item**: Designate a specific compartment or pocket for each item, such as a dedicated spot for your laptop, phone, wallet, and keys.
