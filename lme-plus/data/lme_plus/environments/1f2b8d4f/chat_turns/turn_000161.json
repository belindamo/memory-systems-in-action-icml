It's better to be safe than sorry, and taking the time to measure carefully will save you from potential frustration and returns.\n\nRemember to also consider the functionality and accessibility of the shoe rack in your closet. Think about how you'll be using the rack, how often you'll need to access your shoes, and whether the rack will be easy to clean and maintain.\n\nIf you're still unsure or have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help. Good luck with your shopping trip, and I hope you find the perfect shoe rack for your closet!\n\n(And don't forget to take advantage of Bed Bath & Beyond's return policy if you do need to make any changes or adjustments. They're usually very accommodating, and it's always better to be safe than sorry!)",
