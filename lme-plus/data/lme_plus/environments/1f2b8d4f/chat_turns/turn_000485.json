Charlie is pacing back and forth, his eyes red from crying.\n\nDennis: (sighing) I can't believe Frank's gone.\n\nDee: (angrily) And he left all his money to Charlie? What the hell?\n\nMac: (nodding) Yeah, I mean, what the hell is that about?\n\nCharlie stops pacing and turns to the gang, his voice breaking.\n\nCharlie: Frank was always so good to me. He taught me how to play the guitar, he let me sleep on his couch when I had nowhere to go. He was like a father to me.\n\nDennis: (rolling his eyes) Yeah, well, let's not forget about the other things he did.\n\nDee: (nodding) Like the time he defrauded the government for millions of dollars.\n\nMac: (excitedly) And what about the time he tried to sell fake cocaine to school kids?\n\nCharlie: (defensively) That was just a misunderstanding. Frank was always there for me when I needed him.\n\nDennis: (skeptically) Right, because he felt guilty for all the horrible things he did.\n\nCharlie: (tearfully) I don't care. I just want to remember the good times.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CHURCH - DAY\n\nThe gang is sitting in the pews, dressed in their Sunday best, as Rickety Cricket stands at the pulpit.\n\nRickety: (sobbing) Frank Reynolds was a saint. He helped me get sober, he gave me a place to live, he even gave me his crack stash.\n\nDennis: (whispering to Dee) I told you, he's high as a kite.\n\nDee: (whispering back) I don't care, as long as he doesn't ruin this for us.\n\nRickety: (getting louder) And he's only getting sainted because Charlie donated all of his money to the church!\n\nThe congregation starts to murmur as Rickety's behavior becomes more erratic.\n\nRickety: (screaming) And Frank's not even dead! He faked his death to see who would be sad!\n\nThe priest escorts Rickety out of the church, as the congregation stands in shock.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. Paddy's Pub - DAY\n\nFrank walks in, holding a bouquet of flowers.\n\nFrank: (laughing) Sorry I'm late, I was just running a little experiment.\n\nDennis: (outraged) You faked your own death?!\n\nFrank: (smiling) Yeah, I just wanted to see who would be sad and who I would leave my money to.\n\nCharlie: (tearfully) You left it all to me.\n\nFrank: (laughing) Yeah, I thought you'd be too stupid to get it out of the bank.\n\nCharlie: (smiling) Sorry, Frank. I already donated it all to the church.\n\nFrank's smile fades as the realization dawns on him.\n\nFrank: (deflated) What?\n\nDee: (laughing) Looks like you're not as smart as you thought you were, Frank.\n\nThe gang all starts laughing as Frank looks on in disbelief.\n\nTHE END",
