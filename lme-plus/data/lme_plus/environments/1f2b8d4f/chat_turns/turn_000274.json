  "content": "Since Usain Bolt set the world record in the 100-meter sprint in 2009, several sprinters have come close to breaking it, but none have been able to surpass it yet. The closest anyone has come is Usain Bolt himself. At the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Bolt ran the 100-meter final in 9.63 seconds, which is the second-fastest time ever recorded. However, this was still 0.05 seconds slower than his own world record. Other fast sprinters like Justin Gatlin, Christian Coleman, and Yohan Blake have also come close to breaking the world record, but they have not been able to do so yet.",
