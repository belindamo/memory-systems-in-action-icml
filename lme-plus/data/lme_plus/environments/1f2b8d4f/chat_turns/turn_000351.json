Scan your items as usual\n2. Enter your phone number or swipe your loyalty card to log in to your account\n3. Follow the prompts to apply any digital coupons or redeem your rewards\n4. Pay for your groceries and complete your transaction\n\nThe self-checkout lane will automatically apply any discounts or rewards associated with your loyalty card. You'll earn points on your purchase and redeem any rewards you've accumulated, just like you would at a regular checkout lane.\n\nHowever, if you need assistance or have any issues with your loyalty card or rewards, you may want to visit a regular checkout lane where a cashier can help you.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transaction, make sure your loyalty card is registered and up-to-date, and that you have the latest version of the ShopRite mobile app (if you use it).\n\nNow, you can enjoy the convenience of the self-checkout lane while still earning points and redeeming your rewards!",
