  "content": "The scene starts with the Gang sitting in Paddy's Pub, looking somber and sad. Charlie is beside himself with sadness, tears streaming down his face as he thinks about all the wonderful things Frank has done for him. Dennis and Dee are sitting across from him, fuming about the fact that Frank left all of his money to Charlie and not them.\n\nAs they sit there, Mac enters the bar, looking worried. \"Guys, I've got some bad news,\" he says. \"I just got a call from the hospital, and Frank's dead.\"\n\nThe Gang is shocked, and Charlie starts to weep uncontrollably. \"Why would Frank leave all of his money to me?\" he says, between sobs. \"I'm just a simple janitor.\"\n\nDennis and Dee's expressions turn from sadness to anger. \"What the hell, Charlie?\" Dennis says. \"Frank left all of his money to you? That doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nSuddenly, the door to the bar opens and Rickety Cricket walks in, looking much better than the last time they saw him. \"Good news, guys,\" he says, beaming. \"I just joined the church, and I heard that Frank is going to be canonized.\"\n\nThe Gang looks at each other in disbelief, and then all look at Charlie, who is still crying. \"What do you mean Frank is going to be a saint?\" Dennis asks.\n\n\"Well, Charlie donated all of Frank's money to the church,\" Rickety explains, \"and because of that, they're making Frank a saint.\"\n\nThe Gang is stunned, and Charlie starts to look confused. \"What are you talking about, Rickety?\" he says. \"I don't remember donating any money to the church.\"\n\n\"That's because you were high on paint fumes and glue when you did it,\" Rickety says, chuckling. \"But don't worry, I'll show you guys the way to the church. We'll go see Frank become a saint.\"\n\nAs they walk to the church, Rickety's demeanor starts to change. He's acting erratic and wild, and when they arrive at the church, he starts to cause a scene. \"This is all a scam!\" he cries. \"Frank's only getting sainted because Charlie donated all of his money to the church!\"\n\nThe priest tries to quiet Rickety, but he continues to shout, revealing that Frank is actually alive and that he faked his death to see who would be sad and who he would leave his money to.\n\nThe scene ends with the Gang standing outside the church, looking stunned and bewildered as Frank walks up to them, laughing. \"Gotcha!\" he says, cackling.",
