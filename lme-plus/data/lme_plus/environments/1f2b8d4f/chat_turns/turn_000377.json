  "content": "Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have shown promising results in treating several types of lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here is a comparison of the success rates of immunotherapy and targeted therapy versus traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy:\n\n1. Immunotherapy: Several immunotherapy drugs, including checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have shown considerable success in treating advanced NSCLC. These drugs work by releasing the brakes of the immune system, allowing T-cells to attack cancer cells. The success rate of these drugs varies depending on the patient's response to treatment, but many patients have experienced durable responses with 20-40% of patients with advanced NSCLC responding to treatment.\n\n2. Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy drugs, such as erlotinib and crizotinib, have shown impressive results in treating patients with specific genetic mutations in their cancer cells, such as EGFR or ALK. The success rate of targeted therapies varies depending on the patient's specific mutation and how advanced the cancer is or whether there has been any recurrence.\n\n3. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is a more traditional treatment approach for lung cancer and is typically prescribed for patients with advanced stage, extensive disease or metastatic NSCLC or sensitive small-cell lung cancer. Although chemotherapy still plays a role in lung cancer management, it often provides limited success rates from 30%-40% with severe side effects that can negatively affect a patient's quality of life.\n\n4. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy alone or combined with chemotherapy is typically prescribed for patients with locally advanced disease. When cancer is widespread or advanced, radiation may only be used palliatively to relieve symptoms like pain, shortness of breath, or coughing.\n\nIt is vital to note that every patient's situation is unique, and the choice of treatment will depend on various factors such as the stage of the cancer, the location of the cancer, the age and health of the patient, genetic mutations in tumor DNA among others, as well as the success rates of each therapy. Your healthcare provider can explain to you the various options available and together pick the right course of treatment for the best possible outcome.",
