  "content": "Yes, there are a number of LGBTQ+ athletes and coaches who are making an impact in ice hockey. One notable example is Harrison Browne, who became the first openly transgender player in professional North American team sports when he played for the Buffalo Beauts of the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) from 2016-2018. Browne played a significant role in raising awareness about transgender athletes in sports and has become a prominent advocate for LGBTQ+ inclusion in the sport.\n\nAnother example is Angela James, a former Canadian player who is widely considered one of the best players in women's hockey history. James is openly gay, and her success as a player helped to break down barriers for LGBTQ+ individuals in the sport.\n\nIn terms of coaches, there is currently one openly gay head coach in the NHL: Jared Bednar, who coaches the Colorado Avalanche. Bednar has been open about his sexuality and has been praised for his leadership and coaching abilities.\n\nWhile there is still work to be done in terms of increasing LGBTQ+ representation in ice hockey, these trailblazers and others like them serve as role models and inspire inclusion and acceptance in the sport.",
