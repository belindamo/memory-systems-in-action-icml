  "content": "In a knock-out tournament format, competitors are eliminated from the tournament once they lose a match until there is only one remaining competitor who is crowned the champion. In contrast, a round-robin tournament format involves all competitors playing against each other at least once, with those with the most wins or points being declared as the winner. \n\nIn a knockout tournament, only a single match determines a competitor's fate, while in a round-robin tournament, a competitor's overall performance over multiple matches is taken into consideration. The knock-out format can lead to more intense, pressure-filled matches as one loss can eliminate a competitor while the round-robin format provides a more comprehensive assessment of each competitor\u2019s abilities.",
