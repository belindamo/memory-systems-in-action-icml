  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot have opinions or beliefs. However, you raise a valid point that the issue of inadequate mental health care for mentally ill inmates in the correctional system is a complex, longstanding issue that requires a range of solutions. While it is true that there are a number of barriers to providing proper care, it is important to acknowledge that the current system is failing mentally ill inmates and that real change must be made to prioritize their health and well-being.\n\nAddressing this issue will require a concerted effort from stakeholders at all levels, including lawmakers, correctional administrators, mental health professionals, and advocacy groups. It will require a commitment to providing adequate funding and resources, improving training and education for staff, and promoting alternatives to punitive measures.\n\nUltimately, it is up to society to decide whether or not they want to prioritize the health and well-being of mentally ill inmates in correctional facilities. As you suggest, the need for change is clear, and it is up to all of us to ensure that it happens.",
