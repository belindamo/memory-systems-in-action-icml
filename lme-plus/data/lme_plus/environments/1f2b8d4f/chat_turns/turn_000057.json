Here are some suggestions on how you can further immerse yourself:\n\n1. Watch TV or movies in the language you're learning: Look for TV shows, movies, or videos that are in your partner's language. With subtitles on, this is a great way to improve your comprehension and pick up new vocabulary.\n\n2. Listen to music and podcasts: Listening to music in the language you're learning can help you learn new words and phrases. Podcasts are great too, as they use real-life conversations in the language, helping you practice comprehension and understanding.\n\n3. Read books or articles: Read books or articles in the language you're learning. If you can't find books in your reading level, start with children's books first or magazines.\n\n4. Attend cultural events: Participate in events that showcase your partner's culture, like festivals or concerts, where you will be exposed to the language, food, and customs.\n\n5. Practice with native speakers: Interact with native speakers in social settings and practice speaking in real-life situations.\n\nRemember, every little bit counts, even if it's just a song, a movie, or a conversation. Immersing yourself in the language and culture can be a fun and effective way to deepen your understanding and improve your language skills.",
