I'd be happy to guide you through the process of applying for a visa for your aunt.\n\n**Visa Options:**\n\nSince your aunt is waiting for her green card application to be processed, she may be eligible for a non-immigrant visa, such as a B2 visitor visa or a K-3/K-4 visa. Here's a brief overview of these options:\n\n* **B2 Visitor Visa:** For a short-term visit (typically up to 6 months) for tourism, visiting family and friends, or medical treatment.\n* **K-3/K-4 Visa:** For spouses and unmarried children under 21 of US citizens or permanent residents, allowing them to enter the US while their immigrant visa petition is pending.\n\n**Application Process:**\n\nThe application process involves filing a petition with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), followed by a visa application at a US embassy or consulate. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Form I-130:** File Form I-130, \"Petition for Alien Relative,\" with USCIS to establish your aunt's relationship with you as a US citizen.\n2. **Form I-131:** File Form I-131, \"Application for Travel Document,\" with USCIS to request a visa for your aunt.\n3. **DS-160:** Your aunt will need to complete Form DS-160, \"Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application,\" and pay the applicable fee.\n4. **Schedule Interview:** Schedule an interview at a US embassy or consulate in your aunt's home country.\n5. **Required Documents:** Gather required documents, including:\n\t* Passport with at least 6 months' validity\n\t* Birth certificate\n\t* Proof of relationship (e.g., birth certificate, marriage certificate)\n\t* Proof of income or financial support\n\t* Police certificate (if required)\n\t* Medical examination (if required)\n\t* Proof of strong ties to her home country (e.g., job, property, family)\n6. **Interview and Approval:** Your aunt will attend the interview, and if approved, her visa will be issued.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* Ensure all documents are in English or accompanied by an English translation.\n* Use a high-quality scanner to upload clear and legible documents.\n* Make sure to sign the application form and supporting documents where required.\n* Processing times may vary, so apply well in advance of your aunt's planned visit.\n* Your aunt should be prepared to answer questions about her application, her relationship with you, and her plans during her visit.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* US Department of State: [travel.state.gov](http://travel.state.gov)\n* US Citizenship and Immigration Services: [uscis.gov](http://uscis.gov)\n* US Embassy or Consulate: [usembassy.gov](http://usembassy.gov) (find the embassy or consulate in your aunt's home country)\n\nI hope this guide helps you navigate the process of applying for a visa for your aunt.
