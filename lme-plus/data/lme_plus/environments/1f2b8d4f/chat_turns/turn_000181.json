  "content": "I'd be happy to clarify the differences between the K-3/K-4 visa and the B2 visitor visa.\n\n**K-3/K-4 Visa:**\n\nThe K-3/K-4 visa is a non-immigrant visa for spouses and unmarried children under 21 of US citizens or permanent residents who are waiting for their immigrant visa petition to be processed. This visa allows them to enter the US while their immigrant visa petition is pending.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Spouse or child of a US citizen or permanent resident:** The K-3/K-4 visa is specifically for spouses and unmarried children under 21 of US citizens or permanent residents who have filed an immigrant visa petition (Form I-130) and are waiting for it to be processed.\n* **Pending immigrant visa petition:** The K-3/K-4 visa is a temporary solution for families who want to be reunited while the immigrant visa petition is pending.\n* **Multiple entries:** K-3/K-4 visa holders can enter the US multiple times while their immigrant visa petition is pending.\n* **Work authorization:** K-3/K-4 visa holders are eligible for work authorization in the US.\n* **Path to permanent residency:** Once the immigrant visa petition is approved, the K-3/K-4 visa holder can apply for an adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident.\n\n**B2 Visitor Visa:**\n\nThe B2 visitor visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals who want to enter the US for a specific period (typically up to 6 months) for tourism, visiting family and friends, or medical treatment.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Temporary stay:** B2 visa holders are allowed to stay in the US for a specific period (typically up to 6 months) and must depart the US before the expiration of their authorized stay.\n* **No work authorization:** B2 visa holders are not eligible for work authorization in the US.\n* **No path to permanent residency:** The B2 visa is a non-immigrant visa and does not provide a direct path to permanent residency.\n\n**Choosing the Right Option:**\n\nConsidering your aunt is waiting for her green card application to be processed, the K-3/K-4 visa might be a more suitable option. This visa allows her to enter the US while her immigrant visa petition is pending, and she can apply for work authorization and eventually adjust her status to become a lawful permanent resident.\n\nHowever, if your aunt only wants to visit you in the US for a short period (typically up to 6 months) without intending to work or pursue permanent residency, the B2 visitor visa might be a better option.\n\n**Consultation:**\n\nTo ensure you choose the right option for your aunt, I recommend consulting with an immigration attorney or expert who can assess your aunt's specific situation and provide personalized guidance.\n\nI hope this clarifies the differences between the K-3/K-4 visa and the B2 visitor visa. If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
