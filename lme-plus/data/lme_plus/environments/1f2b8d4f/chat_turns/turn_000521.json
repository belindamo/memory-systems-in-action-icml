Here's what I found out about their ingredients, including their approach to organic and non-GMO options:\n\n**Organic Ingredients:**\n\nFreshly sources organic ingredients whenever possible, but they don't claim to be a 100% organic service. They prioritize organic options for ingredients that are:\n\n* **High-risk for pesticide residue**: Freshly chooses organic options for ingredients like leafy greens, berries, and apples, which are known to have high levels of pesticide residue when grown conventionally.\n* **Critical to flavor and nutrition**: Freshly selects organic options for ingredients like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers, which are essential to the flavor and nutritional profile of their meals.\n\nWhile they don't disclose the exact percentage of organic ingredients in their meals, Freshly's commitment to sourcing organic options ensures that customers receive high-quality, chemical-free ingredients whenever possible.\n\n**Non-GMO Ingredients:**\n\nFreshly is dedicated to using non-GMO ingredients in their meals. They avoid using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their ingredients, including:\n\n* **GMO corn and soy**: Freshly sources non-GMO corn and soy products to ensure their meals are free from genetically modified organisms.\n* **High-risk GMO ingredients**: Freshly avoids using ingredients that are commonly genetically modified, such as canola oil, sugar beets, and papaya.\n\n**Other Ingredient Commitments:**\n\nIn addition to organic and non-GMO options, Freshly is committed to using:\n\n* **Hormone-free and antibiotic-free proteins**: Freshly sources proteins from farms that raise animals without hormones or antibiotics.\n* **Wild-caught seafood**: Freshly uses wild-caught seafood whenever possible to ensure sustainable and eco-friendly sourcing practices.\n* **No artificial preservatives or additives**: Freshly avoids using artificial preservatives, flavor enhancers, and coloring agents in their meals.\n\n**Supply Chain Transparency:**\n\nFreshly is committed to transparency in their supply chain, which means they work closely with their suppliers to ensure the quality and integrity of their ingredients. They regularly audit their suppliers to ensure compliance with their ingredient standards.\n\nBy prioritizing organic and non-GMO ingredients, Freshly demonstrates their commitment to serving high-quality, nutritious meals that align with customers' values and dietary preferences.",
