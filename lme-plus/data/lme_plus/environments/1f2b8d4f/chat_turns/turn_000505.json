  "content": "The knock-out format does have the potential to favor underdogs because it only takes one win to progress to the next round, even if the opponent is considered to be more dominant or established. In contrast, the round-robin format may give an advantage to the more consistent and dominant teams/players, who have an opportunity to accumulate points over several matches.\n\nIn a knock-out format, less-favored teams/players can rely heavily on just one impressive performance to win a game, while in a round-robin format, they may struggle to keep the same level of performance over multiple matches. However, it's important to note that this is not always the case, as upsets can always occur in any format, and underdogs can sometimes win games or tournaments under any circumstance. Ultimately, the outcome's unpredictability is a huge factor that attracts audiences to sport, regardless of the format.",
