  "content": "Congratulations on your 10-year milestone as a naturalized US citizen!\n\n**Reporting OCI Card to US Authorities:**\n\nAs a US citizen, you are required to report any changes to your citizenship status or obtainment of a foreign passport to the US Department of State. Since you've obtained an OCI card, which is not a passport, you don't need to report it to the US Department of State. However, it's essential to update your US passport with your new OCI card details.\n\n**Updating Your US Passport:**\n\nTo update your US passport, you'll need to apply for a replacement passport with the new OCI card information. You can do this by mail or in person at a Regional Passport Agency or Center. Here's how:\n\n1. **Form DS-82:** Fill out Form DS-82, \"Application for a Passport by Mail,\" and submit it with your current passport, a photocopy of both sides of your OCI card, and a photocopy of your proof of citizenship (e.g., naturalization certificate or birth certificate).\n2. **Fee:** Pay the applicable fee, currently $110 for a passport book or $40 for a passport card, with a $35 execution fee.\n3. **Submit:** Mail your application to the address listed on the form or submit it in person at a Regional Passport Agency or Center.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to use the correct form (DS-82) and follow the instructions carefully to avoid delays.\n* If you have any issues or questions, you can contact the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 or [npic@state.gov](mailto:npic@state.gov).\n* It's a good idea to keep a digital copy of your OCI card and other important documents in a secure location, in case you need to access them later.\n\n**Celebrating 10 Years of US Citizenship:**\n\nCongratulations again on this milestone! It's a testament to your hard work and commitment to your new country. Take time to reflect on your journey and the opportunities that US citizenship has brought you. Here's to many more years of growth, exploration, and making the most of your dual citizenship!",
