Dr. Martens are a great investment, and with proper care, they can last for a long time. Here are some tips on how to care for your Dr. Martens:\n\n1. **Clean them regularly**: Use a soft-bristled brush to remove dirt and debris from the surface. For tougher stains, you can use a damp cloth with mild soap. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the leather.\n2. **Condition the leather**: Use a leather conditioner or Dr. Martens' own Wonder Balsam to keep the leather soft and supple. Apply a small amount to a clean cloth and rub it into the leather in circular motions. This will help protect the leather from cracking and drying out.\n3. **Protect them from water**: Dr. Martens are not waterproof, so try to avoid wearing them in wet conditions. If they do get wet, let them air dry slowly and naturally. Avoid using heat to speed up the drying process, as it can cause the leather to crack.\n4. **Use a waterproofing spray**: If you want to add an extra layer of protection, use a waterproofing spray specifically designed for leather. This will help repel water and stains.\n5. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Don't leave your Dr. Martens in a hot car or in freezing temperatures, as this can cause the leather to crack or become brittle.\n6. **Store them properly**: When not in use, store your Dr. Martens in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. You can stuff the shoes with newspaper or paper towels to maintain their shape.\n7. **Consider using a shoe tree**: If you have Dr. Martens with a removable insole, consider using a shoe tree to help maintain the shape of the shoe and prevent creasing.\n8. **Get them serviced regularly**: Just like your sneakers, it's a good idea to take your Dr. Martens to a cobbler every 6-12 months for a professional cleaning and conditioning.\n\nAs for getting your Dr. Martens fixed, it's great that you're thinking about restoration. Depending on the type of repair needed, it may take some time to get them back. Be sure to ask your cobbler for an estimated timeframe and cost before leaving your shoes with them.\n\nRemember to always check the manufacturer's care instructions for specific guidance on caring for your Dr. Martens. With proper care, your Dr. Martens can last for many years and remain a comfortable and stylish addition to your wardrobe.",
