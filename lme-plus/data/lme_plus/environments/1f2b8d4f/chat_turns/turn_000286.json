  "content": "Yes, there are ongoing efforts to increase LGBTQ+ representation in ice hockey. In March 2021, the International Ice Hockey Federation released a new gender equality strategy that includes a focus on promoting inclusivity for LGBTQ+ individuals in the sport. The strategy includes a goal to make ice hockey a safer and more welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ players and coaches, as well as increased representation for LGBTQ+ individuals at all levels of the sport. This includes the creation of resource guides for LGBTQ+ athletes, coaches, and officials, as well as training for individuals and teams on topics such as diversity and inclusion. The IIHF has also partnered with organizations such as You Can Play to promote LGBTQ+ inclusivity in the sport. While there is still work to be done, the IIHF's efforts to promote gender equality and inclusion for LGBTQ+ individuals are encouraging steps towards a more diverse and welcoming sport.",
