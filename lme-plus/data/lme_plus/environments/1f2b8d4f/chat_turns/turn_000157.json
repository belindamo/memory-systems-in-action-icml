  "content": "Both individual cubbies and shelves have their own advantages, so it ultimately depends on your personal preference, shoe collection, and storage needs. Here are some pros and cons of each option to consider:\n\n**Individual Cubbies:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Easy to organize:** Each shoe has its own designated space, making it easy to find and retrieve the pair you want.\n2. **Less clutter:** Cubbies can help prevent shoes from getting jumbled together and reduce clutter in your closet.\n3. **Protection:** Individual cubbies can protect your shoes from scratching or scuffing each other.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Limited flexibility:** Cubbies can be inflexible, making it difficult to store shoes of different sizes or styles.\n2. **Less adaptable:** If you have a lot of shoes with varying heel heights or widths, cubbies might not accommodate them well.\n\n**Shelves:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Flexibility:** Shelves provide more flexibility in terms of storing shoes of different sizes, shapes, and styles.\n2. **Easy to adjust:** You can adjust the spacing between shelves to accommodate shoes with varying heel heights or widths.\n3. **More versatile:** Shelves can be used to store other items like bags, accessories, or even folded clothes.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Clutter prone:** Shelves can lead to clutter if not maintained regularly, as shoes can get jumbled together.\n2. **More difficult to organize:** Without individual compartments, shelves can make it harder to find a specific pair of shoes.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide between individual cubbies and shelves:\n\n* Do you have a lot of shoes with similar sizes and styles? Individual cubbies might be a good fit.\n* Do you have a diverse shoe collection with varying sizes, styles, and heel heights? Shelves might provide more flexibility.\n* Are you willing to maintain and organize your shoe collection regularly? Shelves might work well for you.\n* Do you prefer a more structured and organized system? Individual cubbies could be the way to go.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could consider a hybrid option that combines individual cubbies with shelves. This can offer the best of both worlds, providing structure and flexibility.\n\nTake a closer look at the shoe rack you saw at Bed Bath & Beyond and consider your specific needs. If you're still unsure, you could always ask a sales associate for their opinion or do some online research to find the perfect shoe rack for you!",
