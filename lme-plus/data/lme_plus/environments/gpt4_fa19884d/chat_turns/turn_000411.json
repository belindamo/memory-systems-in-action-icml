Keep in mind that even in these less crowded areas, it's still important to book your campsite in advance, especially during peak season. Here are the filtered recommendations:\n\n1. **Mount Laguna Campground**: Located in the Cleveland National Forest, this campground is a bit more remote and offers scenic views of the surrounding mountains. Hike to the Laguna Mountain Recreation Area or explore the Pacific Crest Trail.\n2. **Dorst Creek Campground** in Sequoia National Park: While Sequoia is a popular destination, Dorst Creek is a more secluded campground compared to Lodgepole. It's surrounded by forest and offers access to hiking trails like the Alta Peak Trail.\n3. **Azalea Campground** in Kings Canyon National Park: This campground is located in a more remote area of the park, surrounded by giant sequoias. Hike to the General Grant Tree, Zumwalt Meadow, or explore the Cedar Grove area.\n4. **Julian Farm and Orchard**: This campground is located in the Cuyamaca Mountains, about an hour east of San Diego. It's a more secluded spot with campsites surrounded by apple orchards and hiking trails.\n5. **Manresa State Beach Campground**: This campground is located in Santa Cruz County and offers campsites with ocean views. It's a bit more off the beaten path compared to other coastal campgrounds, and you can hike to the nearby Sandhills Trail or explore the beach.\n6. **Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park**: This campground is located in the Santa Cruz Mountains and offers campsites surrounded by redwoods. It's a more secluded spot with hiking trails like the Berry Creek Falls Trail and the Redwood Grove Trail.\n7. **Plaskett Creek Campground** in Big Sur: This campground is located in the southern part of Big Sur, away from the more popular campgrounds. It's surrounded by redwoods and offers hiking trails like the Plaskett Creek Trail and the Sand Dollar Beach Trail.\n\nThese campgrounds offer a more secluded experience, but still provide access to hiking trails and scenic views. Enjoy your trip!",
