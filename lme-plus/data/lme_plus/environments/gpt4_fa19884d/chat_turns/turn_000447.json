  "content": "That's great to hear that you're interested in improving your acting skills! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't provide specific recommendations for acting schools or instructors in your area.\n\nBut I can offer some general advice on how to find a good acting school or instructor:\n\n1. Research online: Look for acting schools or instructors in your area and read reviews from past students to get an idea of their reputation and teaching style.\n2. Ask for referrals: Reach out to friends, family, or colleagues who have taken acting classes and ask for recommendations.\n3. Check credentials: Look for instructors who have a degree in acting or a related field, and who have experience in the industry.\n4. Observe a class: Many acting schools offer observation classes or trial sessions. Take advantage of these to get a sense of the instructor's teaching style and the class environment.\n5. Look for variety: Consider schools or instructors who offer a range of classes, including improvisation, scene study, and audition technique.\n\nIt's great that you've already taken a workshop with the local theater company and enjoyed it! You may want to consider taking more classes or workshops with them, or exploring other opportunities in your area.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try searching online for acting schools or instructors in your area, or checking websites like Actors Access or Backstage for classes and workshops.\n\nRemember to always research and vet any school or instructor before committing to classes, and don't be afraid to ask questions or try out a few different options before finding the one that's right for you. Good luck!",
