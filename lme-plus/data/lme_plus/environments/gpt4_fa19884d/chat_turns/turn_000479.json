  "content": "I'd be happy to help you keep track of your medication schedule! Sorry to hear you're dealing with a persistent cough - hopefully, the adjusted medication will help alleviate your symptoms.\n\nTo get started, can you please tell me a bit more about your medication schedule? What medication(s) were adjusted on the 10th, and what's the dosage and frequency you're supposed to take them? Are there any specific times of day you need to take them, or any special instructions (e.g., with food, before bed)? Additionally, do you have any other medications you're taking that aren't related to your cough?\n\nLet's get all the details down, and I can help you create a schedule to ensure you don't miss any doses!",
