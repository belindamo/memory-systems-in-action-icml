  "content": "As per Hinduism, an individual's karma can affect their present life and future reincarnations. However, it does not mean that someone with bad karma is doomed to have a bad life forever. \n\nOne must understand that karma is not just about actions alone but the intention behind them. Therefore, it is possible for someone with bad karma to change their intentions and start performing good deeds, resulting in good karma. Also, it is believed that the effects of one's karma can be mitigated through certain practices like penance, charity, and devotion.\n\nIn Hinduism, ultimate liberation from the cycle of birth and death is achieved through the attainment of Moksha, by living a life of good deeds that causes good karma. So, it is possible for anyone to improve their karma by living a righteous life, following their dharma, and doing good actions.",
