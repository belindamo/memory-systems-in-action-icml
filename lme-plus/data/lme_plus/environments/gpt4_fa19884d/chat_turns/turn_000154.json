  "content": "The Great Wall of China was effective in slowing down invading forces, forcing them to navigate difficult terrain and face Chinese defenders.

The wall was also used as a means of controlling trade, and revenue was collected from those who passed through its checkpoints. Despite its limitations, the Great Wall remains a remarkable feat of engineering and a symbol of China's rich history and culture.",
