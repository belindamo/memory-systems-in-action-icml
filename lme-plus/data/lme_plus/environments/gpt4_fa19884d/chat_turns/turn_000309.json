This can result in more abstract or geometric patterns and a greater emphasis on calligraphy and other forms of non-representational decorative elements.\n- Use of natural materials: Middle Eastern design also often incorporates natural materials such as pottery, leather, and woven fabrics, which are more common in the region.\n- Focus on modernity: Western design styles tend to be more focused on modern, sleek aesthetics, while Middle Eastern design often incorporates elements of traditional and historical design styles.\n- Different cultural influences: While both styles draw on a rich cultural history, Western design is often influenced by European cultural traditions, while Middle Eastern design is influenced by the history of the Islamic world.",
