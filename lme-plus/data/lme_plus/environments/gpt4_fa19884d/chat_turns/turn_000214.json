One example of a conservation project that involved Indigenous communities and their traditional knowledge is the Bathurst Caribou Range Plan, which was developed in partnership with the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb Government, Northwest Territories, and the Government of Canada.\n\nThe Bathurst Caribou Range is an important migratory route for the Bathurst herd of barren-ground caribou, which is an important food and cultural resource for Indigenous communities in the area. In the 1990s, the population of the Bathurst herd began to decline due to habitat loss and changes in predator-prey dynamics.\n\nTo address this issue, the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb Government and other Indigenous groups worked with researchers and conservationists to develop the Bathurst Caribou Range Plan. This plan was based on a combination of scientific research and traditional knowledge, and it aimed to balance the needs of the caribou with the needs of local communities and industries.\n\nThe plan included measures to protect key caribou habitats, such as limiting industrial activities and road construction, improving monitoring programs, and implementing a harvest management plan. It also promoted the use of traditional ecological knowledge in monitoring and management efforts.\n\nThrough this project, Indigenous communities were able to contribute important knowledge and perspectives to conservation efforts, while also ensuring that their cultural and economic needs were taken into consideration. The Bathurst Caribou Range Plan is considered to be a successful example of community-led conservation, and it has helped to stabilize the population of the Bathurst herd.",
