  "content": "The concept of dharma is deeply rooted in Hindu tradition and has been present in Indian society for thousands of years, and it has been interpreted and practiced in various ways in modern Indian society. With modernization came individualism, which is the idea of putting individual needs and wants ahead of the broader societal context. \n\nIn today's India, a more significant emphasis is placed on individualism than it was in the past, but the concept of dharma is still prevalent, especially in rural areas or amongst families that uphold beliefs that have been passed down through multiple generations. \n\nDharma, as a concept, provides a framework for individuals to understand their roles and obligations in society. In modern society, instead of being determined solely by the caste system, dharma is more flexible, and individuals can choose how they want to contribute to society while still fulfilling their responsibilities. \n\nMany Indian modern philosophers suggest that individuals should seek to balance their needs and desires with social responsibilities and obligations, which aligns with the concept of dharma. hence, they argue that each individual should strive to fulfill their dharma while still striving for personal goals, leading to a fulfilling life for themselves as well as contributing to the greater good of society.",
