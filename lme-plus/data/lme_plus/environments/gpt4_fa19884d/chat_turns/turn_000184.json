  "content": "Karma is a fundamental concept in Hinduism that refers to the law of cause and effect. It is based on the idea that every action a person takes will have consequences that determine their future experiences. Positive actions result in good karma, while negative actions result in bad karma. One's karma can affect their present life and future reincarnations.\n\nDharma, on the other hand, revolves around the idea of duty, morality, and righteousness. It refers to the ethical and moral code that governs an individual's behavior, duties, and responsibilities. Dharma is closely linked to karma, as acting according to one's dharma is believed to result in good karma.\n\nIn Hinduism, a person's dharma is determined by a variety of factors, including their caste, gender, occupation, and stage of life. Each person has a duty to maintain social order, uphold tradition and maintain spiritual purity.\n\nOverall, both karma and dharma are essential aspects of Hinduism, with karma determining the consequences of one's actions and dharma providing guidance for how to live a moral and ethical life.",
