Having a dedicated space for bench exercises will definitely help you take your workouts to the next level and provide a comfortable and convenient way to fit in a workout at home.\n\nIt's also great that you're thinking about progressive overload and wanting to challenge yourself with heavier weights. Remember to always prioritize proper form and technique, and don't be afraid to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the load as you build strength.\n\nAlso, don't forget to mix up your routine and try new exercises to avoid plateaus. You can always explore new workout routines and exercises online or consult with a personal trainer to get new ideas and inspiration.\n\nKeep up the great work, and I'm sure you'll see continued progress and success in your fitness journey!",
