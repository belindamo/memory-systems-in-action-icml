  "content": "The Barclays Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard is a great choice, especially if you've had good experiences with Barclays in the past. You'll earn 2x miles on all purchases, and the 70,000-mile bonus after spending $5,000 in the first 90 days is a fantastic offer.\n\nRegarding your Delta SkyMiles, unfortunately, you cannot transfer them directly to Flying Blue. Delta SkyMiles and Air France/KLM Flying Blue are two separate loyalty programs, and they don't have a direct transfer partnership.\n\nHowever, there are a few workarounds:\n\n1. **Transfer to a common partner:** Delta has partnerships with hotels like Hilton Honors and Marriott Bonvoy. If you transfer your SkyMiles to one of these hotel programs, you might be able to transfer those points to Flying Blue. Keep in mind that transfer ratios and policies can vary.\n2. **Use a points broker:** There are some third-party points brokers that allow you to buy or sell miles. You could potentially sell your Delta SkyMiles to a broker and then use the cash to purchase Flying Blue miles. However, be cautious when dealing with third-party brokers, as some may not be reputable.\n3. **Keep earning with Delta:** If you frequently fly with Delta or have upcoming travel plans with them, it might be worth keeping your SkyMiles and using them for award redemptions within the Delta ecosystem.\n\nKeep in mind that transferring miles between programs can be complex, and it's essential to understand the transfer ratios, fees, and policies before making a move.\n\nNow, back to the Barclays Arrival Plus card: With your good experience with Barclays, you'll likely have a smooth application process. Just make sure to meet the spending requirement to earn the 70,000-mile bonus.",
