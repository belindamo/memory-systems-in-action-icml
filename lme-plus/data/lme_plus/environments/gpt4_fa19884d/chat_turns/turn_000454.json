  "content": "The Q&A session was really engaging, and the lead actor was very charismatic and open about his process. He shared some interesting stories about the challenges of playing the Phantom and how he prepared for the role. It was also great to hear about his experiences working with the rest of the cast and crew.\n\nAs for improv techniques, I noticed that he used a lot of active listening and responded truthfully to the audience's questions. He also seemed to be very comfortable with silence and didn't feel the need to fill every moment with talk, which made his responses feel more thoughtful and considered.\n\nI was thinking it might be helpful to practice active listening in my own improv scenes, and to focus on responding truthfully to my scene partners rather than trying to come up with a \"funny\" or \"clever\" response. Do you have any tips on how to practice active listening in improv?",
