I have a few vintage vases that I think would complement the locket nicely, and I can place them around it to form a triangle shape. I'll also try to balance the heights and visual weights of the items to create a sense of harmony. Do you have any advice on how to add some greenery to the vignette? I have some eucalyptus and ferns that I think would add a nice touch.",
