  "content": "Neutral sandals are a fantastic choice to pair with a yellow sundress.\n\nA 2-3 inch heel can be a great option for an outdoor wedding, but it depends on a few factors:\n\n1. **Terrain**: If the wedding is on a grassy or uneven surface, a lower heel or flat sandals might be a better choice to ensure you can walk comfortably and safely. A higher heel might sink into the grass or get stuck in cracks.\n2. **Wedding style**: If the wedding is a more formal or elegant affair, a 2-3 inch heel could be suitable. However, if the wedding has a more casual or rustic vibe, a flat sandal might be a better fit.\n3. **Your comfort level**: If you're comfortable walking in heels and don't mind a bit of added height, a 2-3 inch heel could work well. However, if you're worried about stability or prefer a more relaxed look, flat sandals might be the way to go.\n4. **Dress length**: If your sundress is shorter, a heeled sandal can create a more balanced look. If your dress is longer, a flat sandal might be a better choice to avoid overwhelming the overall silhouette.\n\nUltimately, a 2-3 inch heel can be a great option for an outdoor wedding, but it's essential to consider the above factors. If you're still unsure, you could also consider a block heel or a wedge sandal, which can provide added support and stability.\n\nDo you have any other questions or concerns about choosing the perfect sandals for the wedding?",
