  "content": "Acne can be frustrating, but it's great that you're taking proactive steps to address it. Adding new products to your routine can definitely help. Here are some recommendations that might complement your weekly face mask:\n\n**Cleansers:**\n\n1. **Benzoyl Peroxide-based cleanser**: Look for a gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser containing 2-2.5% benzoyl peroxide, like Neutrogena's Acne Treatment Gel Cleanser or Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid.\n2. **Salicylic Acid-based cleanser**: Try a cleanser with 0.5-2% salicylic acid, like CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser or Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.\n\n**Spot Treatments:**\n\n1. **Tea Tree Oil**: Apply a few drops of tea tree oil to individual pimples using a cotton swab, like The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil.\n2. **Sulfur-based products**: Sulfur can help reduce acne and inflammation. Try a spot treatment containing sulfur, like Mario Badescu Drying Lotion or Sunday Riley Power Couple.\n\n**Moisturizers:**\n\n1. **Non-comedogenic moisturizer**: Look for a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that won't clog pores, like Neutrogena Hydrating Facial Moisturizer or Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream.\n2. **Moisturizer with Niacinamide**: Niacinamide can help improve skin elasticity and reduce acne. Try a moisturizer with 5% niacinamide, like Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream or La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid.\n\n**Exfoliants:**\n\n1. **Chemical exfoliants**: Use a product containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) 2-3 times a week to help unclog pores and reduce acne. Examples include Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid or The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution.\n2. **Physical exfoliants**: Use a gentle physical exfoliant 1-2 times a week, like a konjac sponge or a gentle scrub containing round jojoba beads, like Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Be consistent**: Stick to your skincare routine and give your skin time to adjust (at least 4-6 weeks).\n2. **Use sunscreen daily**: UV rays can exacerbate acne, so use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily.\n3. **Don't over-exfoliate**: Be gentle with your skin, and avoid over-exfoliating, which can lead to irritation and more acne.\n4. **Keep your hands away**: Try to avoid touching your face, as this can transfer bacteria and oils to your skin, causing more acne.\n\nRemember, everyone's skin is different, so it may take some trial and error to find the right products and routine that work for you. If your acne persists or worsens, consider consulting a dermatologist for personalized advice.",
