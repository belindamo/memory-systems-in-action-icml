The decision to proceed with the Olympics despite concerns about the pandemic was criticized by some who felt that the event was being given more priority than public health.\n\n2. 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics: The participation of North Korea in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was seen as a sign of political reconciliation between North and South Korea. However, some felt that the North Korean regime was using the occasion as a propaganda tool to promote its regime.\n\n3. 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics: The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia were overshadowed by controversy surrounding the country's anti-gay laws. Some accused the Russian government of using the Olympics as a platform to promote its conservative social agenda.\n\n4. 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics: The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics have faced controversy due to concerns over human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region, as well as the country's treatment of Hong Kong and Taiwan.
