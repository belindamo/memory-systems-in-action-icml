  "content": "Yes, I completely agree. Prioritizing mental health and well-being should be an integral part of the university experience, both during and after the pandemic. It is important to break down the stigma surrounding mental health and create a culture where seeking help and support is encouraged and seen as a sign of strength.\n\nBy investing in mental health services and resources, universities can support the academic success, personal growth, and overall wellness of their students and faculty. Furthermore, fostering a supportive and caring environment can positively influence the overall sense of community within universities, leading to greater engagement and feeling of connection.\n\nCreating such a culture of mental health and well-being takes time and effort, but the potential benefits for students, faculty and staff make it a crucial step that universities must take.",
