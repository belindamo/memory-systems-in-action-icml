As a beginner, it's essential to start with exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, are easy to learn, and don't require a lot of equipment. Here are some beginner-friendly strength training exercises and tips to get you started:\n\n**Upper Body:**\n\n1. **Push-ups**: A classic exercise that targets chest, shoulders, and triceps. Start with modified push-ups on your knees if regular push-ups are too challenging.\n2. **Bicep Curls**: Use dumbbells or a barbell to work your biceps. Start with lighter weights and focus on proper form.\n3. **Tricep Dips**: Use a bench or chair to work your triceps.\n4. **Shoulder Press**: Use dumbbells or a barbell to work your shoulders.\n\n**Lower Body:**\n\n1. **Squats**: A compound exercise that targets legs, glutes, and core. Start with bodyweight squats and progress to weighted squats.\n2. **Lunges**: Works legs, glutes, and core. Start with bodyweight lunges and progress to weighted lunges.\n3. **Calf Raises**: Use bodyweight or weights to work your calf muscles.\n\n**Core:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds to engage your core, shoulders, and back.\n2. **Russian twists**: Use a weight or medicine ball to target your obliques.\n\n**Tips for Beginners:**\n\n1. **Start with lighter weights**: Focus on proper form and technique over heavy weights.\n2. **Begin with 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps**: Gradually increase sets, reps, and weight as you build strength.\n3. **Warm up and cool down**: Always warm up with 5-10 minutes of cardio and stretching, and cool down with static stretches after your workout.\n4. **Focus on compound exercises**: Exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once are efficient and effective.\n5. **Listen to your body**: Rest when needed, and don't push yourself too hard.
