(3 sets of 12 reps)\n2. **Bent-Over Rows**: Hold dumbbells or a barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend your knees slightly, and lift the weight to your sides until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. (3 sets of 12 reps)\n3. **Superman**: Lie on your stomach with your arms extended in front of you, lift your arms, shoulders, and legs off the ground, holding for 3-5 seconds. (3 sets of 12 reps)\n\n**Glute Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend your knees and lower your body down until your thighs are parallel to the ground.
