  "content": "The caste system has been legally abolished in India and is gaining far less relevance and acceptance than it did in the past. However, caste continues to play a role in Indian society, and discrimination based on caste continues to exist, albeit in subtle ways in many spheres of life. \n\nIn modern India, the government has enacted laws to end caste-based discrimination, and there have been several programs aimed at uplifting the socio-economic conditions of the lower-caste people, for instance, through affirmative action programs like reservation in educational institutions and government jobs. These initiatives have helped to provide equal opportunities for people belonging to lower castes.\n\nMoreover, with modernization, urbanization, education, and exposure to global cultures, Indians are becoming more sophisticated about caste-based discrimination, and this mindset change and advocacy from youth are helping to eliminate the differences between different castes. Additionally, the younger generations are more likely to value individual merit based on education or talent than caste.\n\nSo, while the caste system still plays a role in Indian society, there has been progress towards lessening the relevance of the caste system in modern Indian society, and more emphasis is being placed on individualism and equality.",
