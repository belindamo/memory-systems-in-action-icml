  "content": "A yellow sundress sounds lovely for an outdoor wedding! I'd be happy to help you find the perfect shoes to complement your dress. Here are some shoe options to consider:\n\n1. **Neutral Sandals**: A pair of flat or heeled sandals in neutral shades like beige, gold, or silver will let your dress be the star of the show. This is a great option if you want to keep the focus on the dress.\n2. **White or Cream Wedges**: A wedge sandal in white or cream can add a romantic touch to your outfit. This is a nice choice if you want to add some height without overpowering the dress.\n3. **Natural Espadrilles**: Espadrilles in natural colors like beige, jute, or canvas can add a playful, summery vibe to your outfit. They're also a great choice for an outdoor wedding.\n4. **Strappy Heels in a Light Color**: If you want to dress up your outfit, consider a pair of strappy heels in a light color like pale gold, champagne, or blush. This will add a touch of elegance to your overall look.\n5. **Flat Floral Sandals**: If you want to add some extra whimsy to your outfit, look for flat sandals with floral details or embroidery.
