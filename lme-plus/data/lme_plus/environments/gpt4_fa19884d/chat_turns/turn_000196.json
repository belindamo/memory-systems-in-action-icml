  "content": "1/5: The recent $1.7 trillion spending bill signed into law by President Biden shows an increase in cybersecurity spending across the federal government. However, hiring and retaining skilled tech and cyber pros to fulfill the administration's goals remains a challenge. #cybersecurity #government\n\n2/5: The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is set to receive $2.9 billion as part of the bill, an increase of over $300 million from its previous budget. Other increases in spending include $200 million for the Energy Department's Cybersecurity department & $100 million for the Treasury Department's Cybersecurity Enhancement Account. #budget\n\n3/5: The Federal Cyber Workforce Management and Coordinating Working Group published a report in September stating that of the 700,000 open cyber positions in the U.S., 40,000 of these jobs are in the public sector. The cyber job market is expected to grow 13% from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for all occupations. #jobmarket\n\n4/5: The U.S. Government Accountability Office's December report states that the Pentagon spends hundreds of millions of dollars on cybersecurity training, but the armed forces do not have uniform requirements to ensure that personnel remain in service to guarantee the U.S. Defense Department receives its return on investment and retains its talent. #training\n\n5/5: To attract more cybersecurity talent to government work, the government can appeal to a sense of mission and government service as the U.S. continues to build its cyber capabilities. Agencies should also consider allocating a \"cybersecurity champion\" for each department to assist with enforcing security policies and authentically vouch for extra security resources and training when required. #talentattraction #cybersecurityjobs",
