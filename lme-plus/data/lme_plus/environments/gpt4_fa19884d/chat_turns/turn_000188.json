  "content": "Hindus determine their dharma based on various factors like their birth, age, gender, and occupation. The concept of dharma is complex and unique to each individual. It suggests that every person has a specific role to play in society, and their dharma is determined by their nature, their lineage, and their current life situation. So, dharma is typically divided into four categories, which are based on the individual's stage of life or \"Ashrama.\"\n\nThe four stages of dharma, according to Hinduism, are Brahmacharya or the student stage, Grihastha or the householder stage, Vanaprastha, or the retirement stage, and finally, Sannyasa or the renunciation stage. Each stage has specific duties and responsibilities that an individual must fulfill. For example, during the student stage, a person's primary responsibility is the pursuit of knowledge, while in the householder stage, they are expected to work, raise a family and contribute to society.\n\nAlthough dharma is typically determined by one's birth, it is not absolute and can change throughout one's life. For example, if a person was born into a particular profession but later discovers a passion for a different job, they can choose to follow that path and still live according to their dharma. So, unlike caste, dharma is more flexible and dynamic, adapting to the individual's changing circumstances in life.",
