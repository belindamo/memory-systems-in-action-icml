You can use software like Final Draft or Celtx to help you with formatting.\n5. **Character development**: Your characters should be three-dimensional and relatable.

Make sure each character's dialogue is distinct and revealing of their personality.\n8. **Get feedback**: Join a writing group or find a mentor who can give you constructive feedback on your work. Be open to criticism and willing to make changes.\n9. **Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite**: Scriptwriting is rewriting. Don't be afraid to make changes and try new things. It's all part of the process.\n10. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you write, the better you'll get. Set aside time to write regularly, and challenge yourself to try new things.\n\nFor the workshop, be prepared to:\n\n* Share your work and receive feedback\n* Learn from industry professionals and ask questions\n* Get guidance on script structure, character development, and dialogue\n* Network with other writers and potentially find collaborators or mentors\n* Learn about the script-to-screen process and what producers and directors look for in a script\n\nSome potential questions to ask during the workshop include:\n\n* What are some common mistakes new screenwriters make, and how can they avoid them?\n* How do you develop a compelling story concept and characters?\n* What's the best way to structure a script for maximum impact?\n* How do you balance action, dialogue, and visuals in a script?\n* What's the process of getting a script produced, and what are the key steps involved?\n\nRemember, scriptwriting takes time, effort, and practice.
