Here's why:\n\n**Associating bed with sleep**: When you do activities like meditation and reading in bed, your brain starts to associate the bed with being awake and active, rather than just for sleep. This can make it harder to fall asleep and can lead to insomnia.\n\n**Bed becomes a multitasking zone**: By doing activities in bed, you're turning it into a multitasking zone, where you're not only sleeping but also reading, meditating, or even watching TV (if you're guilty of that too). This can make it challenging for your brain to fully relax and prepare for sleep.\n\n**Lack of clear boundaries**: When you do activities in bed, it can be difficult to create a clear distinction between \"awake time\" and \"sleep time.\" This can lead to a blurred line between the two, making it harder to wind down and fall asleep.\n\n**Recommendation**: Try to do your meditation and reading in a different room or area, preferably with a comfortable chair or couch. This will help create a clear separation between your \"awake time\" and \"sleep time.\" You can even set up a cozy reading nook or meditation corner to make it more inviting.\n\n**Exceptions**: If you have a medical condition or mobility issues that make it difficult to get out of bed, it's perfectly fine to do your activities in bed. Just be sure to keep the lights dim, avoid stimulating activities, and try to create a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nBy doing your meditation and reading in a different area, you'll be able to:\n\n* Associate your bed with sleep and relaxation\n* Create a clear distinction between awake and sleep time\n* Improve the quality of your sleep\n\nGive it a try and see how it affects your sleep quality!",
