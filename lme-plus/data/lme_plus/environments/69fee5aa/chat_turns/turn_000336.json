  "content": "Thank you for letting me know about that requirement. You are correct, the Sub-Tank in Spark Mandrill's stage can only be obtained using the Boomerang Cutter weapon. Here's the updated stage/boss order and item collection sequence for Mega Man X, with the least amount of stage visits while getting 100% upgrades:\n\n1. Storm Eagle's stage: Head Upgrade, Heart Tank, and Sub-Tank.\n2. Flame Mammoth's stage: Arm Upgrade, Heart Tank, and Sub-Tank.\n3. Boomer Kuwanger's stage: Boomerang Cutter weapon and Heart Tank.\n4. Spark Mandrill's stage: Heart Tank and Sub-Tank (requires Boomerang Cutter).\n5. Chill Penguin's stage: Leg Upgrade and Heart Tank (requires Fire Wave).\n6. Sting Chameleon's stage: Body Upgrade and Heart Tank.\n7. Launch Octopus's stage: Heart Tank.\n8. Sigma's Palace:\n* No items to collect, just defeat the bosses in any order you prefer.\n\nI apologize for the previous mistakes in the item collection sequence and thank you for bringing them to my attention.",
