The U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for certifying that the hiring of a foreign worker will not adversely affect U.S. workers.\n\n**Who Handles the Labor Certification?**\n\nIn the EB-2 visa category, the labor certification process is typically handled by your U.S. employer. Your employer is responsible for submitting a labor certification application to the U.S. Department of Labor, which includes:\n\n1. **Job Posting**: Your employer must post the job opening internally and externally, including on the company's website, job boards, and with state workforce agencies, to demonstrate that they cannot find qualified U.S. workers for the position.\n2. **Prevailing Wage Determination**: Your employer must obtain a prevailing wage determination from the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets the minimum wage that must be paid to you, the foreign worker.\n3. **PERM Application**: Your employer submits a PERM application (Form ETA-9089) to the U.S. Department of Labor, which includes information about the job, the company, and the recruitment efforts.\n\n**Your Role in the Labor Certification Process**\n\nAs the foreign worker, you don't need to directly handle the labor certification process. However, you may need to provide information to your employer to support their labor certification application, such as:\n\n1. **Job Requirements**: You may need to provide input on the job requirements, duties, and responsibilities to help your employer create a detailed job description.\n2. **Education and Experience**: You'll need to provide documentation of your education and work experience to demonstrate that you meet the job requirements.\n3. **Availability**: You may need to confirm your availability to start work in the United States and your willingness to accept the job offer.\n\n**Tips and Considerations**\n\n* **Employer's Responsibility**: Remember that your employer is responsible for handling the labor certification process, including the costs and paperwork.\n* **Timing**: The labor certification process can take several months to complete, so it's essential to plan ahead and factor this into your overall immigration timeline.\n* **Job Requirements**: Ensure that your employer accurately reflects your job duties and requirements in the labor certification application to avoid potential issues during the immigration process.\n\nAs a computer science professional with a master's degree from NYU, you likely meet the educational requirements for the EB-2 visa category. Your employer will need to handle the labor certification process, but you'll need to provide supporting documentation and information as required.",
