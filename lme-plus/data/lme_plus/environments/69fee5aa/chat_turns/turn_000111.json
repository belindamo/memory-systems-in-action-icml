  "content": "A funny mug with a quote about coffee or leaving a job can be a great idea for a coworker's gift! Humor is a great way to bring some levity to the situation and make the gift more memorable. Coffee is a universal language, and a mug with a clever quote can become a staple in their daily routine.\n\nSome ideas for quotes could be:\n\n* \"Coffee: because adulting is hard\"\n* \"I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right (coffee fuels my arguments)\"\n* \"Leaving this job, but not leaving my coffee\"\n* \"Goodbye, coffee breaks; hello, nap breaks\"\n* \"Coffee: the only thing getting me through this transition\"\n\nYou could also consider a mug with a more sentimental quote, like:\n\n* \"Thanks for the memories (and the coffee)\"\n* \"You'll be missed, but your coffee mug will remain\"\n* \"Wishing you all the best (and a never-ending coffee supply)\"\n\nRemember to keep the quote light-hearted and respectful, considering your coworker's sense of humor and your workplace culture.\n\nA funny mug is a thoughtful gift that shows you care about your coworker's sense of humor and want to make their last days at the office more enjoyable. I think it's a great idea!",
