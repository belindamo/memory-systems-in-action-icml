  "content": "Yes, consuming too much garlic can have negative effects on the body. Garlic is generally considered safe when consumed in moderation as a food ingredient, but large doses of garlic supplements or raw garlic can cause adverse effects.\n\nSome people may experience digestive issues such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea after consuming too much garlic. Garlic can also interfere with some medications, including blood thinners, and should not be consumed by people with bleeding disorders or before surgery.\n\nIn addition, excessive consumption of garlic can lead to bad breath, body odor, and skin irritation. Garlic may also lower blood sugar levels, so individuals with diabetes should consume garlic with caution.\n\nOverall, moderate consumption of garlic as a food ingredient is unlikely to cause any adverse effects for most people. However, consuming garlic in excess or as a supplement may have negative effects and should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider.",
