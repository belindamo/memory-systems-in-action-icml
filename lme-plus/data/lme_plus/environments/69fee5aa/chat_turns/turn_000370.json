  "content": "Heartburn after consuming garlic can happen due to several reasons. Garlic contains a compound called allicin, which can irritate the gastrointestinal lining and trigger the production of stomach acid. When the stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, it can cause a burning sensation in the chest or throat, which is called heartburn.\n\nGarlic can also cause heartburn in people with certain medical conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or hiatal hernia, where the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) becomes weak or malfunctions, allowing stomach acid to rise back into the esophagus.\n\nIf you experience heartburn after consuming garlic, there are several things you can do to reduce the symptoms. One of the things you can try is to reduce your garlic intake or avoid it altogether. Other options include eating smaller meals, avoiding spicy and acidic foods, not lying down for at least three hours after eating, and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nOver-the-counter antacids or prescription medications can also be used to treat heartburn if it persists. However, if the symptoms persist or become severe, it is recommended to consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment.",
