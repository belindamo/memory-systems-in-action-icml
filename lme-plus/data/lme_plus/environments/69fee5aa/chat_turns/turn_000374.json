Spicy foods - Spicy foods can irritate the gastrointestinal tract and worsen heartburn symptoms.\n\n2. Acidic foods - Citrus fruits, tomatoes, and vinegar can increase stomach acid production and worsen heartburn symptoms.\n\n3. Fried and fatty foods - High-fat foods can cause the LES to relax, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus and cause heartburn.\n\n4. Chocolate - Chocolate contains a compound called theobromine which can relax the LES and also contains high levels of caffeine which can cause acid reflux.\n\n5. Carbonated drinks - Carbonated drinks can increase pressure in the stomach and cause heartburn.\n\n6. Alcohol - Alcohol can irritate the gastrointestinal tract and also cause relaxation of the LES.\n\nIt is recommended to avoid or limit these foods if you experience heartburn symptoms.
