  "content": "That sounds like an amazing experience! Bruno Mars is an incredible performer. I'm happy to help you discover some new music and artists. Since you've been to a bunch of concerts lately, I'll assume you're open to a wide range of genres.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me:\n\n1. What kind of music are you in the mood for? (e.g., pop, rock, hip-hop, electronic, indie, etc.)\n2. Do you prefer mellow and chill or upbeat and energetic vibes?\n3. Are you interested in exploring new artists or would you like to discover new music from artists you already know?\n4. Is there a particular concert or festival you're looking forward to attending soon?\n\nFeel free to answer any or all of these questions, and I'll start recommending some fresh tunes for you!",
