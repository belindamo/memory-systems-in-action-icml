  "content": "Excellent questions to ask! The freshness and sustainability of the seafood are crucial aspects to consider when dining at a seafood restaurant. Here are some potential questions you could ask your server or the chef:\n\n**Freshness:**\n\n* \"Can you tell me about the origin and freshness of the seafood in the Seafood Tower? Are the oysters, lobster, and fish caught locally or sourced from sustainable fisheries?\"\n* \"How often do you receive new shipments of seafood, and how do you ensure the quality and freshness of each item?\"\n* \"Are the seafood items in the tower harvested using sustainable methods, such as day-boat fishing or aquaculture?\"\n\n**Sustainability:**\n\n* \"Does The Lobster have any sustainable seafood policies or certifications, such as MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) or ASC (Aquaculture Stewardship Council) certifications?\"\n* \"What steps does the restaurant take to reduce waste and minimize its environmental impact, such as reducing plastic use or implementing recycling programs?\"\n* \"Are there any menu items or seafood options that are specifically sourced from sustainable or environmentally responsible fisheries?\"\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Look for restaurants that are transparent about their seafood sourcing and have clear policies in place.\n* Check if the restaurant is a member of organizations like the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program, which promotes sustainable seafood practices.\n* Consider asking about the chef's approach to seafood sustainability and their commitment to responsible sourcing.\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll not only ensure that you're getting the freshest and highest-quality seafood, but you'll also be supporting a restaurant that shares your values and is committed to sustainable practices. Kudos to you for being mindful of the environmental impact of your food choices!",
