  "content": "PCGS is indeed popular among error coin collectors, but it's always good to consider multiple options.\n\nAs for coin shows and conventions, I can help you with that!\n\nI'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time location-based information, but I can suggest a few ways to find upcoming coin shows and conventions in your area:\n\n1. **American Numismatic Association (ANA) Website**: The ANA website (money.org) has a comprehensive calendar of upcoming coin shows and events across the United States. You can filter by state, date, or event type.\n2. **Coin Show Calendar**: CoinShowCalendar.com is a website dedicated to listing coin shows and events across the United States and Canada. You can search by state, city, or zip code.\n3. **Local Coin Shops**: Reach out to local coin shops or dealers in your area and ask about upcoming coin shows or events. They often have knowledge about local events and might even be participating in them.\n4. **Online Forums and Groups**: Join online forums like Reddit's r/coincollecting or Facebook groups dedicated to coin collecting. Members often share information about upcoming events and shows.\n5. **Google Search**: Simply searching for \"coin shows near me\" or \"coin conventions in [your state/city]\" can yield relevant results.\n\nMake sure to verify the dates, times, and locations of any events you're interested in attending.\n\nRemember to take your 1972 doubled die cent to a reputable dealer or expert at one of these events to get it authenticated and learn more about its value. Good luck, and I hope you find some exciting events to attend!",
