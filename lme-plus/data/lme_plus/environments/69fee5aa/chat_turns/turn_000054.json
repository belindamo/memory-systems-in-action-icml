I've been using it to keep track of my grocery spending, so it'll be easy to add meal planning and lists to it. I can also access it from my computer, so I can plan my meals and make lists at home before I shop online.\n\nAlso, I wanted to mention that I got a rewards coupon from Safeway last week for $10 off my next purchase, so I need to make sure to use that before it expires. I've been meaning to try out their online shopping platform, so maybe I'll use the coupon for that.",
