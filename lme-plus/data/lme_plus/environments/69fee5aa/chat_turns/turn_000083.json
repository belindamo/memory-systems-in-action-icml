  "content": "When you rotate the letter \"M\" through 180 degrees, it looks very similar to the letter \"W\". The two letters are mirror images of each other, with the \"M\" having the two legs pointed down and the \"W\" having the two legs pointed up.\n\nIn fact, the \"M\" and \"W\" are sometimes referred to as \"twin letters\" or \"double-u and double-m\", because of their similar shape. So if you rotate an \"M\" through 180 degrees, it is most similar to a \"W\".",
