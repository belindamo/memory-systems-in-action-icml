  "content": "My grandfather's old Leica is a rangefinder camera, and I think it's a Leica IIIa model. I'm not sure about the serial number, but I can try to find it. The lens is a 50mm f/2 Summar lens, and it has a shutter speed range of 1/1000 to 1 second, plus B and T settings. It doesn't have a built-in light meter, so I have to use a separate meter or estimate the exposure settings.",
