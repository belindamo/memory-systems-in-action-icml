Boomer Kuwanger's stage: Boomerang Cutter weapon and Heart Tank.\n5. Spark Mandrill's stage: Heart Tank and Sub-Tank (requires Boomerang Cutter).\n6. Chill Penguin's stage: Leg Upgrade and Heart Tank (requires Fire Wave).\n7. Sting Chameleon's stage: Body Upgrade and Sub-Tank.\n8. Launch Octopus's stage: Heart Tank.\n9.
