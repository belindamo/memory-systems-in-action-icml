  "content": "I apologize for the mistake again. You are correct, the Head Upgrade can be found in Storm Eagle's stage, not Flame Mammoth's stage. Here's the updated stage/boss order and item collection sequence for Mega Man X, with the least amount of stage visits while getting 100% upgrades:\n\n1. Storm Eagle's stage: Head Upgrade, Heart Tank, and Sub-Tank.\n2. Flame Mammoth's stage: Arm Upgrade and Heart Tank.\n3. Chill Penguin's stage: Leg Upgrade and Heart Tank (requires Fire Wave).\n4. Launch Octopus's stage: Heart Tank.\n5. Boomer Kuwanger's stage: Boomerang Cutter weapon and Heart Tank.\n6. Sting Chameleon's stage: Sub-Tank and Heart Tank.\n7. Spark Mandrill's stage: Heart Tank.\n8. Sigma's Palace:\n* No items to collect, just defeat the bosses in any order you prefer.\n\nI apologize for any confusion I may have caused and hope this updated information is helpful.",
