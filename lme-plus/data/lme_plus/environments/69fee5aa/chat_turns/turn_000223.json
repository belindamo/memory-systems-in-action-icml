  "content": "Aylen lays on the ground, her body wracked with pain as the thing continues to torment her. Suddenly, an idea comes to her. She musters up all her strength and stands up, facing the thing. She looks it straight in the eyes and says, \"You want to know what fear is? I'll show you.\"\n\nShe reaches deep inside herself and pulls out a memory, a memory of the worst thing that ever happened to her. She holds it up for the thing to see, and it recoils in fear.\n\nAylen continues, \"You think you know what fear is? You don't. You can't. Because you're not human. You're just a monster hiding behind a mask of smoke and shadows.\"\n\nThe thing tries to attack her, but she holds up the memory like a shield, and it's forced to retreat. Aylen stands victorious, but she knows the battle isn't over yet. She needs to find a way to truly defeat this thing, once and for all.",
