  "content": "If you rotate a capital \"Z\" by 90 degrees clockwise, it would look most similar to the letter \"L\" (in uppercase form).\n\nThe capital \"Z\" is a diagonal letter that consists of two perpendicular lines. When you rotate it by 90 degrees, the two lines become horizontal, with the top line now on the left and the bottom line now on the right. This shape closely resembles the letter \"L\", which is also a horizontal letter consisting of a single line on the left and a shorter line on the right.\n\nSo, if you rotate a capital \"Z\" by 90 degrees clockwise, it would look most similar to a capital \"L\".",
