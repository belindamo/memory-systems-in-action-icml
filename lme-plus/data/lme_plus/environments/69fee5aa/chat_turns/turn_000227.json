  "content": "Aylen's dream starts off like any other, with her lying in her bed and the thing looming over her. But this time, she's determined to fight back. She reaches out and grabs at the thing, trying to hold on to it. But her hands keep slipping through the smoke-like tendrils, like trying to hold onto mist. The thing is laughing at her, enjoying her struggles.\n\nBut Aylen doesn't give up. She keeps reaching for the thing, trying to find something solid to hold onto. Suddenly, her hand closes around something solid. She feels the rough texture of scales under her fingers. She's got a grip on the thing!\n\nBut the thing is not going down without a fight. It starts to thrash around, trying to shake her off. Aylen is pulled back and forth, her grip slipping and tightening. She feels her fingers getting sore and her arms starting to ache. But she refuses to let go.\n\nAs she struggles to hold on, the thing starts to touch her. It's tendrils of smoke wrap around her legs, her arms, her neck. They squeeze and squeeze, and Aylen can feel the pressure building. She's gasping for air, but still she doesn't let go.\n\nFinally, with a final wrench, Aylen pulls the thing towards her. She's looking into its face, and it's looking back at her. It's not laughing anymore. And for the first time, Aylen feels a flicker of fear from the thing.\n\nAylen wakes up with a start, her heart racing. For the first time in a long time, she feels like she's making progress.",
