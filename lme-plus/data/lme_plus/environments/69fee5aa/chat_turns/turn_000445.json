  "content": "I'm planning a trip to New York City and was wondering if you could recommend some good art museums aside from MoMA. I recently got back from a 5-day trip to NYC with friends and we had an amazing time exploring the city, but I'm already planning my next trip back. By the way, I also went on a solo trip to Austin, Texas, for a music festival in February, and I'm still on a music high from that experience.",
