  "content": "A dependent variable is a variable in an experiment or study that is being measured or observed in response to changes made to another variable called the independent variable. In other words, it is the variable that is expected to be influenced or affected by the independent variable.\n\nFor example, if we are studying the effect of temperature on the rate of a chemical reaction, the rate of the reaction would be the dependent variable, as it is the variable being observed and measured in response to changes in the temperature, which is the independent variable.\n\nIn summary, the dependent variable is the outcome or response that is being studied or measured, and it is dependent on the independent variable, which is the variable being manipulated or changed in the study.",
