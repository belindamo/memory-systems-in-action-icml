      "content": "When you rotate the letter \"M\" through 180 degrees, it looks very similar to the letter \"W\". The two letters are mirror images of each other, with the \"M\" having the two legs pointed down and the \"W\" having the two legs pointed up.\n\nIn fact, the \"M\" and \"W\" are sometimes referred to as \"twin letters\" or \"double-u and double-m\", because of their similar shape. So if you rotate an \"M\" through 180 degrees, it is most similar to a \"W\"."

      "content": "If you rotate a capital \"Z\" by 90 degrees clockwise, it would look most similar to the letter \"L\" (in uppercase form).\n\nThe capital \"Z\" is a diagonal letter that consists of two perpendicular lines. When you rotate it by 90 degrees, the two lines become horizontal, with the top line now on the left and the bottom line now on the right. This shape closely resembles the letter \"L\", which is also a horizontal letter consisting of a single line on the left and a shorter line on the right.\n\nSo, if you rotate a capital \"Z\" by 90 degrees clockwise, it would look most similar to a capital \"L\"."

      "content": "If you rotate a capital \"N\" by 90 degrees clockwise, it would look most similar to the letter \"Z\" (in uppercase form).\n\nThe capital \"N\" consists of two diagonal lines that intersect at a right angle, with the longer line pointing downwards to the right. When you rotate it by 90 degrees, the longer line will point to the left instead of downwards, and the shorter line will point upwards instead of to the left. This shape closely resembles the letter \"Z\", which is also a diagonal letter consisting of two lines that intersect at a right angle, with the longer line pointing downwards to the right.\n\nSo, if you rotate a capital \"N\" by 90 degrees clockwise, it would look most similar to a capital \"Z\"."
