Reviewing your list one more time can help ensure that you don't forget anything important.\n\nTake a few seconds to scan the list, and ask yourself:\n\n* Do I have everything I need for my recipes (chicken stir-fry and pizza)?\n* Have I covered all the pantry staples I need to restock?\n* Are there any other essentials I need to grab for myself or my niece?\n\nIf you're satisfied that you've got everything, you're ready to head out and shop with confidence!\n\nIf you do happen to remember something else, feel free to come back and add it to the list. I'll be here to help.\n\nHave a great shopping trip, and happy cooking!",
