  "content": "I've been doing a mix of cardio and strength training at the gym, and also playing sports like volleyball and soccer. I'm decent at swimming, I can do laps but my pace is pretty slow. I don't have a bike yet, but I'm planning to get one soon. My running experience is limited, but I did a 5K recently in 32:15. My goal is to do a sprint triathlon, and I think I have around 12 weeks to prepare. I'd like to focus on improving my swimming and biking skills.",
