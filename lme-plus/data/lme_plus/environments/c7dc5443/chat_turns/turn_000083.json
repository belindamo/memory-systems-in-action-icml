Now, let's break down your goals and create a plan to help you improve your swimming and biking skills for your sprint triathlon.\n\n**Current Fitness Level:**\n\n* Cardio: You're doing regular cardio workouts at the gym and playing sports, which is great. Your 5K time of 32:15 indicates you have a good aerobic base.\n* Swimming: You can do laps, but your pace is slow. We'll focus on improving your technique and endurance in the water.\n* Biking: You don't have a bike yet, but you're planning to get one soon. We'll assume you'll start with zero biking experience and build up gradually.\n* Running: You've completed a 5K, which is a great starting point.
