  "content": "The Thule Evo Hitch Bike Rack is a popular and highly-regarded option.\n\n**Installation process:**\n\nInstalling a Thule Evo Hitch Bike Rack is generally a straightforward process, but it does require some effort and attention to detail. Here's an overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. **Hitch receiver compatibility:** Ensure your car's hitch receiver is compatible with the rack's hitch adapter. Thule provides a hitch adapter that fits 1.25\" and 2\" hitch receivers.\n2. **Assemble the rack:** Follow the instructions to assemble the rack's components, including the hitch adapter, mast, and arms.\n3. **Attach the hitch adapter:** Insert the hitch adapter into your car's hitch receiver and secure it with the provided pin and clip.\n4. **Mount the mast:** Attach the mast to the hitch adapter and secure it with bolts or clips.\n5. **Install the arms and trays:** Attach the arms and trays to the mast, making sure they're securely fastened.\n6. **Adjust and tighten:** Adjust the rack's components to fit your bike(s) and tighten all bolts and screws.\n\n**Hitch receiver requirements:**\n\nTo ensure a safe and secure installation, Thule recommends the following hitch receiver requirements:\n\n* **Class II or III hitch receiver:** The Thule Evo Hitch Bike Rack is designed for Class II (1.25\" receiver) or Class III (2\" receiver) hitch receivers.\n* **Weight capacity:** Check your car's hitch receiver weight capacity, as it must be able to support the combined weight of the rack, bikes, and any additional accessories.\n* **Hitch receiver size:** Ensure the hitch receiver is the correct size for the Thule hitch adapter. Thule provides adapters for 1.25\" and 2\" hitch receivers.\n* **Hitch receiver style:** Thule Evo Hitch Bike Racks are designed for standard hitch receivers with a flat, rectangular opening. If your car has a specialized hitch receiver (e.g., a folding or hidden hitch), you may need to check with Thule or a dealer for compatibility.\n\n**Vehicle-specific considerations:**\n\nBefore purchasing, check your car's owner's manual or consult with a Thule dealer to ensure the Evo Hitch Bike Rack is compatible with your vehicle. Some factors to consider:\n\n* **Hitch receiver location:** Ensure the hitch receiver is not obstructed by any rear bumper or trim pieces.\n* **Electrical connections:** If your car has a 7-pin or 4-pin trailer wiring connector, you may need to purchase a wiring harness adapter for the rack's lights and other accessories.\n* **Clearance:** Verify there's sufficient clearance between the rack and your car's rear bumper, trunk lid, or spoiler.\n\nTo confirm compatibility, I recommend:\n\n1. Checking Thule's website for vehicle-specific fit guides and compatibility charts.\n2. Consulting with a Thule dealer or a local bike shop that carries Thule products.\n3. Reviewing your car's owner's manual or manufacturer's website for hitch receiver specifications.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to determine whether the Thule Evo Hitch Bike Rack is a good fit for your car.",
