An ordinal scale is a type of measurement scale that is used to rank items or to place them in order of magnitude, but it does not provide any information about the differences in magnitude between the items. An interval scale, on the other hand, is a type of measurement scale that is used to measure the differences in magnitude between items, but it does not provide any information about the order or ranking of the items.",
