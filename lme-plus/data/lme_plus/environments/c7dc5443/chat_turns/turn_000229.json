Double-checking the hitch receiver specifications and weight capacity in your car's owner's manual will give you peace of mind and ensure a safe installation. Make sure to note down the details, so you can reference them later.\n\n**Weight capacity:**\n\nRemember to calculate the combined weight of the rack, your bike, and any additional accessories to ensure you're within the recommended weight capacity. You don't want to exceed the limit, as it could compromise the safety of your vehicle, the rack, and your bike.\n\n**NiteRider lights:**\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that your NiteRider lights have been a game-changer for your early morning rides! It's always exciting to find a product that makes a significant difference in your cycling experience. Keep shining bright and staying safe out there!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you get your Thule Evo Hitch Bike Rack installed smoothly and enjoy many happy miles with your bike. Happy cycling!",
