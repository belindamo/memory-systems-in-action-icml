Reducing treats and switching to lower-calorie food are excellent starts. However, it's essential to monitor your cat's progress and make adjustments as needed.\n\nHere are some additional tips to help your cat achieve a healthy weight:\n\n1. **Measure food portions**: Instead of free-feeding, measure your cat's food to ensure she's getting the right amount. You can consult with your veterinarian to determine the ideal portion size based on your cat's age, breed, and activity level.\n2. **Choose the right food**: Look for high-protein, low-carb, and fiber-rich foods that can help your cat feel full and satisfied. Avoid fillers and by-products, which can contribute to weight gain.\n3. **Increase playtime and exercise**: Encourage your cat to be more active by providing toys, scratching posts, and climbing structures. You can also try food puzzle toys or interactive games to stimulate her mentally and physically.\n4. **Limit table scraps**: It's essential to avoid feeding your cat table scraps, as they can be high in calories, fat, and salt. Stick to a balanced, nutrient-rich commercial cat food or a homemade diet formulated by a veterinarian or animal nutritionist.\n5. **Monitor progress**: Weigh your cat regularly and track her progress. You can also monitor her body condition score (BCS) by feeling her ribs, spine, and muscle mass.\n6. **Consult with your veterinarian**: Your veterinarian can provide personalized advice and help you develop a weight management plan tailored to your cat's specific needs.\n\nRegarding the adorable collar with a bell, it's great that you found it! However, keep in mind that while it's cute, it's essential to ensure the collar is comfortable and safe for your cat. Make sure it's not too tight and doesn't obstruct her movement or vision.\n\nRemember, every cat is different, and it may take time to find the right balance for your cat's weight management. Be patient, and with the right approach, you can help your cat achieve a healthy weight and live a happy, long life.",
