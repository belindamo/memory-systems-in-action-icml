  "content": "I think I'll start by keeping a \"feelings journal\" to track my emotions and spending habits. I want to get a better understanding of what triggers my desire to splurge and how I can manage those emotions in a more constructive way. I'll also try to find alternative stress-relief methods, like exercise or meditation, to help me cope with stress and boredom.\n\nIt's interesting that you mentioned delayed gratification. I think that's a great strategy to help me determine if a purchase is truly worth it. I'll definitely try to wait 24 hours before making a purchase to see if the urge passes.\n\nI'm also open to seeking support from friends or family members. Sometimes just talking through my feelings and getting a different perspective can help me make more intentional purchasing decisions.\n\nAnd I love the idea of celebrating small wins! It's a great way to stay motivated and encouraged along the way.\n\nThanks for the advice and support. I feel like I'm on the right track now.",
