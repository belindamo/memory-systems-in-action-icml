  "content": "I completely agree with you! The show's portrayal of internalized oppression is a powerful commentary on how societal expectations and norms can shape our sense of identity and limit our potential. It's a nuanced and realistic portrayal of how people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often internalize the negative messages they receive from society, and how this can affect their self-worth and aspirations.\n\nI also appreciate how the show explores the theme of social mobility and the difficulties of upward mobility for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Ana Ribera's character is a great example of this, as she faces numerous obstacles and challenges along the way. Her journey is a powerful reminder that social mobility is not always easy, and that it often requires a lot of hard work, determination, and resilience.\n\nRegarding the portrayal of the wealthy elite, I agree that it could be more nuanced. While the show does a great job of highlighting the privilege and entitlement of the wealthy elite, it sometimes relies on stereotypes and caricatures. It would be interesting to see more complexity and depth in the portrayal of the wealthy characters, to understand their motivations and perspectives as well.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the show could benefit from more diversity in its representation of the working class. While Ana Ribera's character is a great representation of a strong and determined working-class woman, the show could benefit from more diverse characters from different racial, ethnic, and gender backgrounds.\n\nOverall, however, I think Velvet is a powerful and thought-provoking show that does a great job of exploring the complex relationships between identity, social class, and power. Its portrayal of internalized oppression, social mobility, and the struggles of the working class are all particularly well done, and it's a great example of how television can be used to spark important conversations and challenge societal norms.",
