  "content": "I think setting boundaries and making a plan before we go shopping will really help. I'll talk to my sister about my budget and goals, and we can decide together what we're looking for and what we can afford. We can also take breaks and encourage each other to make intentional purchasing decisions.\n\nI like the idea of focusing on experiences too. We can take photos together, try on outfits, or grab lunch instead of just focusing on buying things. That way, we can still have fun and create memories without breaking the bank.\n\nOne thing I'm a bit worried about is that my sister might not be as on board with this as I am. She's always been a bit of a shopaholic, and I'm not sure she'll be willing to change her habits. Do you have any tips on how to approach this conversation with her?\n",
