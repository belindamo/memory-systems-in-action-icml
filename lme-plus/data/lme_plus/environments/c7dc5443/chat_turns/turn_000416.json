While I don't have personal experiences, I can try to help you find a rooftop spot that captures a similar atmosphere.\n\n**Rooftop Spots with a Cozy Atmosphere:**\n\n1. **Look for rooftop gardens or green spaces**: A rooftop with a lush garden or plenty of greenery can create a cozy and intimate atmosphere.\n2. **Search for spots with fire pits or heaters**: Fire pits or outdoor heaters can add a warm and inviting ambiance to a rooftop spot, making it feel cozier.\n3. **Check for comfortable seating**: Opt for rooftop spots with plush couches, sectionals, or lounge chairs that can accommodate your group comfortably.\n4. **Consider rooftop bars with a focus on craft cocktails**: A rooftop bar that focuses on craft cocktails can create a more relaxed atmosphere, as people tend to linger and enjoy their drinks.\n5. **Check the music and noise level**: If you're looking for a more low-key atmosphere, opt for rooftop spots with background music or a more subdued noise level.\n\n**Questions to Ask When Researching Rooftop Spots:**\n\n1. What's the atmosphere like during the evening hours? Is it lively or more relaxed?\n2. Are there any private areas or sections that can be reserved for larger groups?\n3. What's the seating like? Are there comfortable couches or tables?\n4. Are there any fire pits or outdoor heaters available?\n5. Can you accommodate a group of 10 people, and is there a minimum food or drink order required?\n\nBy asking these questions and doing some research, you should be able to find a rooftop spot that captures a similar atmosphere to the brunch spot you visited last weekend.\n\nRemember to book your spot in advance, especially if you're planning a weekend dinner party, as rooftop spots can get busy quickly!",
