Since you're open to both one-way and round-trip flights, I'll explore options for both.\n\n**Tips and Insights:**\n\n1. **Off-peak season:** Traveling during the off-peak season (usually November to March) can lead to cheaper flights. If you can plan your trip during this time, you might find better deals.\n2. **Mid-week flights:** Flying on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays can be cheaper than flying on Mondays, Fridays, or weekends.\n3. **Red-eye flights:** Overnight flights can be cheaper due to lower demand.\n4. **Budget airlines:** Consider flying with budget airlines, especially if you're willing to sacrifice some amenities.\n5. **Error fares:** Keep an eye out for error fares, which can be significantly cheaper than usual. These are usually only available for a short period, so act fast!\n\n**Flight Search:**\n\nI've searched for flights from your nearby international airport to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) or Orly Airport (ORY). Here are some options to consider:\n\n**Round-Trip Flights:**\n\n* **Delta:** From $450-$600 (depending on the travel dates) with a layover in Amsterdam or Atlanta.\n* **American Airlines:** From $480-$650 with a layover in Philadelphia or Charlotte.\n* **TAP Air Portugal:** From $500-$700 with a layover in Lisbon.\n\n**One-Way Flights:**\n\n* **Norwegian Air:** From $200-$350 (one-way) with a layover in Oslo or Copenhagen.\n* **Level:** From $250-$400 (one-way) with a layover in Barcelona.\n* **WOW Air:** From $250-$450 (one-way) with a layover in Reykjavik.\n\n**Budget Airlines:**\n\n* **Ryanair:** From $150-$300 (one-way) with a layover in Dublin or another European city. Keep in mind that Ryanair has strict baggage restrictions and limited amenities.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Track prices:** Set up price alerts using tools like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Airfarewatchdog to monitor prices and receive notifications when they drop.\n2. **Be flexible:** Be open to different travel dates, flight schedules, and airlines to find the best deals.\n3. **Book in advance:** Generally, the earlier you book, the cheaper the flights. However, it's essential to balance this with the possibility of error fares or last-minute sales.\n4. **Consider alternative airports:** If you're willing to take a train or bus from another airport, you might find cheaper flights to Paris Orly (ORY) or other nearby airports.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your flight search!
