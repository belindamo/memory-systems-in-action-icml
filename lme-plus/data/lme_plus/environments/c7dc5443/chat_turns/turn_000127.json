  "content": "That's an interesting point! The use of multiple perspectives in The Sound and the Fury can require some effort from the reader to piece together the different narratives, but it can also offer a richer understanding of the characters and their relationships. In contrast, Holden's perspective in The Catcher in the Rye can be more relatable, but it also limits the reader's understanding of other characters and their motivations. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference as to which is more effective in conveying the story and themes.",
