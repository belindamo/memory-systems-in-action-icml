The Kavanagh Building - Located on Avenida Florida, this art deco skyscraper was completed in 1936 and was the tallest building in Latin America at the time. It was built by Corina Kavanagh, an Irish-Argentine heiress who defied her family's wishes to marry a man from a lower social class.\n2. The Palacio de los Patos - Located in the Monserrat neighborhood, this neo-gothic building was built in 1890 and was originally the headquarters of a wealthy family. It's said that the family was so wealthy that they would feed their pet swans champagne.\n3. The Confiter\u00eda Ideal - Located in the San Nicol\u00e1s neighborhood, this historic tango hall was opened in 1912 and has hosted some of the most famous tango dancers in Buenos Aires. It's a great place to watch tango performances or take a tango lesson.\n4. The Palermo Viejo neighborhood - This trendy neighborhood is known for its hip bars, restaurants, and street art. It's also home to the Palermo Soho and Palermo Hollywood neighborhoods, which are popular with young people and artists.\n5. The Palacio Barolo - As mentioned earlier, this unique building was designed by Italian architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1923. It was inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy and is said to represent the journey from Hell to Heaven.\n\nThese spots can easily be added to the walking tour itinerary and can provide a more off-the-beaten-path experience for visitors.",
