These fields help Google Analytics identify when a form submission has occurred.\n\n**Category Field**\n\nThe category field is a way to group similar events together. For a form submission, you can use a category like \"Forms\" or \"Lead Generation\". This helps you to organize your events and make it easier to analyze them in Google Analytics.\n\n**Action Field**\n\nThe action field specifies the specific action that triggers the goal. For a form submission, the action is usually \"Submit\" or \"Send\". This is the action that the user takes when they click the submit button on your form.\n\n**Label Field**\n\nThe label field provides additional context about the event. For a form submission, you can use a label like \"Contact Form\" or \"Newsletter Signup\". This helps you to identify which specific form was submitted.\n\n**Example Trigger Setup**\n\nHere's an example of how you might set up a trigger for a form submission:\n\n* **Category**: Forms\n* **Action**: Submit\n* **Label**: Contact Form\n\nThis trigger would fire whenever a user submits the contact form on your website.\n\n**Using Google Tag Manager**\n\nIf you're using Google Tag Manager (GTM), you can set up a trigger in GTM to send an event to Google Analytics when the form is submitted. Here's an example:\n\n* **Trigger Type**: Form Submission\n* **Form ID**: #contact-form (replace with the ID of your form)\n* **Event Name**: submit\n* **Event Category**: Forms\n* **Event Action**: Submit\n* **Event Label**: Contact Form\n\nIn this example, the trigger fires when the form with the ID \"contact-form\" is submitted. The event is then sent to Google Analytics with the specified category, action, and label.\n\n**Using a Form Plugin or CRM**\n\nIf you're using a form plugin like Gravity Forms or a CRM like HubSpot, you may need to use a different approach to set up the trigger. Check the documentation for your specific plugin or CRM to see how to set up a trigger for form submissions.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how to set up a trigger for a form submission in Google Analytics!
