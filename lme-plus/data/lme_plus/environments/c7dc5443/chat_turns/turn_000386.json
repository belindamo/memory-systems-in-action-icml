  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or preferences. However, I understand your concern. Many people find that hand sanitizer can leave a sticky or unpleasant feeling on their hands. This is because hand sanitizers contain alcohol, which can dry out the skin and leave a residue. Some hand sanitizers are scented to mask the alcohol smell, but these fragrances may also cause irritation in some people.\n\nTo make hand sanitizer more pleasant to use, manufacturers are now offering different formulations that have added moisturizers, are fragrance-free or have a more pleasant fragrance. Additionally, some hand sanitizer brands have added emollients like essential oils, Vitamin E, or other moisturizing agents to make the hand feel hydrated and smooth after use. You may want to experiment with different brands and formulations to find one that you like and that meets your hand hygiene needs.",
