I don't retain information about individual users or their shopping history.\n\nBut I can definitely provide you with some general tips and recommendations for finding good deals on laptops:\n\n1. **Check online marketplaces**: Websites like Amazon, Newegg, and B&H Photo often have a wide selection of laptops from various brands, and you can filter by price, brand, and features.\n2. **Look for discounts and sales**: Keep an eye on retailers' websites, social media, and email newsletters for promotions, discounts, and sales events.\n3. **Consider refurbished or open-box models**: Refurbished laptops can offer significant savings while still providing a quality device. Open-box models are new laptops that have been returned or opened but are still in excellent condition.\n4. **Check manufacturer's websites**: Sometimes, laptop manufacturers offer discounts, student discounts, or bundle deals on their official websites.\n5. **Read reviews and compare prices**: Research different models, read reviews, and compare prices across multiple retailers to find the best value for your budget.\n\nAs for specific laptop recommendations, here are a few options across different price ranges:\n\n* **Budget-friendly**: Acer Aspire 3 (around $300) or Lenovo IdeaPad 330S (around $400)\n* **Mid-range**: Dell XPS 13 (around $800) or HP Envy x360 (around $600)\n* **High-end**: Apple MacBook Air (around $1,000) or Dell XPS 15 (around $1,200)\n\nRemember to check the specifications, features, and reviews to ensure the laptop meets your needs and budget.\n\nRegarding your 4K TV purchase, I'm afraid I don't have any information about your purchase history. If you need help with finding a good deal on a TV or have questions about a specific model, feel free to ask!",
