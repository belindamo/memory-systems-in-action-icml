  "content": "Let's dive deeper into the issue.\n\n**Factory reset and crashing**\n\nSince you did a factory reset about a month ago, it's possible that some settings or data from the previous setup might be causing the issue. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Syncing issues**: After a factory reset, your phone might still be syncing data from your Google account. This can cause temporary issues with apps like YouTube. Try going to Settings > Accounts > Google > Sync now to ensure everything is up to date.\n2. **Corrupted app data**: Even though you cleared the cache and data, there might be some residual data causing the issue. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the YouTube app to start from scratch.\n\n**Additional troubleshooting steps:**\n\n1. **Check for Android system updates**: Ensure your phone's operating system is up to date, as newer versions might include bug fixes for issues like this. Go to Settings > Software update.\n2. **Disable and re-enable the YouTube app**: Sometimes, simply disabling and re-enabling the app can resolve issues. Go to Settings > Apps > YouTube > Disable, then wait for 30 seconds and Enable it again.\n3. **Check for conflicts with other apps**: Although you mentioned you haven't installed new apps recently, it's possible that an existing app is causing the issue. Try booting your phone in Safe Mode (as I mentioned earlier) to isolate the problem.\n4. **Perform a forced stop and clear storage**: This will stop the YouTube app and clear its storage. Go to Settings > Apps > YouTube > Force stop, then Storage > Clear storage.\n5. **Check for device storage issues**: Low storage space or corrupted storage can cause app crashes. Check your device's storage by going to Settings > Storage. If your storage is almost full, consider deleting unnecessary files or expanding your storage.\n\n**Additional questions to help me narrow down the issue:**\n\n1. Have you noticed any other apps crashing or behaving strangely since the factory reset?\n2. Are you using a microSD card in your phone? If so, try removing it and testing the YouTube app without it.\n3. Have you checked your phone's system logs for any error messages related to the YouTube app? You can do this by going to Settings > About phone > Build number (tap it 7 times to enable Developer options) > Developer options > System logs.\n\nLet me know if any of these steps resolve the issue or if you have any additional information that might help me troubleshoot the problem.",
