  "content": "Sure, here is an example of how you might include a mediation effect in one of the SEM models from the previous example:\n```\n# Load the lavaan package\nlibrary(lavaan)\n\n# Fit the SEM model to the data\nmodel <- ' \n  # Latent variables\n  Anxiety =~ x1 + x2 + x3\n  Depression =~ x4 + x5 + x6\n  Stress =~ x7 + x8 + x9\n  Coping =~ x10 + x11 + x12\n  # Covariances\n  Anxiety ~~ Depression\n  Anxiety ~~ Stress\n  Depression ~~ Stress\n  # Regressions\n  Anxiety ~ Coping\n  Depression ~ Coping\n'\nfit <- sem(model, data = mydata)\n\n# Test the mediation effect of Coping on the relationship between Anxiety and Depression\nmediation(fit, mediator = \"Coping\", dependent = \"Depression\", independent = \"Anxiety\")\n```\nIn this example, the SEM model includes a latent variable, Coping, which is assumed to mediate the relationship between Anxiety and Depression. The `mediation()` function can be used to test the significance of the mediation effect and to estimate the direct and indirect effects of Coping on the relationship between Anxiety and Depression.",
