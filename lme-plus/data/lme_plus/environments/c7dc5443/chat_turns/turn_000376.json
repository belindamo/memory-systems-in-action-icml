I can suggest some general tips to help you find deals on winter clothing at Macy's:\n\n1. **Check Macy's website**: Visit Macy's official website and look for their \"Deals\" or \"Sales\" section. They often feature ongoing promotions, discounts, and clearance sales.\n2. **Sign up for their email newsletter**: By signing up for Macy's email newsletter, you'll receive exclusive offers, promo codes, and early access to sales.\n3. **Follow Macy's social media**: Keep an eye on Macy's social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) for flash sales, promo codes, and special offers.\n4. **Use coupon codes and promo codes**: Check websites like RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, or CouponCabin for Macy's promo codes and coupon codes that can be used online or in-store.\n5. **Look for price matching**: Macy's offers a price matching policy. If you find a lower price on an item at a competitor's store, Macy's will match that price.\n\nAs for the Friends and Family sale, it's possible that Macy's might not have another sale of the same kind immediately. However, they often have other promotions and discounts throughout the year. Keep an eye on their website and social media to stay informed about upcoming sales.\n\nRemember, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal knowledge of your shopping history or interactions with Macy's. If you have any specific questions about Macy's sales or promotions, I'll do my best to help!",
