However, here are some general guidelines on what you might expect:\n\n**Typical Attire:**\n\n* Business casual to formal attire is usually appropriate for a Master's graduation ceremony.\n* For men:\n\t+ A dress shirt and dress pants or khakis are a safe choice.\n\t+ A blazer or sports coat can add a touch of formality.\n\t+ Dress shoes, such as loafers or oxfords, are suitable.\n* For women:\n\t+ A blouse or a nice top with dress pants or a skirt is a good option.\n\t+ A dress or a skirt with a blouse is also acceptable.\n\t+ Dress shoes, such as heels or flats, are suitable.\n\n**Formal vs. Informal:**\n\n* If the ceremony is held in a more formal setting, such as a university auditorium or a hotel ballroom, you may want to dress more formally.\n* If the ceremony is held in a more casual setting, such as a outdoor venue or a smaller conference room, you may be able to get away with business casual attire.\n\n**Consider the University's Culture:**\n\n* Some universities may have a more formal or traditional dress code, while others may be more relaxed.\n* If you're unsure, you can always check with your cousin or someone from the university to get a sense of the dress code.\n\n**Comfortable Shoes:**\n\n* Regardless of the dress code, make sure to wear comfortable shoes, as you may be standing for extended periods or walking around.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be respectful of the occasion and the graduate's achievement. Dress appropriately, and you'll be sure to make a good impression!",
