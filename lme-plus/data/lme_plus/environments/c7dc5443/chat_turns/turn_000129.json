  "content": "Absolutely. The Catcher in the Rye is often praised for its realistic portrayal of the teenage experience through Holden's perspective, but it can be limiting in terms of understanding the perspectives and experiences of other characters. In some ways, this limitation reflects Holden's own limitations in understanding and empathizing with others. Nonetheless, it's a powerful choice on Salinger's part to center the narrative on Holden, even if it leaves some questions unanswered.",
