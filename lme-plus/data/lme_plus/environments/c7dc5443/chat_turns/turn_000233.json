How much did you spend at the Bloomingdale's friends and family sale today?\n2. What is your monthly shopping budget for the rest of the year?\n3. Do you have any other shopping trips or purchases planned in the near future that you'd like to factor into your budget?\n4. Are there any specific categories you'd like to track (e.g. clothing, accessories, beauty products, etc.)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a simple tracking system to monitor your expenses and stay within your budget.\n\n(And, by the way, congrats on scoring a designer handbag and shoes at the sale!)",
