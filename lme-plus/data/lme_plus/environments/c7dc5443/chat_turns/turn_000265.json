  "content": "Yes, you are correct. A ratio scale is a type of measurement scale that is similar to an interval scale, but it also has a true zero point, which means that it is possible to compare the ratios of the values on the scale. This means that a ratio scale can be used to measure not only the differences in magnitude between items, but also the ratios of those differences. For example, a scale that measures weight in kilograms would be considered a ratio scale because it has a true zero point (i.e., 0 kilograms) and it is possible to compare the ratios of the weights (e.g., 2 kg is twice as heavy as 1 kg).",
