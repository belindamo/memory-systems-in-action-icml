  "content": "The main difference between a ratio scale and an interval scale is that an interval scale does not have a true zero point, which means that it is not possible to compare the ratios of the values on the scale. This means that an interval scale can be used to measure the differences in magnitude between items, but it cannot be used to compare the ratios of those differences. For example, a scale that measures temperature in degrees Celsius would be considered an interval scale because it has a fixed and equal unit of measurement (e.g., 1 degree) and it is possible to measure the differences in temperature between items, but it is not possible to compare the ratios of those temperatures because 0 degrees Celsius does not represent a true absence of temperature (i.e., it is not absolute zero).",
