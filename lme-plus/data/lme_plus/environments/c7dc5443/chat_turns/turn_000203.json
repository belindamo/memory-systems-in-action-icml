  "content": "Different countries have different naval armament preferences depending on their strategic needs, budget, and resources. For example, some countries with large coastlines or a focus on naval power may invest heavily in battleships and aircraft carriers, while others may prioritize submarines and missile technology.\n\nAdditionally, some countries may develop their own weapons systems, such as Russia's Kalibr missiles, which have been used in their naval operations in Syria, or China's DF-21D \"carrier killer\" missile, which is specifically designed to target aircraft carriers.\n\nOverall, certain weapon systems like missiles and torpedo defenses are commonly found on most modern naval vessels worldwide. However, the specific armament and weaponry of each naval force will vary based on their individual needs and priorities.",
