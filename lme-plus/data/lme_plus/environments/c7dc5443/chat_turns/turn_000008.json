  "content": "I don't care about the author's message or intent. It's just not right to make light of such a serious topic. Humor can be inappropriate and disrespectful, and this novel is a prime example of that. I don't think it's a creative or thought-provoking approach; it's just tasteless. The soldiers who fought and died deserve more respect than that, and using humor to criticize war institutions is not a valid excuse for doing so.",
