Double-check your amount: Before submitting your donation, double-check the amount you are donating and make sure it's the intended amount. 2.

Spread the word: Share your donation with others and encourage them to support the cause or charity you care about. 5. Consider giving more: If you had a great experience donating or working with a charity, consider giving again in the future. 6.
