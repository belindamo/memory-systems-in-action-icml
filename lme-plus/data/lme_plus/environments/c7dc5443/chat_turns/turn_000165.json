Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Log in to your Google Analytics account**: Go to analytics.google.com and sign in with your credentials.\n2. **Navigate to the Goals section**: In the left-hand sidebar, click on \"Conversions\" and then select \"Goals\" from the dropdown menu.\n3. **Click on \"New Goal\"**: In the Goals page, click on the \"New Goal\" button.\n4. **Choose a goal type**: Select \"Custom\" as the goal type, and then choose \"Form submission\" from the dropdown menu.\n5. **Enter goal details**:\n\t* **Goal name**: Give your goal a descriptive name, such as \"Contact Form Submission\".\n\t* **Goal slot**: Choose a goal slot (1-20) to assign this goal to.\n\t* **Goal type**: Select \"Event\" as the goal type.\n6. **Set up the goal trigger**:\n\t* **Category**: Enter a category for the goal, such as \"Forms\".\n\t* **Action**: Enter the action that triggers the goal, such as \"Submit\".\n\t* **Label**: Enter a label to identify the specific form, such as \"Contact Form\".\n\t* **Value**: Leave this field blank unless you want to assign a specific value to each form submission.\n7. **Set up the goal confirmation**:\n\t* **Destination**: Select \"Regular expression\" and enter the URL of the thank-you page that users see after submitting the form. For example, `^/thank-you/$`.\n\t* **Matching type**: Select \"Exact match\" to ensure that only the exact URL is matched.\n\n**Tracking Goal Value**\n\nTo track the goal value, you need to assign a monetary value to each form submission. This will help you measure the return on investment (ROI) of your ad campaigns.\n\n**Method 1: Assign a fixed value to each form submission**\n\n1. In the goal setup, enter a value in the \"Value\" field. For example, if each form submission is worth $10, enter `10`.\n2. Make sure to select \"Fixed value\" as the value type.\n\n**Method 2: Use a dynamic value from a form field**\n\n1. If you're using a form plugin or a CRM that passes the goal value as a parameter, you can use a dynamic value.\n2. In the goal setup, select \"Dynamic value\" as the value type.\n3. Enter the parameter name that contains the goal value. For example, `lead_value`.\n\n**Verifying the Goal**\n\nOnce you've set up the goal, click \"Save\" and verify that it's working correctly:\n\n1. Go to the \"Real-Time\" section in Google Analytics and navigate to the \"Conversions\" tab.\n2. Submit the form on your website to trigger the goal.\n3. Check that the goal is being tracked correctly in the Real-Time report.\n\n**Tips and Best Practices**\n\n* Use a consistent naming convention for your goals to make them easy to identify.\n* Set up multiple goals to track different actions on your website.\n* Use goal values to measure the ROI of your ad campaigns and optimize your budget allocation.\n* Regularly review your goal performance to identify areas for improvement.\n\nI hope this helps you set up goals and conversions in Google Analytics for form submissions!
