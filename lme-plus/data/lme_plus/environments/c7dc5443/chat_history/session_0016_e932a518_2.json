      "content": "Paris, the City of Light! What a fantastic destination!\n\nGiven your flexibility with travel dates, I'll suggest some strategies to find affordable flights to Paris. Since you're open to both one-way and round-trip flights, I'll explore options for both.\n\n**Tips and Insights:**\n\n1. **Off-peak season:** Traveling during the off-peak season (usually November to March) can lead to cheaper flights. If you can plan your trip during this time, you might find better deals.\n2. **Mid-week flights:** Flying on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays can be cheaper than flying on Mondays, Fridays, or weekends.\n3. **Red-eye flights:** Overnight flights can be cheaper due to lower demand.\n4. **Budget airlines:** Consider flying with budget airlines, especially if you're willing to sacrifice some amenities.\n5. **Error fares:** Keep an eye out for error fares, which can be significantly cheaper than usual. These are usually only available for a short period, so act fast!\n\n**Flight Search:**\n\nI've searched for flights from your nearby international airport to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) or Orly Airport (ORY). Here are some options to consider:\n\n**Round-Trip Flights:**\n\n* **Delta:** From $450-$600 (depending on the travel dates) with a layover in Amsterdam or Atlanta.\n* **American Airlines:** From $480-$650 with a layover in Philadelphia or Charlotte.\n* **TAP Air Portugal:** From $500-$700 with a layover in Lisbon.\n\n**One-Way Flights:**\n\n* **Norwegian Air:** From $200-$350 (one-way) with a layover in Oslo or Copenhagen.\n* **Level:** From $250-$400 (one-way) with a layover in Barcelona.\n* **WOW Air:** From $250-$450 (one-way) with a layover in Reykjavik.\n\n**Budget Airlines:**\n\n* **Ryanair:** From $150-$300 (one-way) with a layover in Dublin or another European city. Keep in mind that Ryanair has strict baggage restrictions and limited amenities.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Track prices:** Set up price alerts using tools like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Airfarewatchdog to monitor prices and receive notifications when they drop.\n2. **Be flexible:** Be open to different travel dates, flight schedules, and airlines to find the best deals.\n3. **Book in advance:** Generally, the earlier you book, the cheaper the flights. However, it's essential to balance this with the possibility of error fares or last-minute sales.\n4. **Consider alternative airports:** If you're willing to take a train or bus from another airport, you might find cheaper flights to Paris Orly (ORY) or other nearby airports.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your flight search! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."
