This component is likely a COM object or ActiveX control that the application relies on, but is not present or properly configured on the system.\n\nOne possible solution is to try re-registering the component by running the command \"regsvr32 epub2pdf.exe\" from the command prompt. If that doesn't work, you may need to contact the application vendor for further assistance or try to find a newer version of the application that is compatible with Windows 10."

      "content": "One way to identify which component is not properly registered on the system is to look at the error message more closely. In this case, the error message specifically states that the class \"epub2pdf.exe\" is not registered. This tells you that the component in question is likely a file with the name \"epub2pdf.exe\".\n\nAnother way to identify the unregistered component is to use tools such as Dependency Walker or Process Monitor to see what dependencies the application has and which ones are not being met. These tools can help you identify which DLLs or other files the application is trying to load, and which ones are missing or not registered.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check the event viewer for application logs to find more information about the error which might give more details about which component is not properly registered.\n\nOnce you have identified the unregistered component, you can then try to register it using the \"regsvr32\" command or contact the application vendor for assistance."

Check the system requirements for the program and ensure that the computer where the program is not working meets those requirements.\n2. Check if there are any updates available for the program and install them.\n3. Try running the program in compatibility mode or as an administrator.\n4.

It seems that the problem may be related to one of these dependencies not being properly registered or missing on the system where the program is not working.\n\nOne way to troubleshoot this issue would be to manually register these dependencies using the regsvr32 command in the command prompt.\n\nHere are the steps to do this:\n\n1. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.\n2. Type the command `cd <path_to_program_folder>` and press Enter. This will change the current directory to the folder where the program files are located.\n3. Type the command `regsvr32 <dll_file_name>` and press Enter. Replace <dll\\_file\\_name> with the name of the dll file (e.g. msvcp100.dll, msvcr100.dll etc). Repeat this step for all the dll files listed in the program folder.\n4. Type the command `regsvr32 <ocx_file_name>` and press Enter. Replace <ocx\\_file\\_name> with the name of the ocx file (e.g. tx4ole20.ocx).\n5. Close the command prompt and try running the program again to see if the issue is resolved.\n\nIt's also possible that the problem is related to missing files that are not included in this list, which would require further troubleshooting.\nIn case if this does not work, it's best to contact the software vendor for further help."
