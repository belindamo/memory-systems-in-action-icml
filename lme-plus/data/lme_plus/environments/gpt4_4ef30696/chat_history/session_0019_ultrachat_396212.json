      "content": "Mount Kilimanjaro is a significant landmark and sacred site for the Maasai people of Tanzania. The Maasai believe that their god, Enkai, resides on the mountain and they also associate it with their creation story. They believe that their ancestors emerged from a cave near the mountain.\n\nThe Maasai also rely on Mount Kilimanjaro for water as the melting snow and ice from the mountain feed many rivers and streams that provide water for their livestock and crops. The mountain is also home to a diverse range of wildlife that the Maasai hunt for food.\n\nHowever, the increased tourism and development around Mount Kilimanjaro has impacted the Maasai way of life. The fencing off of land around the mountain has limited the Maasai\u2019s access to water and grazing land for their livestock. The influx of tourists has also led to increased competition for resources like water and firewood, and has led to increased pressure on the environment around the mountain. To adapt, some Maasai have turned to tourism, becoming guides or selling their crafts to visitors."
