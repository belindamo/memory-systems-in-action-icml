Creating a spreadsheet to track your reading list will help you stay organized and focused on your reading goals.\n\nHere's a simple template to get you started:\n\n**Book Recommendations from Margaret**\n\n| **Book Title** | **Author** | **Priority Level** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n\nYou can add columns as needed, but these three should give you a good starting point. Here's a brief explanation for each column:\n\n1. **Book Title**: The title of the book recommended by Margaret.\n2. **Author**: The author of the book.\n3. **Priority Level**: A ranking system to help you prioritize which books to read first. You can use numbers (1-5), letters (A-E), or even emojis (e.g., \u2b50\ufe0f, \ud83d\udc4d, \ud83d\udcda) to indicate the level of priority.\n\nTo make it even more organized, you could add additional columns, such as:\n\n* **Genre**: The book's genre (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, mystery, sci-fi, fantasy).\n* **Status**: A column to track your progress (e.g., \"To-Read\", \"Reading\", \"Finished\", \"DNF\" (did not finish)).\n* **Notes**: A column for any notes or comments you want to make about the book.\n* **Source**: A column to note where you heard about the book (in this case, \"Margaret's Recommendation\").\n\nHere's an example of what the spreadsheet might look like with a few entries:\n\n| **Book Title** | **Author** | **Priority Level** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The Nightingale | Kristin Hannah | \u2b50\ufe0f |\n| The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo | Taylor Jenkins Reid | \ud83d\udc4d |\n| The Power | Naomi Alderman | \ud83d\udcda |\n\nFeel free to customize the columns and formatting to fit your needs.
