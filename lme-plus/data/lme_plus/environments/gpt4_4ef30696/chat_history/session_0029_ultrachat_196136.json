During the summer, temperatures can reach up to 50\u00b0C, which can be quite hot and uncomfortable for hiking.\n\n2. What to wear: Wear comfortable clothes and shoes that you can hike and swim in. Shorts, t-shirts, and sandals or water shoes are recommended. Don't forget to bring a towel, a waterproof bag, and sunscreen.\n\n3. What to bring: You may want to bring water and snacks with you, as there are no facilities or restaurants nearby. Also, it's recommended to bring a waterproof camera or case to take photos of this beautiful place.\n\n4. Other things to keep in mind: Be aware that the hike to Wadi Shab involves climbing over rocks and going through water, so be prepared to get wet. Also, it's advisable to go with a guide or a group, as the trail can be difficult to navigate on your own. Finally, please be respectful of the natural environment and do not leave any litter behind.\n\nHope you have a wonderful trip to Wadi Shab!"
