Here are some tips to help you make the most of them:\n\n**Citrus Peels:**\n\n1. **Zest:** Use a zester or a fine grater to remove the zest (the outer, colorful layer of the peel) and add it to baked goods, salad dressings, or as a garnish for cocktails.\n2. **Infused oils:** Slice the peels thinly and add them to a jar with a neutral oil (like olive or grapeseed oil) for a few weeks. The resulting infused oil is great for cooking or as a finishing oil for dishes.\n3. **Marmalade:** Make your own marmalade by simmering the peels in water and sugar to create a tangy, sweet spread.\n4. **Candied peels:** Slice the peels thinly and candied them by simmering them in a sugar syrup (equal parts sugar and water) until they're translucent and sweet.\n5. **Tea:** Dry the peels and use them to make a citrusy tea, either on their own or combined with other herbs.\n\n**Other parts of the fruit:**\n\n1. **Juice pulp:** Use the pulp left over from juicing to add fiber and flavor to baked goods, smoothies, or as a topping for oatmeal or yogurt.\n2. **Segments:** Use the segments (the individual pieces of fruit inside the peel) in salads, as a topping for yogurt or oatmeal, or as a snack on their own.\n3. **Citrus-herb salt:** Mix dried citrus peels with kosher salt and other herbs (like thyme or rosemary) to create a flavorful salt perfect for seasoning meats or vegetables.\n\n**General tips:**\n\n1. **Dry citrus peels:** Dry citrus peels in a low oven (150\u00b0F/65\u00b0C) or a dehydrator to preserve them for later use.\n2. **Freeze citrus:** Freeze citrus juice, zest, or segments in ice cube trays or airtight containers to use in recipes later.\n3. **Get creative:** Experiment with different combinations of citrus fruits and other ingredients to create unique flavors and recipes.\n\nBy using up citrus peels and other parts of the fruit, you'll not only reduce food waste but also discover new flavors and textures to enhance your cooking and baking. Happy experimenting!",
