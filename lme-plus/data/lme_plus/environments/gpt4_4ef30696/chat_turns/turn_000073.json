  "content": "As a general rule, it is best to keep different types of succulents in their own separate pots. This is because different succulents have different watering and sunlight requirements, and keeping them in the same pot can make it challenging to provide each plant with the appropriate care. In addition, mixing different types of succulents can make it harder to identify and address any issues that may arise, such as pest infestations or over/under-watering. That being said, if you decide to plant different types of succulents in the same pot, make sure to choose varieties with similar cultural requirements. For example, you could combine different types of echeveria or sedum plants, as these have similar watering and sunlight needs. You could also mix different shades and varieties of the same species to create an interesting and attractive display.",
