  "content": "Thank you so much for your help! I think I've got a good understanding of how to store citrus fruits and use up citrus peels and other parts of the fruit. Your tips on infused oils and candied citrus peels are really helpful, and I'm excited to try them out. I also appreciate the information on composting citrus peels - every little bit helps when it comes to reducing waste!\n\nI don't have any other questions for now, but I appreciate your offer to help. If I do have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, I won't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your help and happy cooking!",
