Creating a spreadsheet to track your reading list will help you stay organized and focused on your reading goals.\n\nHere's a simple template to get you started:\n\n**Book Recommendations from Margaret**\n\n| **Book Title** | **Author** | **Priority Level** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n\nYou can add columns as needed, but these three should give you a good starting point. Here's a brief explanation for each column:\n\n1. **Book Title**: The title of the book recommended by Margaret.\n2. **Author**: The author of the book.\n3. **Priority Level**: A ranking system to help you prioritize which books to read first. You can use numbers (1-5), letters (A-E), or even emojis (e.g., \u2b50\ufe0f, \ud83d\udc4d, \ud83d\udcda) to indicate the level of priority.\n\nTo make it even more organized, you could add additional columns, such as:\n\n* **Genre**: The book's genre (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, mystery, sci-fi, fantasy).\n* **Status**: A column to track your progress (e.g., \"To-Read\", \"Reading\", \"Finished\", \"DNF\" (did not finish)).\n* **Notes**: A column for any notes or comments you want to make about the book.\n* **Source**: A column to note where you heard about the book (in this case, \"Margaret's Recommendation\").\n\nHere's an example of what the spreadsheet might look like with a few entries:\n\n| **Book Title** | **Author** | **Priority Level** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The Nightingale | Kristin Hannah | \u2b50\ufe0f |\n| The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo | Taylor Jenkins Reid | \ud83d\udc4d |\n| The Power | Naomi Alderman | \ud83d\udcda |\n\nFeel free to customize the columns and formatting to fit your needs. You can also use filters and sorting to easily find books by author, priority level, or title.\n\nNow, go ahead and start filling in those book recommendations from Margaret! \ud83d\udcd6",
