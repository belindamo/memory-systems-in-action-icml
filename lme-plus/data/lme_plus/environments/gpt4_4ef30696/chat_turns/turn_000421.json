  "content": "I think we've had this conversation before! You mentioned earlier that you paid $25 for extra legroom on the return flight, and I'm glad to hear it was worth it for you! United's Economy Plus seats do offer more legroom and can make a big difference on longer flights.\n\nIt's great that you've had good experiences with seat selection on United, and paying for extra legroom can be a worthwhile investment for many travelers. If you're willing to pay for it, it can definitely enhance your flying experience.\n\nHowever, just to clarify, since you're booking an award ticket using your miles, you won't be able to purchase Economy Plus or extra legroom seats as part of the award booking process. If you want to upgrade to a seat with more legroom, you might need to wait until check-in or contact United's customer service to explore your options.\n\nBut I'm glad to hear that you've had positive experiences with seat selection and extra legroom on United in the past!",
