Store them in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 months.\n3. **Freeze:** Zest lemons and freeze the zest in an airtight container or freezer bag for up to 6 months. You can also freeze lemon juice in ice cube trays and store the frozen cubes in a freezer bag for up to 3 months.\n\n**Oranges:**\n\n1. **Room temperature:** Store oranges at room temperature, away from direct sunlight, for up to 1-2 weeks.\n2. **Refrigerate:** Place oranges in a paper bag or wrap them individually in paper towels to maintain humidity.
