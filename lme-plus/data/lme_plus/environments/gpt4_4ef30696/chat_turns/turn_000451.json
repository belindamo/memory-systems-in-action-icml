This component is likely a COM object or ActiveX control that the application relies on, but is not present or properly configured on the system.\n\nOne possible solution is to try re-registering the component by running the command \"regsvr32 epub2pdf.exe\" from the command prompt. If that doesn't work, you may need to contact the application vendor for further assistance or try to find a newer version of the application that is compatible with Windows 10.",
