However, the expo typically offers lots of interesting and informative panels, workshops, and other events that you can attend. Make sure to check out the schedule of events beforehand and plan out your schedule accordingly.\n\nSome popular events that have taken place at SPX in the past include workshops on creating comics, panel discussions with prominent creators, and Q&A sessions with authors and artists. There are also often book signings and meet-and-greet opportunities with creators, where you can get your books signed and chat with the creators about their work. Additionally, there's usually an exhibition hall full of publishers and independent creators selling their books and comics, which is a great place to discover new works and buy some cool stuff.\n\nMake sure to take a look at the schedule in advance and plan your time at the show accordingly. Remember, SPX is a great opportunity to meet like-minded people and dive deep into the indie comics scene, so make the most out of it!",
