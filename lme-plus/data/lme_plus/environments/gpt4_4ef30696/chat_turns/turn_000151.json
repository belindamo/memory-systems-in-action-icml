Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Citrus Infused Oil Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup neutral oil (olive, grapeseed, or avocado oil work well)\n* 1/2 cup citrus peels (orange, lemon, or grapefruit)\n* 1 small glass jar with a lid\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Slice the citrus peels thinly, making sure to remove any white pith.\n2. Place the sliced peels in the glass jar, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top.\n3. Pour the neutral oil over the peels, making sure they're completely covered.\n4. Seal the jar and store it in a cool, dark place for 2-4 weeks. Shake the jar every few days to help the infusion process.\n5. After 2-4 weeks, strain the oil through a cheesecloth or fine-mesh sieve into another container. Discard the peels.\n6. Store the infused oil in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Use within 6 months.\n\n**Candied Citrus Peels:**\n\nCandied citrus peels make a delicious garnish or snack.

They're rich in nutrients and can help speed up the composting process. Here are a few tips for composting citrus peels:\n\n* Chop the peels into small pieces to help them break down faster.\n* Mix the peels with other compost materials, like leaves or vegetable scraps, to create a balanced compost pile.\n* Avoid adding too many citrus peels to your compost pile, as they can create a acidity imbalance.\n* If you have a worm composting bin, citrus peels are a great addition to the worm's diet!\n\nRemember to always balance your compost pile with a mix of \"green\" materials (like citrus peels, vegetable scraps, and grass clippings) and \"brown\" materials (like leaves, twigs, and shredded newspaper). Happy composting!",
