I'll make sure to keep my responses concise and within the limit from now on. Please let me try that again!\n\n**Transfer Learning in Language Models:**\n\nBERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet are popular language models that use transfer learning to achieve state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks. They're pre-trained on large corpora of text data using masked language modeling or autoregressive language modeling objectives. The pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question-answering, and text classification.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. Improved performance on specific NLP tasks\n2. Reduced training time\n3. Fewer data requirements\n\n**Applications:**\n\n1. Sentiment analysis\n2. Question-answering\n3. Text classification\n4.
