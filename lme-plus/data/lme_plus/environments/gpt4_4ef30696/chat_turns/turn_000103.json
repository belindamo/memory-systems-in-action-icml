  "content": "The key differences between B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-consumer) include the target market, the buying process, and the sales process. B2B companies sell products or services to other businesses, while B2C companies sell directly to consumers. The buying process for B2B is usually more complex and involves multiple decision-makers, while B2C purchases are typically made by individuals. B2B sales often involve longer-term relationships and contracts, while B2C sales are typically one-time transactions. Additionally, B2B marketing often emphasizes the technical features and capabilities of a product or service, while B2C marketing focuses on emotional appeals and the benefits to the consumer.",
