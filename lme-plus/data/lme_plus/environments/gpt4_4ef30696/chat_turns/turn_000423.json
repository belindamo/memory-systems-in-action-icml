  "content": "The credit card miles you earned from your United credit card are redeemable for award travel, but they don't count towards elite status qualification. To upgrade to Premier Gold or any other elite tier, you'll need to earn the required number of Premier Qualifying Miles (PQMs) and Premier Qualifying Segments (PQSs) through flying on United or its partner airlines.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the requirements for Premier Gold:\n\n* 40,000 PQMs or 48 PQSs\n* $4,000 in Premier Qualifying Dollars (PQDs)\n\nPQMs and PQSs are earned based on the distance flown and the fare paid for your tickets. PQDs are earned based on the base fare and carrier-imposed surcharges.\n\nWhile having a United credit card can provide benefits like extra miles, priority boarding, and travel insurance, it doesn't directly help you earn elite status. To upgrade to Premier Gold, you'll need to fly regularly on United and its partners, or earn PQMs and PQSs through other means, such as credit card spend on certain partners or through other loyalty programs.\n\nThat being said, if you're close to meeting the requirements for Premier Gold, you might consider flying more or using other strategies to earn the remaining PQMs and PQSs. Once you reach Premier Gold, you'll enjoy benefits like upgraded seating, priority check-in and boarding, and increased baggage allowance, among others.",
