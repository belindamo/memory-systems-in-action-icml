Plan Ahead: Before you leave for Small Press Expo, take the time to schedule your days by looking at the schedule of events online or in the printed directory. Identify the panels and exhibitions that you don't want to miss and make a note of the specific times you need to be there.\n\n2. Take Breaks: While it's important to make the most of your time at SPX, remember to take breaks and allow yourself to rest. There's a lot to see, and getting overwhelmed can be a real downer. So try to relax and soak in the vibe.\n\n3. Talk with Creators: Take advantage of the opportunities to talk with creators, publishers, and other fans. Chat with creators, attend signings, and ask questions. It's a great chance to learn more and engage with your favorite indie creators.\n\n4. Bring Cash: Most vendors and creators at SPX take credit cards or can handle digital transactions, but it's always a smart idea to bring cash as well, just in case. You don't want to miss out on a great book or conversation because you don't have the payment option the creator wants.\n\n5. Dress Comfortably: You will spend a lot of time on your feet, so wear comfortable shoes and dress in layers, especially if you plan on queuing up in the hot sun for long periods.\n\nOverall, the key to having an amazing Small Press Expo experience is to plan ahead and immerse yourself in the event. Engage with fellow comic book enthusiasts, talk to creators, participate in panel discussions, and have a lot of fun!",
