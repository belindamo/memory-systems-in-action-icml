I'd be happy to help you brainstorm some delicious and nutritious options based on your doctor's advice. Can you tell me a bit more about the specific dietary changes your doctor recommended? For example:\n\n* Are you looking to reduce sugar intake, increase fiber, or lower cholesterol?\n* Are there any specific food groups you need to focus on or avoid (e.g., gluten, dairy, meat)?\n* Do you have any food allergies or intolerances I should keep in mind?\n* Are there any cuisines or cooking methods you prefer (e.g., vegetarian, Mediterranean, grilling, roasting)?\n\nWith this information, I can provide you with some personalized healthy meal ideas to get you started on your dietary changes.",
