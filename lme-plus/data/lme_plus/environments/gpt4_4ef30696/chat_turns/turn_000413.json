  "content": "I'm happy to help you with that!\n\nTo estimate the number of miles needed for a round-trip economy ticket on United from your preferred departure city to Maui (OGG), I'll need to know a few more details. Please provide me with the following information:\n\n1. Your departure city (or the closest airport to you)\n2. Your travel dates (or a rough idea of when you're planning to travel)\n3. Are you a United MileagePlus member with Premier status (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum, or 1K)?\n\nWith this information, I can give you a more accurate estimate of the miles required for your round-trip economy ticket.\n\nRegarding the extra legroom on the return flight, that's great to hear it was worth it for you! However, please note that the cost of the extra legroom upgrade is separate from the miles required for the award ticket.\n\nLooking forward to helping you plan your trip to Maui!",
