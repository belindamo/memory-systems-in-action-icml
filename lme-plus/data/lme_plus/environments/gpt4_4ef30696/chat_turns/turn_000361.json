  "content": "Excellent suggestion! Creating a subfolder for contacts under \"Individuals\" makes perfect sense. That way, you can store the contact information for each person in a centralized location, making it easy to find and update.\n\nHere's the revised folder structure:\n\n**Top-Level Folder:**\n\n* **People**\n\n**Subfolders:**\n\n* **Contacts** (store general contact information, such as business cards or phone contacts)\n\t+ **Business Cards** (scan or save digital business cards)\n\t+ **Phone Contacts** (export contacts from your phone or save vCards)\n\t+ **Email Contacts** (save email addresses and contact info from emails)\n* **Photos** (store photos of people you've met)\n\t+ **Events** (organize photos by event, e.g., conferences, parties, meetups)\n\t+ **Individuals** (store photos and contact info for specific people)\n\t\t- **John Doe**\n\t\t\t- **Photos**\n\t\t\t\t- john_doe_photo.jpg\n\t\t\t- **Contact Info**\n\t\t\t\t- john_doe_contact_info.txt (or vCard, or business card scan)\n\t\t- **Jane Smith**\n\t\t\t- **Photos**\n\t\t\t\t- jane_smith_photo.jpg\n\t\t\t- **Contact Info**\n\t\t\t\t- jane_smith_contact_info.txt (or vCard, or business card scan)\n\nAnd, I'm sure Jack will get those photos to you soon! In the meantime, you can create a placeholder folder for Jack's photos under \"Individuals\" to keep everything organized.\n\nRemember to update your folder structure as you receive new photos and contacts. It's essential to maintain your organization system to ensure it remains effective and easy to use.\n\nHow does the revised structure look to you?",
