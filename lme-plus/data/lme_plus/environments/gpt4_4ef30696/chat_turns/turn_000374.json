I've been taking sculpting classes at the local art studio on Wednesday evenings, and my instructor, Rachel, has been super helpful in teaching me different techniques. I've also been experimenting with different clays, like terra cotta and stoneware, to get the right texture and look. Do you have any suggestions on how to create a sense of tension and anticipation in my sculpture?",
