It's wonderful that you're seeing improvements in your hair fall.\n\nNow, about using a conditioner after shampooing: it's a great idea, but you're right to worry about it making your hair too greasy at the roots. Since you have combination hair, you'll want to find a conditioner that balances moisture and oil control. Here are some tips:\n\n1. **Choose a lightweight, non-greasy conditioner**: Look for conditioners labeled \"lightweight,\" \"non-greasy,\" or \"oil-controlling.\" These will help moisturize your dry ends without weighing down your roots.\n2. **Use a conditioner specifically formulated for combination hair**: These conditioners are designed to balance moisture and oil control, making them perfect for your hair type.\n3. **Apply conditioner only to the ends**: Focus on applying the conditioner to the mid-lengths and ends of your hair, avoiding the roots. This will help lock in moisture where it's needed most.\n4. **Use a small amount**: Use a small amount of conditioner, about a quarter-sized amount, to avoid overpowering your hair.\n5. **Rinse thoroughly**: Make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly to remove all product residue.\n\nSome great conditioner options for combination hair include:\n\n* TRESemm\u00e9 Keratin Smooth Conditioner\n* Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine Intensely Nourishing Conditioner\n* Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner\n* L'Or\u00e9al Paris EverPure Repair & Protect Conditioner\n\nRemember, it's all about finding the right balance for your hair. If you're concerned about greasiness, start with a small amount and adjust as needed. You can always increase the amount if you find your hair needs more moisture.\n\nBy incorporating a conditioner into your routine, you'll likely see even more improvements in your hair's health and appearance.",
