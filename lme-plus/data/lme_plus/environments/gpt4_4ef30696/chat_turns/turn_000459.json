  "content": "From the list of files provided, it appears that this program is dependent on several dynamic link libraries (dlls) and one activex control (ocx) to function properly. It seems that the problem may be related to one of these dependencies not being properly registered or missing on the system where the program is not working.\n\nOne way to troubleshoot this issue would be to manually register these dependencies using the regsvr32 command in the command prompt.\n\nHere are the steps to do this:\n\n1. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.\n2. Type the command `cd <path_to_program_folder>` and press Enter. This will change the current directory to the folder where the program files are located.\n3. Type the command `regsvr32 <dll_file_name>` and press Enter. Replace <dll\\_file\\_name> with the name of the dll file (e.g. msvcp100.dll, msvcr100.dll etc). Repeat this step for all the dll files listed in the program folder.\n4. Type the command `regsvr32 <ocx_file_name>` and press Enter. Replace <ocx\\_file\\_name> with the name of the ocx file (e.g. tx4ole20.ocx).\n5. Close the command prompt and try running the program again to see if the issue is resolved.\n\nIt's also possible that the problem is related to missing files that are not included in this list, which would require further troubleshooting.\nIn case if this does not work, it's best to contact the software vendor for further help.",
