I'll also consider using Polls to ask followers what type of skin care topics they're most interested in discussing during the Q&A session. Additionally, I might collaborate with a skincare expert to take over my Instagram Live for a Q&A session, providing followers with expert advice and insights. Do you have any suggestions on how I can measure the success of my Q&A session and track engagement?",
