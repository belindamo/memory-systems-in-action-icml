Best time to go: The best time to visit Wadi Shab is from October to April, as it is cooler and there is less risk of flash floods during this time. During the summer, temperatures can reach up to 50\u00b0C, which can be quite hot and uncomfortable for hiking.\n\n2. What to wear: Wear comfortable clothes and shoes that you can hike and swim in. Shorts, t-shirts, and sandals or water shoes are recommended. Don't forget to bring a towel, a waterproof bag, and sunscreen.\n\n3. What to bring: You may want to bring water and snacks with you, as there are no facilities or restaurants nearby. Also, it's recommended to bring a waterproof camera or case to take photos of this beautiful place.\n\n4. Other things to keep in mind: Be aware that the hike to Wadi Shab involves climbing over rocks and going through water, so be prepared to get wet. Also, it's advisable to go with a guide or a group, as the trail can be difficult to navigate on your own. Finally, please be respectful of the natural environment and do not leave any litter behind.\n\nHope you have a wonderful trip to Wadi Shab!",
