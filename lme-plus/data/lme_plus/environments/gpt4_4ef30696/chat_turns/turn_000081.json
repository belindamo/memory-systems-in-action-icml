  "content": "You're thinking strategically about your financial priorities, which is excellent.\n\nPaying off student loans, building an emergency fund, and increasing 401(k) contributions are all important goals. Here's a framework to help you decide which one to focus on first:\n\n**Evaluate your student loans:**\n\n1. **Interest rate:** What's the interest rate on your student loans? If it's higher than 6-7%, it might make sense to focus on paying those off aggressively.\n2. **Balance:** How much do you owe? If you have a large balance, it may be wise to tackle that debt first.\n3. **Payment terms:** Are you on an income-driven repayment plan or have a long repayment period? If so, you might consider focusing on other goals.\n\n**Assess your emergency fund:**\n\n1. **Current savings:** Do you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses set aside in an easily accessible savings account?\n2. **Financial stability:** Are you stable in your job, or do you work in an industry with a high risk of layoffs?\n3. **Other financial obligations:** Do you have other high-priority debt, like credit card debt or a mortgage?\n\n**Consider your 401(k) contributions:**\n\n1. **Company match:** Are you taking full advantage of your employer's 401(k) match? If not, contribute enough to maximize the match.\n2. **Current contribution rate:** Are you currently contributing a significant amount to your 401(k)?\n3. **Retirement goals:** How important is retirement savings to you, and do you have a specific goal in mind?\n\n**Prioritize your goals:**\n\nBased on your evaluation, consider the following order of priority:\n\n1. **High-interest debt:** If you have student loans with high interest rates or credit card debt, focus on paying those off first.\n2. **Emergency fund:** If you don't have a solid emergency fund in place, aim to save 3-6 months' worth of expenses.\n3. **401(k) contributions:** Once you've addressed the above goals, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.\n\n**Example scenario:**\n\nLet's say you have:\n\n* $30,000 in student loans with a 4% interest rate\n* A stable job and 2 months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund\n* You're currently contributing 5% to your 401(k), but your employer offers a 50% match up to 6%\n\nIn this scenario, you might focus on:\n\n1. Building your emergency fund to 3-6 months' worth of expenses\n2. Increasing your 401(k) contributions to 6% to maximize the employer match\n3. Paying off your student loans, potentially considering income-driven repayment plans or refinancing to a lower interest rate\n\nRemember, this is just a general framework, and your individual circumstances may vary. You might need to adjust your priorities based on your specific situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor if you're unsure about the best course of action.",
