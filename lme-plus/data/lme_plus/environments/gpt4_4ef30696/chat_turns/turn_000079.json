However, I can provide some general guidelines to help you assess your progress and set targets.\n\n**How much should you have saved by now?**\n\nA common rule of thumb is to have saved at least 1-2 times your annual income by age 32. Based on this, if you earn $50,000 per year, you might aim to have around $50,000 to $100,000 in your 401(k) account by now. However, this is just a rough estimate, and the right amount for you will depend on your individual circumstances.\n\n**Contribution percentage:**\n\nThe general recommendation is to contribute at least 10% to 15% of your income towards retirement savings. However, if you're just starting out, it's essential to start with a manageable amount and gradually increase it over time.\n\nConsider the following contribution percentage targets:\n\n* 5% to 10% of your income if you're just starting out or have high-interest debt to pay off\n* 10% to 12% if you're established in your career and have a stable financial foundation\n* 12% to 15% or more if you're aggressively saving for retirement or want to retire early\n\n**Actionable steps:**\n\n1. **Review your current contribution rate:** Check your 401(k) statements to see how much you're currently contributing each month. Is it 5%, 10%, or something else?\n2. **Assess your financial situation:** Consider your income, debt, expenses, and financial goals. Are you paying off high-interest debt, building an emergency fund, or saving for other goals?\n3. **Increase your contribution rate:** Aim to increase your contribution rate by 1% to 2% each year or whenever you receive a raise. This will help you make progress towards your retirement savings goals.\n4. **Take advantage of employer matching:** If your employer offers a 401(k) or other retirement plan matching program, contribute enough to maximize the match. This is essentially free money that can add up over time.\n5. **Automate your contributions:** Set up automatic transfers from your paycheck or bank account to your 401(k) account to make saving easier and less prone to being neglected.\n\nRemember, the key is to be consistent and persistent in your retirement savings efforts. Even small increases in your contribution rate can make a significant difference over time.\n\nHow does this guidance align with your current situation? Are you on track with your retirement savings, or do you need to make some adjustments?",
