So, you can expect to need around 40,000 miles for a round-trip economy ticket.\n\nKeep in mind that award availability can vary depending on the specific flights and dates you choose. If you have flexibility in your travel plans, you might be able to find flights that require fewer miles.\n\nAs a new credit card holder, you'll need to book your award ticket through United's website or by calling their customer service. Since you don't have Premier status, you won't have access to more advanced award search tools, but you can still find available flights using United's website.\n\nTo increase your chances of finding available award seats, consider flying into OGG on a weekday (Monday to Thursday) instead of a weekend. You can also try booking your flights well in advance or being flexible with your travel dates.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy travels to Maui!",
