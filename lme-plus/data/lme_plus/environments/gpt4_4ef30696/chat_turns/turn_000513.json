Here are a few ideas that might just do the trick:\n\n1. **Lemon Lavender Panna Cotta**: A creamy, citrusy, and herbaceous dessert that pairs beautifully with the bright, ocean-inspired flavors of the meal. The lavender adds a subtle, floral note that evokes the sea air.\n2. **Sea Salt Caramel Tart with Fresh Berries**: A sweet and salty tart that incorporates the ocean's essence through the use of flaky sea salt. The caramel and berries provide a nice contrast to the savory flavors of the meal.\n3. **Citrus-Herb Sorbet**: A refreshing, palate-cleansing sorbet infused with citrus zest (e.g., lemon, orange, or grapefruit) and herbs like mint, basil, or lemongrass. This dessert will help cut through the richness of the meal and leave your guests feeling revitalized.\n4. **Coconut Lime Macarons**: A tropical, ocean-inspired dessert that incorporates the sweetness of coconut and the brightness of lime. The macaron shells can be flavored with a hint of salt to tie in with the seafood theme.\n5. **Fresh Fruit Tarts with Honey and Thyme**: A light, sweet, and savory dessert that incorporates fresh seasonal fruits (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries) with a drizzle of honey and a sprinkle of thyme. The thyme adds a subtle, herbaceous note that complements the seafood flavors.\n\nThese desserts should provide a nice conclusion to your seafood-inspired dinner party without being too on-the-nose. Choose one that resonates with your taste preferences and cooking style, and don't hesitate to ask if you need any help with recipes or tips!",
