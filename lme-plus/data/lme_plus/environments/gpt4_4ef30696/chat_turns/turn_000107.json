For example:\n\n* What are your top 3-5 tasks that need to be completed by the end of the week?\n* Do you have any meetings or appointments already scheduled?\n* How many hours do you have available to work on your tasks each day?\n* Are there any specific time blocks you need to allocate for breaks, exercise, or personal activities?\n\nWith this information, I can help you create a personalized schedule for the week to ensure you meet your deadline for the report and complete your other tasks on time.",
