These painters often emphasized the sublime and the transcendent, seeking to convey a sense of wonder and awe at the power and vastness of nature.\n\nOne of the key figures in the Romantic landscape tradition was the English painter J.M.W. Turner, whose dramatic and evocative seascapes and landscapes helped to establish a new vision of the natural world. Turner and other Romantic landscape painters often used light and color to create a sense of vastness and expansiveness, as if the viewer were standing on the edge of a vast horizon.\n\nAnother important aspect of Romantic landscape painting was the use of mythology and folklore, as well as a focus on historical and cultural contexts. Many artists drew on ancient myths and legends to imbue their landscapes with a sense of grandeur and mythic import, while others depicted historical events or famous landmarks to convey a sense of national pride and identity.\n\nIn short, landscape painting played a pivotal role in the Romantic era, helping to establish a new vision of the natural world that emphasized its power, beauty, and transcendence, and represented a powerful artistic response to the social, cultural, and technological changes of the time.",
