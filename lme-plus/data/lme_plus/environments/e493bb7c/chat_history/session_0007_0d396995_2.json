      "content": "You're a savvy shopper, and you want to maximize your savings!\n\nAccording to CVS Pharmacy's coupon policy, you can stack digital coupons with other offers, but there are some limitations. Here's what I found out:\n\n**Stacking Digital Coupons:**\n\n1. **Yes, you can stack the $2 off Neutrogena Facial Wipes digital coupon and the 20% off Neutrogena Products digital coupon together**. This is because they are two separate digital coupons, and CVS Pharmacy allows you to combine them.\n2. **The $2 off coupon will be applied first**, and then the 20% off coupon will be applied to the remaining balance.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* Neutrogena Facial Wipes (1 pack) = $10.99\n* $2 off Neutrogena Facial Wipes digital coupon = -$2.00\n* New price = $8.99\n* 20% off Neutrogena Products digital coupon = -$1.80 (20% of $8.99)\n* Final price = $7.19\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n1. **Make sure you have both digital coupons loaded onto your ExtraCare card or mobile app** before checking out.\n2. **The coupons will be applied automatically at checkout**, so you don't need to do anything extra.\n3. **Some digital coupons may have limitations or exclusions**, so always check the terms and conditions before using them.\n\nBy stacking these two digital coupons, you'll save a total of $3.80 on your Neutrogena Facial Wipes purchase! Happy shopping!"
