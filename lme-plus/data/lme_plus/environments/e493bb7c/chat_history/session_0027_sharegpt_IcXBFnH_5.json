Here is a revised draft of the policy that incorporates my previous suggestions:\n\nMemorandum\nFebruary 8, 2023\nTo: WIB WIOA Title I Subrecipients\nFrom: Adam Peck, Executive Director\nSubject: Guidance on Virtual Service Delivery of WIOA Title I Career and Youth Services\n\nPurpose and Scope\nThis memo provides guidance on the provision of virtual services for WIOA Title I Eligibility and Youth and Career and Training Services for the Workforce Investment Board of Tulare County (WIB) subrecipients. The guidance is intended to prioritize virtual services that assist individuals who have an urgent and immediate need for enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy supersedes the guidance titled Maximizing Distance Technology for WIOA Title I Registration, dated March 31, 2020, and guidance titled Activities and Service Delivery for Remote Services, dated July 23, 2020.\n\nDefinition of Remote Services\nFor the purposes of this policy, remote services involve the exchange of information through a virtual platform, such as Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, or other platforms. Remote services should be meaningful, engaging, and equivalent to receiving in-person services.\n\nAccessibility\nSubrecipients should make every effort to ensure that virtual services are accessible to all customers, including those who lack access to technology or reliable internet. When in-person or remote services are not viable, subrecipients should consider meeting customers at an alternative location.\n\nEvaluation of Remote Services\nSubrecipients should regularly evaluate the effectiveness of remote services. This could include metrics such as customer satisfaction, enrollment rates, and employment outcomes for those who receive remote services. Subrecipients should use this information to continually improve and refine their remote service offerings.\n\nCustomer Focused Service Delivery\nAll aspects of service delivery should be designed with the needs and interests of customers in mind. Customers may access WIOA Title I program services remotely or in-person based on their preferences or needs.\n\nRemote CalJOBS Eligibility Explorer Application\nWhen conducting remote eligibility, subrecipients should use the CalJOBS Eligibility Explorer Application to assist customers in completing a pre-application and uploading eligibility documents remotely. Intake staff must protect customers' Personal Identifiable Information (PII), and eligibility documents must be uploaded to CalJOBS through the Eligibility Explorer Application, or an in-person appointment should be scheduled to submit eligibility documents. Staff should enter a case note of the customer's request for a remote eligibility appointment.\n\nCoordinated Enrollment\nUpon completing the eligibility in-person or remotely, customers shall have access to a career coach the same day for an initial assessment, objective assessment, and My Action Plan.\n\nRemote Electronic Signatures\nThe WIOA application enables individuals and staff to sign the CalJOBS program applications remotely. Subrecipients should use the CalJOBS Remote Electronic Signature User Guide to assist customers in signing the WIOA application remotely.\n\nRemote Services for Youth and Adult Career Services\nSubrecipients may offer remote services via engaging, interactive platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, etc.) for career services. In addition, electronic applications may be used to obtain signatures for worksite agreements, timesheets, and other related documents. Access to remote Youth and Adult Career Services shall include, but is not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Career services, coaching, and guidance\n\u2022 Work readiness workshops\n\u2022 Job fairs and industry-specific recruitment\n\u2022 Business Engagement and outreach\n\u2022 Signing work-based training documents and other types of documents via electronic applications.\n\nAccess to remote workshops shall include, but is not limited to:\n\u2022 Interviewing skills\n\u2022 Career Exploration\n\u2022 Resume development\n\u2022 How to apply for jobs online and in-person\n\u2022 Finance and budgeting"
