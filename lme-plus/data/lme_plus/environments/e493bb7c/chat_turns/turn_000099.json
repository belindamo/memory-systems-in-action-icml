However, the Calgary Stampeders have been consistent performers in recent years, having reached the Grey Cup championship game several times in the last decade, including winning in 2014 and 2018. They have a strong organization, good coaching staff, and a winning culture, so they certainly have the potential to compete for the championship again this season. Of course, a lot will depend on their roster, the performance of their players, and their opponents, among other factors. We will have to wait and see how the season unfolds to know if they will make it to the Grey Cup this year.",
