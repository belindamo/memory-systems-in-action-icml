If you enjoyed Codenames, you might like other word-based or party games like Taboo, Pictionary, or Deception. If you're interested, I can give you more suggestions!\n\nNow, about reaching out to Rachel... It's great that you're thinking of reconnecting with her! Given that you used to catch up regularly, it's understandable that you'd want to get back into that rhythm.\n\nRegarding the canceled brunch plans on Valentine's Day, it's up to you whether you want to bring it up or not. If you do decide to mention it, you could frame it in a lighthearted way, like:\n\n\"Hey Rachel, I've been meaning to reach out for weeks! I felt terrible about canceling our brunch plans on Valentine's Day. How have you been, and what's new with you?\"\n\nBy acknowledging the canceled plans, you're showing that you value your connection and are willing to own up to any mistakes. However, if you don't want to bring it up, you could simply start with a friendly hello and ask how she's doing.\n\nRemember, the goal is to reconnect and start a conversation, not to place blame or apologize excessively. Keep the tone light and friendly, and you'll likely have a positive exchange.\n\nIf you need more advice or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",
