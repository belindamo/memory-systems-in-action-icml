Saut\u00e9ed spinach and mushrooms will add a wonderful depth of flavor and texture to your vegan omelet! \n\nHere are some tips to help you bring out the natural flavors of spinach and mushrooms:\n\n**Saut\u00e9ing Spinach:**\n\n1. **Use fresh spinach**: Fresh spinach has a milder flavor and a better texture than frozen or canned spinach.\n2. **Chop it finely**: Chop the spinach leaves finely to help them cook evenly and quickly.\n3. **Heat control**: Cook the spinach over medium-low heat to prevent it from burning or becoming bitter.\n4. **Don't overcook**: Cook the spinach just until it's wilted, about 1-2 minutes.
