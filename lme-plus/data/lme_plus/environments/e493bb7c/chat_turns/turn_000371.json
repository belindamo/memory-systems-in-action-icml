  "content": "It is true that one can serve others and show love to those around them without focusing solely on God, and this is indeed a fundamental part of Christian life. However, in Carmelite spirituality, the emphasis on the interior life is seen as a means of deepening and enriching one's relationship with God, and of developing the virtues and inner strength necessary for a life of service to others.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on detachment and the interior life is not seen as a withdrawal from the world, but rather a means of engaging with the world from a place of spiritual strength and clarity. In Carmelite spirituality, the active life of service is seen as an outgrowth of the interior life, and both are seen as necessary for a truly Christian life.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the interior life is not seen as an end in itself but as a means of growing in relationship with God and deepening one's faith. By cultivating a deep interior life, one can develop the spiritual strength and insight necessary to live a truly Christian life in the world, with all its challenges and complexities.\n\nIn summary, while it is certainly possible to serve others and show love without focusing solely on God, in Carmelite spirituality, the emphasis on the interior life is seen as a necessary means of deepening one's relationship with God and developing the virtues necessary for an active life of service to others.",
