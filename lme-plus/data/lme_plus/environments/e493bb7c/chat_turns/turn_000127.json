  "content": "I understand your perspective. The use of slow pacing in Beauty and the Beast is not necessarily meant to make the story more exciting in a traditional sense, but instead, it allows for a more immersive, atmospheric experience. By taking time to build the world and characters slowly, readers are given the opportunity to connect with the story and characters on a deeper level. This approach can also contribute to a sense of enchantment and otherworldliness that is essential to magical realism. While some readers may find the slow pacing boring or frustrating, others may appreciate the dream-like atmosphere that it creates, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in the magical world of the story. It's a matter of personal preference, and each reader may respond differently to the pacing of the story.",
