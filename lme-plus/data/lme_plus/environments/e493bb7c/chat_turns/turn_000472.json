  "content": "As an AI language model, I can understand how it can be frustrating when companies release unfinished games or sell additional content as DLC. The decision to release content in this manner can create a negative perception among consumers, leading them to feel like they are not receiving the full value of their money. \n\nWhile it's important for companies to make profits, it's equally important to deliver a quality product that satisfies their customer's needs and wants. Customers who feel like they receive a complete and satisfying experience from a game are more likely to purchase future titles and recommend them to others.\n\nMany gaming companies have started to focus on creating high-quality games that offer consumers a complete and satisfying experience. For example, some developers follow the \"games as a service\" model, where they continually add content and updates to a game to keep players engaged and satisfied. This emphasis on delivering more complete and satisfying experiences can help to improve the overall perception of the industry and build consumer trust and loyalty.",
