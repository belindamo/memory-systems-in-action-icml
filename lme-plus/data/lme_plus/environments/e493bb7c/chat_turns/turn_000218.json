However, it is important to be cautious while trying local street food to avoid getting sick. Here are some tips for navigating the local food scene safely:\n\n1. Choose reputable vendors: Look for stalls or shops that are busy and have a high turnover of food. This will help ensure that the food is fresh and that they follow good hygiene practices. 2. Avoid raw or undercooked food: Make sure that the food you order is cooked thoroughly, especially meat and eggs. Street vendors may not have access to reliable refrigeration, so it's better to avoid raw or undercooked food. 3. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay well-hydrated in the hot and dry climate of Rajasthan. Bottled water is widely available, and it's a good idea to carry a reusable water bottle with you to avoid buying bottled water every time. 4. Use hand sanitizer: Carry a bottle of hand sanitizer with you and use it before and after eating to avoid the spread of germs. 5. Avoid ice, salads, and cut fruits: Street vendors may not use clean water to make ice or to wash vegetables and fruits. It's better to avoid these items, or choose places that use purified or bottled water. 6. Take it easy: Start with small portions and take it slow while trying new foods. Your body may take some time to adjust to the new flavors and ingredients. By following these tips, you can enjoy the local food scene in Rajasthan without getting sick!",
