  "content": "The \u201cFriends of the ABC\u201d is a group of young revolutionary students who play a major role in the novel Les Mis\u00e9rables by Victor Hugo. They are also known as the \u201cABC Society,\u201d which stands for \u201cLes Amis de l\u2019ABC\u201d in French. They are motivated by their desire to overthrow the French government and establish a more just and equal society, inspired by the principles of the French Revolution.\n\nThe role of the \u201cFriends of the ABC\u201d is to represent the idealistic and youthful aspect of the revolutionary movement. They are portrayed as passionate and determined young men who are willing to risk everything for their cause. They are also shown as being somewhat naive and inexperienced, as they underestimate the power and brutality of the government forces they are up against.\n\nThe members of the \u201cFriends of the ABC\u201d play a key role in the June Rebellion, which was a failed attempt to overthrow the French government in 1832. Despite their defeat, however, their spirit and ideals continued to inspire future generations of revolutionary movements. The \u201cFriends of the ABC\u201d thus represent the ideal of revolution and the belief in the power of ordinary people to create a better world.",
