Auto racing is an exciting hobby, and it's great that you're enthusiastic about improving your Ford Mustang's performance.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on the power gain from the high-performance air filter and spark plugs! Those are great upgrades for a noticeable boost in horsepower.\n\nNow, let's dive into suspension setup for better handling. Since you're an amateur auto racing enthusiast, I'll provide some general tips that you can consider:\n\n1. **Lowering your car**: Lowering your Mustang can improve its handling by reducing the center of gravity. However, be cautious not to lower it too much, as this can affect your car's ground clearance and increase the risk of scraping or damaging the underside. A 1-2 inch drop is a good starting point.\n2. **Stiffer springs and shocks**: Upgrading to stiffer springs and shocks can help improve your car's handling by reducing body roll and improving cornering stability. However, this may affect your car's ride comfort.\n3. **Sway bars**: Installing stiffer sway bars (also known as anti-roll bars) can help reduce body roll and improve cornering stability. This is especially useful for track driving or autocross events.\n4. **Camber and toe adjustments**: Adjusting your car's camber and toe can help improve its handling. Camber affects the angle of the wheels, while toe affects the direction they point. Proper adjustments can help improve cornering stability and reduce tire wear.\n5. **Bushings and mounts**: Upgrading your car's bushings and mounts can help improve its handling by reducing the amount of movement and flex in the suspension. This can help improve responsiveness and stability.\n6. **Alignment**: Regularly checking and adjusting your car's alignment is crucial for optimal handling. Make sure your wheels are properly aligned to ensure even tire wear and optimal handling.\n7. **Weight distribution**: Consider weight distribution when modifying your car. A well-balanced car with an even weight distribution can handle better than one with an uneven distribution.\n8. **Test and adjust**: When making suspension changes, test your car on different surfaces and adjust accordingly. This will help you find the optimal setup for your driving style and the tracks you frequent.\n\nRemember to always follow safety guidelines and consult with a professional mechanic or suspension specialist if you're unsure about any modifications. It's also essential to ensure that your car meets safety and regulatory requirements for track driving.\n\nI hope these tips help you improve your Mustang's handling and performance!",
