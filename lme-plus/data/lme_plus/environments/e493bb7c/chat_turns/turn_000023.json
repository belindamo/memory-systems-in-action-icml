Freestyle stroke with tennis ball: Hold a tennis ball in one hand while swimming freestyle, and switch hands every few strokes. This drill helps to improve balance and stroke mechanics.\n\n2. Kick drills: You can perform kick drills using a kickboard or by holding onto the side of the pool, focusing on keeping your legs straight and engaging your core muscles.\n\n3. Pull drills: Using pull buoys or just your arms, focus on performing freestyle or breaststroke pulls, improving your arm strength while engaging your core muscles.\n\n4. Interval training: Break up your swimming routine by performing short intervals of fast swimming followed by longer recovery periods. This will help build cardiovascular endurance and improve your overall fitness.\n\n5. Treading water: Treading water is not only a good swimming drill but also a good fitness exercise. Try to keep your head above water and move your arms and legs in a circular motion to keep yourself afloat.\n\nRemember to consult with a certified coach or trainer before starting any new fitness routine to ensure proper technique and safety.",
