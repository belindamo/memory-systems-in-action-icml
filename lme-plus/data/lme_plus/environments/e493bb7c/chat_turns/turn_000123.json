  "content": "The pacing of the story in Beauty and the Beast contributes to the magical realism by creating a dream-like atmosphere that blurs the line between reality and fantasy. The slow, meandering pace of the story allows for the reader to become fully immersed in the enchanted world of the Beast's castle, where time seems to stand still and anything is possible. Additionally, the sudden bursts of action and moments of heightened tension that punctuate the story serve to underscore the magical elements of the narrative, such as when the Beast magically transforms into a prince or when Belle is granted the power to see beyond the Beast's outer appearance. Overall, the pacing of Beauty and the Beast helps to create a sense of wonder and otherworldliness that is central to the magical realism genre.",
