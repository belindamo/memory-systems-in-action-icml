Here are some tips and recipe ideas to get you started:\n\n**Air-Frying:**\n\n1. **Temperature control**: Adjust the temperature according to the ingredients you're cooking. For vegan \"meats,\" start with a lower temperature (around 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C) and increase as needed.\n2. **Don't overcrowd**: Cook in batches if necessary, to ensure even cooking and crispiness.\n3. **Pat dry ingredients**: Remove excess moisture from ingredients like tofu or tempeh before air-frying to achieve crunchiness.\n4. **Use oil sparingly**: Air-frying uses little to no oil, but you can add a small amount for flavor and crispiness.\n\nRecipe idea: **Vegan \"Chick'n\" Nuggets**\n\n* 1 block of extra-firm tofu, drained and crumbled\n* 1/2 cup cornstarch\n* 1/2 cup vegan panko breadcrumbs\n* 1 tablespoon lemon juice\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon paprika\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n\nPreheat the air fryer to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Mix the tofu, cornstarch, panko breadcrumbs, lemon juice, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Shape into nuggets and air-fry for 10-12 minutes, shaking halfway through. Brush with olive oil and serve.\n\n**Pressure Cooking:**\n\n1. **Liquid ratio**: Use a minimum of 1 cup of liquid (broth, water, or plant-based milk) for every 1 cup of solid ingredients.\n2. **Cooking time**: Pressure cooking times vary depending on the ingredients and desired texture. Consult the user manual or online resources for guidance.\n3. **Natural release**: Allow the pressure to release naturally (10-15 minutes) after cooking to prevent overcooking and promote tenderization.\n4. **Experiment with spices**: Pressure cooking can help infuse flavors, so don't be afraid to add aromatics and spices to your dishes.\n\nRecipe idea: **Vegan Lentil Curry**\n\n* 1 cup brown or green lentils, rinsed and drained\n* 2 cups vegetable broth\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon curry powder\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Fresh cilantro, for garnish\n\nSaute the onion and garlic in a little oil, then add the lentils, broth, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Close the pressure cooker lid and cook for 20-25 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally, then serve garnished with fresh cilantro.\n\nRemember to always follow the manufacturer's guidelines and safety precautions when using air fryers and pressure cookers.\n\nI hope these tips and recipes inspire you to create delicious vegan dishes with these cooking methods!",
