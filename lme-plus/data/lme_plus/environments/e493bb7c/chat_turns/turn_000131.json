The museum was designed by architect Alexandros Tombazis and was opened to the public on August 2, 1997. The design was created to display the collection of artifacts discovered during excavation of the ancient city and sanctuary of Delphi, which was known as the center of the ancient world.\n\nOne of the key features of the museum is its location, which offers spectacular views over the archaeological site and the surrounding landscape. The museum is divided into four sections, with a total of 14 exhibition rooms. Each section has its own theme and focuses on the different aspects of the history of Delphi.\n\nThe first section, the Archaeological Site, displays the findings from the excavation of the ancient site of Delphi. It also provides information on the history and development of the area.\n\nThe second section, the Treasury of the Siphnians, displays the architectural and artistic features of the ancient treasure building from Siphnos, which was constructed in the 6th century BC. The Treasury of the Athenians, which houses the findings from the votive offerings of the Athenians, is the third section of the museum. This section of the museum displays stunningly beautiful sculptures, architectural elements, and other artifacts that were offered to the sanctuary during different time periods.\n\nThe fourth section of the museum, the Exhibition Hall, houses a rotation of temporary exhibitions. This section is used to display artifacts from other archaeological sites and museums, allowing visitors to see some of the other archaeological treasures of Greece.\n\nThe architectural design of the Delphi Archaeological Museum reflects the unique style of the ancient site of Delphi. The building is constructed using local materials, such as marble and stone, which are found in the surrounding area. The design of the museum also incorporates natural light, emphasizing the relationship between the archaeological site, the museum, and the surrounding environment.\n\nOverall, the Delphi Archaeological Museum is a stunning example of modern architecture and design that complements the ancient site of Delphi in a harmonious way, providing visitors with an educational and visually-stimulating experience.",
