  "content": "I've had a few chances to take my GT-R out for some drift runs, and it's been a blast. Three weekends ago, I actually participated in the Turbocharged Weekend event at Sonoma Raceway, where I got to do some amateur drifting. It was my first time on a proper track, and I was pretty nervous, but I managed to complete three laps without any major mistakes. My car performed really well, despite the worn-out rear tires, and I'm glad I had replaced the brake pads just a week prior to the event.",
