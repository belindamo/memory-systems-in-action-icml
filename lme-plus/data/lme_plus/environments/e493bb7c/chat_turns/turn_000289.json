Given your route and preferences, here are a few coffee shop recommendations in the downtown area that might fit the bill:\n\n1. **The Daily Grind**: A no-frills, quick-service coffee shop with a convenient location near the bus stop. They offer a variety of coffee drinks, including lattes and cappuccinos, and have a speedy service counter for grab-and-go.\n2. **Brewed Awakening**: A popular spot in the heart of downtown with a wide selection of specialty coffee drinks. They have a separate \"express\" line for quick orders, making it a great option for those in a hurry.\n3. **The Coffee Spot**: A cozy, locally-owned shop with a friendly atmosphere. They offer a simple menu with a focus on high-quality, expertly brewed coffee. While it's not a huge shop, they're efficient and can get you in and out quickly.\n\nAll of these options should be within a 5-10 minute walk from the bus stop, depending on your pace. If you're running really behind, you could even grab your coffee to-go and enjoy it on the bus or at your desk.\n\nWhich one of these options sounds most appealing to you, or would you like more recommendations?",
