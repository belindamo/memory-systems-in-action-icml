Suspension setup is crucial for handling, but \"racking\" isn't a valid term in this context.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to provide general tips on how to optimize your car's suspension setup for better handling:\n\n1. **Understand your car's suspension design**: Familiarize yourself with your car's suspension type (e.g., MacPherson strut, double wishbone, etc.) and its components (e.g., springs, shocks, sway bars).\n2. **Adjust your suspension settings**: If your car has adjustable suspension, experiment with different settings to find the optimal balance between comfort and handling. This may involve adjusting the stiffness of the springs, shocks, or sway bars.\n3. **Check your tire pressure and alignment**: Proper tire pressure and alignment can greatly affect your car's handling. Make sure your tires are inflated to the recommended pressure, and your wheels are properly aligned.\n4. **Consider upgrading your suspension components**: If you're looking to improve your car's handling, consider upgrading your suspension components, such as installing stiffer springs, shocks, or sway bars.\n5. **Get professional assistance**: If you're not familiar with suspension setup or tuning, consider consulting a professional mechanic or a suspension specialist who can help you optimize your car's suspension for better handling.\n\nRegarding the \"tuning\" you had done, it's great to hear that you gained an extra 20 horsepower! However, I'm curious - what kind of tuning did you have done, and what modifications were made to your car's engine?\n\nRemember to always follow safe and responsible driving practices, and I hope these tips help you improve your car's performance!",
