The combination of the tea, reading, and calming music is a wonderful way to unwind before bed.\n\nRegarding the melatonin supplements, it's likely that they're contributing to your improved sleep quality. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates our sleep-wake cycles, and taking a supplement can help increase the levels of melatonin in your body, promoting relaxation and sleepiness.\n\nMelatonin supplements can be especially helpful for people who have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep due to insomnia, jet lag, or other sleep disorders. However, it's essential to use them responsibly and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when taking melatonin supplements:\n\n1. **Start with a low dose**: Begin with a low dose (0.5-1mg) and gradually increase as needed, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n2. **Timing is everything**: Take melatonin supplements 30-60 minutes before bedtime to help regulate your sleep-wake cycle.\n3. **Be consistent**: Take the supplements at the same time every night to establish a consistent sleep schedule.\n4. **Monitor your body**: Pay attention to how your body responds to the supplements. If you experience any side effects, such as dizziness, nausea, or headaches, consult with your healthcare professional.\n5. **Don't rely solely on supplements**: While melatonin supplements can be helpful, it's essential to establish good sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a sleep-conducive environment, and avoiding stimulating activities before bedtime.\n\nIt's great that you've noticed an improvement in your sleep quality since starting the supplements. However, it's also important to remember that melatonin supplements are meant to be a temporary solution. It's essential to address the underlying causes of your insomnia and work on developing healthy sleep habits to promote long-term improvement.\n\nHave you considered talking to a healthcare professional about your sleep issues and the supplements you're taking? They can help you determine the best course of action and provide guidance on how to optimize your sleep quality.\n\nAlso, I'm curious, what's the name of the calming tea blend you're enjoying? Is it a specific brand or a custom blend?",
