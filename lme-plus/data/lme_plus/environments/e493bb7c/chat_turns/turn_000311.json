Here are some tips to help you create a cohesive art piece that incorporates surrealism and lowbrow art:\n\n1. **Start with a concept**: Before you begin creating, define the central idea or theme you want to convey. This will help you stay focused and ensure that your piece doesn't become too disjointed. Consider what emotions or messages you want to evoke in your audience.\n2. **Choose a unifying element**: Select a common thread that ties your different styles and themes together. This could be a specific color palette, a recurring symbol, or a particular texture. This unifying element will help create visual harmony and cohesion.\n3. **Balance contrast**: Surrealism and lowbrow art often feature bold, contrasting elements. To avoid visual chaos, balance your contrasts by pairing opposing elements, such as:\n\t* Soft, dreamy textures with bold, graphic shapes\n\t* Bright, vibrant colors with muted, pastel hues\n\t* Organic, natural forms with geometric, synthetic shapes\n4. **Experiment with layering**: Both surrealism and lowbrow art often incorporate layering techniques. Use layering to combine different elements, such as:\n\t* Digital illustrations with traditional media (e.g., paint, ink, or collage)\n\t* Photographic elements with hand-drawn or painted components\n\t* Transparent or translucent layers to create depth and dimensionality\n5. **Play with scale and proportion**: Surrealism often features distorted or exaggerated proportions. Experiment with scaling objects or elements to create a sense of unease or wonder.\n6. **Embrace the absurd**: Both surrealism and lowbrow art often celebrate the absurd and the irrational. Don't be afraid to incorporate unexpected elements or juxtapose seemingly incompatible objects to create a sense of surprise or curiosity.\n7. **Edit and refine**: As you work on your piece, regularly step back and evaluate its overall cohesion. Remove or adjust elements that disrupt the balance or detract from the central theme.\n8. **Reference and iterate**: Study the work of other artists who have successfully blended multiple styles and themes. Analyze what makes their pieces work and apply those principles to your own art.\n9. **Embrace happy accidents**: Sometimes, the most interesting and innovative art emerges from unexpected mistakes or accidents. Be open to exploring new techniques and embracing the unpredictable nature of the creative process.\n10. **Have fun**: Most importantly, enjoy the process of experimentation and exploration. Surrealism and lowbrow art are all about pushing boundaries and challenging conventions, so don't be afraid to take risks and try new things!\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a cohesive art piece that incorporates the best of surrealism and lowbrow art. Good luck, and have fun!",
