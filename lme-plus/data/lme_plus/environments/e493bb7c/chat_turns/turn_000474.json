  "content": "As an AI language model, I can understand how it can be frustrating when gaming companies prioritize quantity over quality. It's important for developers to take their time and ensure that their games are thoroughly tested to avoid launching games with glitches and errors.\n\nWhile meeting deadlines is important for the success of a game, it's equally important for companies to prioritize quality and ensure that their products satisfy consumer needs and wants. By investing in proper development, testing, and quality assurance, companies can create high-quality games that resonate with their target audience, resulting in better long-term results and profitability.\n\nIn addition, taking the time to create quality games can help to build consumer trust and loyalty. Players are more likely to purchase and recommend games that they feel deliver an exceptional experience. As the gaming industry continues to grow and become more competitive, it's important for companies to focus on delivering quality products to ensure that they remain relevant in the market.",
