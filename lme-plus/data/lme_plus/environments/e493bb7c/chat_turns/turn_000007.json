  "content": "A crusty bread to go with the creamy tomato soup sounds like a match made in heaven! I've got a fantastic vegan bread recipe that fits your description: Crusty Vegan Bread with Oat Flour and Sesame Seeds.\n\nThis bread recipe uses a combination of all-purpose flour, oat flour, and sesame seeds to create a crusty exterior and a soft, airy interior. The oat flour adds a nutty flavor and a tender crumb, while the sesame seeds provide a delightful crunch and nutty flavor.\n\n**Crusty Vegan Bread with Oat Flour and Sesame Seeds Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup oat flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 teaspoon sugar\n* 1 packet active dry yeast (make sure it's vegan)\n* 1 cup warm water\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, oat flour, salt, sugar, and yeast.\n2. Gradually add the warm water to the dry ingredients, mixing until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. Add the olive oil and mix until the dough comes together in a sticky ball.\n4. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-12 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n5. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.\n6. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n7. Punch down the dough and shape it into a round or oblong loaf. Place the loaf onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n8. Brush the top of the loaf with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\n9. Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes, or until it's golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n10. Let the bread cool on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nTips:\n\n* To create a crustier bread, bake the loaf for an additional 5-10 minutes. Keep an eye on it to ensure it doesn't overcook.\n* If you want a more golden crust, brush the loaf with a mixture of 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon water before baking.\n* You can also add other toppings like chopped nuts, seeds, or herbs to the bread for extra flavor and texture.\n\nThis bread recipe is perfect for dipping into your creamy tomato soup, and the oat flour adds a delightful nutty flavor that complements the soup beautifully. Enjoy!",
