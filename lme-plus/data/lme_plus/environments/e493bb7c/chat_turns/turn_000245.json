  "content": "I appreciate your help, but I think there might be some misunderstanding. By \"auto racking,\" I meant auto racing, not \"racking\" a car. I'm an amateur auto racing enthusiast, and I've been modifying my Ford Mustang to improve its performance. The tuning I had done a few months ago at the local mechanic's shop involved replacing the old air filter and spark plugs with high-performance ones, which resulted in a significant boost in horsepower. I'm looking to squeeze out even more performance from my car, so any advice on suspension setup would be great.",
