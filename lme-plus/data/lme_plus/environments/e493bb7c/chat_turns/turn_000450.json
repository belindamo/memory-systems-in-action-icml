  "content": "Armathys, as a Shadar-Kai, may not have the spellcasting abilities of a wizard, but that doesn't mean he couldn't still craft magic items. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Commissioning: Armathys could commission a wizard or other spellcaster to create the magic item for him, using his skills and knowledge to barter or negotiate a fair price.\n2. Trade: Armathys could trade goods, services, or information with a wizard or other spellcaster in exchange for the creation of a magic item.\n3. Finding Rare Components: Armathys could seek out rare components and materials needed to create a magic item, and then trade or sell them to a wizard or other spellcaster who could use them to create the item.\n4. Enchantment: Armathys could use his knowledge of the Shadowfell and the Raven Queen to infuse his weapons and gear with dark magic, creating magical items that reflect his own skills and abilities.\n5. Modification: Armathys could modify existing gear and equipment, imbuing it with magic to enhance its capabilities. He could use his skills and knowledge to find or create magical components, and then use those components to modify his gear.\n\nSo, while Armathys may not be a wizard, he could still find ways to create or obtain magic items that suit his needs and reflect his skills and abilities.",
