  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have information about the current roster of Calgary Stampeders. However, generally speaking, Calgary Stampeders are known for their strong defensive strategies, which involve a combination of man-to-man coverage, zone coverage, and blitz packages. They frequently use their versatile defensive backfield to create confusion and force turnovers. Their offensive strategy often revolves around a strong rushing attack, using a combination of power runs and misdirection plays to keep the defense off balance. They also use a short passing game to move the ball downfield and frustrate defenses. With the current roster, they might have fine-tuned these strategies to make the most of their personnel.",
