  "content": "Hi! I'm looking for some recipe ideas for a cultural dinner party I'm hosting soon. I recently attended my best friend's wedding, and it was a beautiful blend of Indian and Pakistani cultures. I was inspired by the variety of dishes they served, and I want to showcase a mix of cuisines at my party too. Do you have any suggestions for Nigerian or Mozambican dishes that would be easy to make and impressive for my guests?",
