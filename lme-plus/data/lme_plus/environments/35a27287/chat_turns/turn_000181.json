  "content": "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is an excellent game, but it might not be the best fit for you if you're looking for fast-paced action and intense combat similar to Call of Duty. While Deus Ex: Mankind Divided does have action and combat elements, the game's pace is generally more methodical and stealth-oriented.\n\nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided is a first-person RPG with a strong focus on player choice, exploration, and strategy. The game's combat is more tactical and requires a thoughtful approach, as you'll need to use your abilities, augmentations, and environment to take down enemies. The game also has a strong emphasis on stealth, hacking, and social engineering, which can be just as effective as combat in achieving your objectives.\n\nThat being said, if you're open to a different type of gameplay experience, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is an excellent choice. The game's story is deeply engaging, and the game's world is richly detailed and immersive. The game's augmentations and abilities can also be very empowering, and the game's combat can be intense and satisfying when you use your abilities effectively.\n\nIf you're unsure, you might want to watch some gameplay videos or read reviews to get a better sense of the game's pace and gameplay style. Alternatively, you could consider other games that might offer a better fit for your preferences, such as Wolfenstein: The New Colossus or Titanfall 2, which I mentioned earlier.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is the right fit for you. If you're willing to adapt to a different gameplay style and pace, you might find that Deus Ex: Mankind Divided offers a deeply rewarding and engaging experience.",
