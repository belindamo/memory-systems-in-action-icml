By analyzing data on past customer purchases, search queries, and other factors, machine learning models can identify patterns and predict what products are likely to be popular in the near future. One common technique used for this is called trend analysis, which involves analyzing data from multiple sources such as social media, online reviews, and search engine queries to identify trends and patterns. Other techniques such as neural networks and decision trees can also be used to make predictions about product popularity.
