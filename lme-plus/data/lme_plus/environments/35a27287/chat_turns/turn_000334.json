  "content": "If a lorry is designed to be used for both the transport of broken-down vehicles and the transport of non-broken down vehicles, it could be considered a multi-purpose vehicle. In this case, its classification depends on its principal use, design, and features.\n\nIf the lorry has specialized features or equipment primarily intended for the recovery and transportation of broken-down vehicles, such as a tilting or sliding platform, winch or hoist, lifting arms, or other recovery equipment, it would likely be classified under heading 8705, which covers \"Special purpose motor vehicles, other than those principally designed for the transport of persons or goods.\"\n\nHowever, if the lorry is primarily designed for the transport of non-broken down vehicles, such as a car carrier or a general-purpose flatbed truck, without any specialized recovery equipment, it would likely be classified under heading 8704, which covers \"Motor vehicles for the transport of goods.\"\n\nIn cases where it is difficult to determine the principal use or design of the vehicle, it is essential to consult the specific CN and HSENS guidance and consider any additional factors that could help clarify the vehicle's primary purpose. If necessary, consult with a customs or trade expert to ensure accurate classification.",
