I'd be happy to provide more details about the hills and climbs on that route.\n\n**Hill Profile:**\n\nRoute 1 features a mix of rolling hills, gentle climbs, and scenic descents. The elevation gain is spread out over the course of the ride, with several shorter climbs and a few longer, more gradual ascents. Here's a breakdown of the hill profile:\n\n* **Short, steep climbs:** There are 2-3 short, steeper climbs (around 1-2 miles long) with gradients ranging from 6-10%. These climbs are spaced out throughout the route, and they're followed by gentle descents or flat sections to help you recover.\n* **Longer, gradual climbs:** There are 2-3 longer climbs (around 3-5 miles long) with gradients ranging from 2-5%. These climbs are more gradual, allowing you to settle into a rhythm and enjoy the scenery.\n* **Rolling hills:** The route also features several sections of rolling hills, with gentle ups and downs that will keep you engaged without being overly challenging.\n\n**Climbing Tips:**\n\nTo help you prepare for the hills on Route 1, here are some tips:\n\n* **Pace yourself:** Take your time on the climbs, and focus on maintaining a steady pace. You can always stop to catch your breath or take in the views if needed.\n* **Use your gears:** Make sure to shift into an easier gear when approaching a climb, and use your lowest gear if needed. This will help you maintain a comfortable cadence and avoid burning out.\n* **Stand up and stretch:** On the longer climbs, consider standing up on your pedals to stretch your legs and back. This can help you stay comfortable and maintain your power output.\n\n**Descents:**\n\nThe descents on Route 1 are generally gentle and scenic, with wide roads and good visibility. You'll have plenty of opportunities to recover from the climbs and enjoy the views.\n\nIf you're still concerned about the elevation gain, I can suggest some modifications to the route to reduce the climbing or provide more gradual ascents. Just let me know!",
