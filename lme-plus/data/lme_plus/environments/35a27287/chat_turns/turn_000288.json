Don't hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Tips for getting the most out of your Gentle Formula:**\n\n* Start with a small amount and work your way up as needed. The formula is concentrated, so a little goes a long way.\n* Use warm water to help the formula lather and cleanse your hair.\n* Massage the formula into your scalp gently, focusing on the roots and working your way down to the ends.\n* Rinse thoroughly with warm water, then follow up with a cool water rinse to close the cuticle and lock in moisture.\n* Consider using a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush to gently detangle your hair, especially if you have tangles or knots.\n\nI hope you enjoy using the Gentle Formula and that it becomes a staple in your hair care routine!\n\nHappy hair care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else!",
