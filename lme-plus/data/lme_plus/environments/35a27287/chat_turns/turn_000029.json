  "content": "Adding a column to track the type of appointment or procedure is a great idea. Here's the updated template:\n\n**Worksheet 1: Appointments**\n\n| Date | Doctor/Provider | Reason for Visit | Diagnosis | Follow-up Appointment | Prescriptions | Appointment Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2/27/2023 | Primary Care Physician | Abdominal pain | [Insert diagnosis] | [Insert follow-up date] | [Insert prescriptions] | Office Visit |\n| 3/10/2023 | Specialist | Follow-up appointment | [Insert diagnosis] | [Insert follow-up date] | [Insert prescriptions] | Consultation |\n| 3/15/2023 | Lab | Blood work | [Insert diagnosis] | [Insert follow-up date] | [Insert prescriptions] | Lab Test |\n\nHere's how to use the new column:\n\n* **Appointment Type**: Enter the type of appointment or procedure for each visit. This could be:\n\t+ Office Visit (for regular check-ups or consultations)\n\t+ Surgery (for surgical procedures)\n\t+ Lab Test (for laboratory tests or blood work)\n\t+ Radiology (for imaging services like X-rays or MRIs)\n\t+ Therapy (for physical, occupational, or speech therapy)\n\t+ Other (for any other type of appointment or procedure)\n\nThis will help you differentiate between different types of appointments and procedures, making it easier to track and analyze your medical history.\n\nTips to keep in mind:\n\n* Make sure to update the Appointment Type column for each appointment, as the type may vary.\n* Consider using a drop-down menu or a list of pre-defined appointment types to make data entry easier and more consistent.\n* You can also use this column to filter or sort your appointments by type, making it easier to identify patterns or trends in your medical history.\n\nBy tracking the appointment type, you'll have a better understanding of your medical history and can make more informed decisions about your care.",
