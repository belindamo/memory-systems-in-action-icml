Start small: It's better to start with a small goal that you can stick to rather than setting a high expectation that may be too difficult to follow through. Start with a few workouts per week for a set amount of time and slowly increase as it becomes a habit.\n\n2. Create a schedule: Plan your workouts ahead of time and make a schedule to hold yourself accountable. You can use a planner, calendar, or even an app to create a routine and stick to it.\n\n3. Make it convenient: Choose a time and location that is convenient for you, such as before or after work, at home or near your office, which can help you make exercise a regular part of your day.\n\n4. Find activities you enjoy: Try various activities, such as yoga, running, cycling, or dancing, to find what you enjoy the most. When you enjoy your workouts, it makes it easier to stay motivated and stick to your routine.\n\n5. Mix it up: To keep your routine fresh and challenging, try new activities, add weights or resistance bands, or try a different form of cardio. This can add variety and excitement to your workouts.\n\n6. Get support: Join a fitness class or get support from friends, family, or a trainer to keep you motivated and accountable. You can even find a workout buddy to ensure you stay committed.\n\nRemember that creating a sustainable workout routine takes time and effort, so be patient and start small. The most important thing is to stay consistent, make it enjoyable and take it one day at a time.",
