  "content": "The Gentle Formula is a fantastic choice for sensitive scalps and gentle hair care.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\n* **Fragrance-free:** Yes, the Gentle Formula is fragrance-free, which makes it perfect for those with sensitive skin or allergies. Plaine Products deliberately omitted fragrances to ensure that the formula is as gentle as possible.\n* **No harsh chemicals:** You won't find any harsh chemicals or synthetic fragrances in the Gentle Formula. Instead, it's made with natural ingredients that are gentle and soothing.\n* **Subtle, natural scent:** While the Gentle Formula is fragrance-free, it does have a very subtle, natural scent from the ingredients used. The scent is often described as mild, clean, and slightly herbal, but it's not overpowering or lingering.\n\n**Why fragrance-free is important:**\n\n* Fragrances can be irritating to sensitive skin and scalps, causing itchiness, redness, or even allergic reactions.\n* Fragrances can also strip the hair of its natural oils, leading to dryness, dandruff, or other scalp issues.\n* By avoiding fragrances, Plaine Products ensures that their Gentle Formula is as gentle and non-irritating as possible, making it perfect for sensitive scalps and skin.\n\n**Other benefits:**\n\n* The Gentle Formula is also free from dyes, sulfates, parabens, and other harsh chemicals that can strip the hair of its natural oils or cause irritation.\n* The formula is pH-balanced, which means it's gentle on the hair and scalp, and won't disrupt the natural pH balance.\n\nI hope that helps!
