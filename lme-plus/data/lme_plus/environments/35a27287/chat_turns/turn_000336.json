  "content": "A beaver-tail floor on a lorry can be an indicator that the vehicle is designed for the transportation of other vehicles, including broken-down ones. However, the presence of a beaver-tail floor alone does not definitively classify a lorry as a motor breakdown lorry.\n\nA beaver-tail floor refers to the sloping rear section of a lorry, which facilitates the loading and unloading of vehicles onto the platform. While this feature is common in motor breakdown lorries, it can also be found in lorries designed for general vehicle transportation, such as car carriers or flatbed trucks.\n\nTo determine whether a lorry with a beaver-tail floor should be classified as a motor breakdown lorry, it's essential to consider the vehicle's principal use, design, and any specialized features or equipment intended for the recovery and transportation of broken-down vehicles. These may include elements such as a tilting or sliding platform, a winch or hoist, lifting arms, or other specialized recovery equipment.\n\nIf the lorry is primarily designed and equipped for the recovery and transportation of broken-down vehicles, it would likely be classified under heading 8705. If, on the other hand, the lorry is principally designed for the transport of non-broken down vehicles, it would likely fall under heading 8704.\n\nIn cases where the vehicle's primary purpose is not clear, consult the specific CN and HSENS guidance and consider any additional factors that could help clarify the vehicle's primary function. If necessary, consult with a customs or trade expert to ensure accurate classification.",
