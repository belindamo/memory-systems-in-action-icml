Here's what you can expect:\n\n* **Paved roads:** The majority of the route (around 90%) is on paved roads, which are in good condition with minimal potholes or cracks. The roads are generally wide, with a dedicated bike lane or shoulder in many areas.\n* **Rural roads:** Some sections of the route take you through rural areas, where the roads may be narrower and have a rougher surface. However, these sections are still paved and generally well-maintained.\n* **Gravel or dirt sections:** There are two short sections (around 1-2 miles each) where the route takes you onto gravel or dirt roads. These sections are well-packed and suitable for road bikes with decent tires (at least 25mm wide). The gravel sections are relatively smooth, and you can expect a moderate pace.\n\n**Road Conditions:**\n\nWhile the roads are generally in good condition, there may be some sections with:\n\n* **Light gravel or debris:** You may encounter some light gravel or debris on the rural roads, particularly after heavy rainfall. However, these sections are usually easily navigable.\n* **Cracks and potholes:** As with any road, there may be some cracks and potholes, especially on the older roads. However, they're not frequent or severe enough to cause significant issues.\n\n**Tire Recommendations:**\n\nFor Route 1, I recommend using road tires with a minimum width of 25mm and a decent amount of tread. This will provide a comfortable ride and sufficient traction on the gravel sections. If you have tires with a more aggressive tread pattern, you'll be well-suited for the route.\n\nOverall, the road surface on Route 1 is suitable for road bikes, and you can expect a comfortable ride with some scenic detours onto gravel roads. With your Garmin Edge 530 and a bit of preparation, you'll be ready to tackle the route and enjoy the scenery!",
