As for airlines, I don't have a strong preference, but I do tend to fly with airlines that offer more convenient routes and schedules for my work trips. Speaking of which, I've been thinking about my travel habits and how I can make them more efficient. Do you have any suggestions on how I can track my travel expenses and stay organized?",
