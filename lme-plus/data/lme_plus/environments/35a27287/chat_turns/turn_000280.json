This works out to around $1-$2 per gallon of cleaning solution.\n* **Eco-friendly features:** The product is biodegradable, non-toxic, and free of synthetic fragrances, dyes, and preservatives. The bottle is made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic.\n\n**Ecover Concentrated Cleaning Products:**\n\n* **Product range:** Ecover offers a range of concentrated cleaning products, including laundry detergent, dish soap, all-purpose cleaners, and glass cleaner.\n* **Concentration:** Ecover's products are also highly concentrated, with dilution ratios varying depending on the product.
