  "content": "That's great to hear that you're supporting local businesses! Buying from local boutiques not only helps the local economy but also often results in unique, high-quality products that can't be found elsewhere.\n\nThe silver necklace you got for your sister sounds like a lovely gift. $80 is a reasonable price point for a quality piece of jewelry, and I'm sure your sister appreciated the thought and effort you put into selecting a special gift from a local boutique.\n\nNow, let's get back to finding someone to help with the customized camera rig. Asking local friends and acquaintances is a great way to start, as they might know someone with the right skills or connections. You can also try posting on social media or local online forums to see if anyone is interested in taking on the project.\n\nRemember to clearly communicate your requirements and budget to anyone you approach, and don't hesitate to ask for portfolios or examples of their previous work. This will help you find the right person for the job and ensure that the final product meets your expectations.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find the perfect person to help you create an amazing customized camera rig for your brother's graduation gift!",
