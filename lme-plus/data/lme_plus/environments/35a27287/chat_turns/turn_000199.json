If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. If it's already moist, wait another day or two before watering again.\n2. **Water thoroughly**: When you do water, make sure to give your spider plant a good soaking. Water should flow out of the drainage holes in the pot, indicating that the soil is fully saturated.\n3. **Water at the right time**: Spider plants prefer to dry out slightly between waterings. Watering in the morning allows the plant to absorb the water throughout the day. Avoid watering in the evening, as this can encourage fungal growth.\n4. **Monitor the humidity**: Spider plants thrive in humid environments. If your home is dry, consider placing the plant on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier nearby.\n5. **Adjust for the season**: Spider plants require more water during the spring and summer when they're actively growing. During the fall and winter, they require less water as they enter a dormant phase.\n6. **Pot size matters**: If your spider plant is in a small pot, it may need more frequent watering. Larger pots can hold more moisture, so watering can be less frequent.\n7. **Watch for signs of overwatering**: If you notice the leaves turning yellow or droopy, it might be a sign that the plant is getting too much water. Cut back on watering and make sure the pot has good drainage.\n\nIt's great to hear that pruning and grooming your plants made a big difference! Deadheading African violets is an important task to encourage more blooms and keep them looking their best. Keep up the good work, and your plants will thank you!\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
