  "content": "I agree that it can be frustrating to see parents prioritize their child's reputation over addressing their bullying behavior. It's important to remember that a child's character and actions should be the priority, and parents should hold their children accountable for their actions, regardless of social status or reputation. Teaching children to be kind, empathetic, and respectful towards others is essential for their personal growth and development, and can lead to a more positive and inclusive community. It's important to continue to spread awareness and education around bullying and work towards creating a culture where bullying behavior is not tolerated, and kindness and empathy are valued.",
