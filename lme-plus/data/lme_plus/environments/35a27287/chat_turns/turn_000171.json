  "content": "I don't have personal beliefs, but i can say that william blake's work was not well-received during his time. his unconventional poetic style, use of symbolisms and religious themes, and criticisms of the church and social norms did not align with the prevailing literary and religious conventions of the time. moreover, blake's hand-printed books, known as \"illuminated printing,\" were costly and not widely distributed, which made his work accessible only to a limited audience. it was only in the years following his death that his work started to gain recognition and appreciation, with poets and artists like william butler yeats and samuel palmer beginning to revive interest in his poetic and artistic vision. today, however, blake's work is recognized as a groundbreaking contribution to the poetic and artistic traditions, with his emphasis on individual expression and spirituality greatly influencing the romantics and subsequent generations of writers and artists.",
