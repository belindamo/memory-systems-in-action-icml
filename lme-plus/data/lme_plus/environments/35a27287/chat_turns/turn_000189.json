  "content": "The Korean-Style Chicken Breast with Gochujang Glaze is a flavor bomb! Making the gochujang glaze from scratch is definitely worth the effort, and I'm happy to guide you through it.\n\n**What is Gochujang?**\nBefore we dive into the recipe, let's quickly cover what gochujang is. Gochujang is a Korean chili paste made from fermented soybeans, rice, and red chili peppers. It has a thick, sticky consistency and a sweet, savory, and spicy flavor. You can find gochujang in most Asian grocery stores or online.\n\n**Homemade Gochujang Glaze Recipe**\n\nMaking gochujang glaze from scratch requires some patience, as it needs to ferment for a few days. But don't worry, it's a simple process, and the result is well worth the wait.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the gochujang paste:\n\n* 1 cup dried Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)\n* 1/2 cup brown rice flour\n* 1/2 cup fermented soybean paste (doenjang)\n* 1/4 cup water\n* 1/4 cup Korean rice wine (or dry sherry)\n* 1 tablespoon sugar\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n\nFor the glaze:\n\n* 2 tablespoons homemade gochujang paste (above)\n* 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)\n* 1 teaspoon grated ginger\n* 1 teaspoon garlic, minced\n* 1/4 cup water\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**Day 1-3: Make the Gochujang Paste**\n\n1. In a blender or food processor, blend the chili flakes, brown rice flour, and soybean paste into a smooth paste.\n2. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the water, rice wine, sugar, and salt. Mix well.\n3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it ferment at room temperature (around 70\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F) for 2-3 days, stirring every 12 hours. You'll notice the mixture will start to bubble and develop a slightly sour smell.\n\n**Day 4: Make the Gochujang Glaze**\n\n1. In a blender or food processor, blend the fermented gochujang paste, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, Gochugaru, ginger, and garlic into a smooth glaze.\n2. Add the water and blend until well combined.\n3. Strain the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a glass or ceramic container for fermentation, as metal can react with the ingredients.\n* Keep the fermentation area clean and away from direct sunlight.\n* If you don't plan to use the gochujang glaze immediately, you can store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks or freeze it for up to 3 months.\n\n**Using the Gochujang Glaze:**\n\nTo make the Korean-Style Chicken Breast with Gochujang Glaze, simply brush the glaze on the chicken breast during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking. You can grill, bake, or pan-fry the chicken breast, whichever method you prefer.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and using your homemade gochujang glaze!",
