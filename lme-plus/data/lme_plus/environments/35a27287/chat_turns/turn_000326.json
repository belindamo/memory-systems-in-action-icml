  "content": "Most cooking schools in Hanoi, and Vietnam in general, usually provide recipes and notes after the class, so you can recreate the dishes when you get back home. In fact, many schools pride themselves on providing detailed recipe books or handouts, so you can continue cooking Vietnamese cuisine long after your trip.\n\nHere's what you can expect:\n\n* **Recipe book or handouts**: Many schools will provide a comprehensive recipe book or handouts that include the recipes you learned during the class, along with step-by-step instructions and photos.\n* **Notes and tips**: Your instructor will often share additional tips and notes during the class, which you can jot down in your own notebook or on your phone.\n* **Ingredient lists**: You'll typically receive a list of ingredients used in each dish, including measurements and substitutions, so you can source them back home.\n* **Online resources**: Some schools may provide access to online resources, such as video tutorials or recipe websites, to help you continue learning and refining your skills.\n\nWhen booking your cooking class, you can confirm with the school whether they provide recipes and notes after the class. You can ask questions like:\n\n* \"Do you provide a recipe book or handouts after the class?\"\n* \"Will I receive any additional resources or online support after the class?\"\n* \"Can I take photos or videos during the class to help me remember the recipes?\"\n\nSome popular cooking schools in Hanoi, like Hanoi Cooking Centre and Vietnam Cooking School, are known for providing detailed recipe books and notes after the class. However, it's always a good idea to confirm with the school before booking to ensure you get the support you need to continue cooking Vietnamese cuisine back home.\n\nHappy cooking, and I hope you enjoy your cooking class in Hanoi!",
