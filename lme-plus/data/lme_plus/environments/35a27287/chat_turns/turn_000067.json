Weekday mornings can indeed be busy at most airports, especially at a major hub like LAX.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention the airport being busy. LAX is one of the busiest airports in the world, with over 88 million passengers passing through its gates in 2020 alone. The airport is currently undergoing a multi-billion-dollar modernization project to improve the passenger experience, including upgrading terminals, adding new amenities, and enhancing security screening.\n\nIf you're interested, some of the upcoming changes at LAX include:\n\n**1. New Midfield Satellite Concourse**: A new concourse is being built to provide more gates and amenities for passengers.\n**2. Tom Bradley International Terminal (TBIT) Expansion**: The TBIT is being expanded to add more gates, security screening, and amenities.\n**3. Automated People Mover (APM)**: A new APM system will connect the terminals, making it easier for passengers to move around the airport.\n**4. Consolidated Rent-A-Car Facility**: A new facility will centralize car rental operations, reducing congestion and making it easier for passengers to pick up and drop off rental cars.\n\nThese changes should help reduce congestion and improve the overall passenger experience at LAX.\n\nSince you mentioned the airport was busy, did you have a chance to grab a bite to eat or do some shopping before your flight? LAX has a wide range of dining and retail options, including some unique LA-themed eateries and shops.\n\nAlso, do you have any preferred airlines or routes that you tend to fly frequently?",
