Roots should develop within 1-2 weeks. Once roots are visible, you can transfer the cutting to a pot with a well-draining potting mix.\n2. **Cutting selection**: Choose healthy, vigorous stems with at least two nodes (the joint where a leaf meets the stem). Cut just below a node, using a clean, sharp tool.\n3. **Remove lower leaves**: Remove lower leaves that will be submerged in water or soil to prevent rot and encourage rooting.\n4. **Provide humidity**: Keep the cutting in a bright, humid location (e.g., a propagation tray or a clear plastic bag) to promote root growth.\n5. **Transplant**: Once roots are established, transfer the cutting to a pot with a well-draining potting mix. Water thoroughly, and keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.\n\n**Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) Propagation:**\n\n1. **Cutting selection**: Choose healthy, vigorous stems with new growth. Cut 2-3 inch (5-7.5 cm) stem sections, just above a node.\n2. **Remove lower leaves**: Remove lower leaves, leaving about two sets of leaves at the top.\n3. **Prepare the cutting**: Dip the cut end in rooting hormone powder or liquid to promote root growth.\n4. **Plant in a pot**: Plant the cutting in a pot filled with a well-draining potting mix, burying it up to the node. Water gently.\n5. **Provide conditions**: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, and provide bright, indirect light. Rosemary prefers cooler temperatures (around 65\u00b0F/18\u00b0C) and high humidity.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n* Change the water every 2-3 days to prevent bacterial growth and promote healthy root development.\n* Avoid over-handling the cuttings, as this can cause stress and reduce the chances of successful propagation.\n* Keep the cuttings away from direct sunlight, which can cause the water or soil to become too warm and promote rot.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully propagate your pothos and rosemary cuttings. Good luck, and happy planting!",
