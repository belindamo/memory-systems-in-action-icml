  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal experience or emotions, but it can be frustrating and disheartening when parents do not take bullying seriously. It is important to remember that parents may not understand the severity of bullying or feel helpless in addressing their child's bullying behavior. Continuing to educate and provide resources to parents can help them understand the importance of addressing bullying and the impact it has on their child's mental and emotional health, as well as the well-being of others. By working together and addressing bullying early, we can create a safer and more accepting environment for all children.",
