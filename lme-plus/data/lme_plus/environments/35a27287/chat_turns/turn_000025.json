  "content": "Adding a column to track copays and deductibles is a great idea. Here's the updated template:\n\n**Worksheet 2: Expenses**\n\n| Date | Provider | Service/Procedure | Charge | Insurance Payment | Balance Due | Paid | Copay/Deductible | Total Out-of-Pocket |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2/27/2023 | Primary Care Physician | Office Visit | $ [Insert charge] | $ [Insert insurance payment] | $ [Insert balance due] | [Insert payment status] | $ [Insert copay/deductible] | $ [Insert total out-of-pocket] |\n\nHere's how to use the new columns:\n\n* **Copay/Deductible**: Enter the copay or deductible amount you paid for each appointment or procedure. This will help you track your out-of-pocket costs.\n* **Total Out-of-Pocket**: Calculate the total out-of-pocket cost by adding the Copay/Deductible to the Balance Due (if applicable). This will give you a clear picture of how much you've paid for each appointment or procedure.\n\nExample:\n\n**Worksheet 2: Expenses**\n\n| Date | Provider | Service/Procedure | Charge | Insurance Payment | Balance Due | Paid | Copay/Deductible | Total Out-of-Pocket |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2/27/2023 | Primary Care Physician | Office Visit | $100 | $80 | $20 | Paid | $20 (copay) | $40 ($20 copay + $20 balance due) |\n\nTips to keep in mind:\n\n* Make sure to update the Copay/Deductible column for each appointment or procedure, as these amounts may vary.\n* If you have a high-deductible plan, you may need to track your deductible payments separately to ensure you're meeting your annual deductible.\n* Consider using formulas to automatically calculate the Total Out-of-Pocket column, so you don't have to do the math manually.\n\nBy tracking your copays and deductibles, you'll have a better understanding of your out-of-pocket costs and can plan accordingly for future medical expenses.",
