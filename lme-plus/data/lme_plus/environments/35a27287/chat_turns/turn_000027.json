  "content": "Adding a column to track the type of insurance claim submitted is a great idea. Here's the updated template:\n\n**Worksheet 2: Expenses**\n\n| Date | Provider | Service/Procedure | Charge | Insurance Payment | Balance Due | Paid | Copay/Deductible | Total Out-of-Pocket | Claim Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2/27/2023 | Primary Care Physician | Office Visit | $100 | $80 | $20 | Paid | $20 (copay) | $40 ($20 copay + $20 balance due) | Medical |\n\nHere's how to use the new column:\n\n* **Claim Type**: Enter the type of insurance claim submitted for each appointment or procedure. This could be:\n\t+ Medical (for doctor visits, procedures, etc.)\n\t+ Pharmacy (for prescription medications)\n\t+ Lab (for laboratory tests)\n\t+ Radiology (for imaging services)\n\t+ Other (for any other type of claim)\n\nThis will help you track the type of claim submitted and ensure you're not missing any claims or payments.\n\nExample:\n\n**Worksheet 2: Expenses**\n\n| Date | Provider | Service/Procedure | Charge | Insurance Payment | Balance Due | Paid | Copay/Deductible | Total Out-of-Pocket | Claim Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2/27/2023 | Primary Care Physician | Office Visit | $100 | $80 | $20 | Paid | $20 (copay) | $40 ($20 copay + $20 balance due) | Medical |\n| 3/10/2023 | CVS Pharmacy | Medication A | $50 | $40 | $10 | Paid | $10 (copay) | $10 | Pharmacy |\n\nTips to keep in mind:\n\n* Make sure to update the Claim Type column for each appointment or procedure, as the claim type may vary.\n* If you have multiple insurance plans (e.g., medical and pharmacy), you may want to track claims for each plan separately.\n* Consider using a drop-down menu or a list of pre-defined claim types to make data entry easier and more consistent.\n\nBy tracking the claim type, you'll have a better understanding of your insurance claims and can ensure you're not missing any payments or benefits.",
