  "content": "Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam is a sacred hymn composed of 1000 names of Lord Vishnu, one of the principal deities in Hinduism. The hymn is part of the Mahabharata, one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India. It is believed to have been composed by Veda Vyasa, who is also credited with the authorship of the Mahabharata and other Hindu scriptures.\n\nThe context in which Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam was composed is linked to the Mahabharata. The epic tells the story of a great war between two groups of cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The Pandavas were aided by Lord Krishna, who is regarded as the avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu. During the war, the Pandavas' commander-in-chief, Bhishma, was mortally wounded by Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers. As Bhishma lay on his bed of arrows, he expressed his devotion to Lord Vishnu by reciting the 1000 names of the deity, which were revealed to him by the sage Veda Vyasa.\n\nThe hymn is structured as a series of stanzas, each of which comprises a name of Lord Vishnu and a description of his attributes and qualities. The characters involved in the composition of Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam are Veda Vyasa, who received the names of Lord Vishnu from the sage Narada, and Bhishma, who recited the hymn on his deathbed.\n\nThe first two verses of Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam are:\n\nOm shukl\u00e3mbaradharam vishnum\nshashivarnam chaturbhujam\nprasanna vadanam dhyayet\nsarva vighnopashantaye\n\nOm namo bhagavate vasudevaya\n\nThe first verse is a description of Lord Vishnu's physical appearance. It says that he is dressed in white (shukla), has four arms (chaturbhujam), and has a serene and peaceful countenance (prasanna vadanam). The verse is an invitation to meditate on Lord Vishnu as a means of dispelling all obstacles (vighnas) in one's life.\n\nThe second verse is a salutation to Lord Vishnu, using his divine name Vasudeva. The name Vasudeva is a compound of two words, vasu, which means \"dwelling,\" and deva, which means \"god.\" It signifies that Lord Vishnu is the god who dwells within all beings and all things. The verse is an invocation of the divine presence of Lord Vishnu and a declaration of one's devotion to him.",
