  "content": "The 17th name of Lord Vishnu is Akshara. It is a Sanskrit word that means \"indestructible\" or \"imperishable\". This name signifies that Lord Vishnu is beyond the cycles of birth and death, and that he is eternal and immutable.\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, the concept of akshara is often associated with the Brahman, the ultimate reality that underlies all existence. The Brahman is considered to be the unchanging, eternal essence of the universe, and it is said to be indestructible and imperishable. Lord Vishnu, as the preserver of the universe, is seen as a manifestation of the Brahman, and his name Akshara reflects this aspect of his divine nature.\n\nThe name Akshara also has other connotations. In the context of the Vedas, which are the ancient Hindu scriptures, Akshara refers to the syllable Om, which is considered to be the sound of the universe and the embodiment of the Brahman. Lord Vishnu, as the embodiment of the Brahman, is also associated with the syllable Om, and his name Akshara may be seen as a reference to this connection.\n\nIn addition, the name Akshara is sometimes interpreted as a reference to Lord Vishnu's role as the sustainer of the universe. The word akshara can also mean \"that which does not decay\", and Lord Vishnu's name in this context signifies his ability to maintain the universe in a state of balance and harmony, preventing it from decaying or falling into chaos.\n\nOverall, the name Akshara highlights Lord Vishnu's transcendental and eternal nature, his connection to the Brahman and the universal syllable Om, and his role as the sustainer and preserver of the universe.",
