These community-operated workshops often have members with engineering and fabrication skills who might be interested in taking on a custom project.\n\t* Websites like Makerspace Directory or Hackerspaces.org can help you find local makerspaces.\n3. **Local Universities and Colleges:**\n\t* Reach out to the engineering or design departments of local universities and colleges. They might have students or professors who are interested in taking on a custom project or know someone who can help.\n\t* You can also post an ad on the university's job board or social media groups to find interested individuals.\n4. **Professional Networks:**\n\t* Ask friends, family, or colleagues if they know anyone with engineering or fabrication experience who might be interested in a custom project.\n\t* Attend local engineering or photography meetups and network with attendees who might be able to help.\n5. **Local Fabrication Shops:**\n\t* Look for local fabrication shops that offer custom design and build services. They might have experience with camera rigs or be able to adapt their skills to create a custom solution.\n\nWhen reaching out to potential designers or fabricators, be prepared to provide details about your brother's camera and photography style, as well as the type of rig you're looking to create.
