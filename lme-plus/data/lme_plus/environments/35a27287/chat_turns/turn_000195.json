  "content": "Using gochujang sauce as a marinade is a fantastic way to add depth and umami flavor to your protein before stir-frying. Here are some tips to help you marinate like a pro:\n\n**Choosing the Right Protein:**\n\n* Opt for thinly sliced protein, such as chicken breast, beef (e.g., ribeye or sirloin), pork, or tofu, to ensure even marination.\n* You can also use shrimp, scallops, or squid for a seafood twist.\n\n**Marination Time:**\n\n* For chicken and pork, marinate for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours in the refrigerator.\n* For beef, marinate for 2-4 hours or overnight (8-12 hours) for more intense flavor.\n* For tofu, marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.\n\n**Marination Ratio:**\n\n* Use a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio of gochujang sauce to protein. For example, if you're using 1 pound of chicken, use 1/2 cup to 1 cup of gochujang sauce.\n* Adjust the ratio based on your desired level of spiciness and flavor intensity.\n\n**Marination Tips:**\n\n* Place the protein in a ziplock bag or a shallow dish, and pour the gochujang sauce over it. Massage the marinade into the protein, making sure it's evenly coated.\n* Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap, and refrigerate.\n* Every 30 minutes, massage the protein and turn it over to ensure even marination.\n* If using a ziplock bag, you can also use a meat mallet or a rolling pin to gently pound the protein and help the marinade penetrate deeper.\n\n**Before Stir-Frying:**\n\n* Remove the protein from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off.\n* Pat the protein dry with paper towels to prevent excess moisture from affecting the stir-fry.\n* Stir-fry the protein as desired, adding your favorite vegetables, aromatics, and seasonings.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Always marinate in the refrigerator, not at room temperature, to prevent bacterial growth.\n* If you're using a particularly strong or spicy gochujang sauce, you may want to dilute it with a bit of water or soy sauce to avoid overpowering the protein.\n* Experiment with different gochujang sauce recipes or add other ingredients to the marinade, such as garlic, ginger, or sesame oil, to create unique flavor profiles.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create deliciously marinated protein that's ready to shine in your stir-fry dishes!",
