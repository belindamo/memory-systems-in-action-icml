  "content": "Congratulations to your brother on his graduation!\n\nI'd be happy to help you with some gift ideas that might suit him. Since you've mentioned you're looking to support local businesses, I'll try to suggest some options that fit that criteria. Additionally, I'll keep in mind the price range of the silver necklace you bought for your sister ($80).\n\nHere are a few questions to help me narrow down some ideas:\n\n1. What is your brother's field of study or interest?\n2. Does he have any hobbies or passions outside of academics?\n3. Is there a specific type of gift you're looking for (e.g., something practical, sentimental, or experiential)?\n4. Does he have a preferred style or taste (e.g., classic, modern, eclectic)?\n\nAssuming you're open to a variety of ideas, here are some suggestions that might fit the bill:\n\n**Local Business Ideas:**\n\n1. **Artisanal accessory**: Consider a unique, handmade accessory like a leather wallet, watch, or bag from a local artisan.\n2. **Craft beer or wine gift set**: If your brother enjoys beer or wine, look for a local brewery or winery that offers gift sets, tastings, or tours.\n3. **Customized item**: Support a local engraver or printer to create a personalized item, such as a monogrammed briefcase, pen, or picture frame.\n4. **Experience gift**: Give the gift of a local experience, like tickets to a sporting event, a concert, or a fun activity (e.g., rock climbing, indoor skydiving).\n\n**Other Ideas:**\n\n1. **Tech accessory**: A high-quality wireless charging pad, a portable power bank, or a sleek phone case could be a practical and useful gift.\n2. **Personalized item**: A customized phone case, a photo album, or a personalized journal can be a thoughtful and unique gift.\n3. **Subscription service**: Consider gifting a subscription to a streaming platform, a book club, or a monthly delivery of his favorite snacks.\n4. **Fitness or wellness gift**: If your brother is into fitness or wellness, look into a fitness tracker, a yoga mat, or a spa day gift certificate.\n\nFeel free to provide more information about your brother's interests and preferences, and I can give you more tailored suggestions!",
