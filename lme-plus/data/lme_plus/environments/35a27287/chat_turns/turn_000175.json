  "content": "Congratulations on completing the Call of Duty campaign! I'd be happy to recommend some first-person shooter games that you might enjoy. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Battlefield series**: The Battlefield series is known for its large-scale multiplayer battles and engaging single-player campaigns. You might enjoy Battlefield 1, Battlefield 4, or Battlefield V.\n2. **Titanfall series**: Titanfall 2 is a great alternative to Call of Duty, with a strong focus on mech combat and a well-regarded single-player campaign.\n3. **Halo series**: If you're looking for a sci-fi FPS with a strong multiplayer component, Halo might be the way to go. Try Halo 5: Guardians or Halo Infinite.\n4. **CS:GO** (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive): If you're looking for a more competitive, tactical FPS experience, CS:GO is a great option.\n5. **Overwatch**: While not strictly a traditional FPS, Overwatch is a team-based shooter with a strong focus on heroes with unique abilities.\n6. **Wolfenstein series**: If you enjoy a more fast-paced, action-oriented FPS experience, the Wolfenstein series (e.g., Wolfenstein: The New Colossus, Wolfenstein: Youngblood) might be up your alley.\n7. **Far Cry series**: While not strictly a traditional FPS, the Far Cry series offers a strong first-person shooter experience with a focus on open-world exploration and a strong narrative.\n8. **Rainbow Six Siege**: Another tactical FPS with a strong competitive scene, Rainbow Six Siege is all about strategic teamplay and intense firefights.\n9. **Doom (2016)**: A fast-paced, action-packed FPS with a strong focus on combat and a great single-player campaign.\n10. **Metro series**: If you enjoy a more atmospheric, story-driven FPS experience, the Metro series (e.g., Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light) might be a great fit.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many other great FPS games out there. Is there a particular aspect of Call of Duty that you enjoyed (e.g., multiplayer, campaign, specific gameplay mechanics)? This might help me provide more targeted recommendations.",
