  "content": "The augmentations and abilities are a key part of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided's gameplay, and they can greatly enhance your experience.\n\nIn Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, augmentations are cybernetic enhancements that you can install in your body to grant you new abilities or enhance existing ones. These augmentations can be purchased or crafted using Praxis points, which you earn by completing missions, side quests, and other activities.\n\nThere are various types of augmentations, including:\n\n1. **Combat augmentations**: These enhance your combat abilities, such as increased damage output, improved accuracy, or enhanced stealth capabilities.\n2. **Stealth augmentations**: These allow you to move undetected, hack security systems, or create distractions to evade enemies.\n3. **Exploration augmentations**: These enable you to access new areas, such as by climbing walls, jumping higher, or seeing hidden paths.\n4. **Social augmentations**: These improve your social interactions, allowing you to persuade or intimidate NPCs more effectively.\n\nSome examples of augmentations include:\n\n* **Smart Vision**: Highlights enemies, security systems, and hidden objects, making it easier to navigate and plan your approach.\n* **Icarus Landing**: Allows you to fall from great heights without taking damage, making it easier to explore vertical spaces.\n* **Typhoon**: Unleashes a burst of explosive energy that can take out multiple enemies at once.\n* **Social Enhancer**: Improves your social skills, making it easier to persuade or intimidate NPCs.\n\nTo use augmentations effectively, you'll need to consider the situation and choose the right abilities for the task at hand. For example:\n\n* Use stealth augmentations to sneak past guards undetected or to set up ambushes.\n* Employ combat augmentations to take out groups of enemies quickly and efficiently.\n* Utilize exploration augmentations to access hidden areas or find alternative routes.\n* Leverage social augmentations to negotiate with NPCs or gather information.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you'll unlock new augmentations and upgrade existing ones. You'll need to manage your Praxis points carefully, as you can only equip a limited number of augmentations at a time.\n\nRemember, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is a game that rewards strategy and creativity. Experiment with different augmentations and approaches to find what works best for you, and don't be afraid to adapt to new situations.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with Deus Ex: Mankind Divided!
