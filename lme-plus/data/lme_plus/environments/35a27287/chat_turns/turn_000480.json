You can find many 7-minute workout videos online or download an app like Nike Training Club.\n2. **Yoga Flow**: Start with some gentle stretches and flow into a 10-15 minute yoga routine. You can find plenty of free yoga videos on YouTube or follow along with an app like Down Dog.\n3. **Bodyweight Exercises**: Focus on exercises that don't require any equipment, like push-ups, squats, lunges, planks, and burpees. You can do 3 sets of 10-15 reps for each exercise.\n4. **Jumping Jacks and Running in Place**: Get your heart rate up with some high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Do 30 seconds of jumping jacks, followed by 30 seconds of rest. Repeat for 10-15 minutes.\n5. **Brisk Walking or Jogging**: If you have a bit more time, take a 20-30 minute brisk walk or jog around your neighborhood.
