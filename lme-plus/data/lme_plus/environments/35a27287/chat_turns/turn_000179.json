Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Wolfenstein: The New Colossus**: The single-player campaign in Wolfenstein: The New Colossus is around 10-12 hours long, which is slightly longer than the average Call of Duty campaign. The game's story is well-regarded, and the game's atmosphere and setting are highly immersive.\n2. **Titanfall 2**: Titanfall 2's single-player campaign is around 6-8 hours long, but it's highly praised for its storytelling, characters, and level design. The game's campaign is tightly designed, and the story is well-integrated into the gameplay.\n3. **Far Cry 5**: Far Cry 5's single-player campaign is around 20-30 hours long, making it one of the longer campaigns on this list. The game's story is more open-ended, with a focus on exploration and taking down the game's villainous leaders.\n4. **Battlefield 1**: Battlefield 1's single-player campaign is around 6-8 hours long, but it's divided into several \"War Stories\" that offer a more cinematic and story-driven experience.
