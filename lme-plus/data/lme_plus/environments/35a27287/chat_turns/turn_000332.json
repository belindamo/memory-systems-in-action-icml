  "content": "A motor breakdown lorry without a floor would still likely be classified under heading 8705, which covers \"Special purpose motor vehicles, other than those principally designed for the transport of persons or goods.\" The key consideration for classification is the vehicle's primary purpose, which in this case is the recovery and transportation of broken-down or immobilized vehicles.\n\nEven though the motor breakdown lorry lacks a floor, it could still possess other specialized features or equipment that enable it to recover and transport immobilized vehicles, such as a crane or boom, a winch or hoist, lifting arms, or other recovery equipment. If the vehicle is equipped with such features and is primarily designed for the purpose of recovering and transporting broken-down vehicles, it would still be classified under heading 8705.\n\nHowever, if the lack of a floor renders the vehicle incapable of fulfilling its purpose as a motor breakdown lorry or significantly alters its primary function, it may be necessary to reconsider the classification based on its actual use or design. In such cases, you should consult the specific CN and HSENS guidance to determine the appropriate classification.",
