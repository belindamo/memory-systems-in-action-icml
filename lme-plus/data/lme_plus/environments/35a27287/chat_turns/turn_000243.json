Here are some popular options you might consider:\n\n1. **Almond Flour**: Made from ground almonds, almond flour adds a nutty flavor and delicate texture to baked goods. It's high in protein and healthy fats, but can be expensive. Use 1:1 substitution.\n2. **Oat Flour**: Oat flour is a great option for those with gluten intolerance or sensitivity. It has a slightly nutty flavor and can add a denser texture. Use 1:1 substitution.\n3. **Coconut Flour**: Coconut flour is high in fiber and protein, but absorbs more liquid than traditional flours. Use 1/4 cup coconut flour for every 1 cup of all-purpose flour, and adjust liquid content accordingly.\n4. **Teff Flour**: Teff flour is an ancient grain flour high in protein, fiber, and iron. It has a slightly sweet, nutty flavor and can add depth to your banana bread. Use 1:1 substitution.\n5. **Buckwheat Flour**: Buckwheat flour is gluten-free and high in protein. It has a distinct, nutty flavor and can add a denser texture. Use 1:1 substitution.\n6. **Chickpea Flour**: Chickpea flour, also known as gram flour, is high in protein and fiber. It has a nutty flavor and can add a denser texture. Use 1:1 substitution.\n7. **Rice Flour**: Rice flour is a good option for those with gluten intolerance or sensitivity. It's light and delicate, but can make baked goods more crumbly. Use 1:1 substitution.\n\nWhen substituting flours, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* Start with a small batch to ensure the flavor and texture turn out as desired.\n* Adjust the liquid content based on the flour's absorption rate.\n* Combine different flours to achieve the desired texture and flavor.\n* Be prepared for a possible change in texture, as some alternative flours can make baked goods denser or heavier.\n\nRemember, banana bread is a forgiving recipe, so don't be afraid to experiment and adjust as needed. Have fun trying out new flours and finding the perfect combination for your taste buds!\n\nWhich flour are you most interested in trying out first?",
