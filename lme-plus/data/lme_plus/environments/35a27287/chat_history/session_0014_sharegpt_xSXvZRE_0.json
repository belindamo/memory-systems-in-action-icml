      "content": "Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam is a sacred hymn composed of 1000 names of Lord Vishnu, one of the principal deities in Hinduism. The hymn is part of the Mahabharata, one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India. It is believed to have been composed by Veda Vyasa, who is also credited with the authorship of the Mahabharata and other Hindu scriptures.\n\nThe context in which Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam was composed is linked to the Mahabharata. The epic tells the story of a great war between two groups of cousins, the Pandavas and the Kauravas. The Pandavas were aided by Lord Krishna, who is regarded as the avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu. During the war, the Pandavas' commander-in-chief, Bhishma, was mortally wounded by Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers. As Bhishma lay on his bed of arrows, he expressed his devotion to Lord Vishnu by reciting the 1000 names of the deity, which were revealed to him by the sage Veda Vyasa.\n\nThe hymn is structured as a series of stanzas, each of which comprises a name of Lord Vishnu and a description of his attributes and qualities. The characters involved in the composition of Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam are Veda Vyasa, who received the names of Lord Vishnu from the sage Narada, and Bhishma, who recited the hymn on his deathbed.\n\nThe first two verses of Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam are:\n\nOm shukl\u00e3mbaradharam vishnum\nshashivarnam chaturbhujam\nprasanna vadanam dhyayet\nsarva vighnopashantaye\n\nOm namo bhagavate vasudevaya\n\nThe first verse is a description of Lord Vishnu's physical appearance. It says that he is dressed in white (shukla), has four arms (chaturbhujam), and has a serene and peaceful countenance (prasanna vadanam). The verse is an invitation to meditate on Lord Vishnu as a means of dispelling all obstacles (vighnas) in one's life.\n\nThe second verse is a salutation to Lord Vishnu, using his divine name Vasudeva. The name Vasudeva is a compound of two words, vasu, which means \"dwelling,\" and deva, which means \"god.\" It signifies that Lord Vishnu is the god who dwells within all beings and all things. The verse is an invocation of the divine presence of Lord Vishnu and a declaration of one's devotion to him."

      "content": "The 17th name of Lord Vishnu is Akshara. It is a Sanskrit word that means \"indestructible\" or \"imperishable\". This name signifies that Lord Vishnu is beyond the cycles of birth and death, and that he is eternal and immutable.\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, the concept of akshara is often associated with the Brahman, the ultimate reality that underlies all existence. The Brahman is considered to be the unchanging, eternal essence of the universe, and it is said to be indestructible and imperishable. Lord Vishnu, as the preserver of the universe, is seen as a manifestation of the Brahman, and his name Akshara reflects this aspect of his divine nature.\n\nThe name Akshara also has other connotations. In the context of the Vedas, which are the ancient Hindu scriptures, Akshara refers to the syllable Om, which is considered to be the sound of the universe and the embodiment of the Brahman. Lord Vishnu, as the embodiment of the Brahman, is also associated with the syllable Om, and his name Akshara may be seen as a reference to this connection.\n\nIn addition, the name Akshara is sometimes interpreted as a reference to Lord Vishnu's role as the sustainer of the universe. The word akshara can also mean \"that which does not decay\", and Lord Vishnu's name in this context signifies his ability to maintain the universe in a state of balance and harmony, preventing it from decaying or falling into chaos.\n\nOverall, the name Akshara highlights Lord Vishnu's transcendental and eternal nature, his connection to the Brahman and the universal syllable Om, and his role as the sustainer and preserver of the universe."
