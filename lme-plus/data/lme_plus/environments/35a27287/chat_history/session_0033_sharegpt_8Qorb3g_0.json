      "content": "A motor breakdown lorry without a floor would still likely be classified under heading 8705, which covers \"Special purpose motor vehicles, other than those principally designed for the transport of persons or goods.\" The key consideration for classification is the vehicle's primary purpose, which in this case is the recovery and transportation of broken-down or immobilized vehicles.\n\nEven though the motor breakdown lorry lacks a floor, it could still possess other specialized features or equipment that enable it to recover and transport immobilized vehicles, such as a crane or boom, a winch or hoist, lifting arms, or other recovery equipment. If the vehicle is equipped with such features and is primarily designed for the purpose of recovering and transporting broken-down vehicles, it would still be classified under heading 8705.\n\nHowever, if the lack of a floor renders the vehicle incapable of fulfilling its purpose as a motor breakdown lorry or significantly alters its primary function, it may be necessary to reconsider the classification based on its actual use or design. In such cases, you should consult the specific CN and HSENS guidance to determine the appropriate classification."

      "content": "If a lorry is designed to be used for both the transport of broken-down vehicles and the transport of non-broken down vehicles, it could be considered a multi-purpose vehicle. In this case, its classification depends on its principal use, design, and features.\n\nIf the lorry has specialized features or equipment primarily intended for the recovery and transportation of broken-down vehicles, such as a tilting or sliding platform, winch or hoist, lifting arms, or other recovery equipment, it would likely be classified under heading 8705, which covers \"Special purpose motor vehicles, other than those principally designed for the transport of persons or goods.\"\n\nHowever, if the lorry is primarily designed for the transport of non-broken down vehicles, such as a car carrier or a general-purpose flatbed truck, without any specialized recovery equipment, it would likely be classified under heading 8704, which covers \"Motor vehicles for the transport of goods.\"\n\nIn cases where it is difficult to determine the principal use or design of the vehicle, it is essential to consult the specific CN and HSENS guidance and consider any additional factors that could help clarify the vehicle's primary purpose. If necessary, consult with a customs or trade expert to ensure accurate classification."

      "content": "Would the inclusion of a beaver-tail floor on a lorry indicate if it is a motor breakdown lorry or not?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "A beaver-tail floor on a lorry can be an indicator that the vehicle is designed for the transportation of other vehicles, including broken-down ones. However, the presence of a beaver-tail floor alone does not definitively classify a lorry as a motor breakdown lorry.\n\nA beaver-tail floor refers to the sloping rear section of a lorry, which facilitates the loading and unloading of vehicles onto the platform. While this feature is common in motor breakdown lorries, it can also be found in lorries designed for general vehicle transportation, such as car carriers or flatbed trucks.\n\nTo determine whether a lorry with a beaver-tail floor should be classified as a motor breakdown lorry, it's essential to consider the vehicle's principal use, design, and any specialized features or equipment intended for the recovery and transportation of broken-down vehicles. These may include elements such as a tilting or sliding platform, a winch or hoist, lifting arms, or other specialized recovery equipment.\n\nIf the lorry is primarily designed and equipped for the recovery and transportation of broken-down vehicles, it would likely be classified under heading 8705. If, on the other hand, the lorry is principally designed for the transport of non-broken down vehicles, it would likely fall under heading 8704.\n\nIn cases where the vehicle's primary purpose is not clear, consult the specific CN and HSENS guidance and consider any additional factors that could help clarify the vehicle's primary function. If necessary, consult with a customs or trade expert to ensure accurate classification."
