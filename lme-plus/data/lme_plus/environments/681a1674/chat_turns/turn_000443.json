He has also ordered social networks to remove thousands of posts and videos with little room for appeal. And this year, 10 of the court\u2019s 11 justices sentenced a congressman to nearly nine years in prison for making what they said were threats against them in a livestream.\n\nThe power grab by the nation\u2019s highest court, legal experts say, has undermined a key democratic institution in Latin America\u2019s biggest country as voters prepare to pick a president on Oct. 2. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president, has led Mr. Bolsonaro in polls for months, while Mr. Bolsonaro has been telling the country, without any evidence, that his rivals are trying to rig the vote.\n\nIn many cases, Mr. Moraes has acted unilaterally, emboldened by new powers the court granted itself in 2019 that allow it to, in effect, act as an investigator, prosecutor and judge all at once in some cases.\n\nUnderstand\u00a0the\u00a0Riots in Brazil\u2019s Capital\nThousands of rioters supporting Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president of Brazil, \u00a0stormed the nation\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices on Jan. 8.\nAnatomy of a Mass Attack:\u00a0After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede. Here is what went wrong.\nThe Investigations: Authorities face several major questions\u00a0as they piece together how rioters briefly seized the seats of Brazil\u2019s government.\nDigital Playbook: Misinformation researchers are studying how the internet was used ahead of the riots in Brazil. Many are drawing a comparison to the Jan. 6 attack.\nThe Role of the Police: Their early inaction in the riot shows how security forces can help empower violence\u00a0and deepen the threat to democracy.\nDias Toffoli, the Supreme Court justice who created those powers, said in a statement that he did so to protect the nation\u2019s democracy: \u201cBrazil lives with the same incitement to hatred that took lives in the U.S. Capitol invasion, and democratic institutions must do everything possible to avoid scenarios like Jan. 6, 2021, which shocked the world.\u201d\n\nPolitical leaders on the left and much of the Brazilian press and public have largely supported Mr. Moraes\u2019s actions as necessary measures to counter the singular threat posed by Mr. Bolsonaro.\n\nBut many legal experts say that Mr. Moraes\u2019s shows of force, under the banner of saving democracy, are themselves threatening to push the country toward an antidemocratic slide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the story of all bad stuff that ever happens in politics,\u201d said Luciano da Ros, a Brazilian political science professor who studies the politics of the judiciary. \u201cIn the beginning you had one problem. Now you have two.\u201d\n\nMr. Moraes declined to comment through a spokeswoman.\n\nThe court\u2019s expanding influence could have major implications for the winner of the presidential vote. If Mr. Bolsonaro wins a second term, he has suggested that he would seek to pack the Supreme Court, giving him even more control over Brazilian society.\n\nIf Mr. da Silva wins, he would have to contend with justices who could complicate his agenda for a country facing a host of challenges, including rising hunger, deforestation in the Amazon and deep polarization.\n\n\u201cHistorically, when the court has given itself new power, it hasn\u2019t said later that it was wrong,\u201d said Diego Werneck, a Brazilian law professor who studies the court. \u201cThe powers that get created remain.\u201d\n\nIf no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote in the Oct. 2 election, the top two finishers will face a runoff on Oct. 30.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Supreme Court was already a potent institution. In the United States, the Supreme Court weighs in on 100 to 150 cases a year. In Brazil, the 11 justices and the attorneys who work for them issued 505,000 rulings over the past five years.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Moraes ordered the freezing of bank accounts of businessmen and the subpoenaing of their financial, phone and digital records over messages they exchanged on WhatsApp. Credit...Joedson Alves/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nIn 2019, a few months after Mr. Bolsonaro took office, a one-page document vastly expanded the Supreme Court\u2019s authority.\n\nAt the time, the court was facing attacks online from some of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters. Typically, law enforcement officers or prosecutors would have to open an investigation into such activity, but they had not.\n\nSo Mr. Toffoli, the court\u2019s chief justice, issued an order granting the Supreme Court itself the authority to open an investigation.\n\nThe court would investigate \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 Mr. Toffoli used the term in English \u2014 that attacked \u201cthe honorability\u201d of the court and its justices.\n\nIt was an unprecedented role, turning the court in some cases into the accuser and the judge, according to Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello, a former Supreme Court justice who last year reached the mandatory retirement age of 75.\n\nMr. Mello, who is a supporter of Mr. Bolsonaro, believed the court was violating the Constitution to address a problem. \u201cIn law, the means justify the ends,\u201d he added. \u201cNot the reverse.\u201d\n\nAntonio Cezar Peluso, another former Supreme Court justice, disagreed. The authorities, he said, were allowing threats to proliferate. \u201cI can\u2019t expect the court to be quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had to act.\u201d\n\nTo run the investigation, Mr. Toffoli tapped Mr. Moraes, 53, an intense former federal justice minister and constitutional law professor who had joined the court in 2017.\n\nIn his first action, Mr. Moraes ordered a Brazilian magazine, Cruso\u00e9, to remove an online article that showed links between Mr. Toffoli and a corruption investigation. Mr. Moraes called it \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nAndre Marsiglia, a lawyer who represented Cruso\u00e9, said the ruling was startling. The Supreme Court had often protected news organizations from lower-court decisions ordering such takedowns. Now it \u201cwas the driver of the censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had no one to turn to.\u201d\n\nMr. Moraes later lifted the order after legal documents proved the article was accurate.\n\nImage\n\nA screen with an image of Mr. Moraes during a CPAC gathering in June in S\u00e3o Paulo.

Mr. Bolsonaro was increasing attacks on judges, the media and the nation\u2019s electoral system.\n\nMr. Moraes ordered major social networks to remove dozens of accounts, erasing thousands of their posts, often without giving a reason, according to a tech company official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid provoking the judge. When this official\u2019s tech company reviewed the posts and accounts that Mr. Moraes ordered it to remove, the company found that much of the content did not break its rules, the official said.\n\nIn many cases, Mr. Moraes went after right-wing influencers who spread misleading or false information. But he also went after people on the left. When the official account of a Brazilian communist party tweeted that Mr. Moraes was a \u201cskinhead\u201d and that the Supreme Court should be dissolved, Mr. Moraes ordered tech companies to ban all of the party\u2019s accounts, including a YouTube channel with more than 110,000 subscribers. The companies complied.\n\nMr. Moraes went even further. In seven cases, he ordered the arrest of far-right activists on charges of threatening democracy by advocating for a coup or calling people to antidemocratic rallies. At least two are still in jail or under house arrest. Some cases were initiated by the attorney general\u2019s office, while others Mr. Moraes began himself.\n\nIn its investigation, the court discovered evidence that far-right extremists had discussed assaulting justices, were tracking the judges\u2019 movements and had shared a map of a court building, according to a court official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the findings are part a sealed investigation.\n\nIn the most high-profile case, Mr. Moraes ordered the arrest of a conservative congressman after he criticized Mr. Moraes and other justices in an online livestream. \u201cSo many times I\u2019ve imagined you taking a beating on the street,\u201d the congressman, Daniel Silveira, said in the livestream. \u201cWhat are you going to say? That I\u2019m inciting violence?\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court voted 10-to-1 to sentence Mr. Silveira to nearly nine years in prison for inciting a coup. Mr. Bolsonaro pardoned him the next day.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Moraes ordered the arrest of a conservative congressman, Daniel Silveira, center, after Mr. Silveira criticized Mr. Moraes and other high court justices. Credit...Victor Moriyama for The New York Times\n\nWith a majority of Congress, the military and the executive branch backing the president, Mr. Moraes has become arguably the most effective check on Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s power. That has made him a hero to the left \u2014 and public enemy No. 1 on the right.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro has railed against him in speeches, tried and failed to get him impeached and then told supporters he would not abide by Mr. Moraes\u2019s rulings. (He later walked that back.)\n\nLast month, Mr. Moraes took on even more power, also assuming the presidency of the elections court that will oversee the vote. (The timing was a coincidence.)\n\nAt his inauguration, Mr. Moraes seemed to speak directly to Mr. Bolsonaro, who sat nearby. \u201cFreedom of expression is not freedom to destroy democracy, to destroy institutions,\u201d Mr. Moraes said as Mr. Bolsonaro scowled.\n\nThe tension between the men grew with the WhatsApp case involving the businessmen.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro blasted Mr. Moraes\u2019s order, which in part approved a police request to search the men\u2019s homes. In an unusual moment, the mainstream Brazilian press agreed with the president. \u201cExchanging messages, mere opinions without action, even if they are against democracy,\u201d the TV network Band said in an editorial, \u201cdoes not constitute crimes.\u201d\n\nUnder criticism, Mr. Moraes\u2019s office produced an additional legal document that it said provided further evidence of the potential threat the men represented. The document repeated already public connections some of the men had to right-wing operatives.\n\nMr. Moraes later unfroze the businessmen\u2019s bank accounts. The men were never arrested.\n\nLuciano Hang, the box-store billionaire, said he was fighting to regain control of his social media accounts, which collectively had at least 6 million followers. \u201cWe feel violated to have the federal police show up at 6 a.m. wanting to take your phone,\u201d he said.\n\nLindora Ara\u00fajo, Brazil\u2019s deputy attorney general and a career prosecutor, appealed Mr. Moraes\u2019s order against the businessmen, saying the judge had abused his power by targeting them for simply stating opinions in a private chat. His order resembled \u201ca kind of thought police that is characteristic of authoritarian regimes,\u201d she said.\n\nThat appeal went to Mr. Moraes. He dismissed it.",
