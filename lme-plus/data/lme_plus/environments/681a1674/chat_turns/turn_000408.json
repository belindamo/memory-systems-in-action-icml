  "content": "The development of an electronic health record (EHR) management system can be achieved through various tools and technologies. One such approach involves using Solidity, Ethereum, web3, IPFS, React.js, and Next.js. This methodology consists of designing the user interface with React.js and Next.js, writing smart contracts using Solidity to govern the EHR system's behavior, and deploying these contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and immutability. In addition, patient data can be stored securely on IPFS, a decentralized storage platform. To enable seamless interaction between the user interface and smart contracts, web3 is utilized. By using this approach, a secure and decentralized EHR management system can be developed, prioritizing the privacy and security of patient data.",
