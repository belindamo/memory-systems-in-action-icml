Mix the ingredients thoroughly to ensure that the dough is well combined and that there are no dry lumps. 2. Allow the dough to rest and rise for at least 30 minutes in a warm place. This allows the yeast to activate and the dough to rise, creating a lighter and fluffier texture. 3. Use eggs in the recipe, as they help to bind the ingredients together and add moisture to the dough. 4. Be sure to preheat the oven to the correct temperature before baking the bread. 5. Cover the loaf with a kitchen towel while it's rising to prevent it from forming a dry crust. 6. Once the bread is baked, let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. This allows the bread to fully set and creates a non-gummy texture. With these tips in mind, you should be able to achieve a delicious and fluffy gluten-free bread!",
