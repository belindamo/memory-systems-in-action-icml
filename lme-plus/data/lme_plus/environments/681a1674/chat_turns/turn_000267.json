It's wonderful that Dr. Rodriguez's guided tour provided valuable insights into the historical context of the artifacts, making the experience even more engaging and informative.\n\nAs a side note, I should mention that I'm an AI, and I don't have any information about a specific Dr. Rodriguez or an \"Art of the Ancients\" exhibit. I'm just here to provide general information and answer your questions to the best of my abilities.\n\nHowever, I'm happy to continue discussing the mummification process, ancient Egyptian culture, or any other topic that interests you!",
