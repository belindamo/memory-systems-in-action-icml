  "content": "It's understandable to feel that way about the influence of postmodernism on music. However, it's important to remember that artistic expression is always evolving and changing, and different artists approach music-making in different ways. For some musicians, experimentation and deconstruction are a way of exploring new sounds and ideas, and developing their own unique style. For others, relatability and emotional connection are still at the forefront of their music-making process, even if they incorporate elements of postmodernism in their work.\n\nPostmodernism is just one of many movements that have had an impact on music over the years, and its influence on music in the 21st century is just one aspect of contemporary music-making. Some listeners may find that postmodern music is less relatable or emotionally resonant than other kinds of music, while others may find it more engaging and intellectually stimulating. Ultimately, like any art form, music is open to interpretation and different people will respond to it in different ways.",
