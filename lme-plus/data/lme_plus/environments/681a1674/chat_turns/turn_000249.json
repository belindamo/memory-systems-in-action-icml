Unfortunately, without knowing the exact recipe, it's a bit like trying to recreate a secret formula. However, I can provide you with some popular BBQ sauce recipes and tips that might help you get close to the flavor profile you're looking for.\n\nBefore we dive into recipes, can you tell me a bit more about the sauce from Smoke and Dreams? What were the dominant flavors you noticed? Was it sweet, tangy, smoky, spicy, or a combination of these? Was it thick and syrupy or more of a thin, vinegar-based sauce?\n\nHere are a few questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n1. Did the sauce have a strong tomato flavor or was it more of a vinegar-based sauce?\n2. Was there a noticeable sweetness from ingredients like brown sugar, honey, or molasses?\n3.
