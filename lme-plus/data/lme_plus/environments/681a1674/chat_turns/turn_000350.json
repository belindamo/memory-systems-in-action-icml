  "content": "Yes, you can definitely add extra ingredients like nuts or seeds to the bread! Here's how you can modify the recipe:\n\n1. Before adding the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stir in 1/4 to 1/2 cup of your preferred nuts or seeds (such as chopped almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, or chia seeds).\n\n2. Combine the wet and dry ingredients as directed in the recipe.\n\n3. When you transfer the dough to the greased loaf pan, sprinkle additional nuts or seeds on top of the dough.\n\n4. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place as directed in the recipe.\n\n5. Bake the bread as directed, keeping an eye on it to ensure it doesn't brown too quickly.\n\nAdding nuts or seeds to the bread will give it a bit of texture and extra flavor. Just be sure to use gluten-free nuts and seeds to keep the recipe completely gluten-free!",
