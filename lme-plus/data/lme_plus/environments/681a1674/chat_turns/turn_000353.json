  "content": "The passage discusses different modes for retrieving water quality parameters using remote sensing. These modes are the empirical mode, analytical mode, semi-empirical mode, and artificial intelligence mode. The empirical mode uses a statistical regression formula to establish a relationship between water quality parameters and reflectance, while the analytical mode uses bio-optical and radiation transmission models to simulate the propagation of light in the atmosphere and water bodies to describe the relationship between water quality components and the radiance or reflection spectrum. The semi-empirical mode combines the empirical and analytical modes and uses a small amount of in situ data and reflectance or radiance values to calculate water quality variables. The artificial intelligence mode uses neural networks and support vector machines to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships between water quality parameters and sediment deposits.",
