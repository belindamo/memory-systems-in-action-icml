  "content": "(Verse 1)\nYo, listen up, I got a tale to tell,\n'Bout a Mardi Gras crew, man, they raised some hell,\nIn Dothan city, where the party's alive,\nWet Bandits rollin' in, led by Tanner the wise.\n\nThey spotted a float with mermaids and dolphins,\nTanner said, \"Let's take it, no ifs or ands, we're all in!\"\nThey transformed it quick, made it nautical and naughty,\nRenamed that bad boy, now it's called \"Feeling Nauti.\"\n\n(Chorus)\nFeeling Nauti, floatin' through the night,\nWet Bandits raisin' chaos, but it feels so right,\nIn the city of Dothan, where Mardi Gras thrives,\nTanner Shelley and his crew, bringin' it alive.\n\n(Verse 2)\nThey threw beads and trinkets, crowd goin' wild,\nWater balloons flyin', like a crazy child,\nPeople laughin', cheerin', lovin' the show,\nWet Bandits rockin' Mardi Gras, you already know.\n\nBut the cops, they came, tryna shut it down,\nTanner's too slick, he ain't wearin' no frown,\nInto an alley, escaped without a trace,\nWet Bandits vanished, couldn't keep up the chase.\n\n(Bridge)\nA legend was born on that Mardi Gras night,\nFeeling Nauti float, out of sight,\nTanner Shelley and his crew, they came and went,\nBut the memory stays, it's heaven-sent.\n\n(Chorus)\nFeeling Nauti, floatin' through the night,\nWet Bandits raisin' chaos, but it feels so right,\nIn the city of Dothan, where Mardi Gras thrives,\nTanner Shelley and his crew, bringin' it alive.\n\n(Outro)\nThe night wore on, whispers filled the air,\n'Bout the Wet Bandits' deeds, people couldn't help but stare,\nThey'll never forget the day the chaos came to town,\nFeeling Nauti, Wet Bandits, they'll always wear the crown.",
