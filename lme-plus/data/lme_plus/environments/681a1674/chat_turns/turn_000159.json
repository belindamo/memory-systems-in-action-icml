  "content": "Yes, the Maldives Government has implemented several measures to ensure that its fishing industry is sustainable and environmentally friendly. First of all, the Maldives prohibits the use of fishing nets that are harmful to marine life, such as driftnets, which can kill dolphins, whales, and other large marine animals. Instead, the Maldives uses a traditional pole-and-line fishing method to catch tuna, which is considered more environmentally friendly.\n\nThe Maldives also works to protect the marine environment by establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) to conserve fish stocks and their habitats. Currently, 10% of the country's waters are designated as MPAs, which protects sea turtles, dolphins, sharks, and other marine species.\n\nFurthermore, the Maldives Government has introduced a licensing system for fishing vessels to control overfishing and ensure that fishing activities respect sustainable fishing practices. The government also implements strict catch quotas and monitors the size of catches to ensure that fishermen do not take too much of any one species.\n\nFinally, the Maldives has taken an active role in international efforts to fight illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The Maldives has ratified international conventions on sustainable fishing, such as the UN's Fish Stocks Agreement and established partnerships with other countries to combat IUU fishing.\n\nOverall, the Maldives has implemented a comprehensive set of measures to ensure that its fishing industry is environmentally friendly and sustainable.",
