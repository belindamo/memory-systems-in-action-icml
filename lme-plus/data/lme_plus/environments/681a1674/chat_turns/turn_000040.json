Thanks for the tips on creating an effective outline! I'll definitely keep them in mind as I work on my essay.\n\nBy the way, I've been experimenting with different writing tools, and I recently tried writing with a fountain pen. I have to say, it's been a really enjoyable experience. There's something about the feel of the pen gliding across the paper that's very satisfying. Do you have any favorite writing tools or habits that help you stay creative and focused?",
