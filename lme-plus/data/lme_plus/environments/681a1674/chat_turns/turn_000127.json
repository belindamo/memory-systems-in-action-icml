To print the distribution of average weekly sales per store for 2012:\n```r\n# read in the data from the csv file\nSupermarketdata <- read.csv(\"Supermarketdata.csv\")\n\n# filter the data to only include 2012\nSupermarketdata_2012 <- filter(Supermarketdata, year == 2012)\n\n# group the data by Store and calculate the mean of Weekly_Sales for each group\nSupermarketdata_2012_store_summary <- group_by(Supermarketdata_2012, Store) %>%\n  summarize(mean_weekly_sales = mean(Weekly_Sales))\n\n# print the summary statistics\nsummary(Supermarketdata_2012_store_summary$mean_weekly_sales)\n```\nThis will give you the summary statistics for the distribution of average weekly sales per store for 2012. The code filters the data to only include 2012, groups the data by store, calculates the mean of weekly sales for each store, and then prints the summary statistics.\n\n1. To create a box plot that displays this information and identifies where Store number 10 is:\n```python\n# read in the data from the csv file\nSupermarketdata <- read.csv(\"Supermarketdata.csv\")\n\n# filter the data to only include 2012\nSupermarketdata_2012 <- filter(Supermarketdata, year == 2012)\n\n# create a box plot of Weekly_Sales grouped by Store\nboxplot(Weekly_Sales ~ Store, data = Supermarketdata_2012, main = \"Distribution of Weekly Sales per Store in 2012\", \n        xlab = \"Store Number\", ylab = \"Weekly Sales\")\n\n# add a vertical line to show where Store 10 is\nabline(v = 10, col = \"red\", lty = 2)\n```\nThis will create a box plot that displays the distribution of weekly sales per store in 2012, with the store numbers on the x-axis and the weekly sales on the y-axis. It also adds a vertical line in red to show where Store number 10 is in the plot.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",
