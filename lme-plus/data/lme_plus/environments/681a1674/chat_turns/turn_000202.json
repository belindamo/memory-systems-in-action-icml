Here's what I found:\n\n1. **Yoga Studio Hana**: They offer some English classes, and their instructors are happy to provide guidance in English if needed. They also have a \"Yoga for Beginners\" class that's taught in English.\n2. **Yoga Tree Shimokitazawa**: They have a few English-speaking instructors, and they offer some classes in English, including Hot Yoga and Vinyasa Flow. They also have a \"Yoga for Foreigners\" class, which is taught in English.\n3. **Sattva Yoga Studio**: They don't have regular English classes, but they do offer private lessons in English. You can contact them to arrange a private session with an English-speaking instructor.\n\nThe other studios I mentioned might not have English classes or instructors, but it's always a good idea to call or email them to confirm.\n\nAdditionally, I found a few more studios in Shimokitazawa that offer English classes or have English-speaking instructors:\n\n* **Yoga Room Shimokitazawa**: This studio offers some English classes, including Hatha and Vinyasa yoga. They also have a \"Yoga for Beginners\" class in English.\n* **Bikram Yoga Shimokitazawa**: This studio offers Bikram Yoga classes in English, and their instructors are fluent in English.\n\nPlease note that the availability of English classes or instructors might change, so it's always a good idea to check the studio's website or contact them directly to confirm before attending a class.\n\nI hope this helps you find a yoga studio that fits your needs!",
