  "content": "1. Research question and finding of Tian et al. (2022):\nResearch question: Can Sentinel-2 satellite data combined with multiple machine learning algorithms be used to accurately retrieve inland water quality parameters?\nFinding: The study found that machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest and support vector regression, combined with Sentinel-2 data can provide accurate retrieval of inland water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, and turbidity.\n2. Research question and finding of Arias-Rodriguez et al. (2020):\nResearch question: Can the entire lifespan of MERIS satellite data combined with machine learning approaches be used to monitor the water quality of Valle de Bravo Reservoir in Mexico?\nFinding: The study found that machine learning algorithms, specifically artificial neural networks and random forests, combined with the entire lifespan of MERIS data can accurately monitor the water quality of the Valle de Bravo Reservoir, including parameters such as chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, and colored dissolved organic matter.",
