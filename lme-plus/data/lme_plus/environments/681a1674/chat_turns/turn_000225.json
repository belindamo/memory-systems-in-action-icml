  "content": "I've been experimenting with different types of wood chips myself. Last month, I tried using hickory chips for the first time, and I was impressed by the strong, sweet flavor they added to my BBQ. I've since purchased a few bags of applewood and mesquite chips, which I'm looking forward to trying out soon. Do you have any recommendations for how to store wood chips to keep them fresh for a longer period?",
