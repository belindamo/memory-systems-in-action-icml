  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't hold personal beliefs, but I can provide information on this topic.\n\nI agree that social media companies should do more to prevent harmful content from being shared in the first place. While there are many policies and measures in place to limit the spread of harmful content, some content can still be missed or slip through the cracks. \n\nIt is essential that social media companies continue to develop and refine policies and technology to detect and remove potentially harmful content. They could also invest in developing AI-based systems to proactively identify and remove harmful content. Some social media platforms have already implemented features like image recognition technology to detect and remove harmful content.\n\nIn addition to these measures, social media companies should also provide users with resources and support to deal with harmful content. They could offer users access to mental health support, provide education and awareness campaigns to their users about mental health, and engage in consultations and collaboration with experts in the field.\n\nOverall, social media companies have a crucial role to play in preventing harmful content from being shared on their platforms. While parents and educators play an essential role in supporting teenagers' mental health, social media companies need to take action to ensure that their platforms do not contribute to negative mental health outcomes.",
