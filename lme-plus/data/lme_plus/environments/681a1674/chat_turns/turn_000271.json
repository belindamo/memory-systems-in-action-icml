I can provide general information about ancient Egyptian and Greek artifacts, but I don't have specific knowledge about the exhibit you attended.\n\nHowever, I can tell you that exhibits on ancient Egyptian and Greek civilizations often feature a wide range of artifacts, including:\n\n* Mummies and sarcophagi\n* Sculptures, reliefs, and statues of gods and goddesses\n* Jewelry, amulets, and other personal adornments\n* Pottery, ceramics, and other household items\n* Coins, seals, and other objects related to trade and commerce\n* Funerary objects, such as canopic jars and shabti figures\n* Architectural elements, like columns, capitals, and friezes\n* Papyri, scrolls, and other written materials\n\nThese artifacts provide valuable insights into the daily lives, beliefs, and cultural practices of ancient Egyptians and Greeks. They can also offer a glimpse into the artistic, technological, and intellectual achievements of these civilizations.\n\nIf you have specific questions about a particular artifact or type of artifact, I'd be happy to try and help!",
