However, I can provide some objective information. \n\n\"That's Why\" is a country music song by American singer Michael Ray, released in 2018. The lyrical themes explored in the song include lost love, heartbreak, and regret. The song's narrator reflects on the failed relationship, acknowledging his mistakes and wishing he could go back in time to fix things. \n\nCompared to other songs in its genre, \"That's Why\" may stand out for its introspective and emotional lyrics, as well as its focus on a specific relationship rather than broader themes like partying, trucks, or small-town life that can be common in country music. The song also features a strong vocal performance from Ray and a relatively stripped-down, acoustic arrangement.",
