However, it can be argued that postmodernism has had a significant impact on the development of 21st-century music. Postmodernism is characterized by a rejection of traditional notions of high art and a preference for a more inclusive and eclectic approach to culture. This rejection of hierarchy and the celebration of diversity have influenced the development of popular music, which has become more diverse and experimental. The use of sampling, mash-ups, and other forms of collage, which are characteristic of postmodernism, have become ubiquitous in popular music.\n\nPostmodernism has also influenced the way in which music is produced and disseminated. The widespread availability of digital technology has allowed musicians to create and distribute their work outside of traditional record labels and distribution channels. This has led to a proliferation of new genres and niche markets as musicians are able to target smaller, more specialized audiences.\n\nThe influence of postmodernism on music can also be seen in the way that musicians engage with popular culture. Many musicians incorporate references to popular culture in their work, such as samples from movies and TV shows, or references to celebrities and other cultural icons. This blurring of the boundaries between high and low culture is a characteristic of postmodernism.\n\nOverall, it can be argued that postmodernism has had a significant impact on the development of 21st-century music, leading to a more diverse and experimental musical landscape, as well as a blurring of the boundaries between high and low culture.",
