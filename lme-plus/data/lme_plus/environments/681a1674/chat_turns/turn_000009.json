  "content": "With a modern style and a dark gray couch, you've got a great canvas to work with.\n\nConsidering your budget and the size of the room, I'd recommend a rug that's around 8x10 feet or 9x12 feet. This size will provide a comfortable fit under the coffee table and define the seating area nicely.\n\nFor a modern look, you might want to consider the following rug styles:\n\n1. **Solid-colored rug**: A solid-colored rug in a lighter shade can create a nice contrast with your dark gray couch and dark blue throw pillows. Look for a rug with a subtle texture or pattern to add some visual interest.\n2. **Geometric pattern**: A geometric pattern can add a modern touch to your living room. You can opt for a bold, contrasting color or a more subtle design that complements your existing furniture.\n3. **Moroccan-inspired rug**: Moroccan-inspired rugs are super popular in modern interiors, and for good reason! They often feature a mix of geometric patterns, abstract designs, and bold colors. Look for a rug with a darker blue or gray tone to tie in with your throw pillows.\n\nIn terms of materials, consider the following:\n\n1. **Wool or wool-blend**: Wool is a great choice for high-traffic areas, as it's durable and easy to clean. Wool-blend rugs can offer a more affordable option while still providing good performance.\n2. **Synthetic fibers**: If you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, synthetic fibers like polypropylene or polyester can be a good choice. They're often stain-resistant and easy to clean.\n\nSome popular mid-range rug brands to consider are:\n\n1. West Elm\n2. Crate & Barrel\n3. Pottery Barn\n4. CB2\n5. Rugs USA\n\nYou can also try online marketplaces like Wayfair, Overstock, or Amazon, which often offer a wide selection and competitive pricing.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I recommend reading reviews and checking the rug's specifications, including the material, pile height, and construction. This will help ensure you find a rug that meets your needs and fits your budget.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Do you have any other questions or preferences you'd like to share?",
