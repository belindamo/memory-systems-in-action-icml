  "content": "Yes, you can do all the steps in one line of query without repeating step 6. You can use a formula such as =AVERAGE(LN(B2:B12))/0.5\\*COS(Y$10) where B2:B12 refers to the range of B readings and Y$10 refers to the range of angles in radians. This formula will calculate the transmittance for each angle/measurement of B readings and then use the average of the two A reading as the reference above the canopy, convert it to log values, and then average as log and from the averages we can compute the LAI.\nYou can then drag the formula down for all the rows that contain B readings.\nYou can then use the chart tool in excel to plot the graph with Angle (X axis) and all the B'S on the Y axis.",
