The 20% discount during the VIB Sale is a great opportunity to try out their products.\n\nFor fine lines and dullness, I'd recommend focusing on products that contain ingredients like:\n\n1. Retinol: Stimulates collagen production, reduces fine lines, and improves skin texture.\n2. Peptides: Helps to plump and firm the skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n3. Antioxidants: Neutralize free radicals, which can cause dullness and damage to the skin.\n4. Exfoliants: Gently remove dead skin cells, revealing brighter, smoother skin.\n5. Nourishing ingredients: Hydrate and plump the skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines and dullness.\n\nHere are some Drunk Elephant products that might interest you:\n\n1. **Protini Polypeptide Cream**: A rich moisturizer containing peptides, vitamins, and antioxidants to plump and firm the skin.\n2. **Retinol Serums**: Drunk Elephant offers two retinol serums: A-Passioni Retinol Cream ( gentle, nourishing) and D-Bronzi Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops (contains antioxidants and has a bronzy glow).\n3. **T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial**: A weekly exfoliating treatment containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) to gently resurface the skin.\n4. **C-Firma Day Serum**: A vitamin C serum that brightens, firms, and protects the skin from environmental stressors.\n5. **Lala Retro Whipped Cream**: A rich, nourishing moisturizer that provides long-lasting hydration and helps to plump fine lines.\n\nConsider building a routine around these products, and don't hesitate to mix and match with other Drunk Elephant products or other brands that resonate with you.\n\nSome other brands you might want to explore during the VIB Sale, considering your concerns, are:\n\n1.
