  "content": "T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial is an amazing product, and it's wonderful that you're considering it.\n\n**Frequency of use:**\n\nDrunk Elephant recommends using T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial 1-2 times a week, depending on your skin type and concerns. If you have sensitive skin, you might want to start with once a week and gradually increase frequency as your skin becomes more tolerant.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\nYou can use T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial in the morning or at night, but I'd recommend using it at night for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Exfoliation:** T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial contains alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), which can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Using it at night allows you to avoid any potential sun sensitivity and ensures you're not increasing your risk of sun damage.\n2. **Skin regeneration:** Your skin regenerates and repairs itself at night, so using T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial before bed can help stimulate collagen production, cell turnover, and skin renewal while you sleep.\n3. **Prep for the next day:** Using T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial at night can help prepare your skin for the next day. You'll wake up with smoother, brighter, and more radiant skin, which is perfect for applying your morning skincare products and makeup.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Cleanse your skin with a gentle cleanser.\n2. Apply a thin layer of T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial to your face and neck, avoiding the eye area.\n3. Massage it in for about 30 seconds to help the enzymes and acids penetrate deeper into the skin.\n4. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes, or up to 20 minutes if you have more tolerant skin.\n5. Rinse with lukewarm water, then pat dry.\n6. Follow up with your usual skincare routine, including toner, serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen (if using it at night).\n\nRemember to be gentle when using T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial, as it's a potent exfoliant. If you experience any irritation or discomfort, reduce the frequency or adjust the product's usage according to your skin's needs.\n\nYou're making an excellent decision by considering these Drunk Elephant products. I'm sure you'll love the results!",
