Seated Twist: Sit with your legs crossed and twist to one side, placing your opposite hand on the knee and the other hand behind you. Hold the pose for several breaths, then switch sides.\n\n2. Mountain Pose: Stand up tall with your feet hip-distance apart, and arms down by your side. Close your eyes, and take several deep breaths.\n\n3. Downward Dog: Come onto your hands and knees, then lift your hips up and back. Straighten your arms and legs and press your heels towards the ground. Hold the pose for several breaths, then release.\n\n4. Tree Pose: Stand with both feet on the ground, then lift one foot and place it on the opposite leg\u2019s inner thigh. Bring your hands in front of your chest and take several deep breaths.\n\n5. Forward Fold: Stand tall with your feet hip-distance apart, then fold forward, letting your head and neck relax. Reach for the ground or place your hands on your shins, and hold the pose for several breaths.\n\nRemember to take it slowly and be gentle with yourself. It's better to do a few simple postures correctly than to do many complicated poses incorrectly. Take time to pause and breathe in each pose, and focus on being present in the moment.",
