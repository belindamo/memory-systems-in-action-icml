  "content": "Certainly, here's another paragraph on the methodology without the encryption of IPFS:\n\nTo ensure transparency and immutability, the EHR management system uses blockchain technology to store patient data. The system is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which allows for the deployment of smart contracts that govern the behavior of the EHR system. The smart contracts are written in Solidity, a programming language designed specifically for Ethereum. These contracts are then deployed onto the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures that the records are transparent and tamper-proof. To enable seamless interaction between the user interface and smart contracts, web3 and Metamask are utilized. The user's private key is used to sign transactions and interact with the smart contracts, while Metamask ensures that the interactions are secure and that the user's private key is protected. This approach offers a secure and decentralized EHR management system, where patients have greater control over their health data, and the records are transparent and immutable.",
