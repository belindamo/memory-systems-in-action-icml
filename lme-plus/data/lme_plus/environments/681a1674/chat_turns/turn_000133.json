  "content": "The eternal conundrum of getting honest feedback from loved ones! It's great that you're testing your material on friends and family, but yes, they can be too nice or biased. Here are some tips to help you get more honest feedback from them:\n\n**1. Ask specific questions:**\nInstead of asking a general \"What did you think?\", ask specific questions like:\n\t* \"What didn't you understand?\"\n\t* \"What made you laugh the most?\"\n\t* \"What felt forced or unnatural?\"\n\t* \"Would you like to hear more about [topic]?\"\n\t* \"Was there a part where you felt lost or confused?\"\n\n**2. Use a \"brutal honesty\" disclaimer:**\nLet them know that you want their honest opinion and that you can handle criticism. You can say something like:\n\t* \"Hey, I want you to be brutally honest with me. If something's not funny, tell me. I can take it.\"\n\t* \"I'm looking for constructive criticism, so don't worry about hurting my feelings.\"\n\n**3. Provide context:**\nGive them context about the type of comedy you're aiming for, your target audience, and what you're trying to achieve with your set. This will help them understand your vision and provide more targeted feedback.\n\n**4. Encourage them to be specific:**\nWhen they do provide feedback, ask them to be specific about what they liked or didn't like. For example, if they say \"I didn't get the joke,\" ask them what specifically didn't make sense or what they thought you could do to improve it.\n\n**5. Seek feedback from multiple sources:**\nDon't rely on just one or two people for feedback. Test your material on different friends, family members, or even online communities (like Reddit's r/standupcomedy) to get a diverse range of opinions.\n\n**6. Look for non-verbal cues:**\nPay attention to their body language and reactions during your performance. Do they seem engaged, confused, or bored? Take note of these non-verbal cues and ask them about their reactions afterward.\n\n**7. Offer incentives:**\nMake it a fun experience for them! Offer to buy them a drink or dinner in exchange for their honest feedback. This can help them feel more invested in providing constructive criticism.\n\n**8. Be open to criticism:**\nRemember that feedback is subjective, and not everyone will like your material. Be open to criticism and use it as an opportunity to learn and improve. Avoid getting defensive or dismissive, as this can discourage them from providing honest feedback in the future.\n\nBy following these tips, you can get more honest and actionable feedback from your friends and family, which will help you refine your material and become a better comedian.",
