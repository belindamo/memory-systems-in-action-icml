However, as a text-based AI model, I don't have real-time access to current prices or the ability to browse websites. But I can give you some tips on how to compare prices effectively:\n\n1. **Use price comparison websites**: Sites like PriceGrabber, Nextag, or Google Shopping allow you to compare prices across different retailers, including Amazon, eBay, and Best Buy.\n2. **Check the official websites**: Visit the official websites of the case brands you're interested in to see their prices and any available promotions.\n3. **Amazon**: Amazon often offers competitive pricing, and you can check prices on different seller listings, including Amazon itself, as well as third-party sellers. Don't forget to check the seller's ratings and reviews.\n4. **eBay**: eBay is another platform where you can compare prices from various sellers. Be cautious of auction prices, and make sure to check the seller's ratings and reviews.\n5. **Best Buy**: Best Buy often has competitive pricing, and you can check their website or visit a physical store to compare prices.\n6. **Discount codes and coupons**: Keep an eye out for discount codes, coupons, or promo codes that can give you a percentage off your purchase.\n7. **Warranty and return policies**: When comparing prices, also consider the warranty and return policies offered by each retailer.\n8. **Shipping costs**: Factor in shipping costs, as they can add up quickly. Look for retailers that offer free shipping or discounted shipping rates.\n\nTo make the comparison process easier, you can create a spreadsheet or table to organize the prices and features of the cases you're interested in. This will help you visualize the differences and make a more informed decision.\n\nRemember to prioritize your needs and preferences when choosing a case, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",
