  "content": "Protini Polypeptide Cream and C-Firma Day Serum are both fantastic products that can make a significant difference in your skin.\n\n**Protini Polypeptide Cream:**\n\n* Use it as a moisturizer, ideally in the morning and/or at night, depending on your skin's needs.\n* Apply a small amount (about a pea-sized amount) to your face and neck, gently massaging it in until absorbed.\n* Protini is a rich, nourishing cream, so you might want to use it as a standalone moisturizer or mix it with a lighter moisturizer if you have oily skin.\n* It's suitable for all skin types, including combination skin, and can help to plump fine lines, improve skin elasticity, and provide long-lasting hydration.\n\n**C-Firma Day Serum:**\n\n* Use it in the morning, as it's designed to provide antioxidant protection and brightening benefits during the day.\n* Apply 2-3 drops to your face and neck, gently massaging it in until absorbed.\n* C-Firma is a lightweight, fast-absorbing serum, so you can use it under your moisturizer, sunscreen, or makeup.\n* It's an excellent product to help brighten and firm the skin, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and provide antioxidant protection.\n\n**Incorporating them into your daily routine:**\n\nHere's a sample routine you can follow:\n\n1. Cleanse your skin with your favorite cleanser.\n2. Toner (optional): Use a toner that suits your skin type to help balance your skin's pH.\n3. C-Firma Day Serum: Apply 2-3 drops to your face and neck, gently massaging it in until absorbed.\n4. Moisturizer: Apply a small amount of Protini Polypeptide Cream to your face and neck, gently massaging it in until absorbed.\n5. Sunscreen: Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30, even on cloudy days.\n6. Makeup (optional): Apply your favorite makeup products.\n\nAt night, you can follow a similar routine, but you might want to consider adding an exfoliant (like T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial) 1-2 times a week to help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores.\n\n**Mixing with existing products:**\n\nYou can definitely mix Protini and C-Firma with your existing products. However, keep in mind that Drunk Elephant products are formulated to work well together, so you might want to consider using them with other Drunk Elephant products to maximize their benefits.\n\nIf you're introducing new products to your routine, it's a good idea to patch test them individually to ensure you don't have any sensitivities or reactions. Start with a small amount and gradually increase as needed.\n\nRemember, the key to getting the most out of these products is to be consistent, patient, and gentle with your skin. Give your skin time to adjust, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns!",
