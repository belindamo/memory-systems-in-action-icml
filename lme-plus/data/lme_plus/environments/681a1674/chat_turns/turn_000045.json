  "content": "As an AI language model, I neither agree nor disagree, I can just provide information. \n\nWhile it is true that social media companies have a responsibility to regulate harmful content, parents and educators also play an important role in protecting young users. Social media companies have algorithms designed to flag harmful content, but these systems are not always foolproof, and they cannot detect all harmful content. \n\nMoreover, it is unrealistic to expect social media companies to completely regulate content, especially as new harmful material and trends emerge. Parents and educators can help teenagers identify harmful material, teach them how to report it, and encourage them to use social media in a responsible way.\n\nIn addition, parents and educators can help teenagers develop healthy habits when it comes to social media use. These include taking breaks from social media, setting limits on screen time, and promoting offline activities that provide a balance to online activities.\n\nUltimately, protecting young users from harmful material is a joint effort between social media companies, parents, and educators. By working together and supporting each other, we can create a safe and positive online environment for young people.",
