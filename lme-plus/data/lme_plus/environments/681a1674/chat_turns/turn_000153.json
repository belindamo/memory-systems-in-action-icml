  "content": "The tourism industry has had a significant impact on the Maldives economy. It contributes to over 28% of the country's GDP and generates employment opportunities for over 60% of the population. The industry also brings in foreign currency, which is crucial for the country's economic growth. \n\nTourism has allowed the Maldives to transform itself from a predominantly fishing-based economy to a service-based one. The industry attracts high-spending visitors and provides employment opportunities in tourism-related sectors such as hospitality, transportation, and retail. The development of the tourism sector has also led to improvements in infrastructure, such as airports, seaports, and telecommunications, which have benefited the entire population.\n\nHowever, the Maldives is vulnerable to external factors such as economic downturns, natural disasters, and political instability, which can affect the number of visitors to the country. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the industry, with a decrease in tourist arrivals, resulting in job losses and revenue losses for the country. The Maldives government has introduced measures to cope with the pandemic's impact on the tourism industry, such as offering financial relief to tourism-related businesses and launching promotional campaigns to attract visitors back to the country.",
