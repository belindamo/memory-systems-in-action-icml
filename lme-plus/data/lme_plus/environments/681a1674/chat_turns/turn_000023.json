Here are some companion plants that can help repel pests or improve the growth of your eggplants:\n\n**Pest-Repelling Companions**\n\n1. **Basil**: Repels aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites, which can be problematic for eggplants. Basil's fragrance can also improve the flavor and aroma of eggplants.\n2. **Marigold**: Repels nematodes, which can harm eggplants, and also deters aphids and whiteflies.\n3. **Nasturtium**: Repels aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that target eggplants. Its bright flowers also attract beneficial insects.\n4. **Radish**: Repels cucumber beetles, which can spread bacterial wilt and other diseases to eggplants.\n5. **Chives**: Repels aphids and other pests, and its onion-like scent can improve the flavor of eggplants.\n\n**Growth-Improving Companions**\n\n1. **Beans**: Provides shade and improves soil nitrogen, which benefits eggplants.\n2. **Borage**: Attracts beneficial insects and improves soil health, leading to healthier eggplants.\n3. **Oregano**: Improves soil health and repels pests, promoting a healthy environment for eggplants.\n4. **Comfrey**: Acts as a fertilizer plant, adding nutrients to the soil that benefit eggplants.\n5. **Dill**: Improves growth and flavor of eggplants, and its tall stems provide a trellis for the plants to climb.\n\n**Other Benefits**\n\n1. **Tomatoes**: Planting tomatoes and eggplants together can improve their growth and flavor, as they have similar growing requirements.\n2. **Herbs like parsley, cilantro, and dill**: These herbs can help to repel spider mites and other pests that target eggplants.\n\nRemember to plant your companions according to their growing requirements and space needs. A general rule of thumb is to plant companions around the perimeter of your eggplant bed or intersperse them among the eggplants.\n\nKeep in mind that while companion planting can be beneficial, it's not a substitute for good gardening practices like crop rotation, proper watering, and pest management. Happy gardening!",
