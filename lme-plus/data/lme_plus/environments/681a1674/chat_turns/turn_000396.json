Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and a relaxing bedtime routine are excellent steps towards improving your sleep.\n\n**The importance of consistency:**\n\nSticking to a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends, helps regulate your body's internal clock and improves the quality of your sleep. It's great that you've been going to bed around 11:30 PM for the past two weeks, except for that one Friday night. Try to minimize those exceptions and aim for a consistent sleep schedule.\n\n**Using a timer for your bedtime routine:**\n\nSetting a timer for your bedtime routine is an excellent idea. This will help you avoid getting too engrossed in your book and staying up too late. Try setting a timer for 20-30 minutes, and when it goes off, start winding down for the night. You can also use a timer to remind you to start your bedtime routine, ensuring you have enough time to relax before sleep.\n\n**Keeping a sleep diary:**\n\nYes, keeping a sleep diary is an excellent idea!
