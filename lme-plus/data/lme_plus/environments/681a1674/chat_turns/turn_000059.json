However, the frequency of your practice may depend on your personal goals, schedule, and level of experience. If you are new to yoga, you may want to start with shorter, less frequent sessions and gradually increase the practice\u2019s length and frequency. Consistency is key, so even if you can only manage a short practice session, try to do it regularly. Remember, yoga is not a competition, and it's essential to listen to your body and practice at your own pace. Consistent yoga practice, coupled with meditation, deep breathing, and other stress reduction techniques, can help alleviate stress and anxiety, promote relaxation, and improve overall well-being.",
