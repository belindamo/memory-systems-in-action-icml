  "content": "Cotton and microfiber are both excellent choices for baby blankets.\n\nWhen it comes to sizing, the ideal blanket size for a baby depends on several factors, including the baby's age, size, and intended use of the blanket. Here are some general guidelines to help you choose the right size:\n\n**Small Blanket (approx. 18\" x 24\" to 20\" x 30\"):**\n\n* Suitable for newborns (0-3 months) or as a stroller blanket.\n* Great for swaddling or as a small, portable blanket.\n\n**Medium Blanket (approx. 24\" x 30\" to 30\" x 40\"):**\n\n* Suitable for infants (3-6 months) or as a crib blanket.\n* Ideal for everyday use, such as during naps or as a playtime blanket.\n\n**Large Blanket (approx. 30\" x 40\" to 36\" x 45\"):**\n\n* Suitable for older babies (6-12 months) or toddlers.\n* Great for use as a toddler blanket or as a blanket for a larger baby.\n\nConsidering you're getting the blanket as a gift for a baby shower, a medium-sized blanket (around 24\" x 30\" to 30\" x 40\") is a great choice. This size is versatile and can be used for both everyday activities and as a crib blanket.\n\nHowever, if you want to get a blanket that will grow with the baby, a larger size might be a better option. Ultimately, the size you choose will depend on your personal preference and the intended use of the blanket.\n\nRemember to check the seller's product description or reviews to ensure the blanket size is accurate and suitable for your needs.",
