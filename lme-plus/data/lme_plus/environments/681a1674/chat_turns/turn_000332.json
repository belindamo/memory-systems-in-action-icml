  "content": "It's understandable that you prefer music that focuses on delivering a clear message or emotion to its audience. There's nothing wrong with having personal preferences when it comes to music, and it's important to seek out the kind of music that speaks to you.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there are many different kinds of music that have a focus on emotional connection or meaningful messages, even within the context of postmodernism or experimental music. Many musicians use experimentation and deconstruction as a way of exploring complex emotions and experiences, or of commenting on social or political issues in a meaningful way.\n\nAt the same time, there are also many musicians who choose not to incorporate postmodern elements into their music-making and instead create music that is focused on straightforward storytelling or emotional expression. Ultimately, the beauty of music is in its diversity - there's something out there for everyone, whether you prefer music that is experimental and challenging or music that is focused on delivering a clear emotion or message.",
