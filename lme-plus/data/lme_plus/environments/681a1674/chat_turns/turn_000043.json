On one hand, social media has connected teenagers with like-minded individuals, providing a space for support, collaboration, and communication. On the other hand, research suggests that social media use is associated with depression, anxiety, and body image issues.\n\nSocial media has created an environment in which teenagers face pressure to present themselves in a particular way, often leading to constant comparison and self-criticism. In addition, exposure to cyberbullying and online hate can contribute to negative mental health outcomes.\n\nTo address these issues, parents and educators can promote a healthy relationship with social media, emphasizing the importance of balance and emotional regulation. Strategies can include setting limits on screen time, monitoring social media use, and encouraging offline activities. Teachers and mental health professionals can also provide education, support, and resources to help teenagers develop healthy coping mechanisms and self-esteem. Lastly, social media platforms can take steps to prevent cyberbullying and foster a positive, non-toxic online community.",
