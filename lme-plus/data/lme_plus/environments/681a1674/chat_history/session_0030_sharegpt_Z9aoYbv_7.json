They commandeered a float, the best float ever, with mermaids and dolphins, renamed it \"Feeling Nauti,\" and made Mardi Gras great again!\n\nTanner and his crew were winners. They threw beads and trinkets, and people loved it. The Wet Bandits tossed water balloons, and it was the most fantastic thing, everybody was drenched and having a great time!\n\nThe police tried to stop them, but Tanner was too smart. He outmaneuvered them, and the Wet Bandits vanished like magic! That night, everyone talked about the legendary Feeling Nauti float. It was the best Mardi Gras, folks, the absolute best, and Dothan will never forget it!"
