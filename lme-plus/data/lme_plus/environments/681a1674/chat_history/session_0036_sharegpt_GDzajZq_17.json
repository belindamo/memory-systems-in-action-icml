      "content": "The passage discusses different modes for retrieving water quality parameters using remote sensing. These modes are the empirical mode, analytical mode, semi-empirical mode, and artificial intelligence mode. The empirical mode uses a statistical regression formula to establish a relationship between water quality parameters and reflectance, while the analytical mode uses bio-optical and radiation transmission models to simulate the propagation of light in the atmosphere and water bodies to describe the relationship between water quality components and the radiance or reflection spectrum. The semi-empirical mode combines the empirical and analytical modes and uses a small amount of in situ data and reflectance or radiance values to calculate water quality variables. The artificial intelligence mode uses neural networks and support vector machines to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships between water quality parameters and sediment deposits."

      "content": "Sure, here are the drawbacks mentioned for each mode:\n\n1. Empirical Mode (EM)\n* Hard for simple empirical models to meet the accuracy requirements of water quality parameters concentration estimation\n* Poor generalities due to regional and temporal constraints\n* Requires a lot of field water quality sampling data as the basis to assure relatively higher accuracy\n2. Analytical Mode (AM)\n* Composition of water body and radiation transmission procedure is rather complex because many factors need to be measured for the model to be established\n* Spectral resolution of most satellite sensors and those measured near the ground are inconsistent, leading to difficulties in model research\n* Quantitative remote sensing inversion based on the analytical mode is difficult to achieve and is limited in practical applications\n3. Semi-Empirical Mode (SEM)\n* None mentioned in the paragraph\n4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Mode\n* Establishing a neural network for water quality retrieval requires a large number of samples to be trained with extensive experiences, otherwise there may be under-learning or over-learning situations, which greatly limit the neural network model inversion accuracy\n* Increase in the number of training samples will make SVM algorithms difficult to implement and run slowly."
