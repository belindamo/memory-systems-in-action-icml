Make this email very motivational and supportive and encouraging that they can follow through this time if they do things differently, which is to change small daily habits and no longer chase the quick fix or the diet without understanding why that diet even work. (hint: it's all based on calorie deficit, but most of them are extreme in deficit and in practicality and the inability to sustain) Hint to the next email being something pertaining to dispelling some of the most common and UNCOMMON myths so they won't want to miss out. Keep in mind all of the rules given prior to this."
