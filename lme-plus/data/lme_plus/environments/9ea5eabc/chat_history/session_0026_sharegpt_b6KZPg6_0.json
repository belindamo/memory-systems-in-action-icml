      "content": "Madam Speaker,\n\nI rise today to express my deep concern about the current government's soft-on-crime approach and its impact on poor and marginalised communities in New Zealand. While the government may think it's being compassionate by reducing sentences and giving offenders a second chance, the reality is that this approach is causing harm and perpetuating cycles of violence and victimisation.\n\nIt's our duty as representatives to protect our citizens from harm, and that means ensuring that our justice system is fair, effective, and delivers meaningful consequences for criminal behaviour. But the current government's policies have created a situation where offenders are being let off with little more than a slap on the wrist, while their victims are left to suffer the consequences.\n\nThis is particularly true for poor and marginalised communities, who are already at a disadvantage in terms of access to resources and support. When offenders are released back into these communities without proper supervision or consequences, it's the vulnerable who suffer the most.\n\nFurthermore, this soft-on-crime approach undermines the hard work of our police force and other law enforcement agencies who are working tirelessly to keep our communities safe. It sends a message that criminal behaviour is acceptable and that there are no real consequences for breaking the law.\n\nMadam Speaker, we need a justice system that is tough on crime and that prioritises the safety of all New Zealanders, not just those who can afford to protect themselves. It's time for this government to take a hard look at its policies and recognise the harm they are causing. We owe it to our citizens to do better, and the National Party will continue to fight for a justice system that is fair, effective, and prioritises the needs of victims and vulnerable communities. Thank you."
