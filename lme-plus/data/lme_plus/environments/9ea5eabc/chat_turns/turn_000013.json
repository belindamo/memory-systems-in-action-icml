The Act granted sweeping powers to intelligence and law enforcement agencies, including the ability to conduct surveillance without warrants. This Act greatly compromised civil liberties and privacy rights in the name of national security.\n2. The National Security Agency (NSA) Wiretapping Program: In 2005, it was revealed that the NSA was conducting wiretapping and data mining operations on the communications of millions of US citizens without a warrant. The NSA claimed these measures were necessary to prevent terrorism, but many viewed them as a violation of privacy rights.\n3. Facebook Data Scandals: In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal came to light, revealing that the political consulting firm had harvested data from millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or consent. This data was then used to influence political campaigns. Facebook\u2019s lack of oversight and action in preventing this breach highlighted the balance between privacy and freedom of expression.\n4. Facial Recognition Technology: Facial recognition technology has become widely implemented in public spaces, including airports, stadiums and retail stores. While this technology can be used to improve security measures, it can also be used to monitor citizens\u2019 movements and activities, leading to concerns around privacy and civil liberties being infringed upon.\n5.

These apps tracked individuals\u2019 movements and interactions, raising concerns about the government using personal data and privacy in the name of public health.",
