This was my school, the place where I had spent the last four years of my life, and the place where I was going to make my dream of starting a school idol club a reality.\n\n\"This is Seika High School,\" I said, turning to my friends Rachel, Madison, Emily, and Samantha. \"It's where we'll be creating our school idol club and performing as school idols.\"\n\nI led them through the main building, pointing out the various classrooms and facilities. \"This is the auditorium where we'll be holding our performances,\" I said, gesturing towards a large, imposing building. \"And over there is the music room where we'll be practicing. It's got all the instruments and equipment we'll need.\"\n\nAs we walked, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. Seika High School was a special place, full of opportunities and possibilities. And I knew that with hard work and dedication, we could create something truly special here.\n\n\"I know it might be difficult to get our school administrator to allow us to create a school idol club, but I believe that with our passion and determination, we can make it happen,\" I said, looking at my friends with a determined expression on my face. \"Are you all with me?\"\n\nThey all nodded eagerly, and I knew that together, we could make our dreams a reality at Seika High School.",
