It's great that you appreciated the attention to detail in the decorations and atmosphere.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you got to see your cousin happy and radiant on her special day. There's something truly special about seeing loved ones experience joy and fulfillment, isn't there? Did you have a chance to catch up with your cousin and chat with her about her big day, or was it more of a whirlwind celebration?\n\n(By the way, I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I'm happy to chat with you about yours!)",
