  "content": "Yes, having a designated meeting leader or facilitator is an excellent way to keep the remote meeting on track and ensure everyone's engagement. The role of a meeting leader or facilitator includes setting the agenda, keeping the meeting on track, enforcing time limits, creating an inclusive environment and guiding team members to stick to the meeting goals. The meeting leader can also help moderate the discussion, ensure that everyone gets a chance to speak and guide the meeting back to the agenda if the conversation goes off-topic. This person should also ensure that the meeting runs on time and follows a structure that meets the meeting goals. By having a designated meeting leader or facilitator, the team can stay focused and engaged, as well as have a structure to follow that ensures all relevant topics are addressed.",
