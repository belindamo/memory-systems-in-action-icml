My kids are excited to have a bigger backyard and a new room, but they're also going to miss their friends and the familiar surroundings. My spouse is a bit anxious about the logistics of the move and making sure everything goes smoothly, but they're also looking forward to the new opportunities and experiences that come with living in a new home. As for me, I'm feeling a sense of accomplishment and relief that we've finally found a home that fits our needs, and I'm excited to start this new chapter in our lives.",
