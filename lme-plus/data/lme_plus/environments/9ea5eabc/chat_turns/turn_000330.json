  "content": "I'm looking for some tips on how to organize my jewelry box. I have a lot of sentimental pieces and I'm worried about losing something important. Speaking of which, I lost my favorite silver necklace with a small pendant at my friend's birthday party today - it was a gift from my grandmother, so I'm really hoping to find it. Do you have any advice on how to keep my jewelry organized and avoid losing anything else?",
