As a child, I loved Bob the Builder, but if anything, I was his opposite, clumsily breaking everything from serving bowls and vases to my brother\u2019s meticulous LEGO starships. My parents and brother unanimously agreed: I had the rare \u201creverse Midas touch.\u201d Coming from a family of engineers, I was supposed to be naturally good at fixing things. Instead, it quickly proved to not be the case.\n\nWhile I may not have had high mechanical precision, my favorite TV show showed me that building means so much more. It taught me to love building in other, equally important ways: building communities by bringing people together and using innovation and imagination to solve challenging problems in the world.\n\nOne such area that I\u2019ve been interested in working in is edtech. After witnessing the world around me fracture under social isolation, I set out to build YAPA Kids, an organization of high school volunteers dedicated to teaching and inspiring young students. What started simply as a way for me to support a few students quickly reached more of those eager to learn. I realized then the power that technology could have in not just bringing educational access but inspiring younger students to explore their curiosities. Now, I\u2019m engaging with the Collins Institute, a cutting edge educational organization, working to develop personally tailored educational experiences enhanced by AI tools. Technology often takes a long time to permeate the educational space, but the potential is unlimited, and I am excited to continue exploring applications in this area.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen first-hand the impact that technologies that AI are able to have, as a builder. My nature is to tinker, even if I break things, and with machine learning, it\u2019s been no different. Having developed independent projects such as applying NLP topic and sentiment classification to email and computer vision/CNNs to 3D MRI scans, I resonate with the mission and vision of the Technology Innovation Fellows program in seeking to create a community of builders. This past summer, I worked as a Product and Engineering intern at a growth-stage fintech startup, Grata, pioneering the use of deep learning and NLP to make sense of the messy, complex financial information in the world and make it searchable. Being part of a fast-moving company creating innovative products opened my eyes to just how quickly impact can scale and makes me eager to develop the business expertise to do the same with my life.\n\nEqually important, I believe it is important to be involved in the policy and government perspective on technology. In a rapidly advancing world, generalist policymakers will need more and more advanced technology perspectives and government policy is routinely slow to keep up. I\u2019m currently taking a Gov seminar on disruptive technologies and international relations, and have separately spearheaded a white paper on large language models as a research project. My interest in understanding where technology leads us led me to apply for the Harvard Yun Fellows for Revolutionary Thinking program, where I conducted a year-long project into the effects of artificial intelligence on the workforce and economy.\n\nI believe in the power of communities to shape the world. The lack of enough conversation around AI on campus led me to co-found the Harvard AI Group, affiliated with HCS, as a way to create conversation about AI and allow for exchange of ideas. Now, we\u2019re engaging 160+ members in events focusing on the impacts of AI on society, government, and technological advancements. And in just a few weeks, we\u2019re planning to release free access to GPT-4 to the Harvard community to bring the latest technology to campus as one of our latest initiatives.\nThe Undergraduate Technology Innovation Fellows program shapes a broader community of builders, innovators, and students pushing into the realm of imagination in so many interesting directions. For many years, I\u2019ve been involved in learning about technology and its applications, but I want to dive deeper into how I can pursue this entrepreneurial approach to the broader professional world, education, and policy.\n\nThrough this program, I aim to find ways to leverage the newfound potential of technologies including AI to create positive impact in the world, and hope to learn and contribute my experiences as an engaged member of the ongoing conversation on technology at Harvard.",
