  "content": "Caravaggio's art was heavily influenced by the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, as well as the Venetian painters, Titian and Tintoretto. One of his early mentors was the Milanese painter Simone Peterzano, who was a student of Titian. Caravaggio's use of intense, dramatic light and dark contrasts was influenced by his study of the chiaroscuro techniques of the Venetian school, especially the works of Tintoretto. Additionally, Caravaggio drew inspiration from his observation of everyday life and used ordinary people as models for his biblical and mythological figures. This approach to painting, which emphasized realism and naturalism over idealism and allegory, was a major contributing factor to his success and fame during his lifetime.",
