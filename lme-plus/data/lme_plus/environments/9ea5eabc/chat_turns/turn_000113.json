  "content": "This a title of my abstract sent to a conference:\nComparison of the ensemble algorithms with the multiple layer perceptron for classification of groundwater quality.\n\nAnd this is the abstract:\nGroundwater is essential for agriculture, and efforts are being made to improve it. Groundwater quality has been an important topic in the last years and several attempts have been taken to implement contemporary techniques to serve in water quality improvement, machine learning, and deep learning took a big part in that attempts. In this work, we try to judge the suitability of these two approaches in dealing with the tabular data representing the water quality parameters for classification purposes. For that aim we applied a wide range of machine learning algorithms to compare them with the multiple layer perceptron MLP, the dataset used for that involving 6 physiochemical parameters represent the dimensionality of the dataset, to test the accuracy of the deployed algorithms we used the accuracy and the F1 score as evaluation metrics. The results showed that the ensemble methods such as ExtraTreesClassifier and the RandomForestClassifier performed with 90.62% and 89.72% as accuracy, and 90.20% and 89.56% as F1 score, respectively. The Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) underperformed over the dataset, with 86.29% and 85.72% as accuracy and F1 score, respectively. That confirms the superiority of the ensemble algorithms over the artificial neural network in dealing with tabular data.\n\n- Give me the presentation outline.\n- Possible question might be asked.",
