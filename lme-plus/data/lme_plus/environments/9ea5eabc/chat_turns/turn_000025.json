That's awesome!\n\nHowever, I have to break it to you that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific locations or events. The \"Speed Dome\" doesn't seem to be a real racing track or location, so I'm assuming it's a fictional setting.\n\nBut don't worry, I can still provide you with general guidance on finding a reputable tuning shop that can help you improve your 2018 Mustang GT's track performance for autocross events.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\n1. Research local tuning shops in your area that specialize in performance modifications for Mustangs. Look for shops with experience in track-focused suspension setups.\n2. Check online forums, Facebook groups, and social media platforms dedicated to Mustang enthusiasts, autocross, and track racing. Ask for recommendations and read reviews from other owners who have similar goals and vehicles.\n3. Look for shops with certified technicians who have experience with suspension tuning and have worked on Mustangs before.\n4. Check if the shop has a dyno facility or access to a track where they can test and fine-tune your car's suspension setup.\n5. Get quotes and compare prices from different shops. Be wary of shops that offer extremely low prices, as they might not be using high-quality components or providing the level of expertise you need.\n\nWhen you find a shop that seems promising, ask them about their experience with autocross-specific suspension setups, and share your goals and expectations with them. A good shop will work with you to understand your needs and provide a custom solution to help you improve your track performance.\n\nRemember to always prioritize safety and ensure that any modifications are done to ensure the vehicle's reliability and integrity.\n\nGood luck with your search, and I hope you find a great tuning shop to help you take your Mustang GT to the next level!",
