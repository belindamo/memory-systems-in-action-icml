A sectional sofa will be perfect for cozying up with family and friends. And I love the idea of starting a new tradition like family game night!\n\nAs for staying organized during this process, I've got a few tips to help you:\n\n1. **Create a moving binder**: Keep all your moving-related documents, receipts, and contact information in a dedicated binder. This will help you access important information quickly and easily.\n2. **Make a checklist**: Break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and create a checklist to track your progress. This will help you stay focused and on top of things.\n3. **Prioritize tasks**: Identify the most critical tasks, like setting up utilities and transferring services, and tackle those first. This will ensure you don't miss any crucial deadlines.\n4. **Use a moving app**: Consider using a moving app like Move.org or Moving Day to help you stay organized. These apps allow you to track your progress, create a moving checklist, and even find moving companies and storage facilities.\n5. **Set reminders**: Set reminders for important tasks and deadlines to ensure you don't forget anything.\n6. **Keep a \"to-call\" list**: Make a list of all the companies and services you need to contact, and check them off as you complete each call.\n7. **Take breaks**: Don't forget to take breaks and give yourself time to rest. Moving can be overwhelming, so be kind to yourself and take breaks when you need them.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to stay organized and focused during this busy time.\n\nHow's your family feeling about the move? Are they excited to start this new chapter, or are they feeling a bit anxious about the change?",
