However, I have to clarify that I didn't actually help you remember anything, since I don't have any knowledge about your personal experiences or activities.\n\nIt seems like you were just reminiscing and recalling the details of your own experience. That's perfectly normal, and I'm happy to have been a conversation partner to help you reflect on your memories!\n\nIf you'd like to talk more about your experience at St. Mary's Church or your conversation with Father John, I'm all ears (or rather, all text). I'm here to listen and provide any guidance or support if you need it.",
