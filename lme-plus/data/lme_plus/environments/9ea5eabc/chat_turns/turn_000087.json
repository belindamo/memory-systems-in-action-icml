I do not think that the possession of a vote is a matter for one sex alone.\" (1910)\n\n2. \"Women\u2019s suffrage will be won. It is only a matter of time.\" (1912)\n\n3. \"The Government is sympathetically disposed to the claims of the women.\" (1913)\n\n4. \"We have passed beyond the stage where the discrimination of man against woman can be tolerated.\" (1915)\n\n5. \"I hope that the time is not far distant when the suffrage will be extended to those who help to bear the burdens of the state, to those who have served it in the field, and to those who have laboured for it in the workshop.\" (1917)",
