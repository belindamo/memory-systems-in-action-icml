I've also been researching the trail conditions, weather, and required gear to make sure I'm prepared. I'm planning to start training with my backpack and gear soon to get comfortable with the weight and setup.\n\nSpeaking of gear, I've been thinking about getting a new pair of hiking poles. Do you have any recommendations for lightweight and durable poles that can handle the demands of the Tongariro Alpine Crossing?",
