  "content": "Yes, Lloyd George actively worked to support women's suffrage throughout his political career. As Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lloyd George introduced a proposal for women's suffrage in 1912, which would have given the vote to women who owned property or were married to property owners. Although the proposal was defeated, it demonstrated his support for the cause. In 1913, he gave a speech in support of the suffrage movement and promised to introduce a new suffrage bill if the current one failed. He also worked behind the scenes to persuade other politicians to support the cause. During World War I, Lloyd George became Prime Minister and used his position to push for women's suffrage. In 1918, the Representation of the People Act was passed, giving women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications the right to vote. Overall, Lloyd George was a strong supporter of women's suffrage and worked actively to make it a reality.",
