Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Soy-Ginger Marinade Recipe:**\n\n* 1/2 cup soy sauce\n* 1/4 cup brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n\nCombine all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. You can adjust the amount of ginger and garlic to your taste.\n\n**Applying Korean BBQ Sauce:**\n\nFor the last 10-15 minutes of cooking, you can either brush the Korean BBQ Sauce on the ribs or use a mop sauce. Here's how:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\n1. During the last 10-15 minutes of cooking, brush the Korean BBQ Sauce evenly onto both sides of the ribs.\n2. You can use a basting brush or a spoon to apply the sauce.\n3. Make sure to brush the sauce on in a thin, even layer to prevent the ribs from becoming too saucy.\n\n**Mop Sauce:**\n\n1. Mix the Korean BBQ Sauce with a small amount of water or beer to thin it out (about 1 part sauce to 1 part liquid).\n2. Use a mop sauce tool or a large spoon to apply the thinned sauce to the ribs during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking.\n3. Mop the sauce on in a gentle, sweeping motion to coat the ribs evenly.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If you're using a sweet and sticky Korean BBQ Sauce, you may want to brush it on during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking to prevent the sauce from burning or caramelizing too much.\n* If you prefer a more intense flavor, you can brush the sauce on multiple times during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking.\n* To prevent the sauce from dripping off the ribs, you can place them on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet or a grill mat.\n\nNow, get ready to elevate your rib game with the Soy-Ginger Marinade and Korean BBQ Sauce!",
