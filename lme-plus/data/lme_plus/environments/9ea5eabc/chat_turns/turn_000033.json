As a friendly AI, I need to clarify that I'm not aware of a specific \"Turbocharged event\" or a \"local racing school\" that you're referring to. It seems like we're operating in a fictional scenario.\n\nHowever, I'm glad to hear that you attended a workshop on throttle control and braking techniques, and it helped you improve your skills! That's great!\n\nIt's excellent that you had the opportunity to learn from a professional racing driver, and I'm sure their tips and guidance were invaluable. Improving your acceleration and cornering skills can make a significant difference in your driving performance, and it's awesome that you're taking steps to enhance your skills.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what specific tips or techniques did you learn from the workshop that you found particularly helpful? I'm always curious to hear about people's experiences and what they've learned from driving workshops or racing schools!",
