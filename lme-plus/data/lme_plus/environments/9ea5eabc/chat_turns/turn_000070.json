I've been thinking about taking a few extra days after the family trip to explore on my own, maybe meet up with some friends who live in the area or try some new restaurants.\n\nWhat are some good ways to meet new people while traveling solo? I've heard of apps like Bumble BFF and Meetup, but are there any other ways to connect with fellow travelers or locals?",
