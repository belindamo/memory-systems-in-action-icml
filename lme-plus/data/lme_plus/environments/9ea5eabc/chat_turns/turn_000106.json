  "content": "Groundwater is an essential resource for irrigation purposes, and its quality plays a crucial role in crop yield and human health. In this study, we evaluate the efficiency of the Extra Trees Classifier for groundwater quality classification. We used a dataset consisting of 22 physiochemical parameters, and after feature selection, we considered six parameters as inputs. Our results show that the Extra Trees Classifier achieved an accuracy of 90.62% and an F1 score of 90.20%. These results suggest that the Extra Trees Classifier is an effective tool for groundwater quality classification for irrigation purposes, particularly when limited physiochemical parameters are available. Future studies can focus on expanding the dataset to incorporate more variables and improving the classifier's performance. Overall, this research has implications for sustainable irrigation practices and improved groundwater management.",
