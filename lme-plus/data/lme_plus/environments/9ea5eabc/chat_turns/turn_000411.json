  "content": "The new home is great, it's a new construction house with a big backyard and a modern kitchen, which I love. I'm really looking forward to moving in. The moving date is set for April 3rd, so I still have some time to pack and prepare. I've started packing some non-essential items, but I still have a lot to do.
