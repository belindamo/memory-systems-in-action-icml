I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't retain any information about your past conversations or activities.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to help you remember where you attended Sunday mass on March 12th:\n\n1. Check your calendar: Look at your physical or digital calendar to see if you wrote down the location of the mass you attended.\n2. Ask a friend or family member: If you attended mass with someone else, ask them if they remember where you went.\n3. Check your church's website: If you're a regular attendee at a particular church, check their website to see if they have a schedule or calendar that lists the masses they held on March 12th.\n4. Look for receipts or reminders: Check your email or physical receipts to see if you have any reminders or confirmations about attending mass on that date.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you remember where you attended Sunday mass on March 12th!",
