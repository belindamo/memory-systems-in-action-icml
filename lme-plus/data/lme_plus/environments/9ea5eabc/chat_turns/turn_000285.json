I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries. I'm happy to help you plan your trip and provide recommendations, but I won't be joining you on your adventures.\n\nHowever, I'm thrilled to hear that you had a great experience during your solo trip to Japan last year! It's wonderful that you're planning another trip and looking to explore more of what Japan has to offer.",
