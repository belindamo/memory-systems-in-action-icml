  "content": "One common metric for checking if a distribution follows Zipf's law is the coefficient of determination, also known as the R-squared value. This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (in this case, the settlement size) that can be explained by the independent variable (the rank). A value of 1 indicates that the data follows Zipf's law perfectly, while a value close to 0 indicates that the data does not follow Zipf's law at all.\n\nTo compute the R-squared value for a given dataset, you can use the `lm()` function in R, which fits a linear model to the data. For example, the following code fits a linear model to the data and prints the R-squared value:\n```\n# Fit a linear model to the data\nmodel <- lm(size ~ rank, data = data)\n\n# Print the R-squared value\nprint(summary(model)$r.squared)\n```\nAlternatively, you can plot the data on a log-log scale, as shown in the previous example, and visually inspect the plot to see if the data follows Zipf's law. If the data follows Zipf's law, then the points in the plot should form a straight line. In this case, you can compute the R-squared value by comparing the distances of the points from the line to the distances of the points from the origin. A higher R-squared value indicates that the points are closer to the line, which means that the data follows Zipf's law more closely.\n\nNote that the R-squared value is only one metric for checking if a distribution follows Zipf's law, and it is not the only way to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear model. There are other metrics, such as the mean squared error, that you can use for this purpose. For more information, see the documentation for the `lm()` function and the `summary()` function in R.",
