It's a big change, and it's natural to feel both excited and anxious about what's to come.\n\nIt's great that your kids are looking forward to the positive aspects of the move, like having a bigger backyard and a new room. It's also understandable that they'll miss their friends and familiar surroundings. As a parent, it's wonderful that you're acknowledging their feelings and validating their emotions.\n\nYour spouse's concerns about the logistics of the move are valid, but it's great that they're also focusing on the positive aspects of the move. And I'm sure they'll be a huge help in making sure everything goes smoothly.\n\nAs for you, it's amazing that you're feeling a sense of accomplishment and relief. You've worked hard to find a home that fits your family's needs, and it's a huge accomplishment. You should be proud of yourself!\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time and to acknowledge that it's a big change for everyone. But with time, patience, and support, your family will adjust to the new home and make it your own.\n\nWhat are your plans for helping your kids adjust to the move and make new friends in the area? Are you considering enrolling them in any local clubs or activities to help them meet new people?",
