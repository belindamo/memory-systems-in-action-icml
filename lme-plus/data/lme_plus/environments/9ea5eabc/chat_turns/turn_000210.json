I'd be happy to help with both what to wear and RSVP etiquette.\n\n**What to Wear to a Wedding:**\n\n1. **Dress Code**: Check the invitation for a dress code or ask the couple if you're unsure. Common dress codes include:\n\t* Black Tie: Formal attire, think tuxedos and evening gowns.\n\t* White Tie: Ultra-formal, typically requiring a tailcoat and a top hat.\n\t* Formal: Suits and ties for men, cocktail dresses or formal gowns for women.\n\t* Semi-Formal: Suits and dresses, but not as formal as black tie.\n\t* Casual: Dressy casual, think nice pants and a blouse or a dressy skirt.\n2. **Consider the Time of Day**: If the wedding is during the day, opt for lighter colors and fabrics. For an evening wedding, you can choose darker, more formal attire.\n3. **Think About the Venue**: If the wedding is outdoors, consider the terrain and weather. If it's a beach wedding, you may want to wear sandals or wedges. For a church or formal venue, opt for more conservative shoes.\n4. **Don't Upstage the Bride**: Avoid wearing anything too flashy or attention-seeking. You want the focus to be on the happy couple, not your outfit.\n5. **Be Comfortable**: You'll likely be standing, dancing, and socializing, so make sure your outfit is comfortable and allows you to move freely.\n\n**RSVP Etiquette:**\n\n1. **Respond Promptly**: RSVP as soon as possible, but definitely by the RSVP deadline specified on the invitation.\n2. **Use the Provided RSVP Method**: If the invitation includes an RSVP card, use it. If not, respond via email or phone, as specified by the couple.\n3. **Be Clear and Concise**: When responding, include your name, the number of guests attending (if applicable), and any dietary restrictions or special requests.\n4. **Don't Assume a Plus-One**: If the invitation doesn't specifically mention a plus-one, don't assume you can bring a guest. Ask the couple or wait for their response to clarify.\n5. **Don't RSVP for Someone Else**: Only respond for yourself and your invited guests. If someone else is attending with you, they should RSVP separately.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to send a gift or card with a thoughtful message, even if you can't attend the wedding.\n* Be respectful of the couple's wishes and preferences when it comes to attire and RSVPs.\n* If you need to change your RSVP, notify the couple as soon as possible to avoid any inconvenience.\n\nI hope this helps! Enjoy the wedding, and congratulations to the happy couple!",
