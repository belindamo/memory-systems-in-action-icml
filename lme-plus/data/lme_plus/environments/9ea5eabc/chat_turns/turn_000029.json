As a friendly AI, I need to clarify that I'm not aware of a specific Riverside Speedway that you're referring to, and I'm not aware of a \"Turbocharged event\" either. It seems like we're operating in a fictional scenario.\n\nHowever, I can still provide you with general guidance on brake pads and cooling system upgrades, which are important considerations for track driving.\n\n**Brake Pads:**\n\nUpgrading your brake pads to high-performance ones can be a great idea, especially if you're planning to push your Mustang hard on the track. High-performance brake pads are designed to:\n\n1. Provide better stopping power\n2. Withstand higher temperatures\n3. Resist brake fade\n\nIf you're already experiencing brake fade or feeling like your brakes are not performing well, upgrading to high-performance brake pads can make a significant difference.\n\n**Cooling System:**\n\nUpgrading your cooling system can also be beneficial, especially if you're tracking your Mustang regularly. A high-performance cooling system can help:\n\n1. Keep your engine temperatures in check\n2. Prevent overheating\n3. Improve overall engine reliability\n\nIf you're planning to push your Mustang hard on the track, a high-performance cooling system can help ensure that your engine stays within a safe operating temperature range.\n\n**General Advice:**\n\nBefore making any upgrades, consider the following:\n\n1. Assess your current setup: Evaluate your Mustang's current performance and identify areas that need improvement.\n2. Research and choose the right upgrades: Select upgrades that are designed for track use and suitable for your vehicle.\n3. Consult with experts: Reach out to experienced track drivers, mechanics, or tuners for guidance on the best upgrades for your specific needs.\n4. Prioritize safety: Always prioritize safety over performance. Ensure that any upgrades you make do not compromise your vehicle's safety features.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",
