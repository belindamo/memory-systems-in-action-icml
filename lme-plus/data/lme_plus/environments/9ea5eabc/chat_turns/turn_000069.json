Allowing yourself some personal freedom and autonomy can actually help you recharge and be a more engaged and present family member.\n\nFor your next trip, you might consider having an open and honest conversation with your family about your needs and desires. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey everyone, I love spending time with you all, but I also want to make sure I have some time to myself to explore and do some shopping. Would it be okay if I take a few hours on [insert day] to do my own thing? I promise to meet up with you all for dinner/lunch/etc. and share my adventures with you.\"\n\nBy communicating your needs and setting clear boundaries, you can find a balance that works for everyone.\n\nAnd who knows, you might even discover some new hidden gems in Waikiki that you can share with your family on your next trip!\n\nDo you think you'll plan any solo excursions or activities on your next family trip, or are there any other travel goals you're hoping to achieve?",
