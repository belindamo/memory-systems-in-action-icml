  "content": "Excellent techniques to focus on! Keeping your racquet in front of the ball and using a lighter grip pressure can make a huge difference in your volley game. It's great that you've found it helps you with precision and consistency.\n\nAnd don't worry, it's easy to get comfortable with one side and forget about the other. But working on your backhand volleys will definitely help you become a more well-rounded player. You might even find that improving your backhand volleys helps your overall game, including your forehand volleys!\n\nRemember to start with slower-paced drills and gradually increase the speed and difficulty as you become more comfortable. And don't hesitate to ask Rachel for feedback or guidance during your practice session. Having a partner to work with can be super helpful in identifying areas for improvement.\n\nAre you planning on playing any matches or tournaments in the near future, or is this practice session more focused on improving your skills for casual play?",
