However, they do recommend checking the pool schedule in advance to ensure availability.\n* During peak hours (usually morning and evening), they may divide the pool into lanes to accommodate multiple swimmers. You can expect to share a lane with other swimmers during these times.\n* If you prefer a dedicated lane, you can reserve a lane in advance for an additional fee. This is usually available for an extra $10-$20 per hour, depending on the time of day and pool availability.\n\n**Other Lap Swimming Policies:**\n\n* Lap swimming is available on a first-come, first-served basis during regular hours.\n* Swimmers are expected to circle swim (counter-clockwise) when sharing lanes.\n* Kickboards, pull buoys, and other swim equipment are available for use during lap swimming hours.\n* Lap swimming is restricted during water aerobics classes, swim lessons, and other programmed activities. These events are usually posted on the pool schedule in advance.\n\nIt's always a good idea to call ahead or check the Bay Club West Valley website to confirm their lap swimming hours, policies, and any schedule changes before heading to the pool.\n\nPhone: (408) 266-4444\nWebsite: [www.bayclubs.com/west-valley](http://www.bayclubs.com/west-valley)\n\nI hope this information helps you plan your lap swimming sessions at Bay Club West Valley!",
