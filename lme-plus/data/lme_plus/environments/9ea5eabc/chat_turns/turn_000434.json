You can consider them as \"digital coupons\" or \"discount codes\" and store them alongside your physical coupons.\n\nHere are a few ways to incorporate these digital discounts into your binder:\n\n1. **Print them out**: If you have a physical copy of the discount code or coupon, you can print it out and add it to your binder.\n2. **Take a screenshot**: If the discount is only available digitally, take a screenshot of the email or webpage and print it out or save it to a digital file.\n3. **Write it down**: If you don't have a physical copy, simply write down the discount code, expiration date, and any relevant details (e.g., minimum purchase required) on an index card or a piece of paper and add it to your binder.\n\nBy including these digital discounts in your binder, you'll have a comprehensive collection of all your savings opportunities in one place. This will help you:\n\n* Keep track of expiration dates and avoid missing out on deals\n* Easily find the discounts you want to use when you're planning a shopping trip\n* Make the most of your savings by combining physical coupons with digital discounts\n\nWhen organizing these digital discounts, you can create separate sections or tabs in your binder for:\n\n* Digital coupons (e.g., email coupons, app-exclusive deals)\n* Discount codes (e.g., promo codes, percentage-off coupons)\n* Loyalty program rewards (e.g., points, rewards, cashback offers)\n\nRemember to update your binder regularly to ensure it remains organized and useful. Remove expired coupons and discounts, and add new ones as you receive them.\n\nBy including both physical coupons and digital discounts in your binder, you'll have a powerful tool to help you save money and stay on top of your shopping game!",
