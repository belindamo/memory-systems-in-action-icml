  "content": "rewrite, but instead of delving deeper into those solutions we already gave, let's talk about them putting those solutions to work or good use or to action in this email and a few motivational style recommendations to start taking action. no need to do alternatives at all. let's just give email 1 in this outline, which is technically email 2 for me, one email which is on a deep dive of implementation of good habits and practices to get fit instead of either doing nothing with the information we gave them or option B, chasing the next diet, meal plan, or 5 lb weight loss to rejoice over. Make this email very motivational and supportive and encouraging that they can follow through this time if they do things differently, which is to change small daily habits and no longer chase the quick fix or the diet without understanding why that diet even work. (hint: it's all based on calorie deficit, but most of them are extreme in deficit and in practicality and the inability to sustain) Hint to the next email being something pertaining to dispelling some of the most common and UNCOMMON myths so they won't want to miss out. Keep in mind all of the rules given prior to this.",
