  "content": "The original Globe Theatre was built in 1599 by Shakespeare\u2019s playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. It was located in the Southwark district of London, on the southern bank of the River Thames.\n\nAfter a dispute with the landlord of their previous home, the Theatre, the Lord Chamberlain's Men dismantled the old building and transported the timbers across the river to construct the new theatre. The Globe was a round, open-air amphitheatre that could hold up to 3,000 people, with the stage area jutting out into the middle of the audience.\n\nThe Globe quickly became the most famous theatre in London, hosting many of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, as well as works by other playwrights. It was also visited by King James I, who was a fan of the company\u2019s performances.\n\nIn 1613, during a performance of Henry VIII, a cannon shot set fire to the thatched roof of the theatre, and the entire building burned to the ground. Miraculously, no one was killed, and the company immediately began plans to rebuild the theatre.\n\nThe new Globe was constructed on the same site, using as many of the original materials as possible. However, it was not as successful as the original, and was eventually closed in 1642 by the Puritan government. The building was then demolished, and the site was used for housing.\n\nIn the 20th century, an American actor and director named Sam Wanamaker began plans to rebuild the Globe Theatre as a new arts complex. His vision was to recreate the experience of an authentic Elizabethan theatre. The new Globe Theatre opened in 1997, located just a short distance from the site of the original theatre. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction, hosting performances of Shakespeare\u2019s plays and other works year-round.",
