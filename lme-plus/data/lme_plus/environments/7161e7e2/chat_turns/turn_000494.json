  "content": "During the formation of a triple bond, carbon undergoes sp hybridization. In sp hybridization, one s orbital and one p orbital combine to form two sp hybrid orbitals. These two sp hybrid orbitals are oriented in a linear arrangement, with an angle of 180 degrees between them. One of these orbitals forms a sigma bond with another atom, and the other two form two pi bonds with another atom. Therefore, in a triple bond, one sigma bond is formed by overlap of the sp hybrid orbital with another atomic orbital, and two pi bonds are formed by overlap of the two unhybridized p orbitals with two other atomic orbitals.",
