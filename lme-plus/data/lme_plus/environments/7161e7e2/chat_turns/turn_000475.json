  "content": "The Arab conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE is considered the first historical event involving Arabs and Jews in the land of Israel. However, the nature of the conflict at the time was not specifically defined as a conflict between Arabs and Jews, but rather as a conflict between different religious and political groups. The history of the region is complex and there were likely many smaller conflicts and incidents between Jews and Arabs over the centuries. The Safed incident in 1660, which we discussed earlier, is considered one of the earliest recorded incidents that specifically involved violence between Jews and Arabs in the region.",
