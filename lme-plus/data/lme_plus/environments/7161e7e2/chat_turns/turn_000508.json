That's a great accomplishment, and it's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more confident in your practice.\n\nIf you enjoyed Yin Yoga, you may like other classes that focus on deep stretches, relaxation, and mindfulness. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Restorative Yoga**: This class focuses on relaxation and rejuvenation. You'll use props to support your body in gentle, restorative postures, allowing you to fully relax and unwind.\n2. **Hatha Yoga**: A traditional and gentle style of yoga that focuses on physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama). Hatha classes often include slower-paced flows, deep stretches, and relaxation.\n3. **Yoga Nidra**: A guided meditation class that takes you into a deep state of relaxation, often referred to as \"yogic sleep.\" You'll lie down or sit comfortably, and the instructor will guide you through a series of relaxing visualizations and breathwork.\n4. **Slow Flow or Gentle Flow Yoga**: These classes are slower-paced than traditional Vinyasa Flow classes and focus on linking movement with breath, deepening into stretches, and cultivating relaxation.\n5. **Anusara-Inspired Yoga**: This style of yoga emphasizes positive thinking and self-acceptance. Classes often include gentle flows, deep stretches, and relaxation, with a focus on inner awareness and self-expression.\n6. **Svaroopa Yoga**: A gentle, therapeutic style of yoga that focuses on releasing tension in the spine, hips, and legs. Classes often include deep stretches, relaxation, and breathing techniques.\n7. **Kundalini Yoga**: While Kundalini Yoga can be more dynamic, some classes focus on gentle, restorative postures, breathing techniques, and meditation to promote relaxation and inner awareness.\n\nWhen searching for classes, look for keywords like \"relaxation,\" \"gentle,\" \"restorative,\" or \"deep stretch\" to find classes that align with your preferences. You can also ask your yoga studio or instructor about their teaching style and what to expect in their classes.\n\nRemember to always listen to your body and honor its limitations, especially when trying new classes or styles. Enjoy exploring these options, and congratulations again on mastering tree pose!",
