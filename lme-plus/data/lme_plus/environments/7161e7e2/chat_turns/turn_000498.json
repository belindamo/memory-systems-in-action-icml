  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. When carbon is sp hybridized, it can form 2 sigma and 2 pi bonds.\n\nIn sp hybridization, one s and one p orbital combine to form two sp hybrid orbitals, which are oriented at an angle of 180 degrees to each other. These two hybrid orbitals form sigma bonds with two other atoms, while the two unhybridized p orbitals form two pi bonds with two other atoms.\n\nSo, in summary, sp hybridized carbon can form two sigma bonds and two pi bonds.",
