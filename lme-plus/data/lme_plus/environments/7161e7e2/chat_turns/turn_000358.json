  "content": "Roasting broccoli and sweet potatoes is a fantastic way to bring out their natural sweetness and add depth to your quinoa salad. Here's a simple recipe to roast them in the oven:\n\n**Basic Roasting Method**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven**: Set your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n2. **Chop the vegetables**: Cut the broccoli into florets and the sweet potatoes into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes.\n3. **Toss with oil and seasonings**: In a bowl, toss the broccoli and sweet potatoes with:\n\t* 2 tablespoons of oil (olive, avocado, or grapeseed work well)\n\t* Salt and pepper to taste\n\t* Any other desired seasonings (e.g., garlic powder, paprika, or dried herbs like thyme or rosemary)\n4. **Spread on a baking sheet**: Spread the vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n5. **Roast in the oven**: Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and lightly caramelized.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* **Shake the pan**: Halfway through the roasting time, shake the baking sheet to redistribute the vegetables and promote even roasting.\n* **Add aromatics**: Toss in some sliced onions, garlic cloves, or lemon wedges with the vegetables for added flavor.\n* **Spice it up**: Add a pinch of cumin, coriander, or smoked paprika to give your roasted vegetables a smoky or spicy flavor.\n* **Don't overcrowd**: Make sure to leave some space between the vegetables to allow for even roasting. If necessary, use multiple baking sheets.\n\nFor broccoli, you can also try:\n\n* **High-heat roasting**: Roast at 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, or until tender and slightly charred.\n* **Steaming**: Steam the broccoli florets for 3-5 minutes before roasting to help retain their bright green color.\n\nFor sweet potatoes, you can also try:\n\n* **Higher heat**: Roast at 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n* **Maple syrup glaze**: Drizzle with a mixture of maple syrup, olive oil, and spices during the last 10 minutes of roasting for a sweet and sticky glaze.\n\nNow, simply chop the roasted broccoli and sweet potatoes into bite-sized pieces and add them to your quinoa salad. Enjoy!",
