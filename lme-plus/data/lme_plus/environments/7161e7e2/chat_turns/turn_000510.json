  "content": "Restorative Yoga is a wonderful way to cultivate deep relaxation, rejuvenation, and awareness. Here's more information to help you understand what to expect:\n\n**What is Restorative Yoga?**\n\nRestorative Yoga is a gentle, therapeutic style of yoga that involves using props to support the body in relaxing postures, allowing for deep relaxation, rejuvenation, and restoration. The focus is on relaxation, rather than physical exertion or flexibility. This practice is inspired by the teachings of B.K.S. Iyengar and has been popularized by Judith Hanson Lasater.\n\n**Common Props Used:**\n\n1. **Bolsters**: Long, cylindrical pillows used to support the body, often under the knees, back, or chest.\n2. **Blankets**: Used to provide warmth, comfort, and support for the body.\n3. **Blocks**: Used to support the body in various postures, such as under the hips, back, or shoulders.\n4. **Straps**: Used to help deepen the stretch or maintain alignment in certain postures.\n5. **Pillows**: Used to support the head, neck, or back.\n6. **Weighted blankets**: Used to provide a calming, grounding sensation.\n\n**How it Differs from Yoga Nidra:**\n\nWhile both Restorative Yoga and Yoga Nidra are relaxation-focused practices, there are some key differences:\n\n1. **Physical Postures:** Restorative Yoga involves holding gentle, supported postures for extended periods, whereas Yoga Nidra is typically practiced lying down or sitting comfortably, with minimal movement.\n2. **Level of Consciousness:** Yoga Nidra is a guided meditation practice that aims to induce a deep state of relaxation, often referred to as \"yogic sleep.\" Restorative Yoga, while relaxing, is more focused on physical relaxation and rejuvenation, with the practitioner remaining in a state of gentle awareness.\n3. **Duration:** Restorative Yoga classes typically last 60-90 minutes, with each posture held for 5-20 minutes. Yoga Nidra classes can be shorter, lasting 30-60 minutes.\n4. **Focus:** Restorative Yoga focuses on physical relaxation, rejuvenation, and restoration, while Yoga Nidra focuses on deep relaxation, visualization, and conscious awareness.\n\n**What to Expect in a Restorative Yoga Class:**\n\n1. A gentle, calming atmosphere, often with soft music and dim lighting.\n2. A series of 5-7 postures, held for 5-20 minutes each, using props to support the body.\n3. Deep breathing techniques and gentle stretches to relax the body and mind.\n4. Minimal movement, with an emphasis on relaxation and rejuvenation.\n5. A sense of calm, relaxation, and rejuvenation upon completion of the class.\n\nRemember to communicate with your instructor about any physical limitations or discomfort, and don't hesitate to ask questions or adjust your props as needed. Enjoy your Restorative Yoga journey!",
