  "content": "That's a great approach! It's always a good idea to communicate with your instructor beforehand, especially when trying something new. They can provide valuable guidance and ensure that you get the most out of your experience.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to try out the weighted blanket! Remember to be open-minded, and don't hesitate to adjust or remove the blanket if you need to. It's all about listening to your body and finding what works best for you.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a wonderful time trying out the weighted blanket in your next Restorative Yoga class. Enjoy the relaxation and rejuvenation!\n\n(And don't forget to share your experience with me afterwards, if you'd like!)",
