You'll need to provide some information about yourself, your vehicle, and your driving history. They'll then provide you with a quote based on their rates and coverage options.\n\nIt's great that you're shopping around for insurance quotes, as it's always a good idea to compare rates and coverage options from different providers. Progressive is a well-established insurer with a reputation for offering competitive rates and a range of coverage options.\n\nRegarding your experience with Geico, it's not uncommon for insurance rates to vary between providers, even for the same vehicle and driver. Progressive may indeed offer better rates for Honda owners, but it's essential to get a quote and compare it to your current rate with Geico.\n\nOn a separate note, it's great to hear that the new car wash soap you used did a great job of removing bug splatters from your front bumper! Keeping your car clean and well-maintained is important for both aesthetic and safety reasons.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help with getting a quote from Progressive, feel free to ask!",
