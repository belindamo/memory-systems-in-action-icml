  "content": "One example of an incident of violence and tension between Jews and Arabs in the region that occurred prior to the 1834 Peasants' Revolt was the 1831-1832 Jerusalem cholera epidemic. This was an outbreak of cholera that swept through Jerusalem and its surrounding areas, killing thousands of people. The epidemic exacerbated existing tensions between Jewish and Arab communities in the region, as both groups blamed each other for the spread of the disease. There were also allegations that Jewish doctors were poisoning the city's water supply in order to spread the disease, which further inflamed tensions. While the epidemic was not exclusively a conflict between Jews and Arabs, the tensions and violence between the two groups played a role in the larger political context of the region at the time.",
