I'm happy to help!\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you get started:\n\n**1. Create a spreadsheet:**\nMake a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel) to keep track of the shows and movies you've watched, including:\n\t* Title\n\t* Streaming service (e.g., Netflix, Disney+, Hulu)\n\t* Date watched\n\t* Rating (if you want to keep track of your opinions)\n\t* Notes (if you want to jot down any thoughts or comments)\n\n**2. Use a habit-tracking app:**\nApps like Habitica, HabitBull, or Loop Habit Tracker allow you to track your daily habits, including your TV watching habits. You can set reminders and customize your tracking to fit your needs.\n\n**3. Take advantage of built-in features:**\nMany streaming services, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, have a \"Watch History\" or \"Recently Watched\" section. Use these to keep track of what you've watched and when.\n\n**4. Utilize online tools and websites:**\nWebsites like Letterboxd (for movies) and TV Time (for TV shows) allow you to log and track what you've watched, rate and review content, and connect with others who share similar interests.\n\n**5. Create a watchlist:**\nMake a list of shows and movies you want to watch, including upcoming releases and recommendations from friends. You can use a note-taking app like Evernote, OneNote, or Simplenote to keep your watchlist organized.\n\n**6. Set reminders:**\nSet reminders for new episodes or seasons of your favorite shows, or for upcoming movie releases. You can use a calendar app or a reminder app like Any.do or Todoist.\n\n**7. Consider a media manager:**\nIf you have a large collection of digital media (e.g., movies, TV shows, music), consider using a media manager like Plex, Kodi, or Emby to organize and track your content.\n\nPick the method that works best for you, or combine a few to create a system that suits your needs. Happy tracking!\n\nDo you have any other questions or need more specific help with setting up a tracking system?",
