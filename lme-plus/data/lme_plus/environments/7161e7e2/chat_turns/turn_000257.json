I've also heard great things about Big Sur and Monterey, so I might want to stop there as well.\n\nAs for activities, I'm definitely interested in hiking and taking in the scenic views, but I'm also open to other ideas. What do you think about whale watching or taking a scenic drive on 17-Mile Drive in Pebble Beach?",
