It's great that you're varied their diet with the frozen brine shrimp and bloodworms, as these can be a nice treat for them. The pellet food from Tetra provides a reliable source of nutrition, and it's good that your fish appreciate it as a regular meal.\n\nFrozen brine shrimp are a popular treat among many fish species, and it's no surprise that your fish go crazy for them! The high protein content and omega-3 fatty acids in brine shrimp make them a nutritious and tasty snack.\n\nThe fact that your fish are more finicky about the frozen bloodworms isn't uncommon. Bloodworms can be a bit more of an acquired taste for some fish, but they're still a great source of protein and iron. You might consider trying different brands or types of bloodworms to see if your fish prefer one over another.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention your fish seem to appreciate the pellet food as a regular meal. This suggests that they're getting used to the routine and are comfortable with the pellets as a staple food. This is great, as a consistent diet can help promote healthy growth and development.\n\nHave you noticed any changes in your fish's behavior or appearance since introducing the varied diet? For example, have their colors become more vibrant, or are they more active and energetic?",
