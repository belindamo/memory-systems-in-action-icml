Descriptive Query: To understand the number of songs added to different playlists on Spotify, you could use the following SQL query:\n\nSELECT COUNT(song\\_id) as total\\_songs, playlist\\_name\nFROM playlist\\_data\nWHERE platform = 'Spotify'\nGROUP BY playlist\\_name\nORDER BY total\\_songs DESC;\n\nThis query would return the number of songs added to each playlist on Spotify, with the playlists ordered by the number of songs in descending order.\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis Query: To understand the relationship between playlist size and the number of streams a song receives on Spotify, you could use the following SQL query:\n\nSELECT AVG(streams) as avg\\_streams, COUNT(song\\_id) as playlist\\_size\nFROM playlist\\_data\nWHERE platform = 'Spotify'\nGROUP BY playlist\\_size\nORDER BY avg\\_streams DESC;\n\nThis query would return the average number of streams for songs added to playlists of different sizes on Spotify, with the playlists ordered by average number of streams in descending order. This query would allow you to understand if there is any correlation between playlist size and song streams.",
