  "content": "Generally, the bond enthalpy increases as bond length decreases, and decreases as bond length increases. This is because shorter bonds have stronger attractions between the atoms, and therefore require more energy to break. Conversely, longer bonds have weaker attractions and require less energy to break. So, if bond length increases, the bond enthalpy usually decreases.",
