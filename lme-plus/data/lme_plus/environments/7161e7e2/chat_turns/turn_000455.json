  "content": "There are different accounts of what happened during the 1810 Nablus Riots, but it is generally believed that the synagogue was built on or near the site of an old Muslim cemetery, which was considered by some to be a desecration of a holy site. Some sources suggest that the cemetery was destroyed to make way for the synagogue, while others suggest that the synagogue was built adjacent to the cemetery without desecrating it. Regardless of the specifics of the situation, the dispute over the synagogue and the cemetery was a major source of tension between the Jewish and Muslim communities in Nablus, and it played a role in the outbreak of violence and the resulting riot.",
