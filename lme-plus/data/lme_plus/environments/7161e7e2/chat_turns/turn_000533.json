  "content": "The Gage is a modern American bistro with a chic atmosphere, but it's still a great spot for a quick lunch. They have a lunch menu that's designed to be served within 30-45 minutes, so you can easily fit in a meal during your break.\n\nAs for seating, The Gage has both indoor and outdoor seating options. Their outdoor patio is a lovely spot to enjoy your meal, especially on a nice day. It's situated along Michigan Avenue, so you'll have great people-watching views. However, keep in mind that outdoor seating is first-come, first-served, so you might want to arrive a bit early to snag a spot.\n\nIf you're short on time, you can also consider ordering at the bar or taking advantage of their \"Express Lunch\" menu, which features a selection of quicker options like sandwiches and salads.\n\nOne more tip: If you're planning to sit down for lunch, I recommend making a reservation, especially if you're short on time. You can book a table through their website or by calling them directly.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll enjoy your lunch at The Gage!",
