  "content": "Non-obviousness is a requirement for a patent that states that an invention must not be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the relevant field of technology.\n\nFor example, consider the invention of a new type of solar panel. If a person having ordinary skill in the field of solar technology could have easily come up with the same invention by using known techniques and technologies, then it would not be considered non-obvious and would not qualify for a patent.\n\nOn the other hand, if the inventor has used a completely new and unique approach to create the solar panel, such as by using a new type of material or a new method of manufacturing, then it would be considered non-obvious and would be eligible for a patent.\n\nAnother example could be a new way of purifying water by using a specific type of bacteria. If a person having ordinary skill in the field of water purification can easily come up with the same process by using known techniques and technologies, it would be considered obvious and would not qualify for a patent.\n\nIn summary, non-obviousness is the requirement that the invention should not be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the relevant field of technology and should be something new, innovative and not derivable by simple experimentation or modification of an existing process or product.",
