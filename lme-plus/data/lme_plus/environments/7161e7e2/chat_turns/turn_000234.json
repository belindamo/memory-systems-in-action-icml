  "content": "One way for a company to ensure competitive compensation without overspending is to conduct market research to determine what other companies in their industry and region are paying for similar positions. They can also consider the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the job to evaluate a fair wage. Another approach is to offer competitive benefits or incentives, like paid time off, remote work options, or health insurance, which can make up for a slightly lower salary. Additionally, companies can offer performance-based compensation, where employees earn additional pay based on their performance and results, which can be motivational for employees and aligned with the company\u2019s goals. Finally, companies can focus on creating a positive and engaging work culture that prioritizes work-life balance, respects employees, and provides opportunities for growth and development, which can also be a way to attract and retain top talent.",
