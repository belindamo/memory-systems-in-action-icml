Indeed, the quote \"never let a good crisis go to waste\" has often been misattributed to Winston Churchill, but there is no solid evidence to support that Churchill ever actually said or wrote those exact words. It's possible that the idea behind the quote has been adapted or paraphrased from other statements made by Churchill, but the specific phrasing is most famously associated with Rahm Emanuel in the context of the 2008 financial crisis.",
