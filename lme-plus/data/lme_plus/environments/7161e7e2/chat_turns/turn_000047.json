  "content": "The objectives of patent law are to encourage innovation and the dissemination of new technologies by providing inventors with a temporary monopoly on the use and commercial exploitation of their inventions.\n\n1. Encourage innovation: Patent law provides inventors with an incentive to invest time and resources into researching and developing new technologies by giving them the exclusive right to profit from their invention for a certain period of time.\n2. Disseminate new technologies: Patent law encourages inventors to disclose their inventions to the public by making a patent application. This allows others to learn from and build upon the invention, which can lead to further innovation and technological progress.\n3. Promote public welfare: Patents are granted only for new, useful, and non-obvious inventions, which helps ensure that only socially beneficial technologies are granted a patent monopoly.\n4. Balance between public and private interest: Patent laws strike a balance between protecting the rights of the inventor and the needs of society by allowing others to use the invention after the patent expires.\n5. Encourage foreign investment: By providing protection for foreign companies' patents in India, the patent law encourages foreign investment in India and also helps Indian companies to protect their patents in other countries.\n6. Protect small and medium enterprises: Patent laws provide small and medium enterprises with the same level of protection as large companies, this helps to promote innovation and competition in the market.\n7. Promote competition: Patents can promote competition by encouraging multiple companies to develop competing technologies and by preventing a single company from dominating a market through the exclusive use of a particular technology.",
