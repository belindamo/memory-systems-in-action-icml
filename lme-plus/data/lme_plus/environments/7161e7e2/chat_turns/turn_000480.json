  "content": "I apologize for any confusion. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the case of a carbon-carbon double bond, the carbon atoms involved are typically sp2 hybridized. This means that one of the carbon atom's 2s orbitals and two of its 2p orbitals hybridize to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals. The remaining 2p orbital is unhybridized and can form a pi bond with the 2p orbital of the other carbon atom. The pi bond is formed by the overlap of the two unhybridized 2p orbitals.\n\nSo to summarize, in the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond, the carbon atoms involved are sp2 hybridized, but there is also an unhybridized 2p orbital involved in the formation of the pi bond.",
