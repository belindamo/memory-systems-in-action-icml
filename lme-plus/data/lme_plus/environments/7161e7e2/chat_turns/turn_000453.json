  "content": "One example of a violent incident between Jews and Arabs in the region that occurred prior to the 1834 Peasants' Revolt was the 1810 Nablus Riots. In 1810, there was a dispute between Jewish and Muslim communities in the city of Nablus over the construction of a synagogue on the site of an ancient Muslim cemetery. The dispute led to a violent confrontation between the two communities, with Muslim rioters attacking and looting Jewish homes and businesses in the city. The violence continued for several days, with both sides suffering casualties. The Ottoman authorities eventually intervened and restored order, but the incident left a lasting legacy of tension and mistrust between the two communities.",
