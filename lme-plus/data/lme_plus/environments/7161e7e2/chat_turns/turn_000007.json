Mixing it up and using relevant, niche hashtags can help you tap into new audiences and increase your visibility.\n\nRemember to research hashtags that are specific to the content of each post, rather than using the same generic hashtags for everything. This will help you attract people who are genuinely interested in the topic you're posting about.\n\nAlso, try to use a mix of popular and niche hashtags. Popular hashtags like #booklover or #bookstagram can get you a lot of visibility, but they're also very competitive. Niche hashtags like #fantasybooks or #romancereaders can help you target a specific audience and get more engagement.\n\nDon't forget to keep track of the performance of your hashtags and adjust your strategy accordingly. You can use Instagram Insights or third-party tools to see which hashtags are performing well and which ones aren't.\n\nAnd hey, since you're mixing up your hashtags, why not try experimenting with some new content formats too? You could try creating Instagram Stories, IGTV videos, Reels, or even Instagram Live sessions to shake things up and keep your audience engaged.",
