  "content": "The salient features of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in India include:\n\n1. Legal Framework: India has a comprehensive legal framework for the protection and enforcement of IPRs, including laws for patents, trademarks, copyrights, and geographical indications.\n2. Patentability: India follows a \"first to file\" system for patent registration and has strict criteria for patentability, including novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability.\n3. Trademark registration: India follows a \"first to use\" system for trademark registration. The Indian Trade Marks Act, 1999, lays down the procedure for registration of trade marks, which is administered by the Trade Marks Registry.\n4. Copyright: Copyright protection in India is automatic and does not require registration. The Copyright Act, 1957, governs the copyright law in India.\n5. Enforcement: India has several mechanisms in place for the enforcement of IPRs, including civil and criminal remedies, and specialised courts and tribunals for the resolution of IPR disputes.\n6. International treaties: India is a signatory to several international treaties and conventions related to IPRs, including the TRIPS Agreement and the Paris Convention.\n7. Intellectual Property Appellate Board: India has set up an Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) to hear and decide appeals against the decisions of the Registrar of Trade Marks, the Controller of Patents and the Registrar of Copyrights.\n8. National IPR policy: In 2016, India came out with a National IPR Policy, which lays down the framework for the overall development and strengthening of the IPR system in the country.\n\nOverall, India has a robust system for the protection and enforcement of IPRs, with a focus on striking a balance between protecting the rights of creators and owners and the larger public interest.",
