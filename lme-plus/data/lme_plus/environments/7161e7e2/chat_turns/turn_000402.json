Listening to podcasts is a great way to pass the time and even learn something new or entertaining. It's amazing how much more enjoyable the commute can be when you're engaged in something you enjoy.\n\nIt's also great that you've gotten comfortable with the route, which can make a big difference in reducing stress and anxiety. Knowing the route like the back of your hand can give you a sense of control and confidence, especially during times when the train is delayed or there are unexpected changes.\n\nSpeaking of podcasts, what kind of podcasts have you been listening to during your commute? Are you a fan of true crime, comedy, or educational podcasts?\n\nAnd how's the meeting you were worried about? Did you end up being late, or did you manage to make it on time?",
