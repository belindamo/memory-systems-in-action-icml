The Fontainebleau in Miami sounds like an amazing place to relax and unwind, and I'm sure you must have had a wonderful time there.\n\nBut anyway, back to your current trip in Chicago! I hope you have a great time at The Gage and enjoy the rest of your conference. If you need any more recommendations or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",
