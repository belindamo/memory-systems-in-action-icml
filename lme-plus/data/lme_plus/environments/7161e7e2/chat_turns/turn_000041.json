  "content": "Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce. Intellectual property rights are legal rights granted to creators, inventors and owners of such creations, to prevent others from using or reproducing them without their permission.\n\nThere are several types of intellectual property, which can be broadly categorized into four main groups:\n\n1. Patent: A patent is a legal monopoly granted to an inventor for a certain period of time, usually 20 years, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. Patents are granted for new, useful and non-obvious inventions, such as machines, processes, and chemical compositions.\n2. Trademark: A trademark is a symbol, name, or logo that is used to identify and distinguish a company's products or services from those of other companies. Trademarks can include words, logos, or other distinctive marks.\n3. Copyright: Copyright is a legal right that protects original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as books, plays, songs, and paintings. It also includes computer software, films, and photographs.\n4. Trade secrets: Trade secrets refer to information, such as a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that is used in business, and that gives the business an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Trade secrets are protected by law, but the protection is not granted by registration, like patents or trademarks.\n\nThese are the main classification of Intellectual properties. However, there are other forms of IP such as geographical indication, industrial design, layout-design of integrated circuits, Plant variety protection etc.",
