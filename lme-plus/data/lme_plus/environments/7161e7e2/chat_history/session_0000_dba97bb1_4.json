It's shorter, more concise, and has a higher usage rate (12 million+ uses vs. 6 million+ uses for #bookrecommendations).

By the way, I was thinking about my Instagram posts and I realized that I've been using the same set of hashtags for all my posts, so I decided to do some research and find some new ones to mix it up."

      "content": "That's a great idea! Using the same set of hashtags for all your posts can lead to a plateau in engagement and reach. Mixing it up and using relevant, niche hashtags can help you tap into new audiences and increase your visibility.\n\nRemember to research hashtags that are specific to the content of each post, rather than using the same generic hashtags for everything. This will help you attract people who are genuinely interested in the topic you're posting about.\n\nAlso, try to use a mix of popular and niche hashtags. Popular hashtags like #booklover or #bookstagram can get you a lot of visibility, but they're also very competitive. Niche hashtags like #fantasybooks or #romancereaders can help you target a specific audience and get more engagement.\n\nDon't forget to keep track of the performance of your hashtags and adjust your strategy accordingly. You can use Instagram Insights or third-party tools to see which hashtags are performing well and which ones aren't.\n\nAnd hey, since you're mixing up your hashtags, why not try experimenting with some new content formats too? You could try creating Instagram Stories, IGTV videos, Reels, or even Instagram Live sessions to shake things up and keep your audience engaged."

It's a great way to give your followers a peek into your creative process and make them feel like they're part of the conversation.\n\nSome ideas for Instagram Story content:\n\n* Sneak peeks of your #BookClubChat prep: Share snippets of you reading the book, making notes, or preparing questions.\n* Post-chat thoughts: Record a quick video or write a caption sharing your thoughts on the discussion, what you learned, or what you're looking forward to in the next chat.\n* Q&A sessions: Host mini Q&A sessions in your Stories, answering questions from followers or discussing topics related to the chat.\n* Behind-the-scenes of your content creation: Share snippets of you writing, editing, or designing content related to the chat.\n\nAs for IGTV, it's perfect for more in-depth content, like book reviews or author interviews. Here are some ideas:\n\n* Book reviews: Record a video review of the book, discussing your thoughts, opinions, and feelings. You could even include footage of you reading the book or flipping through the pages.\n* Author interviews: Reach out to authors or publishing houses to schedule interviews, which you can record and share on IGTV.
