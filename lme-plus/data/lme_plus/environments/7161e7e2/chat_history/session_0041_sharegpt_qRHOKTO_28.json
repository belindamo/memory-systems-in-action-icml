      "content": "The Great Manager Institute (GMI) and Coforge have similar goals in their leadership development programs, which is to help managers improve their skills and drive business outcomes. However, there are several key differences in the design and implementation of the two programs.\n\nGMI's program is divided into several phases such as pre-work, workshops, action planning, and impact assessment and is available for both less than 100 managers and at least 100 managers. The program for less than 100 managers lacks certain activities and resources, particularly in the pre-work, workshops, and action planning phases and also the cost of the program varies greatly between less than 100 managers and at least 100 managers.\n\nCoforge's program on the other hand is designed to develop top leadership within the company for CXO level roles, it has a specific 2-month long intervention that includes face-to-face programs, weekly online retention modules and activity-based & simulation-based classroom programs.\n\nIn terms of evaluation, Coforge's program also includes a follow-up with the participants after six months to analyse the business impact, whereas GMI's program is not specified in terms of follow-up.\n\nIn summary, GMI's program is more comprehensive and covers more phases with different resources and cost for less than 100 managers and at least 100 managers, whereas Coforge's program is more specific in terms of intervention and duration, with a more specific follow-up on the impact of the program."
