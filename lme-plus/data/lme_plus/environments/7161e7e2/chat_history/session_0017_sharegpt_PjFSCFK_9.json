      "content": "The long-term return on investment (ROI) for investors in a project like this can come from several sources, and the appeal often lies in the growth potential and profitability of the platform. Here are some factors that can contribute to the long-term ROI and appeal to investors:\n\n1. Revenue generation: As the platform grows and attracts more developers and gamers, various revenue streams can be established, including microtransactions, in-game advertising, subscription fees, and sales of digital assets. The platform's revenue growth can lead to an increase in the overall value of the company, providing long-term returns for investors.\n2. Platform expansion: As more games are added to the platform, the user base can grow, leading to increased engagement and spending on the platform. This expansion can contribute to the long-term success of the company, which can, in turn, benefit investors.\n3. IP licensing and partnerships: As the Newerth IP becomes more popular, there may be opportunities to license the IP to other companies for merchandise, media adaptations, or collaborations with other game developers. These licensing deals can generate additional revenue streams for the company, which can contribute to the long-term ROI for investors.\n4. Exit strategies: If the platform becomes successful, it may attract the attention of larger companies interested in acquiring the business, which could provide investors with an exit opportunity and a return on their investment. Alternatively, the company could consider going public through an IPO, which could provide liquidity for investors.\n\nTo maintain creative control over the platform and collaborate with investors, you can structure the investment deal to ensure that you retain a certain level of decision-making power. This can be achieved by negotiating the terms of the investment, such as the percentage of ownership and voting rights that the investor receives.\n\nWhen seeking investment, it's essential to present a comprehensive business plan that outlines your vision, target market, competitive analysis, marketing strategy, and financial projections. By demonstrating the potential for growth and profitability, you can increase the appeal of your project to potential investors. Additionally, communicating your desire to maintain creative control and outlining your requirements for backend funding and support can help you find investors who share your vision and are willing to collaborate on your terms."
