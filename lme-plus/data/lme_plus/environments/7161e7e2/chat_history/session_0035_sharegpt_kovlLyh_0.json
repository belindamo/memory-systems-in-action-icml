The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nBelow is the payment determinzation algotrhism for an healthcare alternative payment model. I need you to write Stata code to create a dataset with simulated ACR, UAMCC, and DAH measure scores. the ACR measure has 1010 observations, following a normal distribution ranging from 14 to 17; the UAMCC measure has 1005 observations, following a uniform distribution ranging from 45 to 85; the DAH measure has 1000 observations, ranging from 250 to 350 following a normal distribution. The variable that captures unique healthcare org ID is DCE\\_ID. Please make sure none of the DCE has all the three measure scores missing. Then create a Stata code to apply to this simulated dataset, to compute the Final Earn-Back Rate for every DCE. If a DCE has missing scores for all relevant quality measures, give them a P4P score=missing. Please use the benchmark information in \"Table 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\"\n -------For PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final\n \n\nreconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1."
