If necessary, use multiple baking sheets.\n\nFor broccoli, you can also try:\n\n* **High-heat roasting**: Roast at 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, or until tender and slightly charred.\n* **Steaming**: Steam the broccoli florets for 3-5 minutes before roasting to help retain their bright green color.\n\nFor sweet potatoes, you can also try:\n\n* **Higher heat**: Roast at 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n* **Maple syrup glaze**: Drizzle with a mixture of maple syrup, olive oil, and spices during the last 10 minutes of roasting for a sweet and sticky glaze.\n\nNow, simply chop the roasted broccoli and sweet potatoes into bite-sized pieces and add them to your quinoa salad.
