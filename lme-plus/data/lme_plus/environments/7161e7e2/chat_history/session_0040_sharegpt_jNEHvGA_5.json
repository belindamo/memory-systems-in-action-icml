      "content": "Create a five-day meal plan for someone unskilled in preparing food. Only use things that can be found easily in a Norwegian grocery store such as Rema 1000. Each day should have: breakfast, lunch, dinner and evening meal. No meal except maybe dinner should take more than 8 minutes to prepare. For each day, add a shopping list for the next day. Try to limit the amount of different things I need to buy. Reuse ingredients if possible. Avoid anything vegan. Avoid tuna. Avoid tomatoes. Avoid croutons. Avoid beans. Avoid turkey. Avoid chocolate. Avoid greek yoghurt. If instructions are ambiguous, let me know."
