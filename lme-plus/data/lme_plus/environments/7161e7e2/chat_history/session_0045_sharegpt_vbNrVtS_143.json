Checker users can also add comments for each label.\n* Page number and total number of pages: Displays the page number and total number of pages in the document.\n\nUser flows\n----------\n\nThe Annotation screen supports the following user flows:\n\n* Tagger annotation flow:\n\t1. Tagger selects a classification for the document.\n\t2. Tagger chooses labels from the relevant list and places them on the document.\n\t3. Tagger adjusts the position, size, and shape of the labels as needed.\n\t4. Tagger edits the name and description of the labels as needed.\n\t5. Tagger changes the color of the labels as needed.\n\t6. Tagger saves their annotation progress.\n* Checker review flow:\n\t1. Checker reviews the labels that have been placed on the document by Tagger users.\n\t2. Checker approves or rejects each label.\n\t3. Checker modifies the labels if necessary.\n\t4. Checker adds comments for each label.\n\t5. Checker submits their review.\n\nUse cases\n---------\n\nThe Annotation screen supports the following use cases:\n\n* Tagger annotation: Tagger users can classify and annotate documents with labels.\n* Checker review: Checker users can review and verify the annotations made by taggers.\n* Label modification: Tagger and Checker users can edit the name and description of labels, and change their color.\n* Label approval/rejection: Checker users can approve or reject labels. Rejected labels are sent back to the Tagger user for modification.\n* Commenting: Tagger and Checker users can add comments for each label.\n* Navigation: Tagger and Checker users can navigate between pages in the document, and jump to specific pages or headings using the document outline.\n* Annotation history: Tagger and Checker users can view the history of changes for each label on the document."

      "content": "Limitations\n-----------\n\nThe Annotation screen has the following limitations:\n\n* Only Tagger and Checker users can access the Annotation screen. Other users do not have access to the screen.\n* Tagger users can only annotate documents that have been assigned to them. They cannot annotate documents that have not been assigned to them.\n* Checker users can only review annotations for tasks that have been assigned to them. They cannot review annotations for tasks that have not been assigned to them.\n* The Annotation screen does not support the annotation of documents in formats other than PDF.\n* The Annotation screen does not support the annotation of documents with more than 100 pages.\n* The Annotation screen does not support the annotation of documents with more than 60 labels per page.\n\nRisk assessment\n---------------\n\nThe following risks have been identified for the Annotation screen:\n\n* Data loss: There is a risk of data loss if the annotation tool fails to save annotations made by Tagger users.\n* Incorrect annotations: There is a risk of incorrect annotations if Tagger users do not follow the correct labeling guidelines.\n* Miscommunication: There is a risk of miscommunication if Tagger and Checker users do not use the commenting feature effectively.\n* User frustration: There is a risk of user frustration if the Annotation screen has a poorly designed user interface."

Other users do not have access to the screen.\n* Data encryption: All data entered into the Annotation screen, including annotations and comments, is encrypted in transit and at rest.\n* Data backup: Regular backups of the annotation data are taken to prevent data loss.\n\nUser stories\n------------\n\nThe following user stories have been identified for the Annotation screen:\n\n**Epic: Annotation**\n\n* As a Tagger user, I want to classify documents so that I can see the relevant labels for the document.\n* As a Tagger user, I want to place labels on the document so that I can annotate the document.\n* As a Tagger user, I want to adjust the position, size, and shape of the labels so that I can accurately annotate the document.\n* As a Tagger user, I want to edit the name and description of the labels so that I can provide accurate information about the annotation.\n* As a Tagger user, I want to change the color of the labels so that I can distinguish between different labels.\n* As a Tagger user, I want to save my annotation progress so that I can continue annotating at a later time.\n\n**Epic: Review**\n\n* As a Checker user, I want to review the labels that have been placed on the document by Tagger users so that I can verify the accuracy of the annotations.\n* As a Checker user, I want to approve or reject each label so that I can indicate my approval or disapproval of the annotation.\n* As a Checker user, I want to modify the labels if necessary so that I can correct any errors in the annotations.\n* As a Checker user, I want to add comments for each label so that I can provide feedback to the Tagger user.\n* As a Checker user, I want to submit my review so that I can complete the review task.\n\n**Epic: Navigation**\n\n* As a Tagger or Checker user, I want to navigate between pages in the document so that I can easily view different parts of the document.\n* As a Tagger or Checker user, I want to use the document outline to jump to specific pages or headings so that I can quickly access the information I need.\n\n**Epic: Annotation history**\n\n* As a Tagger or Checker user, I want to view the history of changes for each label on the document so that I can see who made the changes and when they were made."
