  "content": "Asheville, NC is a popular tourist destination, and traffic and parking can be a challenge, especially during peak season (June to October). Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Traffic:**\n\n* Asheville's roads can get congested, especially during rush hour (7-9 am and 4-6 pm) and on weekends when tourists flock to the city.\n* The downtown area is particularly busy, with narrow streets and a high volume of pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles.\n* Be prepared for slower traffic on the Blue Ridge Parkway (NC-469), especially during peak season, as it's a popular scenic route.\n\n**Parking:**\n\n* Parking in downtown Asheville can be limited, especially during peak season. Be prepared to park in one of the many parking garages or lots, which can fill up quickly.\n* Metered parking spots are available, but be mindful of time limits and fees.\n* Some popular attractions, like the Biltmore Estate, have limited parking, so plan ahead and consider using their shuttle services or parking at nearby lots.\n\nTo minimize traffic and parking hassles:\n\n* Plan your visits to popular attractions during off-peak hours (e.g., early morning or late afternoon).\n* Consider parking in one of the many parking garages or lots on the outskirts of downtown and using the Asheville Transit bus system or a ride-sharing service to get around.\n* Take advantage of parking apps like ParkMe or SpotHero to find and reserve parking spots in advance.\n* Be patient and flexible, as traffic and parking can be unpredictable in a popular tourist destination like Asheville.\n\nIf you're staying in Asheville for a few days, you might want to consider exploring the surrounding areas, like the River Arts District or the nearby towns of Weaverville or Hendersonville, which offer a more relaxed atmosphere and easier parking.\n\nKeep in mind that the traffic and parking situation can vary depending on the time of year, special events, and construction projects. It's always a good idea to check the city's website or a traffic app like Waze for up-to-date information before your trip.",
