Here's what you should keep in mind:\n\n1. **Power and Volume**: You'll need a system that can produce enough volume to cut through ambient noise and reach a larger audience. Look for a system with higher power output (watts) and a more efficient speaker design.\n2. **Weather Resistance**: Since you'll be using the system outdoors, it's essential to choose a system that can withstand the elements. Look for systems with weather-resistant materials, waterproof speakers, and a durable design.\n3. **Battery Life**: Outdoor events can be unpredictable, and access to power outlets might be limited. A system with a long-lasting battery life or one that can be powered by a battery pack is ideal.\n4. **Portability**: You'll likely need to transport the system to and from the event location, so consider a system that's lightweight, compact, and easy to carry.\n\nBased on these requirements, here are some portable PA system recommendations:\n\n1. **JBL EON ONE Compact**: A compact, all-in-one PA system with a 7-inch woofer and 1-inch tweeter. It's lightweight, weather-resistant, and has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 12 hours. ($500-$600)\n2. **Bose S1 Pro Portable PA System**: A compact, all-in-one PA system with a 6-inch woofer and 1-inch tweeter. It's lightweight, weather-resistant, and has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 11 hours. ($500-$600)\n3. **QSC K12.2 Portable PA System**: A more powerful system with a 12-inch woofer and 1-inch tweeter. It's weather-resistant, has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 14 hours, and is designed for outdoor use. ($800-$900)\n\nThese systems are all designed for outdoor use and can handle the demands of park gatherings or street performances. However, keep in mind that you may still need to adjust your volume and tone to accommodate the outdoor environment and any noise regulations.\n\nRemember to always check the local noise ordinances and permits required for outdoor performances in your area.\n\n(Also, consider investing in a waterproof cover or case to protect your system during transportation and storage.)",
