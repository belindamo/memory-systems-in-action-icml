The seat pitch, which is the distance between the back of one seat and the front of the next, can vary across different aircraft and airlines.\n\nIt's great that you had a smooth check-in process with American Airlines last month, but it's also important to research the seat comfort and amenities before booking a flight. Seat comfort can make a big difference in your overall travel experience, especially on longer flights.\n\nHere are some tips to help you research seat comfort before booking a flight:\n\n1. **Check the airline's website:** Look for information on seat pitch, width, and recline for each aircraft type and cabin class.\n2. **Use online resources:** Websites like SeatGuru, Skytrax, or TripAdvisor can provide detailed information on seat comfort, amenities, and passenger reviews.\n3. **Read reviews:** Check out reviews from other passengers who have flown with the airline and aircraft you're considering.\n4. **Compare airlines:** Research and compare the seat comfort and amenities offered by different airlines on your desired route.\n5. **Consider upgrading:** If seat comfort is a top priority, consider upgrading to a higher cabin class or looking into airlines that offer more spacious seating options.\n\nBy doing your research, you can make an informed decision and choose a flight that meets your comfort needs.",
