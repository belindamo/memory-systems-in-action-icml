Here's a brief introduction to each:\n\n**Charlie St. Clair**:\n\n* Age: 19\n* Nationality: American\n* Background: Charlie is a socialite from a wealthy family in New York. She's beautiful, charming, and used to getting what she wants. However, she's also pregnant and unmarried, which is a scandal in 1947. Her family is pushing her to marry a wealthy suitor, but Charlie wants to make her own decisions and find her own path.\n* Goal: Charlie is determined to find her cousin, Rose, who disappeared in Nazi-occupied France during the war. She's convinced that Rose is still alive and wants to find her before she has her baby.\n* Personality: Charlie is impulsive, determined, and fiercely independent. She's also naive and a bit entitled, which can get her into trouble. Despite her flaws, she's likable and relatable, and her courage and resilience grow throughout the story.\n\n**Eve Gardiner**:\n\n* Age: Late 30s\n* Nationality: British\n* Background: Eve is a former spy for the Alice Network, a real-life espionage ring that operated in France during WWII. She's haunted by her past and the traumatic events she experienced during the war.\n* Goal: Eve is trying to rebuild her life and find redemption after the war. She's struggling to come to terms with her past and find a sense of purpose in a world that seems to have moved on without her.\n* Personality: Eve is tough, resourceful, and intelligent. She's also scarred, both physically and emotionally, and has built walls around herself to protect herself from getting hurt again. Despite her tough exterior, she has a deep sense of empathy and a strong sense of justice.\n\nThroughout the book, Charlie and Eve's paths intersect as they both search for answers and redemption. They form an unlikely bond, with Charlie's youthful energy and determination helping to awaken Eve's long-dormant sense of purpose. As they navigate their journeys, they both undergo significant character development, facing their fears, confronting their pasts, and discovering their own strengths.\n\nThese two women from different backgrounds and generations form a powerful and emotional connection, and their stories will stay with you long after you finish the book.",
