  "content": "I enjoy reading historical fiction novels for the emotional connection I make with the characters and the way they evolve throughout the story. I prefer books that are character-driven and focus on the emotional journey of the protagonist. I'm interested in reading about WWII and the French Resistance, and I don't mind multiple perspectives as long as they're well-integrated into the story. I'm looking for a book that will make me feel invested and emotional, like \"The Nightingale\" did.",
