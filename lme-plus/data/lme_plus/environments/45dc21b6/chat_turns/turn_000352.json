  "content": "Congratulations on deciding to set up a feeder for your Blue Jay friends!\n\nKeeping feeders clean and safe from other animals can be a challenge, but with some tips and tricks, you can minimize the issues:\n\n**Cleaning the feeder:**\n\n1. **Regularly clean the feeder:** Every 1-2 weeks, take down the feeder and wash it with soap and warm water. Rinse thoroughly and let it dry before refilling.\n2. **Disinfect the feeder:** Mix 1 part white vinegar with 9 parts water and soak the feeder for 10-15 minutes. Rinse and dry as usual.\n3. **Use a feeder with a wide tray or ledge:** This allows for easy cleaning and reduces the buildup of debris.\n\n**Squirrel-proofing and raccoon-deterrent tips:**\n\n1. **Use squirrel-proof bird feeders:** Look for feeders with weight-activated perches, cage-like enclosures, or other designs that exclude larger animals.\n2. **Position the feeder correctly:** Place the feeder at least 10 feet away from any structures that squirrels or raccoons can jump from.\n3. **Use squirrel baffles:** Install a physical barrier, like a plastic or metal baffle, above or below the feeder to block access.\n4. **Offer squirrel-friendly alternatives:** Provide separate feeders or areas with squirrel-friendly food, like corn or sunflower seeds, to distract them from the Blue Jay feeder.\n5. **Use raccoon-deterrent seed:** Some bird seed blends are specifically formulated to be unpalatable to raccoons.\n6. **Trim back nearby branches:** Keep nearby trees and shrubs trimmed to reduce jumping points for squirrels and raccoons.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Use a feeder with a roof or overhang:** This will help keep the seed dry and reduce waste.\n2. **Keep the area around the feeder clean:** Regularly sweep or rake up spilled seed and debris to discourage unwanted visitors.\n3. **Consider using a motion-activated camera:** This can help you monitor feeder activity and identify any problems.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a safe and enjoyable feeding station for your Blue Jay friends!\n\n(And, just to clarify, I'm glad you mentioned that the young birds you found were indeed Blue Jays \u2013 I was already aware of that, but it's always fun to confirm!)",
