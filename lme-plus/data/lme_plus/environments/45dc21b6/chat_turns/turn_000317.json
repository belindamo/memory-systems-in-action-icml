Oak is a beautiful, warm wood that can add a lot of character to a room. It's even more special that it has sentimental value, coming from your parents' house. I'm sure it'll be a great addition to your dining area and will make your dinner parties feel even more special.\n\nAnd wow, you're really paying attention to the little details, aren't you? Replacing the light bulbs with warmer color temperature ones can make a huge difference in the ambiance of a room. It's amazing how something as simple as lighting can affect the mood and feel of a space. Your living room must feel so cozy and inviting now!\n\nIt's great that you're thinking about the little things that can make a big impact.
