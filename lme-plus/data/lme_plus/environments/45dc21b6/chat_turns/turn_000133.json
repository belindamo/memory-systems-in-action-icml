In a small bowl, mix together the chia seeds, cocoa powder, and salt.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the plant-based milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract (if using).\n3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until the chia seeds are well coated.\n4. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight (4-6 hours).\n5. After the chia pudding has chilled, give it a good stir to redistribute the chia seeds. You can also add any toppings you like, such as:\n\t* Fresh fruit (berries, sliced bananas, or diced mango)\n\t* Shredded coconut\n\t* Chocolate shavings or chocolate chips\n\t* Whipped coconut cream\n\t* Nuts or seeds (hazelnuts, almonds, or chia seeds)\n6. Serve the chocolate chia pudding chilled and enjoy!\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to stir the mixture well before refrigerating to prevent the chia seeds from clumping.\n* If you prefer a thicker pudding, add more chia seeds or let it chill for a longer time.\n* You can also flavor the pudding with a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, or cayenne pepper for added depth.\n* Experiment with different types of plant-based milk to change the flavor and texture.\n\nThat's it! I hope you enjoy your delicious and healthy Chocolate Chia Pudding. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any variations on this recipe.",
