Here's a recipe that might come close to what you had at Smokey's BBQ joint:\n\n**Smokey's-Style Baked Bean and Coleslaw Mix**\n\n**Baked Bean Component:**\n\n* 1 (15 oz) can of pork and beans, drained and rinsed\n* 1/4 cup of ketchup\n* 2 tablespoons of brown sugar\n* 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar\n* 1 teaspoon of ground mustard\n* 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley\n\n**Coleslaw Component:**\n\n* 2 cups of shredded cabbage\n* 1 cup of shredded carrots\n* 1/4 cup of mayonnaise\n* 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard\n* 1/2 teaspoon of sugar\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley\n\n**Assembly:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C).\n2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pork and beans, ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, ground mustard, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well until the beans are coated.\n3. Transfer the bean mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish and bake for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n4. While the beans are baking, prepare the coleslaw. In a separate bowl, combine the shredded cabbage, carrots, mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well until the slaw is creamy and tangy.\n5. Once the beans are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly.\n6. Add the coleslaw mixture on top of the baked beans and stir until well combined.\n7. Sprinkle the chopped parsley on top and serve warm or at room temperature.\n\nTips to get closer to Smokey's flavor:\n\n* **Use a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce:** Instead of using ketchup, try using a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce like the one I provided earlier. This will give the baked beans a richer flavor profile.\n* **Add some smokiness:** Add a pinch of smoked paprika or chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to the baked beans for an extra smoky flavor.\n* **Use a variety of cabbages:** Experiment with different types of cabbages, such as red cabbage or napa cabbage, to give the coleslaw a more complex flavor profile.\n* **Add some crunch:** Add some chopped onions, bell peppers, or jalape\u00f1os to the coleslaw for an extra crunch and flavor boost.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point, and you can adjust the recipe to your taste. Don't be afraid to experiment and add your own twist to make it even more delicious!",
