  "content": "\"Choose our next adventure\" is a fun and engaging way to phrase the question.\n\nIncluding an \"Undecided\" option is an excellent idea! It's essential to give your friends the freedom to express their uncertainty or indecision, especially if they're still weighing their options or need more information. This option also helps you gauge how many people are still on the fence, which can inform your next steps in the planning process.\n\nHere's an updated example:\n\n\"Choose our next adventure:\n\nA) New Orleans, LA\nB) Austin, TX\nC) Nashville, TN\nD) Undecided - still considering my options\n\nLet me know your top choice!\"\n\nBy including the \"Undecided\" option, you're:\n\n* Acknowledging that it's okay to be unsure\n* Encouraging friends to participate in the poll without feeling pressured to make a decision\n* Gathering valuable feedback on the number of people who need more time or information\n\nRemember to keep an eye on the poll results and adjust your planning accordingly. If a significant number of friends are undecided, you may want to share more information about each destination or provide additional context to help them make a decision.",
