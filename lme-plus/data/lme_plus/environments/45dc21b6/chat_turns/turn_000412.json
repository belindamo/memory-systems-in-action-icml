As a digital AI assistant, I don't have have real-time access to current sales or promotions, but I can suggest a few ways to find out about any deals United Airlines might be offering.\n\n1. **Check United's website**: Visit United Airlines' official website ([www.united.com](http://www.united.com)) and look for their \"Deals\" or \"Sales\" section. They often feature promotional fares, discounts, or package deals on their homepage.\n2. **Sign up for United's email newsletter**: By registering for their email newsletter, you'll receive notifications about exclusive offers, sales, and promotions.\n3. **Follow United on social media**: Keep an eye on United's social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) for flash sales or special offers.\n4. **Use fare comparison tools**: Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak allow you to compare prices across airlines, including United. You might find a better deal on a specific route or travel date.\n5. **Consider budget-friendly options**: If you're flexible with your travel dates, consider flying on off-peak days (e.g., Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Saturdays) or booking a Basic Economy ticket, which can be cheaper.\n\nRegarding your positive experience with American Airlines, that's great to hear! Smooth check-in processes can make a big difference in your travel experience.\n\nRemember to also factor in any additional fees, such as baggage fees or seat selection, when comparing prices between airlines.\n\nSafe travels to Chicago next month!",
