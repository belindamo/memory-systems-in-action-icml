Investing in a new guitar amp can be a great way to enhance your practice sessions and sound.\n\nAs a beginner, you don't need to break the bank on a super expensive amp. Here are some recommendations that are perfect for starters:\n\n1. **Fender Mustang I V2**: A compact, versatile, and easy-to-use amp that's perfect for beginners. It has 24 presets, built-in effects, and a headphone output for silent practice. ($100-$150)\n2. **Blackstar ID:Core Stereo 10**: A compact, stereo amp with a range of built-in effects and a USB output for recording. It's a great option for those who want a bit more power and features. ($150-$200)\n3. **Yamaha THR5**: A compact, battery-powered amp that's perfect for practice sessions at home or on-the-go. It has built-in effects, a headphone output, and a USB output for recording. ($100-$150)\n4. **Marshall MG15GR**: A compact, 15-watt amp with a range of built-in effects and a headphone output. It's a great option for those who want a bit more power and a classic Marshall tone. ($100-$150)\n\nWhen choosing an amp, consider the following factors:\n\n* Power output: As a beginner, you don't need a super powerful amp. A 10-20 watt amp should be sufficient for practice sessions.\n* Size and portability: If you plan to practice at home or take your amp to lessons, a compact amp is a great option.\n* Built-in effects: If you're new to guitar, built-in effects can be a great way to experiment with different sounds without breaking the bank on pedals.\n* Budget: As a beginner, you don't need to spend a fortune on an amp. Set a budget and stick to it!\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy playing!\n\n(And, by the way, Arctic Monkeys are an amazing live band! I'm glad you had a blast at the festival!)",
