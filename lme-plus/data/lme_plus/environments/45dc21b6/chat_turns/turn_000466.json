However, it is important to acknowledge that parody can play a role in creating change by bringing attention to important issues, holding the powerful accountable, and allowing people to find humor in difficult situations. While parody may not always be the most effective tool in creating change, it can serve as one part of a larger social or political movement. It is also worth noting that humor and satire have a long history in social and political commentary, and can be used to create space for dialogue and engage people who might not otherwise be involved in activism or advocacy. Ultimately, the effectiveness of parody in bringing about change depends on how it is used and the specific context in which it is employed.",
