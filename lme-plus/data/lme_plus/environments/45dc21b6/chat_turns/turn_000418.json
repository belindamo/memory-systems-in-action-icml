  "content": "Delta's Airbus A321neo does offer more legroom, which is fantastic for taller passengers like yourself.\n\nRegarding your carry-on bag, the overhead compartment space on the A321neo is a bit limited, but it should fit most standard-sized carry-on bags. Here are the dimensions of the overhead bins on the A321neo:\n\n* Height: 22 inches (56 cm)\n* Width: 14 inches (36 cm)\n* Depth: 9 inches (23 cm)\n\nIf your carry-on bag fits within these dimensions, it should fit in the overhead compartment. However, it's always a good idea to check with Delta's carry-on baggage size restrictions to ensure your bag complies.\n\nDelta's carry-on baggage size restrictions are:\n\n* Maximum size: 22 inches tall, 14 inches wide, and 9 inches deep\n* Maximum weight: 40 pounds (18 kg)\n\nIf your bag has a built-in charger and laptop sleeve, it might be a bit bulkier than a standard carry-on. Make sure to measure your bag carefully and consider the following:\n\n* If your bag is slightly larger than the overhead bin dimensions, it might not fit or might need to be gate-checked.\n* If your bag is heavier than 40 pounds, you might need to check it instead of carrying it on.\n\nTo be safe, you can also consider checking with Delta's customer service or checking their website for more information on carry-on baggage restrictions.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your safety and the safety of others by stowing your carry-on bag properly in the overhead compartment or under the seat in front of you.",
