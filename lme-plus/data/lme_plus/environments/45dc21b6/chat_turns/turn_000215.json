  "content": "Semi-oceanfront and oceanfront locations are not exactly the same, although they both offer great views and proximity to the beach. Here's a breakdown of the main differences:\n\n**Oceanfront:**\n\n* Directly faces the ocean, with no obstacles or other buildings blocking the view\n* Typically has direct access to the beach, often with a private walkway or stairs\n* Unobstructed views of the ocean, sunrise, and sunset\n* Usually more expensive than semi-oceanfront properties\n* Often has a higher premium due to the prime location and unobstructed views\n\n**Semi-Oceanfront:**\n\n* Located near the ocean, but may not have a direct view of the ocean due to other buildings, dunes, or vegetation\n* May have a partial or angled view of the ocean, but not a direct, unobstructed view\n* Still has easy access to the beach, but might require a short walk or crossing a small street\n* Often less expensive than oceanfront properties, but still offers great proximity to the beach\n* Can be a great option for those who want to be close to the ocean without breaking the bank\n\nIn general, semi-oceanfront properties are a great choice for those who want to be close to the beach but don't need a direct, unobstructed view of the ocean. They often offer a more affordable option with still excellent proximity to the beach and amenities.\n\nIn the case of the \"Coastal Cottage\" I mentioned earlier, it's a semi-oceanfront property with partial ocean views. While it doesn't have a direct, unobstructed view of the ocean, it's still just a short walk to the beach and offers a comfortable, relaxing atmosphere.\n\nDoes that help clarify the difference between oceanfront and semi-oceanfront locations?",
