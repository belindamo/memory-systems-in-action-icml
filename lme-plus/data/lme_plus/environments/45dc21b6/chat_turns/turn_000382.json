  "content": "Adding live plants to your tank can greatly enhance the environment and benefit your fish. Here are some beginner-friendly plants that are suitable for a community tank with neon tetras, rasboras, and corydoras catfish:\n\n1. **Java Moss**: A low-maintenance, carpeting plant that's perfect for creating a natural-looking substrate. It's easy to care for and can thrive in low-light conditions.\n2. **Anacharis**: A fast-growing, floating plant that's great for providing shelter and food for your fish. It's easy to care for and can be trimmed regularly to maintain a desired length.\n3. **Water Wisteria**: A versatile, low-maintenance plant that can be trained to grow on a trellis or left to trail. It's relatively easy to care for and can thrive in a variety of lighting conditions.\n4. **Java Fern**: A popular, low-maintenance plant that's easy to care for and can thrive in low-light conditions. It's also a great choice for creating a natural-looking environment.\n5. **Cryptocorynes** (e.g., Cryptocoryne wendtii or Cryptocoryne cordifolia): These plants are relatively easy to care for and can thrive in a variety of lighting conditions. They're also great for creating a natural-looking environment.\n6. **Dwarf Hairgrass** (Eleocharis acicularis): A low-maintenance, carpeting plant that's perfect for creating a natural-looking substrate. It's relatively easy to care for and can thrive in low-light conditions.\n\nWhen choosing plants for your tank, make sure to consider the following:\n\n* Lighting: Most plants require moderate to low lighting. If your tank is very bright, you may need to provide shade or choose plants that can tolerate high light levels.\n* Water parameters: Make sure the plants you choose can thrive in the same water conditions as your fish. For example, if your tank has soft, slightly acidic water, choose plants that prefer these conditions.\n* Maintenance: Some plants require more maintenance than others. If you're new to live plants, start with low-maintenance options like Java Moss or Anacharis.\n\nRemember to introduce plants gradually to your tank to prevent sudden changes in water chemistry. Start with a few plants and monitor their health and growth before adding more.\n\nGood luck, and happy planting!",
