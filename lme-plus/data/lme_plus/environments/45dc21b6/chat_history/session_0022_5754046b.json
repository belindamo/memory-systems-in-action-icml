      "content": "Semi-oceanfront and oceanfront locations are not exactly the same, although they both offer great views and proximity to the beach. Here's a breakdown of the main differences:\n\n**Oceanfront:**\n\n* Directly faces the ocean, with no obstacles or other buildings blocking the view\n* Typically has direct access to the beach, often with a private walkway or stairs\n* Unobstructed views of the ocean, sunrise, and sunset\n* Usually more expensive than semi-oceanfront properties\n* Often has a higher premium due to the prime location and unobstructed views\n\n**Semi-Oceanfront:**\n\n* Located near the ocean, but may not have a direct view of the ocean due to other buildings, dunes, or vegetation\n* May have a partial or angled view of the ocean, but not a direct, unobstructed view\n* Still has easy access to the beach, but might require a short walk or crossing a small street\n* Often less expensive than oceanfront properties, but still offers great proximity to the beach\n* Can be a great option for those who want to be close to the ocean without breaking the bank\n\nIn general, semi-oceanfront properties are a great choice for those who want to be close to the beach but don't need a direct, unobstructed view of the ocean. They often offer a more affordable option with still excellent proximity to the beach and amenities.\n\nIn the case of the \"Coastal Cottage\" I mentioned earlier, it's a semi-oceanfront property with partial ocean views. While it doesn't have a direct, unobstructed view of the ocean, it's still just a short walk to the beach and offers a comfortable, relaxing atmosphere.\n\nDoes that help clarify the difference between oceanfront and semi-oceanfront locations?"

I think we'd be happy with a semi-oceanfront property, as long as it's still within walking distance to the beach. Can you tell me more about the neighborhood and amenities around the Coastal Cottage? Is it close to any shops, restaurants, or kid-friendly activities?"
