Judgment\n\nThese longstanding proceedings arise from the construction by the plaintiff/cross-defendant, Boulus Constructions Pty Limited (\u201cthe Builder\u201d), of a retirement village known as the Three Rivers Regional Retirement Community on behalf of the defendant/cross-claimant, Warrumbungle Shire Council (\u201cthe Council\u201d), on a former hospital site in Dunedoo.\n\nThe Builder commenced these proceedings almost four years ago, on 6 November 2018. The Builder seeks to be paid what it asserts is due for the construction work. The Council has brought a Cross-Claim alleging defective works. The Council alleges some 300 defects in total which, I was informed, comprise some 30 different kinds of defect in multiple locations in the units within the retirement village.\n\nA complex range of factual, legal and procedural issues has arisen. The matter was set down for a hearing to take place in July of last year. That hearing was vacated for a number of reasons not necessary to recite here. There is no current hearing date.\n\nOn 20 April 2022, the Builder served a Second Further Amended Technology and Construction List Statement and a Third Further Amended Technology and Construction Cross-Claim List Response. The Builder alleges that, in effect, the Council is not entitled to any remedy for the allegedly defective works in the retirement village due to the failure by the Council to obtain a valid Development Consent and Construction Certificate. The Builder had made allegations to similar effect in earlier iterations of its List Statement on what Mr Feller SC, who appeared with Mr Marshall for the Council, described as a \u201cprogressive and escalating basis\u201d.\n\nMr Feller accepted that, if the Builder makes out its allegation arising from the lack of a valid Development Consent and Construction Certificate, the Council may fail in its defective work claim. Obviously, I make no findings about that matter on this application.\n\nAgainst that possibility, by Notice of Motion filed on 4 August 2022, the Council now seeks to amend its Cross-Claim Cross-Summons and Cross-Claim List Statement (in accordance with the document circulated on 21 July 2022) to include a claim under s 37 of the Design and Building Practitioners Act 2020 (NSW) (\u201cthe Act\u201d) against the Builder itself (already a cross-defendant), as well as against the Managing Director of the Builder, Mr Brian Boulus, and the Project Site Supervisor, Mr Bradley McCarthy. Mr Boulus and Mr McCarthy are not presently cross-defendants.\n\nSection 37 of the Act provides:\n\n\u201c37 Extension of duty of care\n\n(1) A person who carries out construction work has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid economic loss caused by defects\u2014\n\n(a) in or related to a building for which the work is done, and\n\n(b) arising from the construction work.\n\n(2) The duty of care is owed to each owner of the land in relation to which the construction work is carried out and to each subsequent owner of the land.\n\n(3) A person to whom the duty of care is owed is entitled to damages for the breach of the duty as if the duty were a duty established by the common law.\n\n(4) The duty of care is owed to an owner whether or not the construction work was carried out\u2014\n\n(a) under a contract or other arrangement entered into with the owner or another person, or\n\n(b) otherwise than under a contract or arrangement.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\u201cConstruction work\u201d is defined in s 36 of the Act as follows:\n\n\u201cconstruction work means any of the following\u2014\n\n(a) building work,\n\n(b) the preparation of regulated designs and other designs for building work,\n\n(c) the manufacture or supply of a building product used for building work,\n\n(d) supervising, coordinating, project managing or otherwise having substantive control over the carrying out of any work referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\nSections 36 and 37 of the Act commenced operation on 10 June 2020 and have retrospective effect. [1]\n\n1. Schedule 1, s 5 of the Act.\n\nI have considered the operation of the Act in four decisions: The Owners \u2013 Strata Plan No 87060 v Loulach Developments Pty Ltd (No 2); [2] Goodwin Street Developments Pty Ltd atf Jesmond Unit Trust v DSD Builders Pty Ltd (in liq); [3] The Owners \u2013 Strata Plan No 84674 v Pafburn Pty Ltd; [4] and The Owners \u2013 Strata Plan No 84674 v Pafburn Pty Ltd (No 2). [5]\n\n2. (2021) 250 LGERA 114; [2021] NSWSC 1068.\n\n3. [2022] NSWSC 624.\n\n4. [2022] NSWSC 659.\n\n5. [2022] NSWSC 1002."
