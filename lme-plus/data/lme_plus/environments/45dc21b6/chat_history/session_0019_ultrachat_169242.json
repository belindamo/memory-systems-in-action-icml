This was the first game played by the Saints after being displaced from their home stadium by Hurricane Katrina, and it was an emotional return for the city and its fans.\n\nThe game was a back-and-forth shootout, with the Saints ultimately pulling off a 23-3 win. It was a meaningful moment for the team, the city of New Orleans, and the NFL as a whole.\n\nOther classic Monday Night Football games like the \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\", \"The Catch\", \"The Immaculate Reception\", and \"The Tuck Rule Game\" are also worth watching to get a sense of iconic moments that shaped the NFL's history."
