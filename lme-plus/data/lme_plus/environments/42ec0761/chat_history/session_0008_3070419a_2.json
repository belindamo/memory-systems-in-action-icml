You can use a butter knife or a spreader to get an even layer.\n3. **Add the filling**: Add your desired filling, such as scrambled tofu, marinated and baked tofu \"bacon,\" saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, or spinach.\n4. **Add additional toppings**: Add any additional toppings you like, such as sliced tomatoes, avocado, or lettuce.\n5. **Top with another slice of bread**: Place another slice of toasted bread on top to complete the sandwich.\n\n**Bread Options:**\n\n1. **Whole Wheat English Muffin**: A classic choice for breakfast sandwiches, whole wheat English muffins provide a sturdy base for your filling.\n2. **Bagel**: A toasted bagel adds a nice crunch and a bit of chewiness to the sandwich.
