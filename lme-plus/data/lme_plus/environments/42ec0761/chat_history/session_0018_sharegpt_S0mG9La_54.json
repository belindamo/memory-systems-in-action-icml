      "content": "10. inside the zone, anything that doesn't require fuel or electricity. Outside the zone, people also mostly walk, or ride horses, because fuel is extremely expensive, and cars, trains, airplanes etc. do exist, but they are just for the few belonging to mid-to-higher social classes.\n\n11. Mostly oil, coal, lithium mines etc. Similar to 21st century.\n\n12. They buy it or rent from Hybrid kingdoms. This is all rapidly dwindling outside the hybrid kingdoms.\n\n13. They have meetings, but only through Raziel. Even when they're in person, Raziel must be present, as he is the only thing keeping them together, advising them all ( even though he's becoming more unreliable by the day, due to Tiamat radiation ).\n\n14. Not really, but due to the failing infrastructure, huge parts of the world now have a much lower population, so there are forests re-growing, deserts expanding, rivers flooding etc."

      "content": "1. The Hybrids are very secretive about their own lives and history. They maintain a carefully constructed image of perfection, and any cracks in that image are quickly covered up or eliminated. As a result, there is little information available about their personal lives or relationships with each other.\n2. The people inside the Tiamat zone have a strong sense of community and cooperation, as they must work together to survive in a world without modern technology. Outside the zone, people are more isolated and focused on individual survival.\n3. The Hybrids are very concerned with maintaining their power and control, so they carefully monitor and manipulate the information that is available to the public. They also use propaganda and fear tactics to maintain their image as powerful and unstoppable beings.\n4. The people inside the Tiamat zone have a more traditional view of gender roles, with men often taking on more physically demanding tasks and women taking care of the home and children. Outside the zone, gender roles are more fluid and varied, as people have had to adapt to a changing world.\n5. The Hybrids are very focused on their own power and survival, and are willing to do whatever it takes to maintain their position. This includes manipulating and exploiting other beings, including humans and other hybrids.\n6. Religion is still an important part of life for many people, both inside and outside the Tiamat zone. However, the interpretations of religion have changed and adapted to the new world, with new beliefs and practices emerging to reflect the challenges of the post-Tiamat world."

      "content": "if we disregard the government policies, social cohesion and individual preparedness, which cities are most likely to survive the crises I mentioned, and develop into city-states. \n\nI imagine that the blast would take out all the cities east of the rocky mountains, and maybe west from New York. Down south almost to Houston TX. etc. so everything outside would initially have some problems with their tech and computers, but be repaired in days or weeks."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In terms of natural resources and geographical features that could aid in survival and development, some coastal cities that may have a better chance of surviving and developing into city-states could include:\n\n1. Seattle, Washington: With access to freshwater from Lake Washington and the nearby Cascade Mountains, as well as a thriving fishing industry and nearby agricultural land, Seattle could potentially weather the food crises. Additionally, its location on the Puget Sound offers a natural harbor for trade and defense.\n2. San Francisco, California: Despite being located in a high-risk earthquake zone, San Francisco has access to the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean for trade and fishing. It also has nearby agricultural land and potential for solar energy, which could aid in its survival.\n3. Vancouver, British Columbia: Similar to Seattle, Vancouver has access to freshwater and a thriving fishing industry. It also has nearby agricultural land and is situated in a relatively mild climate, which could aid in food production.\n4. Portland, Oregon: With access to the Columbia River and Pacific Ocean, Portland could potentially rely on fishing and trade for survival. It also has nearby agricultural land and potential for solar and wind energy.\n5. Halifax, Nova Scotia: Located on the Atlantic Ocean, Halifax has access to fishing and trade routes. It also has nearby agricultural land and is situated in a relatively mild climate for Canada, which could aid in food production.\n\nOf course, there are many factors that could impact a city's survival and development, and it's difficult to predict how events would unfold in a post-EMP world."

      "content": "so, it's something similar to an EMP blast, but it's mostly subatomic particles, as Tiamat is a sort of black hole. How many people would be left without electricity and computers from such a huge blast area ?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It's difficult to estimate the exact number of people that would be left without electricity and computers from a Tiamat radiation blast, as it depends on a number of factors such as the strength of the blast, the density of population in the affected areas, and the resilience of the electrical infrastructure.\n\nHowever, given the size of the blast area you described (from around Calgary in Canada to Jacksonville in Florida, and from Juarez in Mexico to Quebec in Canada), it's likely that millions of people would be affected. Even if some areas managed to protect their electrical infrastructure from the initial effects of the blast, the subsequent effects of radiation and the need for repairs could lead to widespread blackouts and disruptions to services that rely on electricity and computers.\n\nOverall, it's safe to say that a Tiamat radiation blast on this scale would have a profound and long-lasting impact on the affected regions, and could result in the collapse of many institutions and systems that rely on electricity and computer technology."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Interesting concept. So, the Tiamat zone would expand slowly and steadily over time. How do the people in the zone respond to this expansion? Are there any efforts to contain or halt the growth of the zone?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "By the time of the events in the novel, everyone had given up on halting the growth of the zone. The Hybrids do send some scientists from time to time, but as the results are unsatisfactory to them, they lose interest for a while. The hybrids are inconsistent, as they have their own court dramas and other things to do."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It sounds like the growth of the zone is an accepted reality for most people in the world, even if it is still not fully understood. The fact that the hybrids are not consistently interested in halting the growth of the zone suggests that they may have other priorities or concerns that they consider more important. It will be interesting to see how the growth of the zone continues to impact the world in your novel, and how characters adapt to this reality."
