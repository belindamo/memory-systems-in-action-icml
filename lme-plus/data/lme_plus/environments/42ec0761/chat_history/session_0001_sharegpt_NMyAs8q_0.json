      "content": "The Euclidean distance between two points (a,b) and (x,y) is given by the formula:\n\nsqrt((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2)\n\nThis formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFor example, if the coordinates of the two points are (3,4) and (6,8), the Euclidean distance between them would be:\n\nsqrt((6-3)^2 + (8-4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5"

      "content": "The indefinite integral of 1/x is given by the formula:\n\nln |x| + C\n\nWhere C is a constant. To find the definite integral of 1/x from x=1 to x=2, you can evaluate the definite integral using this formula by substituting the upper and lower limits of integration into the indefinite integral and taking the difference:\n\nintegral from x=1 to x=2 of (1/x) dx = ln |2| - ln |1|\n= ln 2 - ln 1\n= ln 2\n\nSo the definite integral of 1/x from x=1 to x=2 is equal to ln 2."
