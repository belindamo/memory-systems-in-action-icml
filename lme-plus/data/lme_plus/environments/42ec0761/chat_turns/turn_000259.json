Their online deals can change frequently, and I wouldn't want to provide outdated information.\n\nInstead, I recommend checking Bed Bath & Beyond's website directly to explore their current online deals on kitchen appliances. You can follow these steps:\n\n1. Visit Bed Bath & Beyond's website ([www.bedbathandbeyond.com](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com)).\n2. Click on the \"Kitchen\" or \"Small Kitchen Appliances\" category from the top navigation menu.\n3. Look for the \"Deals\" or \"Sales\" section, usually displayed as a banner or tab on the category page.\n4. Filter the results by price, brand, or product type to find the kitchen appliance you're interested in.\n5. Check the product pages for any discount prices, promo codes, or special offers.\n\nYou can also use their website's search function to look for specific products or brands you're interested in, like \"stand mixers\" or \"Ninja blenders.\" This should give you a better idea of what's currently on sale.\n\nRemember to also check for any additional promo codes or discounts that might be available on top of the online deals. Happy shopping!",
