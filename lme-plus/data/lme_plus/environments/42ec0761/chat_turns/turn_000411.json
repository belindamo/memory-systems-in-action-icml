  "content": "While it is true that designing grand buildings solely for the purpose of impressing people may seem like a waste of resources, it is important to understand that the Beaux-Arts style and similar architectural movements were not just about grandiosity.\n\nPublic buildings constructed in this style were often designed to serve a specific purpose. For example, the Grand Central Terminal provided a pivotal transportation hub for the growing city of New York, while the Beaux-Arts-styled museums and cultural centers provided space for intellectual and artistic pursuits. Aesthetics and grandeur were often used to elevate the importance of public institutions and to inspire a sense of civic pride in the people who used them.\n\nIn addition, the design and construction of such grand buildings often provided employment opportunities for skilled craftsmen and artisans, promoting economic growth and cultural values of the time.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to consider the cultural context in which buildings were designed and constructed. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Beaux-Arts style represented and celebrated an ideal of cultural refinement and sophistication, which was highly valued by many wealthy members of society.\n\nUltimately, the value of such grand buildings lies not only in their aesthetics but also in their ability to reflect and reinforce cultural values, provide public services, and inspire a sense of civic pride in the communities they serve.",
