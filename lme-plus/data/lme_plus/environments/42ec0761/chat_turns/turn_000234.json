  "content": "People who receive hearing implants for the first time may not initially understand what other people are saying. It can take time for them to adjust to hearing sounds and speech again, and it may take some time for them to understand spoken language fully. It is not uncommon for people who receive hearing implants to need to undergo therapy and training to learn how to interpret the sounds they are hearing and to improve their ability to understand spoken language. In some cases, people who receive hearing implants may be able to understand spoken language relatively quickly, while in other cases it may take longer. It can also depend on the severity of the individual's hearing loss and how long they have gone without being able to hear.",
