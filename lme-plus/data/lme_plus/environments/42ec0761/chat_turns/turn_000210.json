  "content": "1. The Hybrids are very secretive about their own lives and history. They maintain a carefully constructed image of perfection, and any cracks in that image are quickly covered up or eliminated. As a result, there is little information available about their personal lives or relationships with each other.\n2. The people inside the Tiamat zone have a strong sense of community and cooperation, as they must work together to survive in a world without modern technology. Outside the zone, people are more isolated and focused on individual survival.\n3. The Hybrids are very concerned with maintaining their power and control, so they carefully monitor and manipulate the information that is available to the public. They also use propaganda and fear tactics to maintain their image as powerful and unstoppable beings.\n4. The people inside the Tiamat zone have a more traditional view of gender roles, with men often taking on more physically demanding tasks and women taking care of the home and children. Outside the zone, gender roles are more fluid and varied, as people have had to adapt to a changing world.\n5. The Hybrids are very focused on their own power and survival, and are willing to do whatever it takes to maintain their position. This includes manipulating and exploiting other beings, including humans and other hybrids.\n6. Religion is still an important part of life for many people, both inside and outside the Tiamat zone. However, the interpretations of religion have changed and adapted to the new world, with new beliefs and practices emerging to reflect the challenges of the post-Tiamat world.",
