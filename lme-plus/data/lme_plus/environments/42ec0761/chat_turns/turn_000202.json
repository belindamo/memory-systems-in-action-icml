Each team member can participate as much or as little as they like, and teams can have multiple members on the track at the same time.\n3. **Luminaria Ceremony**: At night, the track is lined with candles and luminarias (paper bags with candles inside) to honor those who have lost their battle with cancer and to support those still fighting. Participants walk a silent lap in remembrance and reflection.\n4. **Closing Ceremony**: The event concludes with a closing ceremony, which includes a final lap, closing remarks, and the announcement of the top fundraising teams.\n\n**Funds Raised:**\n\nThe funds raised through Relay For Life support the American Cancer Society's mission to:\n\n1. **Fund Cancer Research**: Support groundbreaking research to find new treatments, improve existing ones, and discover new ways to prevent cancer.\n2. **Provide Patient Support**: Offer resources, services, and support to cancer patients, such as transportation to treatment, lodging, and emotional support.\n3. **Educate the Public**: Promote cancer awareness, education, and prevention through public outreach programs and campaigns.\n\n**How Funds are Used:**\n\nThe American Cancer Society allocates funds raised through Relay For Life events to support various programs and services, including:\n\n1. **Research Grants**: Funding for scientists and researchers to investigate new treatments, early detection methods, and cancer prevention strategies.\n2. **Patient Services**: Support for cancer patients, including transportation, lodging, and emotional support.\n3. **Education and Awareness**: Public outreach programs to promote cancer awareness, education, and prevention.\n4. **Advocacy**: Efforts to advocate for public policies that support cancer research, prevention, and patient care.\n\n**Getting Involved:**\n\nIf you're interested in participating in a Relay For Life event, you can:\n\n1. **Find an Event**: Search for a Relay For Life event in your area on the American Cancer Society's website.\n2. **Form a Team**: Gather friends, family, or coworkers to form a team and register online.\n3. **Fundraise**: Set a fundraising goal and start collecting donations to support the American Cancer Society's mission.\n4. **Participate**: Attend the event and take turns walking or running laps with your team.\n\nRelay For Life is a powerful way to make a difference in the fight against cancer.
