  "content": "That's great to hear that stevia is working well for you in your sugar-free mojitos! Mint and stevia can be a fantastic combination, as the cooling effect of the mint can help balance out the sweetness of the stevia.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you're reducing your sugar intake, and exploring more stevia-based cocktails is a great way to do so. Stevia can be a bit tricky to work with, but once you get the hang of it, it can be a wonderful sugar substitute.\n\nRegarding the craft distillery, I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or knowledge of specific locations, but I'd love to hear more about it! Grapefruit and rosemary flavor sounds like an intriguing combination. Have you tried it out yet? What did you think of it? Are you planning on incorporating it into any cocktails or using it as a base for a new creation?\n\nFeel free to share more about your experiences with stevia, sugar-free cocktails, and the craft distillery. I'm all ears (or rather, all text)!",
