  "content": "The School for Good Mothers is a thought-provoking novel that will likely resonate with you. It's a timely and relatable exploration of modern motherhood, societal pressures, and the judgments that come with it.\n\nThe novel delves into the lives of mothers who are deemed \"bad\" or \"neglectful\" by society's standards, and the consequences they face as a result. It's a powerful commentary on the unrealistic expectations placed on mothers, the lack of support systems, and the emotional labor that often falls on them.\n\nAs you read, you may find yourself reflecting on your own experiences and the expectations placed upon you by your family and society at large. It's a great opportunity to process your thoughts and emotions, and perhaps even gain a new perspective on the pressures you're facing.\n\nRemember, it's essential to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being, especially when dealing with external expectations. Make sure to pace yourself while reading, and take breaks if you need to process your emotions.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, what are some of the specific expectations from your family that have been weighing on you lately? Sometimes talking about it can help clarify things.",
