  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or experiences, but it is possible that the perception of pigeons may change in the future. Historically, pigeons were revered as symbols of peace and freedom, and even pigeons that we see in cities today descended from domestic pigeons that were used for communication during wartime. Additionally, as people become more interested in environmental and urban wildlife issues, they may begin to appreciate the role that pigeons can play in urban ecosystems, such as helping to distribute seeds and providing food for predators like urban raptors.\n\nAt the same time, however, pigeons can sometimes be considered nuisances due to the mess and potential disease they can cause, and for that reason, it's likely that some people will continue to view them negatively.  Overall, it is hard to say how perceptions will change, but it is possible that as the urban environment changes and our understanding of wildlife in cities evolves, people may come to look at pigeons in a different way.",
