  "content": "KitchenAid stand mixers are iconic and highly popular, and Bed Bath & Beyond does carry KitchenAid products.\n\nYou can find a wide selection of KitchenAid stand mixers on Bed Bath & Beyond's website or in their stores. They typically carry a variety of models, including the Classic, Artisan, and Professional series, in different colors and sizes.\n\nAs for current deals, I recommend checking Bed Bath & Beyond's website or visiting a store to see what's available. However, I can give you some general insights:\n\n1. **Price Match Guarantee**: Bed Bath & Beyond offers a price match guarantee, so if you find a lower price on a KitchenAid stand mixer at a competitor's store, they'll match it.\n2. **Sales and Discounts**: Keep an eye out for sales or discounts on specific KitchenAid models. They might offer a percentage off, a fixed discount, or a bundle deal with other KitchenAid products.\n3. **Manufacturer's Closeout**: If KitchenAid is discontinuing a particular model or color, Bed Bath & Beyond might offer clearance prices on those items.\n4. **Floor Models or Open-Box Items**: You might find floor models or open-box KitchenAid stand mixers at a discounted price. These items are often in great condition, but the packaging might be damaged or missing.\n5. **Gift with Purchase**: Occasionally, Bed Bath & Beyond offers a gift with purchase, like a free accessory or a cookbook, when you buy a KitchenAid stand mixer.\n\nTo find current deals, you can:\n\n* Visit Bed Bath & Beyond's website and search for \"KitchenAid stand mixer\" or the specific model you're interested in.\n* Check their website's \"Deals\" or \"Sales\" section for any promotions or discounts on KitchenAid products.\n* Sign up for their email newsletter to receive exclusive offers and sale notifications.\n* Visit a Bed Bath & Beyond store and ask a sales associate about any current deals or promotions on KitchenAid stand mixers.\n\nRemember to also check for any available coupons, promo codes, or rewards on your Bed Bath & Beyond credit card that you can combine with any deals you find.",
