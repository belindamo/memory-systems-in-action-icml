  "content": "For a Sorcerer/Monk, there are a few spells that can help increase AC (Armor Class) and improve survivability in combat:\n\n1. Shield: This 1st-level spell provides a +5 bonus to AC until the start of the caster's next turn. It is a reaction spell, which means it can be cast in response to an enemy's attack, making it a valuable tool for avoiding damage.\n2. Mage Armor: This 1st-level spell provides a base AC of 13 + Dexterity modifier, which can be particularly useful for a character with a low Armor Class. It has a duration of 8 hours, which makes it a good choice for pre-combat preparation.\n3. Blur: This 2nd-level spell causes the caster to become blurred and indistinct, making it more difficult for enemies to hit them. It grants attackers disadvantage on attack rolls against the caster, which can be particularly useful in melee combat.\n4. Mirror Image: This 2nd-level spell creates illusory duplicates of the caster, making it more difficult for enemies to hit them. It creates 3 duplicates that move with the caster and are destroyed when hit, providing an additional layer of defense against attacks.\n5. Stoneskin: This 4th-level spell turns the caster's skin into stone, giving them resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. This can be particularly useful in situations where the party is facing physical attacks from enemies.\n\nOverall, Shield and Mage Armor are both good choices for increasing AC, as they can be cast quickly and have a long duration. Blur and Mirror Image are both more situational, but can be extremely effective in the right circumstances. Stoneskin is a powerful defensive spell, but it requires a 4th-level spell slot and may be more situational depending on the campaign.",
