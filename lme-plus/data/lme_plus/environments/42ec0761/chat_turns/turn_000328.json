I'd be happy to help you with some interior design tips for your living room makeover.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on scoring some great finds at Target's new home decor section! Throw pillows and a vase are excellent starting points for adding a pop of color and texture to your space.\n\nHere are some general interior design tips to consider as you continue to work on your living room:\n\n1. **Define your style**: Think about the overall aesthetic you want to achieve in your living room. Do you prefer modern, traditional, bohemian, or a mix? Collect inspiration images or create a Pinterest board to help you visualize your desired look.\n2. **Start with a neutral base**: Choose a neutral color palette for your walls, flooring, and larger furniture pieces. This will provide a calm background for adding pops of color and pattern through accessories like throw pillows, rugs, and decorative items.\n3. **Balance scale and proportion**: Ensure that the furniture is proportional to the room and each other. For example, a large sectional sofa might require a larger coffee table to balance it out.\n4. **Layer lighting**: Combine different light sources, such as table lamps, floor lamps, and overhead lighting, to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n5. **Add texture and pattern**: Mix different textures like velvet, linen, and wood to add depth and visual interest. Patterned rugs, throw blankets, and pillows can also add a cozy touch.\n6. **Consider the 60-30-10 rule**: Allocate 60% of your budget to essential items like a sofa and coffee table, 30% to secondary pieces like chairs and lamps, and 10% to decorative accessories.\n7. **Don't forget about negative space**: Leave some breathing room between furniture pieces to create a sense of flow and visual relaxation.\n\nNow, tell me more about your living room! What's the approximate size, shape, and current layout? Do you have any specific design challenges or areas you're struggling with?",
