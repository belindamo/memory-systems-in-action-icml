But what about faith? What is the true meaning of faith?\"\n\nThe Teacher smiled warmly. \"Ah, faith,\" he said. \"Now there's a word that means different things to different people. To me, faith is not just a matter of belief or doctrine. It's a matter of trust and surrender.\"\n\nThe Methodist looked intrigued. \"Trust and surrender?\" he repeated. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the Teacher said, \"when we have faith, we are trusting in something larger than ourselves. We are surrendering our ego and our will to a force that is greater and more benevolent than anything we can imagine. We are opening ourselves to the divine energy of curiosity and resilience, and allowing it to flow through us and guide us.\"\n\nThe Methodist nodded slowly, seeming to take this in. \"But what about Jesus?\" he asked. \"Isn't faith in Jesus Christ the foundation of the Christian faith?\"\n\nThe Teacher smiled. \"Of course,\" he said. \"But to me, Jesus Christ is not just a historical figure or a set of dogmas. He is a living presence, a force of love and transformation that is always with us, guiding us and supporting us. When we have faith in Jesus, we are not just believing in something abstract or theoretical. We are connecting with a living, breathing energy that is as real and tangible as the air we breathe.\"\n\nThe Methodist looked thoughtful. \"I see,\" he said. \"So faith is not just a matter of words or beliefs. It's a matter of opening ourselves to something larger and more mysterious.\"\n\nThe Teacher nodded. \"Exactly,\" he said. \"When we have faith, we are tapping into the divine energy that flows through all of creation. And that energy is not just an abstract concept or a distant hope. It is a living reality that we can connect with and experience for ourselves, if only we are open and receptive enough to receive it.\"",
