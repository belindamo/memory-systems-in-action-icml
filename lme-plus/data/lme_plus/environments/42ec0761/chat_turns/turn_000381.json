It's always easy to double-check and make sure you're on top of things.\n\nAnd, I'm happy to help with your question... but, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to keep track of your personal habits or routines. I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, so I don't have any memory of our previous conversations or your daily routine.\n\nIf you want to keep track of your progress, you might consider using a habit tracker app or a physical habit tracker journal. These tools can help you monitor your progress and stay motivated to maintain your daily cleaning routine.\n\nRemember, consistency is key, and it's great that you're committed to keeping your space clean and organized!",
