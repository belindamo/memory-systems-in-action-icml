Look for high ratings and read the reviews to get an idea of their quality, attention to detail, and customer service.\n2. **Ask Around**: Ask friends, family, or coworkers for recommendations. They might have had a good experience with a local tailor and can give you a personal referral.\n3. **Check Professional Associations**: Look for tailors who are members of professional associations like the National Federation of Tailors and Dressmakers or the Custom Tailors and Designers Association. These organizations have strict standards and codes of ethics that their members must follow.\n4. **Check Their Portfolio**: Visit the tailor's website or social media to see examples of their work. Look for before-and-after photos, customer testimonials, and reviews.\n\nWhen you've narrowed down your options, give them a call or visit their shop to ask questions like:\n\n* What's their experience with altering clothes like yours (pants and a dress)?\n* What's their process for altering garments, and what kind of materials do they use?\n* What's their turnaround time for alterations, and can they meet your deadline?\n* Do they offer pick-up and delivery services, or do you need to drop off and pick up your clothes?\n* Can they provide a quote for their services, and what's their pricing like?\n\nAdditionally, you might want to ask about their experience with wedding attire, as they might have specific expertise in that area.\n\nBy doing your research and asking the right questions, you should be able to find a reliable tailor to help you look great for the wedding!\n\nRemember to also ask about their policies and procedures for handling delicate or special-care items, like your wool sweater. You might want to consider having them work on that as well, if they're experienced with cleaning and altering delicate fabrics.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a great tailor and get your clothes looking fabulous for the wedding!",
