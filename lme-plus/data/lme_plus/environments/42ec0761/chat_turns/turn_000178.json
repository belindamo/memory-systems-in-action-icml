  "content": "The case material of your Omega Seamaster is likely made from a type of stainless steel, which is a popular choice for watch cases due to its durability, corrosion resistance, and attractive appearance.\n\nOmega typically uses a specific type of stainless steel alloy, known as 316L or 904L, for their watch cases. Here's a brief overview of each:\n\n**316L Stainless Steel:**\n\n* 316L is a widely used stainless steel alloy in the watch industry.\n* It contains a minimum of 16% chromium, 10% nickel, and 2% molybdenum, which provides excellent corrosion resistance and durability.\n* 316L is resistant to pitting, crevice corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking, making it suitable for use in harsh environments.\n* It's also non-magnetic, which is important for watches that require magnetic resistance.\n\n**904L Stainless Steel:**\n\n* 904L is a higher-grade stainless steel alloy used by Omega for some of their high-end watches, including certain Seamaster models.\n* It contains a minimum of 20% chromium, 25% nickel, and 4% molybdenum, which provides even better corrosion resistance and durability than 316L.\n* 904L is more resistant to pitting and crevice corrosion than 316L, making it suitable for use in extreme environments, such as deep-sea diving.\n* It's also more resistant to scratches and wear, which helps maintain the watch's appearance over time.\n\n**Other Materials:**\n\n* Omega may also use other materials, such as titanium, gold, or ceramic, for specific Seamaster models. These materials offer unique properties, such as lightness, strength, or scratch resistance, that can enhance the watch's performance and appearance.\n\nTo determine the specific material used in your Seamaster's case, you can:\n\n1. Check the watch's documentation, such as the warranty card or instruction manual.\n2. Look for engravings or markings on the case back or inside the case.\n3. Contact an authorized Omega dealer or a professional watchmaker for assistance.\n\nKeep in mind that Omega may have used different materials for different Seamaster models over the years, so it's essential to verify the specific material used in your watch.",
