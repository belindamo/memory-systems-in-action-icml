I'd be happy to help you with some trail recommendations.\n\nBefore we dive into that, I'm curious - you mentioned an Instagram group about cats? Is that Whisker Warriors? I've heard great things about that community!\n\nNow, back to Red Rock Canyon: it's a beautiful area with many trails for all skill levels. Here are some popular ones:\n\n1. **Turtlehead Peak Trail**: A moderate 4.6-mile out-and-back hike with stunning views of the canyon and the Las Vegas Valley.\n2. **Calico Tanks Trail**: A 2.5-mile out-and-back hike that takes you to a scenic tank (a natural water basin) surrounded by red rock formations.\n3. **Lost Creek Trail**: A relatively easy 4.2-mile out-and-back hike that follows a creek and offers great views of the canyon's unique geological features.\n4. **Willow Springs Trail**: A 4.5-mile out-and-back hike that takes you through a lush canyon and ends at a scenic spring.\n5. **Moenkopi Trail**: A shorter, 2-mile out-and-back hike that's great for families or those looking for a quick, easy hike with nice views.\n\nRemember to bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and snacks, as the Nevada desert can be unforgiving. Also, be sure to check the trail conditions and any restrictions before you head out.\n\nWhich of these trails sounds appealing to you and your friends?",
