  "content": "A 5th level Sorcerer can cast the 2nd level Druid spell Flame Blade by using the Sorcerer's Spellcasting feature to learn the spell.\n\nThe Spellcasting feature allows a Sorcerer to learn and cast spells from the Sorcerer spell list. However, there are a few ways a Sorcerer can learn and cast spells from other spell lists, such as through the Magic Initiate or Ritual Caster feats, or by multiclassing into a class that has access to the desired spell.\n\nIn the case of Flame Blade, a Sorcerer can learn this spell by taking the Magic Initiate feat and choosing Druid as their chosen class. This would allow them to learn two cantrips and one 1st-level spell from the Druid spell list, which could include Flame Blade. Alternatively, they could multiclass into Druid and gain access to the spell that way.\n\nOnce the Sorcerer has learned the Flame Blade spell, they can cast it using their Sorcerer spell slots, provided they have a spell slot of 2nd level or higher available. The spell's duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes, and the caster creates a fiery blade that can be used to make melee spell attacks, dealing 3d6 fire damage on a hit.\n\nIt's worth noting that, while a Sorcerer may be able to learn and cast spells from other spell lists, their primary focus will typically be on the Sorcerer spell list, which has many powerful spells that can enhance their abilities and deal significant damage.",
