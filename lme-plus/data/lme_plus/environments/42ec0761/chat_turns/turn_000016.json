  "content": "The Euclidean distance between two points (a,b) and (x,y) is given by the formula:\n\nsqrt((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2)\n\nThis formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFor example, if the coordinates of the two points are (3,4) and (6,8), the Euclidean distance between them would be:\n\nsqrt((6-3)^2 + (8-4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5",
