  "content": "The indefinite integral of 1/x is given by the formula:\n\nln |x| + C\n\nWhere C is a constant. To find the definite integral of 1/x from x=1 to x=2, you can evaluate the definite integral using this formula by substituting the upper and lower limits of integration into the indefinite integral and taking the difference:\n\nintegral from x=1 to x=2 of (1/x) dx = ln |2| - ln |1|\n= ln 2 - ln 1\n= ln 2\n\nSo the definite integral of 1/x from x=1 to x=2 is equal to ln 2.",
