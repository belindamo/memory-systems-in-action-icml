  "content": "Simplicity and functionality are important considerations in architecture, and many architects today prioritize designing efficient and practical buildings that can be constructed with less waste and expense.\n\nThat being said, the Beaux-Arts style was a response to a particular cultural moment, and it reflected the values of that time. It's important to recognize that what may be viewed as a waste of resources from our modern perspective may not have been seen that way by people in the past.\n\nAdditionally, grand buildings can have lasting cultural and historical significance, beyond their practical usefulness. They can become landmarks and symbols of their cities or countries, and serve as important cultural heritage sites that help us to remember and understand our collective history. Preserving these buildings can also have economic benefits, as they can draw tourists and help to stimulate local economies.\n\nIn summary, while it is always important to consider practicality and sustainability in design, it's also important to remember that architecture is shaped by cultural and historical values. The Beaux-Arts style and similar grand architectural styles may have been driven by different values than we hold today, but they still have cultural and historical value that we should recognize and preserve.",
