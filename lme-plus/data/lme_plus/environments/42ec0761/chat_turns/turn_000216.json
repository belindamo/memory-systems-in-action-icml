  "content": "It's difficult to estimate the exact number of people that would be left without electricity and computers from a Tiamat radiation blast, as it depends on a number of factors such as the strength of the blast, the density of population in the affected areas, and the resilience of the electrical infrastructure.\n\nHowever, given the size of the blast area you described (from around Calgary in Canada to Jacksonville in Florida, and from Juarez in Mexico to Quebec in Canada), it's likely that millions of people would be affected. Even if some areas managed to protect their electrical infrastructure from the initial effects of the blast, the subsequent effects of radiation and the need for repairs could lead to widespread blackouts and disruptions to services that rely on electricity and computers.\n\nOverall, it's safe to say that a Tiamat radiation blast on this scale would have a profound and long-lasting impact on the affected regions, and could result in the collapse of many institutions and systems that rely on electricity and computer technology.",
