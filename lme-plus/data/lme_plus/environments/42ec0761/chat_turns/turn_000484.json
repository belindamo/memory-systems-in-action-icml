Release and repeat 10-15 times on each side.\n3. **Neck Circles:** Slowly move your head in a circular motion, first clockwise and then counterclockwise. Repeat 5-10 times in each direction.\n4. **Neck Stretch:** Place your right hand on your left shoulder, and gently pull your head towards your right shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds and release. Repeat on the other side.\n\n**Shoulder Self-Massage:**\n\n1. **Shoulder Rolls:** Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion. Repeat 10-15 times.\n2. **Arm Circles:** Hold your arms straight out to the sides and make small circles with your hands.

It's also a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or licensed massage therapist if you have any underlying medical conditions or concerns.\n\nI hope these techniques help you release tension and promote relaxation in your neck and shoulders!",
