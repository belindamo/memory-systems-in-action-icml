  "content": "Cassius Winston was a fantastic player, but there are plenty of other talented players in the Big Ten to follow.\n\nThe Big Ten is always a competitive conference, and this season is no exception. Several teams have a good chance of making a deep run in the tournament. Here are a few to keep an eye on:\n\n1. **Purdue Boilermakers**: As I mentioned earlier, Purdue has a strong team with a dominant center in Zach Edey. They have a well-balanced offense and a stingy defense, making them a strong contender.\n2. **Indiana Hoosiers**: Indiana has had a resurgence this season, led by Trayce Jackson-Davis (19.3 ppg, 11.1 rpg). They have a strong defense and a balanced offense, which could take them far in the tournament.\n3. **Illinois Fighting Illini**: The Illini have a talented roster, led by Cole Hawkins (15.7 ppg, 6.3 rpg) and Terrence Shannon Jr. (17.1 ppg). They have a strong defense and can score from both inside and outside.\n4. **Maryland Terrapins**: Maryland has a well-rounded team with a strong offense, led by Jahmir Young (16.1 ppg) and Donta Scott (12.3 ppg). They've had some impressive wins this season and could make a surprise run.\n\nThese teams all have the potential to make a deep run in the tournament, but it's always difficult to predict how they'll perform in the single-elimination format. Keep an eye on their matchups and performances, and you might discover some new favorite players or teams!\n\nWhich of these teams do you think has the most potential to make a deep run?",
