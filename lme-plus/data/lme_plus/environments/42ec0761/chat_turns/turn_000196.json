  "content": "Branded workwear may not be necessary for employees who work remotely or off-site, as these employees may not come into contact with customers or clients that would benefit from the recognition or uniformity conveyed by branded workwear, nor would it be necessary for safety purposes.\n\nIn case it is required that remote workers wearing branded workwear could still benefit the company's brand image, companies might still offer branded workwear to these employees, but it would be on a smaller scale. \nFor instance, it could include branded accessories like badges, hats or masks, which would still be visible to customers during virtual meetings or phone calls, but it would not be a full uniform.\n\nHowever, in situations where branding is not necessary, employees could wear their own comfortable workwear, unless there are specific dress requirements for their work that ensure their safety and personal protection.",
