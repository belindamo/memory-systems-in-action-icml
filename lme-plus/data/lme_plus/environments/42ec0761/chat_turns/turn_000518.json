  "content": "To incorporate domain knowledge into the causal graph, you can modify the initial graph obtained from the previous steps. In this example, we'll ensure that Sleep directly impacts Exercise but not Resilience Index.\n\nWe assume that you already have a directed graph from the previous steps, stored in a variable called `custom_graph`.\n\n1. Get the list of existing edges:\n```python\nexisting_edges = custom_graph.getEdges()\n```\n1. Remove the edge between Sleep and Resilience Index, if it exists:\n```python\nedge_to_remove = \"Sleep --> Resilience Index\"\nif edge_to_remove in existing_edges:\n    custom_graph.removeEdge(edge_to_remove)\n```\n1. Add the edge between Sleep and Exercise, if it doesn't exist:\n```python\nedge_to_add = \"Sleep --> Exercise\"\nif edge_to_add not in existing_edges:\n    custom_graph.addEdge(edge_to_add)\n```\n1. Run the GES algorithm with the modified initial graph:\n```python\ntetrad.run(algoId='ges', dfs=df, scoreId='mixed-var-polynominal-bic', penaltyDiscount=penalty_discount, initialGraph=custom_graph)\n```\n1. Get the resulting causal graph:\n```python\ngraph = tetrad.getTetradGraph()\nprint(graph)\n```\nBy incorporating domain knowledge into the causal graph, you ensure that the graph is consistent with prior understanding. This can help improve the reliability and interpretability of the inferred causal relationships. Note that these specific examples are for illustration purposes only; you should adapt the code to incorporate the domain knowledge relevant to your specific problem and dataset.",
