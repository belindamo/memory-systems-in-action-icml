Following local running clubs, fitness studios, or community centers on social media to stay updated on upcoming events.\n4. Searching for hashtags like #charityrun, #charitywalk, #fundraiserun, or #fundraisewalk on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.\n\nRemember to register for events in advance to secure your spot and ensure you receive any necessary information and materials.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a charity run or walk that aligns with your interests and values!",
