  "content": "Historical fiction novels can indeed vary in length, but on average, they tend to fall between 350-500 pages. However, it's not uncommon to find books that are longer, sometimes exceeding 600-800 pages.\n\nIn recent years, there's been a trend towards longer books in the historical fiction genre, possibly due to the complexity of the stories being told and the level of research involved. Authors like Hilary Mantel, Ken Follett, and Philippa Gregory are known for their detailed and immersive storytelling, which can result in longer page counts.\n\nThat being said, some historical fiction novels can be more concise, ranging from 250-350 pages. These books might focus on a specific event, time period, or character's story, allowing for a more streamlined narrative.\n\nIn the case of **The Alice Network**, the page count is around 432 pages in the hardcover edition, which is fairly typical for a historical fiction novel. **The Women in the Castle** has a slightly longer page count, around 512 pages in the hardcover edition.\n\nUltimately, the page count shouldn't deter you from reading a book. If the story and characters capture your interest, you'll likely find yourself invested in the narrative, regardless of the page count.\n\nDo you have a preferred page count or reading format (e.g., e-book, audiobook, physical book) that affects your reading experience?",
