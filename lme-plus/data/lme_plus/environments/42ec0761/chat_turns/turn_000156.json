  "content": "Great job on updating your driver's license with your new name, Emily!\n\nThe time it takes to update a driver's license with a new address varies by state, but it's usually a relatively quick process. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n**In-person update:**\n\n* Visit your local DMV office and submit the required documents (proof of new address, identification, etc.).\n* The update is usually processed on the spot, and you'll receive a new driver's license with your updated address.\n* Wait time: Typically 15-30 minutes to an hour, depending on the DMV office's workload.\n\n**Online or mail-in update:**\n\n* Fill out the change of address form online or by mail, and submit the required documents.\n* Processing time: 7-10 business days to receive your updated driver's license by mail.\n* Some states may offer expedited shipping options for an additional fee.\n\n**Real ID-compliant driver's license:**\n\n* If you need a Real ID-compliant driver's license, you may need to visit a DMV office in person and provide additional documentation.\n* Processing time: Varies by state, but typically takes a few weeks to a few months.\n\nKeep in mind that these times are estimates, and the actual processing time may vary depending on your state's DMV workload and policies.\n\nIt's great that you're on top of updating your driver's license with your new address, Emily!",
