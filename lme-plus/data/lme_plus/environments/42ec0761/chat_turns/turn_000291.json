It's always exciting to be in the middle of a good book, and it's even better when you can make progress on it during your commute.\n\nBeing on chapter 7 means you're making good progress, and with your daily goal of 20 pages, you'll likely finish the book soon. It's awesome that you're motivated to make the most of your commute time to get to the end of the story.\n\nSince you're enjoying the book, I have to ask: What's the book about, and what do you think of it so far? Is it a new author or series for you, or are you a fan of the genre?\n\nAlso, do you find that reading during your commute helps you transition into a more relaxed mindset before work, or does it get you pumped up and ready to tackle the day?",
