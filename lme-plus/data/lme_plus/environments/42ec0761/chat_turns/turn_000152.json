It's understandable that you're getting anxious, especially with your trip approaching soon.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to help you track the status of your application:\n\n1. **Check the status online**: Visit the U.S. Department of State's website ([travel.state.gov](http://travel.state.gov)) and use the \"Online Passport Status System\" to track your application. You'll need your application number or last name, birthdate, and last four digits of your Social Security number.\n2. **Contact the National Passport Information Center**: Reach out to the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 (1-877-4USA-PPT) or [NPIC@state.gov](mailto:NPIC@state.gov). They can provide you with an update on the status of your application.\n3. **Check your mail regularly**: Make sure to check your mail regularly, as your new passport may arrive sooner than expected.\n\nIf you're concerned about your trip, you may want to consider expediting the process. You can contact the National Passport Information Center to discuss your options, including expedited service at a Regional Passport Agency.\n\nFingers crossed that your new passport arrives soon, Emily!",
