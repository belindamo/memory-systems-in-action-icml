I'd be delighted to help you with landscaping design ideas for a patio and small garden combo that's perfect for entertaining and relaxing, with a beachy twist.\n\n**Patio and Small Garden Combo:**\n\n1. **Coastal Color Scheme:** Choose a calming palette that reflects the beachy vibe: shades of blue, green, sandy neutrals, and coral-inspired hues.\n2. **Patio Shape and Size:** Consider a rectangular or L-shaped patio to create defined spaces for seating, dining, and relaxing. A smaller patio (around 12x15 feet) can be cozy and intimate, while a larger one (15x20 feet) can accommodate more guests.\n3. **Materials:** Use natural materials like bluestone, flagstone, or concrete pavers in a beachy color palette. Add warmth with wood accents, like a wooden pergola or a beachy-style outdoor furniture.\n4. **Garden Elements:**\n\t* Incorporate low-maintenance plants like succulents, beach morning glories, or coastal grasses that thrive in salty air.\n\t* Add a small water feature, like a bubbler or a small fountain, to create a soothing sound.\n\t* Incorporate a vertical element, like a trellis or a living wall, to add visual interest and create a sense of enclosure.\n5. **Lighting:** String lights, lanterns, or tabletop torches can create a warm, inviting ambiance in the evening.\n\n**Beach-Inspired Landscaping Ideas:**\n\n1. **Dune-Inspired Plantings:** Create a naturalistic planting scheme with beach grasses, succulents, and driftwood-inspired elements.\n2. **Sea Glass Accents:** Incorporate sea glass-colored glass pebbles or tiles into your patio design to add a pop of color and beachy charm.\n3. **Driftwood Decor:** Use driftwood pieces as decorative elements, such as a statement wall, a planter, or even a unique outdoor sculpture.\n4. **Beachy Pathways:** Design a meandering pathway using shells, pebbles, or small stones to lead visitors to different areas of your outdoor space.\n5. **Sea-Inspired Hardscaping:** Incorporate natural stone or concrete elements that resemble beach rocks or waves, like a wave-shaped retaining wall or a stone bench.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Consider the Wind:** Since you're near the beach, be mindful of wind direction and speed when designing your patio and garden. Choose plants and structures that can withstand coastal winds.\n2. **Incorporate Storage:** Add storage benches, planters, or a shed to keep outdoor furniture, beach gear, and other items out of sight.\n3. **Think About Functionality:** Design your space to accommodate your lifestyle and needs. Consider adding a outdoor kitchen, fire pit, or a shaded area for hot summer days.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create a beautiful, functional, and relaxing outdoor space that reflects the beachy vibe of your vacation home!",
