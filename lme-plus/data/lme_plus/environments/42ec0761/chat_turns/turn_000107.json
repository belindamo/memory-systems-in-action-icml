  "content": "A Monk's Armor Class (AC) is calculated using the following formula:\n\n10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier\n\nA Monk's AC is primarily based on their ability to dodge and avoid attacks, rather than wearing armor. Their unarmored defense ability allows them to calculate their AC as 10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier, provided they are not wearing armor or using a shield. This calculation assumes that the Monk has been trained in the martial arts and can use their agility and wisdom to evade attacks.\n\nIn addition to their unarmored defense, Monks have several abilities that can increase their AC, such as the Patient Defense feature, which allows them to spend a bonus action to dodge, granting attackers disadvantage on their attack rolls. Additionally, some Monk subclasses offer additional benefits that can increase AC, such as the Way of the Kensei, which allows the Monk to add their Wisdom modifier to their AC when wielding certain weapons.\n\nIt's worth noting that Monks cannot use shields or wear armor without negating their unarmored defense ability, so they must rely on other tactics to increase their AC. Overall, a Monk's high mobility and ability to dodge attacks make them a formidable opponent even without wearing traditional armor.",
