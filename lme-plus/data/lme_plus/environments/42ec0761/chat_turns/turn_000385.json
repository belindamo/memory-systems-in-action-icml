  "content": "A grilled cheese sandwich with ham and tomato is a classic combo.\n\nFor a side dish, I'd recommend something light and refreshing to balance out the richness of the sandwich. Here are a few ideas:\n\n**Option 1: Carrot Sticks with Hummus**\n\n* Cut up some carrots into sticks and serve with a side of hummus for a crunchy and healthy snack\n\n**Option 2: Fresh Fruit Salad**\n\n* Mix together your favorite fruits, such as grapes, berries, and apple slices, for a sweet and refreshing side dish\n\n**Option 3: Tomato Soup**\n\n* Heat up a can of tomato soup or make your own using a quick recipe for a comforting and savory side dish\n\n**Option 4: Mixed Greens Salad**\n\n* Prepare a simple salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a light vinaigrette dressing for a light and refreshing side dish\n\n**Option 5: Roasted Vegetables**\n\n* Roast some cherry tomatoes, broccoli, or asparagus in the oven with a drizzle of olive oil and salt for a healthy and flavorful side dish\n\nThese side dishes are all quick, easy, and pair well with the grilled cheese sandwich. You can choose one or more based on your preferences and dietary needs.\n\nEnjoy your lunch!",
