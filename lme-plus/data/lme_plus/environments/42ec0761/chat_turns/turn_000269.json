Domesticated pigeons are often used for racing or as a source of food. They are also bred for their desirable traits. In some cultures, they are considered a symbol of peace and goodwill, and their presence is encouraged in urban areas.\n\nBecause of their widespread domestication, pigeons are found in cities all over the world. They are a familiar sight in parks, on building ledges, and on busy streets. Their adaptability, omnivorous diet, and ability to breed year-round make them resilient and capable of thriving in urban environments.\n\nHowever, their overpopulation can cause problems, including disease transmission, damage to buildings, and pollution. As a result, some cities have implemented measures to control their population, including restricting access to food sources and implementing humane population control measures.",
