They often have access to information about in-store only deals, unadvertised sales, or special promotions that aren't listed on the website.\n\nHere are some questions you can ask the sales associate:\n\n1. **Do you have any in-store only deals or promotions on KitchenAid stand mixers?**\n2. **Are there any unadvertised sales or discounts available on this specific model?**\n3. **Do you offer any bundle deals or discounts if I purchase multiple items together?**\n4. **Are there any floor models or open-box items available for this product, and what's the discount?**\n5. **Do you have any upcoming sales or promotions that I should know about?**\n6. **Can I get a discount if I pay with cash or use a specific payment method?**\n7. **Do you offer any student, military, or senior discounts?**\n8. **Are there any manufacturer's rebates or promotions available on this product?**\n\nRemember to be friendly and polite when asking these questions. Sales associates are more likely to help you out if you're respectful and courteous.\n\nAdditionally, if you have a Bed Bath & Beyond credit card, be sure to mention it to the sales associate. They might have exclusive offers or discounts available for credit cardholders.\n\nBy asking the right questions, you might be able to snag an even better deal on your KitchenAid stand mixer!",
