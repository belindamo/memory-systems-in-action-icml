      "content": "Yes, there are a few other words that could be used instead of \"unterschreibt\" in this sentence. Some options might include:\n\n* Unterzeichnet (signs)\n* Bindet sich (binds himself)\n* Verpflichtet sich (commits himself)\n\nThe exact word choice would depend on the context and the intended meaning of the sentence. For example, if the team is signing Lahm to a contract, \"unterzeichnet\" or \"verpflichtet sich\" might be more appropriate. If Lahm is simply joining the team, \"bindet sich\" might be a better choice. It's always a good idea to double-check with a native speaker or a reliable translation resource to make sure you're using the most appropriate word in a given context."
