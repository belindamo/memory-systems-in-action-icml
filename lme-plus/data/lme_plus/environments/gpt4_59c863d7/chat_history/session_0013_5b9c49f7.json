I'm a text-based AI assistant, and I don't have the capability to retrieve or display visual data like graphs.\n\nBut I can offer some suggestions to help you track your Instagram engagement:\n\n1. **Instagram Insights**: If you have an Instagram business account, you can use Instagram Insights to track your engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, saves, and more. Insights provide a detailed breakdown of your account's performance over time.\n2. **Third-party analytics tools**: There are many third-party analytics tools available that can help you track your Instagram engagement. Some popular options include Hootsuite, Sprout Social, and Iconosquare. These tools can provide you with detailed reports and graphs to help you visualize your engagement metrics.\n3. **Manual tracking**: You can also track your engagement metrics manually by taking note of your likes, comments, and other engagement metrics for each post. You can use a spreadsheet or a note-taking app to record your data and create your own graphs.\n\nIf you need help with setting up Instagram Insights or finding a third-party analytics tool, I'd be happy to provide more information and guidance!"

Since you've already started creating Reels, I'd recommend continuing to do so, but with a strategic approach.

You can post 2-3 Reels per week and 3-5 regular posts per week.\n\nBy doing so, you'll cater to different content preferences and keep your audience engaged. Some users might prefer the quick, visually-driven format of Reels, while others might enjoy the more in-depth content of regular posts.\n\n**Tips for creating effective Reels**:\n\n1. **Keep it short and sweet**: Reels should be 60 seconds or less. Make sure you're concise and to the point.\n2. **Use catchy music**: Music plays a huge role in making Reels engaging. Choose a catchy, upbeat track that complements your content.\n3. **Add captions and hashtags**: Include captions and relevant hashtags in your Reels to increase discoverability and engagement.\n4. **Experiment with formats**: Try different formats, such as tutorials, Q&A sessions, or \"day-in-the-life\" vlogs, to keep your Reels fresh and engaging.\n\n**Tracking performance**:\n\n1. **Monitor your Reels' performance**: Use Instagram Insights to track the performance of your Reels, including views, engagement, and reach.\n2. **Adjust your strategy**: Based on your analytics, adjust your Reels strategy to focus on the types of content that perform well.\n\nBy incorporating Reels into your content mix, you'll not only reach a broader audience but also keep your content fresh and engaging. Keep experimenting, and don't be afraid to try new things!\n\nWhat do you think about incorporating IGTV or IG Live into your content strategy?"
