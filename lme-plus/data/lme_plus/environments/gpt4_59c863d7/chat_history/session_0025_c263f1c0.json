I would definitely recommend it to others who are interested in learning new cooking skills. It was a great way to meet new people who shared similar interests, and we got to enjoy the fruits of our labor afterwards!\n\nBy the way, I'm thinking of making some green tea to pair with my sushi tonight.

Adjust to your taste preferences.\n4. **Steep for the right amount of time**: Steep the tea for 1-2 minutes, depending on the type of tea and your desired level of bitterness.\n5. **Use filtered water**: Use fresh, filtered water to prevent any impurities or minerals from affecting the flavor of the tea.\n6. **Serve in a suitable vessel**: Use a ceramic or glass teapot and cup to prevent any metallic flavors from affecting the tea.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to brew a delicious and refreshing cup of green tea to pair with your sushi dinner.
