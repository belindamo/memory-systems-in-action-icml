  "content": "I really appreciate these tips! I think I'll go with the private helicopter tour proposal. It sounds so romantic and unique. Since we attended my cousin Rachel's wedding at the Bellagio Hotel last weekend, I was thinking of incorporating some elements from that special day into the proposal. Maybe I could have a custom banner or sign made with a message like \"Will you marry me?\" or \"Forever with you\" to display during the helicopter tour. What do you think?",
