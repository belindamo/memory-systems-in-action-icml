  "content": "I think I'll go with a hybrid approach. I want to focus on portraits, but I also don't want to limit myself to just one genre. I like the idea of having a primary focus on portraits, but still allowing myself to experiment with other genres occasionally. That way, I can still develop my skills in portrait photography, but also have some creative freedom to try new things. Plus, it'll keep my project fresh and exciting. Do you have any tips on how to plan and organize my project, so I can stay on track and make the most of my 365 days?",
