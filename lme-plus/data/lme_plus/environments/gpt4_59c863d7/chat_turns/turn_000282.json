  "content": "Pakistan is navigating these complexities by adopting a pragmatic foreign policy approach. Here are some strategies that Pakistan has employed to balance its relations with its neighbors and China:\n\n1. Maintaining strong ties with China: Pakistan has continued to strengthen its economic and strategic partnership with China. This is evident from the deepening of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has resulted in significant investment in infrastructure, energy, and other sectors in Pakistan. Furthermore, the frequent high-level visits by the leaders of both countries have further consolidated their ties.\n\n2. Engaging with other regional powers: Pakistan has been engaging with other regional powers such as Russia, Iran, and Turkey to enhance its diplomatic reach beyond China. Strengthening economic and strategic ties with these countries can help to reduce its reliance on China and provide a buffer in case of any adverse policies.\n\n3. Initiating Confidence Building Measures: Pakistan has initiated confidence-building measures with neighbors like India and Afghanistan. Such measures include dialogue processes to address bilateral disputes, exchange of visits between civil and military leaders, and economic collaborations to increase regional integration.\n\n4. Balancing its security interests and economic ties: Pakistan has been balancing its security interests and economic ties with China, India, and other regional powers. For instance, it has been participating in China-led security forums like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) while maintaining close relations with India, which is not a member of the SCO.\n\n5. Providing humanitarian assistance and support to neighbors: Pakistan has been providing humanitarian assistance and support to its neighboring countries, including Afghanistan and Iran, during the Covid-19 pandemic. Such gestures can help build bridges and improve relations between Pakistan and its neighbors.\n\nIn conclusion, Pakistan's pragmatic approach to balancing regional powers has allowed it to navigate the complexities of China's growing influence in the region, maintain its strategic autonomy, and foster closer regional integration.",
