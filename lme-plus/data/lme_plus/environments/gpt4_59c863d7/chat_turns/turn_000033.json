As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or plans, but I can certainly provide suggestions for you!\n\nAfter the proposal, you might consider celebrating with a romantic dinner at a special restaurant, a weekend getaway to a cozy bed and breakfast, or a relaxing trip to a beautiful destination. You could also share the news with friends and family, either in person or through a heartfelt announcement on social media.\n\nHere are a few more ideas to make the celebration even more special:\n\n1. **Champagne toast**: Pop open a bottle of champagne and toast to your engagement, either in the helicopter or at a romantic spot after the flight.\n2. **Romantic dinner**: Book a reservation at a Michelin-starred restaurant or a cozy, intimate spot with a special menu just for the two of you.\n3. **Weekend getaway**: Plan a quick weekend escape to a nearby city or a cozy bed and breakfast, where you can relax and enjoy each other's company.\n4. **Sunrise or sunset viewing**: Wake up early and watch the sunrise together, or find a spot to watch the sunset, symbolizing the beginning of your new chapter.\n5. **Personalized gift**: Give each other a thoughtful, personalized gift to commemorate the occasion, such as a custom photo album or a special piece of jewelry.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to celebrate your love and commitment to each other in a way that feels special and meaningful to both of you.\n\nWhat do you think?
