The citrus will also complement the delicate flavors of the green tea nicely.\n\nIt was my pleasure to chat with you! I'm glad I could help and provide some useful tips and recommendations. It's always wonderful to connect with someone who shares similar interests and passions.\n\nI hope you have a fantastic time preparing dinner and enjoying your homemade sushi and green tea.

Happy cooking and happy sipping!\n\n(And don't forget to enjoy your morning green tea tomorrow, too!)",
