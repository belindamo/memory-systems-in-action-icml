Here are some recommendations for great desk lamps that can help alleviate the shadow issue:\n\n1. **Flexible Arm Desk Lamp**: Look for a lamp with a flexible arm or neck that can be adjusted to direct light exactly where you need it. This will allow you to position the light to avoid the overhead shadow and focus it on your workspace.\n2. **LED Desk Lamp**: LED lamps are energy-efficient and produce minimal heat.
