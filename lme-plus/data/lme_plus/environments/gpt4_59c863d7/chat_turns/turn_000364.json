The general rule of thumb is to expect to pay between 2% to 5% of the purchase price in closing costs. This can vary depending on the location, type of property, and other factors, but 2% to 5% is a good starting point.\n\nBased on this range, for a $425,000 house, you could expect to pay:\n\n* 2% of $425,000 = $8,500 in closing costs\n* 3% of $425,000 = $12,750 in closing costs\n* 4% of $425,000 = $17,000 in closing costs\n* 5% of $425,000 = $21,250 in closing costs\n\nKeep in mind that these are just rough estimates, and your actual closing costs may be higher or lower.\n\nSince you mentioned you found a better deal on a different property, you'll want to calculate the closing costs based on the new purchase price. Just plug in the new price into the percentage ranges above to get an estimate.\n\nAdditionally, it's a good idea to factor in other costs associated with buying a home, such as:\n\n* Inspection fees (around $500 to $1,000)\n* Appraisal fees (around $300 to $1,000)\n* Title insurance and escrow fees (around $1,500 to $3,000)\n* Loan origination fees (around 0.5% to 1% of the loan amount)\n\nYour lender and real estate agent can provide more detailed estimates of these costs based on your specific situation.\n\nRemember to also consider other expenses associated with homeownership, such as property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, when calculating your overall affordability.\n\nGood luck with your home buying journey!",
