  "content": "Aylen stood in the middle of a deserted street, her heart pounding in her chest. She could see the figure standing a few feet away, its form shifting and twisting as if it were made of smoke.\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Aylen shouted, her voice trembling with anger and fear. \"Why are you showing me all of these terrible things? Why are you trying to destroy the world?\"\n\nThe figure let out a cold, mocking laugh. \"Why not?\" it said, its voice echoing through the empty streets. \"It's so much fun to watch the world burn, to see the fear and suffering on the faces of the mortals. And as for you, Aylen, you're just a convenient tool. Someone to show me the way.\"\n\nAylen clenched her fists, her frustration and anger boiling over. \"I won't be used by you!\" she screamed, lunging forward to try and strike the figure. But her fists passed right through it, as if it were made of smoke.\n\nThe figure chuckled, its form shifting again. \"You can't touch me, Aylen,\" it said. \"I'm beyond your reach. But don't worry, I'll be with you every step of the way, tormenting you and showing you all the horrors to come.\"\n\nAylen felt a wave of despair wash over her as the figure disappeared, leaving her alone in the empty street. She knew that it was right, that she was trapped and there was nothing she could do to stop it.",
