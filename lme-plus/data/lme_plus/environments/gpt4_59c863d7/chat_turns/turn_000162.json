Lenovo offers a wide range of laptops, but I can give you a general idea of the weight range for some of their popular models.\n\nTypically, Lenovo laptops can weigh anywhere from 3.9 pounds to 5.5 pounds, depending on the model, size, and features. Here are some examples of popular Lenovo laptops and their weights:\n\n* Lenovo IdeaPad 330S: 3.96 pounds\n* Lenovo IdeaPad 530S: 4.23 pounds\n* Lenovo Yoga C740: 4.3 pounds\n* Lenovo ThinkPad E495: 4.23 pounds\n\nKeep in mind that these are just a few examples, and weights can vary depending on the specific model and configuration.\n\nGiven that you got a doorbuster deal, it's likely that your laptop was a more budget-friendly option. In that case, it's possible that your laptop weighs around 4-4.5 pounds.\n\nThe Anker laptop Stand, which I mentioned earlier, has a weight capacity of up to 8.8 pounds, so it should be able to support a laptop in the 4-4.5 pound range.\n\nIf you're still unsure, I can try to help you narrow down the possibilities or explore other laptop stand options that can support your Lenovo laptop. Just let me know!",
