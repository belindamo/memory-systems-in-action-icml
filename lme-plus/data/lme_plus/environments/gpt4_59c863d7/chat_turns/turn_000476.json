  "content": "Here is a table that lists the year that slave ships first reached Africa, the countries they went to, and where they went to in America:\n\n| Year | African Country | American Destination |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1526 | West Central Africa | Hispaniola |\n| 1562 | West Central Africa | Mexico and Peru |\n| 1619 | West Central Africa | Jamestown, Virginia |\n| 1637 | Angola | Massachusetts |\n| 1650 | West Central Africa | Barbados |\n| 1672 | Senegal | South Carolina |\n| 1698 | Senegal | South Carolina |\n| 1701 | Senegal | South Carolina |\n| 1716 | Angola | Virginia |\n| 1730 | West Central Africa | South Carolina |\n\nIt is worth noting that this table only lists the first year that slave ships reached certain African countries and American destinations, and that the transatlantic slave trade continued for several centuries after these dates. Additionally, many other African countries were also sources of enslaved people, and many other American colonies and states also received enslaved people via the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nSource :\n\n* \"The Transatlantic slave trade: a database on CD-ROM\" by David Eltis and David Richardson, Cambridge University Press\n* \"Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass\" by Paul Finkelman, Oxford University Press\n* \"Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia\" edited by Junius P. Rodriguez, ABC-CLIO\n\nIt is worth noting that the transatlantic slave trade was a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon and it is difficult to provide an exhaustive list of all the ship and routes. Slaves were transported to many regions of the America, including the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and South America, as well as the British, French, Spanish, and Dutch colonies in North America.",
