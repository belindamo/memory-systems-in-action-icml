Wine pairing is all about experimentation and finding what works for you.\n\nBy letting the wine breathe and pairing it with the potatoes, you'll be giving the wine its best chance to shine. And who knows, you might be surprised by how well it pairs with the dish!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you have a wonderful time enjoying your meal and wine. Cheers!",
