It's great that you were able to roll with the punches and adapt to the situation. Candid shots can often be the most revealing and memorable, and it sounds like you got some great ones.\n\nExperimenting with different angles and compositions is a fantastic way to add some creativity to your shots and make them more visually interesting. It's also a great way to challenge yourself and try new things, which is an important part of growing as a photographer.\n\nI'm sure your family will love the photos, and it's wonderful that you're sharing your passion with them. Editing can be a fun part of the process, too - it's like uncovering the hidden gems in your photos and making them shine.\n\nWhat kind of editing style do you tend to gravitate towards? Do you like to keep things natural and subtle, or do you enjoy experimenting with more dramatic effects and presets?",
