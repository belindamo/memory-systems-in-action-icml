  "content": "JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used primarily for client-side web development. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.\n\nJavaScript allows developers to create interactive web pages and web applications by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of an HTML document, handling user events, and communicating with servers via AJAX requests. It is also used for server-side programming with Node.js, a popular runtime environment for JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript syntax is similar to other C-style programming languages, with variables, functions, loops, and conditionals. It supports both dynamic and static typing, with the latter being introduced in the latest versions of the language. JavaScript can be run in any modern web browser and is also used in many popular web frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js.",
