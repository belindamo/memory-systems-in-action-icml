Since you mentioned it was a good deal for $200 off the original price, I'm going to take a guess that it might be a mid-range to budget-friendly Lenovo laptop.\n\nTo get a better idea of your laptop's specifications, I'd recommend checking your receipt or the packaging that came with your laptop. The model number should be listed on the packaging or on the laptop itself. It's usually a combination of letters and numbers, like \"Lenovo IdeaPad 330S-15API\" or \"Lenovo ThinkPad E495\".\n\nIf you can find the model number, I can look up its specifications, including its weight, to determine if the Anker laptop Stand can support it.\n\nAlternatively, you can also contact Best Buy's customer service or visit their website to look up your purchase history. They might be able to provide you with the exact model number or specifications of your laptop.\n\nDon't worry if you can't find the exact model number right now. We can continue to narrow down the possibilities and explore other options to ensure you find a laptop stand that's compatible with your Lenovo laptop.",
