This way, you're covering your bases and giving yourself options.\n\nBy asking for the repairs and a credit/reduction, you're essentially saying:\n\n\"Hey, seller, I'd like you to fix the roof leak and replace the carpeting. If you're not willing to do that, I'd like a credit towards closing costs or a reduction in the sale price to offset the cost of these repairs.\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're willing to work with the seller, but also protects your interests and gives you leverage in the negotiation.\n\nHere's an example of how you could structure your request:\n\n\"Dear Seller,\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation in addressing the issues found in the home inspection report. We would like to request that you fix the small leak in the roof and replace the worn-out carpeting in the bedrooms. If you're unable to complete these repairs, we would like to request a credit towards closing costs of $X or a reduction in the sale price of $Y to offset the cost of these repairs.\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts on this request. We look forward to hearing back from you.\"\n\nBy including this language, you're giving the seller options and showing that you're willing to negotiate. Remember to discuss this with Rachel, your agent, and have her help you craft the request and negotiate with the seller.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get the outcome you're looking for!",
