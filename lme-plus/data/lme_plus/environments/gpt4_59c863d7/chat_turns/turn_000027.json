  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Incorporating elements from your cousin's wedding will make the proposal even more personal and meaningful. A custom banner or sign with a romantic message is a great way to make the proposal even more special. Here are a few more ideas to consider:\n\n1. **Personalized banner**: As you mentioned, a custom banner with a message like \"Will you marry me?\" or \"Forever with you\" would be perfect. You could also include your names, the date, and a special message to make it even more personal.\n2. **Wedding photo recreation**: Since you attended your cousin's wedding at the Bellagio, you could recreate a special moment from that day during the helicopter tour. For example, you could hold up a sign that says \"Just like Rachel and [her partner's name], I want to spend forever with you.\"\n3. **Special music**: Choose a song that was played during your cousin's wedding or a song that holds special meaning for the two of you. Have the helicopter pilot play the song during the proposal to make it even more romantic.\n4. **Flowers or bouquet**: Bring a small bouquet of your partner's favorite flowers or the same type of flowers that were used in your cousin's wedding. You could also have a single long-stemmed rose or a special flower arrangement waiting in the helicopter.\n5. **Customized photo shoot**: After the proposal, arrange for a romantic photo shoot on the helipad or at a nearby location. This will give you both a chance to capture the moment and remember the proposal forever.\n\nRemember to discuss the details with the helicopter tour company and make sure they can accommodate your requests. With a little planning and creativity, this proposal is sure to be an unforgettable experience for both of you!",
