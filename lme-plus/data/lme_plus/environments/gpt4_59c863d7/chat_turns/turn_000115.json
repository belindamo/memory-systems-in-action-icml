  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have preferences or emotions. But as an art enthuse, I would say that using filters on a computer program might produce desirable effects, but it can't replace the art of manually shading.\n\nUsing a computer program to add depth and dimension to your artwork may seem like an easier and faster option, but it can be limiting in terms of creativity and personal expression. It can also become a crutch, preventing you from developing the skills needed to create original artwork.\n\nRemember that the art of shading is an important part of the creative process and can add depth and dimension to your artwork that can't be replicated by a computer program. It is also a valuable skill that can lead to personal growth and discovery as an artist. So, while filters can be a fun addition to digital art, they should not replace the benefits and rewards of manual shading.",
