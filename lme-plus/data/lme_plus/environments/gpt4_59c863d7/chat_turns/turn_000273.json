  "content": "I'm actually planning to make a classic California roll with crab and avocado, and then try out a new recipe with grilled eel and cucumber. I've never worked with eel before, so it'll be a fun challenge!\n\nThe cooking class was a one-time workshop, and it was a fantastic experience! Our instructor was very knowledgeable and patient, and we got to learn about the history and cultural significance of sushi-making in Japan. I would definitely recommend it to others who are interested in learning new cooking skills. It was a great way to meet new people who shared similar interests, and we got to enjoy the fruits of our labor afterwards!\n\nBy the way, I'm thinking of making some green tea to pair with my sushi tonight. Do you have any recommendations for the best way to brew green tea to bring out its subtle flavors?",
