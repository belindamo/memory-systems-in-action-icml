  "content": "Super glue (cyanoacrylate) can be finicky, and it's great that you're looking for alternative methods. Here are a few options to attach photo-etched parts to your model without using super glue:\n\n1. **White glue (PVA glue)**: White glue is a gentle and forgiving adhesive that works well with photo-etched parts. Apply a small amount to the part and the model, and hold the part in place until the glue sets. This method is ideal for larger PE parts or parts with a larger surface area.\n2. **Gator's Grip**: Gator's Grip is a acrylic-based adhesive specifically designed for attaching small parts, including photo-etched details. It's easy to use, dries clear, and doesn't fog or yellow over time. Apply a small amount to the part and the model, and hold the part in place until the glue sets.\n3. **Tacky Wax**: Tacky Wax is a type of adhesive wax that's perfect for attaching small parts. It's gentle, non-toxic, and easy to use. Apply a small amount to the part and the model, and press the part into place. The wax will hold the part securely without damaging the surrounding area.\n4. **Micro-Mark's Micro-Set**: Micro-Set is a low-viscosity adhesive designed for attaching small parts, including photo-etched details. It's easy to use, dries clear, and doesn't fog or yellow over time. Apply a small amount to the part and the model, and hold the part in place until the glue sets.\n5. **Two-part epoxy**: A two-part epoxy, like JB Weld or Devcon, can be used to attach larger photo-etched parts. Mix the epoxy according to the instructions, apply a small amount to the part and the model, and hold the part in place until the epoxy sets. This method is more suitable for larger parts or parts that require a strong bond.\n\nWhen using any of these alternatives, make sure to:\n\n* Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying times.\n* Use a small amount of adhesive to avoid excess glue oozing out.\n* Hold the part in place until the glue sets to ensure proper alignment.\n* Test the adhesive on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure compatibility with the model's materials.\n\nKeep in mind that some of these alternatives might take longer to set than super glue, so be patient and plan accordingly. Additionally, if you're working with very small parts, you might need to use a combination of these methods or experiment with different adhesives to find the one that works best for you.",
