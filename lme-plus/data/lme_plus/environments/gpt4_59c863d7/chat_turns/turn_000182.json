Capturing special moments like your niece's birthday party is a great way to practice your portrait photography skills while also creating lasting memories for your family. I'm sure your niece and her family will treasure those photos for years to come.\n\nIt's also a great way to get comfortable with directing and interacting with your subjects, which is an essential skill for portrait photography. Working with children can be especially challenging, but it's also super rewarding when you get those perfect shots.\n\nHow did you find the experience?
