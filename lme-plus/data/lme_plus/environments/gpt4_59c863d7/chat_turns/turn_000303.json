  "content": "I would like to start a podcast. It will have two old friends who have known each other for over twenty years. They argue about investment ideas. Michael think the world is going to fall in and you should have your money in cash. Billy thinks markets will have ups and downs and you just need to stay invested for the long term and ignore the news. They send messages back and forth in a whatsapp group, which is very boring for their other friends. But one of them suggested we should start a podcast! Please could you suggest ten names for the podcast and write a summary about the podcast that would appeal to people interested in personal finance.",
