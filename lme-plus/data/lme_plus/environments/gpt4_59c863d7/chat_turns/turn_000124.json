  "content": "I'm planning to attend a concert in a different city and I'm not familiar with the venue. I'll definitely check out the venue's website and online review sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor to get an idea of the venue's layout, seating, and amenities. Since I saw The 1975 at a music festival recently, I'm excited to see how their live show will translate to a smaller venue. Do you have any tips on how to prepare for a concert, such as what to bring, what to wear, and how to stay safe?",
