  "content": "Yes, Queen did perform \"Another One Bites the Dust\" live with the same sound effects created by hitting the metal chains against a metal bucket. During the band's live performances, the sound effects were created by Roger Taylor, the band's drummer, hitting a drumstick against a mic stand. Taylor stood at the front of the stage during the intro of the song, while the rest of the band would gradually join in until Freddie Mercury began to sing. The sound effects became a feature of the live performances of the song, and helped to make the song's intro even more iconic and recognizable when performed live.",
