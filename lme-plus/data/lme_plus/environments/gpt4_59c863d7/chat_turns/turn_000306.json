  "content": "Sure, here's an updated summary:\n\nJoin two old friends, Michael and Billy, as they argue about investment ideas on their new podcast. They've known each other for over twenty years, but they still can't seem to agree on anything when it comes to personal finance. Michael thinks the world is going to fall in and you should have your money in cash, while Billy thinks markets will have ups and downs and you just need to stay invested for the long term and ignore the news. The catch? Neither of them really knows what they're talking about!\n\nDespite their lack of expertise, their passionate and sometimes absurd arguments will keep you entertained and make you question everything you thought you knew about investing. They may not always provide the best advice, but their discussions are always based on real-life experiences, and you might even pick up a few useful tips along the way.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a lighthearted take on personal finance, and want to hear two friends argue about topics they're not qualified to discuss, then tune in to Michael and Billy's podcast. It's the perfect blend of humor and financial misadventures!",
