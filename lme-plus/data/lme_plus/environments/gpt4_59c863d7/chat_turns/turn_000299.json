  "content": "I used to listen to a lot of indie and alternative rock back then. Bands like Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, and The Black Keys were some of my favorites. I still enjoy listening to them today, but my taste in music has evolved a bit over the years.\n\nAs for using my old iPod Nano, I think I'll keep it as a nostalgic item, but I'll stick to my phone for music listening. It's just more convenient, and I can access my entire music library with just a few taps. Plus, I can easily discover new music and create playlists with my phone's music apps.",
