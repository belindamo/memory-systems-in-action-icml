The young midfielder has agreed to join us on a long-term contract and will join up with his new teammates when the transfer window opens in the summer.\n\nBellingham is one of the most promising young players in the world and we are thrilled to have secured his signature. He has already shown his quality at the highest level, having made his professional debut for Dortmund at just 17 years old.\n\nWe believe that Bellingham has all the attributes to become a key player for Liverpool FC and we are excited to see him develop and grow as a player at Anfield.\n\nWe would like to welcome Jude and his family to the Liverpool FC family and look forward to seeing him in action for the Reds.\n\nYours sincerely,\nLiverpool FC",
