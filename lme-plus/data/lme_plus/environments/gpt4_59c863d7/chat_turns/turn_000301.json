  "content": "I've been listening to a lot of indie folk and acoustic music lately. I discovered this one artist, Phoebe Bridgers, and I absolutely love her music. Her lyrics are so poetic and hauntingly beautiful. I've also been enjoying some older bands like Fleet Foxes and Bon Iver. Their harmonies are just incredible.\n\nBut I've also been trying to get into more electronic and ambient music. I've been listening to some Tycho and Four Tet, and I really enjoy their atmospheric soundscapes. Do you have any recommendations for electronic or ambient music?",
