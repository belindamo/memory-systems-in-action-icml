  "content": "In the vision, Aylen sees the figure standing in front of her, taking on the form of a random person from the street. She feels a surge of anger and determination as she charges towards it, her fists clenched. But as soon as she tries to make contact, her hands pass through the figure as if it were a mirage. The figure laughs and taunts her, \"Over here!\" as it suddenly appears behind her, still out of reach. Aylen turns around and tries again, but the figure disappears and reappears in different locations, always just out of reach. The figure's taunts become increasingly cruel, \"Come on Aylen, is that all you've got?\", \"You're never going to catch me, Aylen.\" Aylen grows more and more desperate, her attempts to hit the figure becoming increasingly wild and futile. The figure seems to be relishing in her frustration and helplessness, until the vision ends and Aylen wakes up feeling defeated and humiliated.",
