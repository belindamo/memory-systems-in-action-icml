Introduction: Express deep concern over the government's decision to lift the eviction ban, which will put thousands of vulnerable families at risk of homelessness in a time of economic hardship.\n2. Impact on families: Highlight the devastating consequences for families who will face eviction, including increased stress, uncertainty, and the potential for long-term damage to children's wellbeing and development.\n3.

Lifting the eviction ban will only worsen these struggles, pushing families further into poverty and creating an even greater divide between the haves and have-nots.\n5.

Demand for immediate action: Insist that the government reinstate the eviction ban until a comprehensive housing policy is in place to ensure that no family is left without a safe and secure place to call home.\n7. Human rights perspective: Emphasize that housing is a fundamental human right, and the government has a moral and legal obligation to protect and uphold this right for all citizens.\n8. Community support: Encourage community members and organizations to stand in solidarity with families facing eviction and demand that the government takes immediate action to address this crisis.\n9.
