      "content": "The Recycled Cashmere Crew is a popular style, and I'd be happy to help you with fit and sizing information.\n\n**Fit and Sizing:**\n\nEverlane's The Recycled Cashmere Crew is designed to have a classic, relaxed fit. It's meant to be comfortable and easy to wear, without being too baggy or too fitted. Here are some key fit details to consider:\n\n1. **Relaxed fit**: The sweater has a relaxed silhouette, with a slightly dropped shoulder and a straight hem.\n2. **Classic crew neck**: The crew neck is designed to be comfortable and easy to wear, with a slightly wider neckline than a traditional crew neck.\n3. **Longer length**: The sweater has a longer length, hitting just below the hip, which makes it perfect for layering over dresses or wearing on its own.\n\n**Sizing:**\n\nEverlane offers a range of sizes for The Recycled Cashmere Crew, from XS to XL. Here's a general size guide to help you determine your best fit:\n\n| Size | Bust | Waist | Hip | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| XS | 32-34\" | 24-26\" | 34-36\" | 24.5\" |\n| S | 34-36\" | 26-28\" | 36-38\" | 25\" |\n| M | 36-38\" | 28-30\" | 38-40\" | 25.5\" |\n| L | 38-40\" | 30-32\" | 40-42\" | 26\" |\n| XL | 40-42\" | 32-34\" | 42-44\" | 26.5\" |\n\n**Cashmere Sizing Tips:**\n\nSince cashmere is a natural fiber, it can have a slightly different fit compared to other materials. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Cashmere tends to stretch**: Cashmere fibers have a natural stretch, so the sweater may feel slightly snug at first but will relax over time.\n2. **Size down for a fitted look**: If you prefer a more fitted silhouette, consider sizing down. However, if you prefer a looser fit, stick with your usual size.\n3. **Check the measurement guide**: Make sure to check the measurement guide to ensure the best fit for your body.\n\n**Return Policy:**\n\nIf you're still unsure about the fit, Everlane has a great return policy. You can return or exchange items within 30 days of delivery, as long as they're in their original condition.\n\nDo you have any other questions about The Recycled Cashmere Crew or would you like to know more about Everlane's return policy?"
