You might need to adjust both the lens's autofocus settings and the camera's autofocus settings to get the best results. Here's a breakdown to help you troubleshoot:\n\n**Lens Autofocus Settings:**\n\n1. **AF Customization**: Check your Sigma lens's manual for AF Customization settings. Some Sigma lenses have a \"Custom Mode\" or \"AF Fine-Tune\" feature that allows you to adjust the autofocus behavior. You might need to adjust the \"Acceleration\" or \"Deceleration\" settings to better match the bird's movement.\n2. **Focus Limiter**: If your lens has a Focus Limiter switch, try setting it to the \"Full\" or \"\u221e-2.8m\" range. This can help the lens focus more quickly on distant subjects like birds in flight.\n\n**Camera Autofocus Settings:**\n\n1. **AF Case**: On your Canon EOS 80D, go to the \"AF\" menu and select \"AF Case\". Choose the \"Case 1\" or \"Case 2\" setting, which are designed for tracking fast-moving subjects like birds.\n2. **AF Tracking Sensitivity**: As I mentioned earlier, adjust the AF Tracking Sensitivity to \"-1\" or \"-2\" to help the camera track the bird's movement more smoothly.\n3. **AF Acceleration/Deceleration Tracking**: This setting is available on some Canon cameras, including the 80D. It helps the camera anticipate the subject's acceleration and deceleration. You can adjust this setting to better match the bird's movement.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use the Correct Autofocus Mode**: Ensure you're using AI Servo AF mode, which is designed for tracking moving subjects.\n2. **Autofocus Point Selection**: Use the \"Auto Selection\" or \"Zone AF\" mode to allow the camera to select the autofocus point automatically.\n3. **Focus on the Bird's Body**: Place the autofocus point on the bird's body, rather than its wings or tail, to help the camera track the bird's movement more accurately.\n\n**Testing and Adjusting:**\n\n1. **Test Your Settings**: Take some test shots with your current settings to see how the autofocus performs.\n2. **Adjust and Refine**: Based on your test results, adjust the lens's autofocus settings and/or the camera's autofocus settings to refine the tracking performance.\n3. **Repeat and Refine**: Continue testing and adjusting until you achieve the desired autofocus performance.\n\nRemember, autofocus settings can be nuanced, and it might take some trial and error to find the optimal combination for your specific situation. Be patient, and don't hesitate to experiment with different settings to get the best results.",
