  "content": "Yes, like any surgical procedure, fetal cardiac surgery in utero carries risks. However, advancements in medical technology and the expertise of specialized medical teams have led to improved success rates and reduced risks over time.\n\nSome potential risks associated with fetal cardiac surgery include:\n\n1. Preterm labor or premature birth: The surgical procedure may trigger the onset of labor or cause the mother to go into premature labor.\n\n2. Rupture of the fetal membrane: A tear can occur in the membrane protecting the fetus during the procedure, which can lead to the loss of amniotic fluid and increase the risk of infection.\n\n3. Fetal bleeding: The surgical procedure can cause bleeding in the fetus, which can lead to life-threatening conditions such as anemia or brain damage.\n\n4. Maternal complications: The maternal body may have a reaction to a foreign body (e.g., surgical instruments) entering the uterus or amniotic sac, which can cause complications.\n\n5. Failure to correct the anomaly: Despite the successful operation, fetal cardiac surgeries may not always correct the abnormality or may cause another anomaly which can put the baby's life at risk.\n\nDespite the risks, fetal cardiac surgery in utero can provide significant benefits to certain fetuses, particularly those with potentially fatal conditions. A multidisciplinary team of fetal specialists, obstetricians, and neonatal physicians can provide the best consultation to a family considering this intervention.",
