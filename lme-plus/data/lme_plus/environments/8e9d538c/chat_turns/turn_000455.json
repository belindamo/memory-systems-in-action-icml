  "content": "Fetal surgery is a rapidly evolving field of medicine, and several types of fetal surgeries are being performed these days to treat a wide range of medical conditions in utero. In addition to fetal cardiac surgery, some examples of other fetal surgeries are:\n\n1. Spina bifida repair: This is a procedure in which the spinal defect is repaired before the baby is born. The surgery is performed through a small incision in the uterus, and a tiny patch is used to cover the opening in the spine.\n\n2. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) surgery: This is a condition that occurs in identical twin pregnancies in which one twin receives too much blood, while the other receives too little. In this type of surgery, a laser is used to seal off the blood vessels that are causing the imbalance.\n\n3. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair: This is a procedure in which a surgeon creates a small incision in the mother's uterus and then inserts a tiny camera and surgical instruments to repair the hole in the baby's diaphragm before birth.\n\n4. Laser photocoagulation for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome: This procedure uses a laser to coagulate and close off the blood vessels that are causing the blood flow inbalance in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.\n\n5. Fetal thoracoamniotic shunt: This procedure involves the insertion of a small tube (shunt) into the chest area of the fetus to drain fluid from the pleural cavity.\n\nThese surgeries require a highly specialized team of fetal medicine, obstetrics, anesthesiology or neonatology and other medical specialists, and a hospital that is equipped to handle the care of the mother and the fetus.",
