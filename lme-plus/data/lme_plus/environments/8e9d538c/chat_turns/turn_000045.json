Involving her in the decision-making process and consulting with a healthcare professional will help ensure that the modifications are tailored to her specific needs and preferences.\n\nRemember, it's not just about making physical changes to the home, but also about creating a supportive and empowering environment that allows your grandmother to maintain her independence and quality of life.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance. And don't forget to celebrate the small wins along the way, like completing a home safety assessment or installing a new handrail. Every step counts, and it's all worth it to see your grandmother thrive!\n\nTake care, and I wish you and your grandmother all the best on this journey!",
