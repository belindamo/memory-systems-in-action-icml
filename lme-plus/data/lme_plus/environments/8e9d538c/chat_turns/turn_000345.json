  "content": "Adding an **Industry/Sector** column will help you analyze your networking efforts and identify patterns or areas of focus. This can be particularly useful for:\n\n1. Identifying areas of strength or clusters of connections in specific industries.\n2. Revealing potential gaps or opportunities in your network.\n3. Informing your future networking strategies and event choices.\n\nYou can add the **Industry/Sector** column to the **People Met** sheet, e.g., Column L: **Industry/Sector**. This will allow you to categorize each connection by their industry or sector.\n\n**Tips for tracking Industry/Sector:**\n\n1. Use a consistent set of categories: Establish a standard list of industries or sectors to choose from, such as:\n\t* Technology\n\t* Finance\n\t* Healthcare\n\t* Marketing\n\t* Education\n\t* Non-Profit\n\t* Government\n\t* etc.\n2. Be specific: When possible, use more specific categories, such as:\n\t* Fintech\n\t* Healthtech\n\t* E-commerce\n\t* Cybersecurity\n\t* Renewable Energy\n3. Use a hierarchical structure: Consider using a hierarchical structure, such as:\n\t* Industry > Sub-Industry > Sector\n\t\t+ Example: Technology > Software > Artificial Intelligence\n4. Keep it flexible: Be prepared to adjust your categorization system as your network grows and evolves.\n\nBy tracking the industry or sector of the people you meet, you'll gain valuable insights into your networking efforts and be able to make more informed decisions about where to focus your energy.\n\n**Example of updated People Met sheet:**\n\n| Name | Title/Company | Contact Info | Conversation Notes | Follow-up Action | Follow-up Deadline | Status | Industry/Sector |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Smith | CEO, ABC Inc. | [john.smith@abc.com](mailto:john.smith@abc.com) | Discussed partnership opportunities | Send follow-up email | 2023-03-15 | New | Technology > Software > Artificial Intelligence |\n| Jane Doe | Marketing Manager, DEF Corp. | [jane.doe@defcorp.com](mailto:jane.doe@defcorp.com) | Exchanged business cards | Connect on LinkedIn | 2023-03-10 | New | Marketing > Digital Marketing |\n\nNow, you can filter and analyze your connections by industry/sector, event type, and more, to gain a deeper understanding of your networking efforts!",
