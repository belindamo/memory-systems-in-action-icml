  "content": "I'm happy to help you with some healthy lunch options and break your culinary rut!\n\nBut first, I'm curious - what's the type of drink that's been giving you a quick energy boost? Is it a coffee, tea, energy drink, or something else?\n\nNow, about those healthy lunch options... What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for? Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)?\n\nHere are some general ideas to get you started:\n\n1. Salads with protein: Grilled chicken, salmon, or tofu on top of mixed greens with nuts and veggies.\n2. Whole grain wraps: Hummus, avocado, and veggies wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla.\n3. Soup and sandwich: Lentil soup with a side of whole grain bread or a fresh fruit salad.\n4. Asian-inspired bowls: Brown rice, roasted veggies, and grilled chicken or tofu with a drizzle of soy sauce.\n5. Fresh fruit and cheese platter: A colorful mix of fruits, paired with a small block of cheese and a handful of nuts.\n\nLet me know if any of these options spark your interest, or if you'd like more ideas!",
