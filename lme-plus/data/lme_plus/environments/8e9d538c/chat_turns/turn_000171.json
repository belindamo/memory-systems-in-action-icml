  "content": "Marigolds are an excellent addition to your garden, especially if you're growing tomatoes! \n\nMarigolds (Tagetes spp.) are a natural nematode repellent, which makes them a fantastic companion plant for tomatoes. Nematodes are microscopic worms that can harm tomatoes by feeding on their roots, causing stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced fruit production. Marigolds contain a chemical called alpha-terthienyl, which is toxic to nematodes and can help reduce their population in the soil.\n\nHere are some benefits of planting marigolds with your tomatoes:\n\n1. **Nematode control:** As mentioned, marigolds can help deter nematodes, which can harm tomatoes. By planting marigolds around your tomatoes, you can reduce the risk of nematode infestation.\n2. **Pest control:** Marigolds also repel other pests like whiteflies, aphids, and nematode-carrying insects, which can further benefit your tomatoes.\n3. **Soil health:** Marigolds have deep taproots that can help break up compacted soil and improve its structure, making it more conducive to healthy root growth for your tomatoes.\n4. **Companion planting:** Marigolds are a natural trap crop for nematodes, which means they'll attract nematodes away from your tomatoes. This can help reduce the nematode population in the soil and protect your tomatoes.\n\nWhen planting marigolds with your tomatoes, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n1. **Plant marigolds around the perimeter:** Plant marigolds around the perimeter of your tomato bed to create a barrier against nematodes and other pests.\n2. **Interplant marigolds with tomatoes:** You can also interplant marigolds among your tomatoes to provide additional protection and benefits.\n3. **Use a combination of marigold varieties:** Plant a mix of French marigold (Tagetes patula) and African marigold (Tagetes erecta) varieties, as they have different growth habits and can provide more comprehensive protection.\n4. **Rotate your crops:** Remember to rotate your crops annually to avoid depleting the soil of its natural nematode-repelling properties.\n\nBy adding marigolds to your garden, you'll be taking a natural and effective step towards protecting your tomatoes from nematodes and other pests. Great decision!",
