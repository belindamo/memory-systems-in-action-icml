They're known for their transparency and commitment to environmentally-friendly practices.\n\nAs for sales and promotions, Everlane does offer periodic discounts and special deals. I'd recommend checking their website directly for the most up-to-date information. Here are a few tips to help you score a good deal:\n\n1. **Sign up for their email newsletter**: By joining their email list, you'll receive notifications about upcoming sales, promotions, and new arrivals.\n2. **Check their sale section**: Everlane has a dedicated sale section on their website where they feature discounted items. You can find previous seasons' styles or overstocked items at a lower price.\n3. **Look for bundle deals**: Everlane occasionally offers bundle discounts when you purchase multiple items together. This might be a great opportunity to grab a pair of jeans and a matching denim jacket, for example.\n4. **Keep an eye on their social media**: Everlane sometimes announces flash sales or limited-time promotions on their social media channels, so it's worth following them on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter.\n5. **Consider shopping during off-peak seasons**: If you're not particular about having the latest style, you might find discounts on previous seasons' collections during off-peak periods (e.g., buying winter jeans in the spring).\n\nAs for your Zara purchase, congrats on returning the black turtleneck sweater! It's great that you're mindful of your shopping habits and making conscious choices.\n\nDo you have a specific style or wash in mind for your Everlane jeans, or would you like some recommendations?",
