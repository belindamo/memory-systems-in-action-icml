Here are some tips to help Lola recover from her stress and stay happy and healthy:\n\n1. **Lighting:** Spider plants prefer bright, indirect light, but not direct sunlight, which can cause scorching. If Lola's getting too much direct sun, try moving her to a spot with filtered or dappled light.\n2. **Watering:** Overwatering is a common issue with Spider plants. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it feels dry, it's time to water. Water thoroughly, but make sure the pot drains well to prevent waterlogged soil. Let the top 1-2 inches of soil dry out between waterings.\n3. **Humidity:** Spider plants prefer a humid environment, but they can adapt to average humidity levels. To keep Lola happy, you can place her pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or use a humidifier nearby.\n4. **Temperature:** Spider plants prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). Avoid placing Lola near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n5. **Fertilization:** Feed Lola with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning her roots.\n6. **Pruning:** Remove any yellow or damaged leaves to prevent the spread of disease and encourage healthy growth. Cut off any long stems to encourage bushy growth and more baby plants (spiderettes).\n7. **Potting mix:** Use a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for tropical plants like Spider plants. Avoid using regular potting soil, as it can retain too much water and cause root rot.\n8. **Pest control:** Check Lola regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale. If you notice any, treat her with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n9. **Repotting:** Spider plants typically need to be repotted every 2-3 years as they outgrow their containers. Choose a pot that's only slightly larger than the previous one, and gently remove any circling roots before repotting.\n10. **Monitor for diseases:** Inspect Lola regularly for signs of disease like black spots, white powdery patches, or soft, mushy leaves. If you notice any, remove affected leaves or stems, and treat with a fungicide if necessary.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to help Lola recover from her stress and thrive once again. Remember to observe your plant's response to these changes and adjust as needed. Happy planting!",
