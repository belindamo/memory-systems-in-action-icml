  "content": "Excellent suggestions!\n\n**Adding an Event Type column:**\n\nYou can add a new column to the **People Met** sheet, e.g., Column K: **Event Type**. This will allow you to categorize the events by type, making it easier to filter and analyze your connections by event type (e.g., conferences, networking receptions, meetups).\n\n**Tracking events with incomplete date information:**\n\nFor the event with incomplete date information, you can add a note in the **Event Summary** sheet with as much detail as you remember. For example:\n\n* Event Name: Marketing Conference at Hilton Hotel\n* Date: Mid-February (approx.)\n* Location: Hilton Hotel\n* Number of attendees: [unknown]\n* Brief notes about the event: Met someone from Google, discussed [topic]\n\nLater, if you recall the exact date or find the event program, you can update the date field.\n\nTo make the most of this incomplete data, you can also consider adding a **Date Range** column to the **Event Summary** sheet. This way, you can specify a date range (e.g., February 10-20) to help narrow down the possibilities.\n\n**Tips for managing incomplete data:**\n\n1. Be consistent in how you record incomplete data, so it's easy to identify and update later.\n2. Use keywords or tags to help you search for related events or connections.\n3. Consider creating a \"To-Research\" list or a separate sheet to track events or connections that need further investigation.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, your spreadsheet will become an even more powerful tool for managing your networking efforts!",
