And you can't go to NYC without trying some of the famous pizza!\n\n**Times Square:**\n\n* You can visit Times Square on Day 2 or 3, depending on your schedule and preferences. It's a great place to grab dinner and catch a Broadway show, or simply take in the sights and sounds of the area.\n* Be prepared for crowds and chaos, but it's a quintessential NYC experience.\n\n**NYC Pizza:**\n\n* Lombardi's and Joe's Pizza are both iconic spots for a classic NYC slice. You can't go wrong with either choice!\n* Lombardi's is America's first pizzeria, opened in 1905, and is known for its classic Neapolitan-style pizza.\n* Joe's Pizza is a Greenwich Village institution, serving up classic slices since 1975.\n\n**Sightseeing Pass:**\n\n* A sightseeing pass can be a great way to save time and money on attractions and experiences. Both the New York City Explorer Pass and the Freestyle Pass are popular options.\n* The New York City Explorer Pass offers admission to 3, 5, 7, or 10 attractions, with discounts on additional attractions.\n* The Freestyle Pass offers admission to 3, 5, or 7 attractions, with the option to add a hop-on hop-off bus tour.\n* Consider which attractions you want to visit and calculate the cost of individual tickets versus the cost of a sightseeing pass.

It could help you save time and money, and provide a convenient way to plan your itinerary.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards a specific sightseeing pass or attractions?",
