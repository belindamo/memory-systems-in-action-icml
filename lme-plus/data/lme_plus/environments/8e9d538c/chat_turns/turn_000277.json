Let's continue the code for the `static/js/game.js` file:\n```javascript\n    function update() {\n        updateProbeActivities();\n\n        // You can implement the logic for exploration, reproduction, resource collection, and upgrades here.\n        // For example:\n        // - Update the positions of the probes based on their explore activity.\n        // - Create new probes based on their reproduce activity.\n        // - Collect resources and perform upgrades based on the collectResources activity.\n\n        // For now, we'll just render the probes\n        renderProbes();\n    }\n\n    function renderProbes() {\n        const probeSelection = gameContainer.selectAll(\".probe\").data(probes, d => d.id);\n\n        probeSelection.enter()\n            .append(\"div\")\n            .attr(\"class\", \"probe\")\n            .style(\"left\", d => d.x + \"px\")\n            .style(\"top\", d => d.y + \"px\")\n            .merge(probeSelection)\n            .style(\"left\", d => d.x + \"px\")\n            .style(\"top\", d => d.y + \"px\");\n\n        probeSelection.exit().remove();\n    }\n\n    // Main game loop\n    setInterval(update, 1000 / 60); // 60 FPS\n});\n```\nIn this code snippet, we've added an `update` function that updates the probe activities based on the sliders' values and calls a `renderProbes` function. The `renderProbes` function is responsible for rendering the probes on the screen.\n\nPlease note that the game logic for exploration, reproduction, resource collection, and upgrades is not implemented in this example. You'll need to implement these features according to your game design and requirements.\n\nOnce you've set up these files, you can run your Flask application by executing `python game_app.py` in your terminal or command prompt. This will start a local development server, and you can access the game in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.",
