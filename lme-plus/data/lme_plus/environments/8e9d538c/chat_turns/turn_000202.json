By separating the autofocus function from the shutter release, you can gain more control over the autofocus system and improve tracking performance.\n\n**Back-Button Autofocus:**\n\n1. **Enable BBAF**: On your Canon EOS 80D, go to the \"Custom Functions\" menu and enable \"Back-button AF\" (C.Fn II-11). This will allow you to assign the autofocus function to the AF-ON button on the back of the camera.\n2. **Assign AF-ON Button**: Assign the AF-ON button to the autofocus function. This will allow you to control the autofocus separately from the shutter release.\n3. **Use the AF-ON Button**: When tracking a bird, press and hold the AF-ON button to activate autofocus. This will allow you to focus on the bird without taking a photo.\n4. **Release the Shutter**: Once you've acquired focus, release the AF-ON button and press the shutter release to take the photo.\n\n**Benefits of BBAF for Bird Photography:**\n\n1. **Improved Tracking**: By separating autofocus from the shutter release, you can focus on tracking the bird's movement without worrying about accidentally taking a photo.\n2. **Reduced Camera Shake**: Since you're not pressing the shutter release to focus, you'll reduce camera shake and blur caused by camera movement.\n3. **Faster Refocusing**: With BBAF, you can quickly refocus on the bird if it changes direction or distance.\n\n**Tips for Using BBAF with Birds in Flight:**\n\n1. **Anticipate the Bird's Movement**: Use the AF-ON button to track the bird's movement, and anticipate where it will be in the next instant.\n2. **Use the Correct Autofocus Mode**: Ensure you're using AI Servo AF mode, which is designed for tracking moving subjects.\n3. **Monitor Your Focus**: Keep an eye on your camera's focus indicators to ensure you're maintaining focus on the bird.\n\nBy combining BBAF with the AF Customization settings on your Sigma lens and the AF Case settings on your Canon EOS 80D, you should see an improvement in tracking performance. Remember to practice and adjust your techniques as needed to get the best results.",
