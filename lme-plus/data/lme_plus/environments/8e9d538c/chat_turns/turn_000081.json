Unfortunately, I don't have any exclusive coupons or promo codes to share with you, as they are typically offered by the stores themselves or through their loyalty programs. However, I can suggest some ways to help you find discounts and savings for your meal prep session:\n\n1. **Check the stores' websites and apps**: Visit Publix and Target's websites, as well as their mobile apps, to see if they have any digital coupons, sales, or promotions available.\n2. **Sign up for loyalty programs**: If you haven't already, sign up for Publix's loyalty program, Publix Rewards, and Target's loyalty program, Target RedCard. These programs often offer exclusive discounts and savings.\n3. **Look for weekly ads and sales**: Check the weekly ads for both stores to see what's on sale and plan your meal prep around those items.\n4. **Use cashback apps**: Apps like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, and Checkout 51 offer cashback on certain grocery items.\n5. **Manufacturer coupons**: Check websites like Coupons.com, SmartSource, and RedPlum for printable coupons or digital coupons for specific brands.\n6. **Meal prep on a budget**: Consider planning meals around affordable, staple ingredients like rice, beans, and pasta, and shop for seasonal produce to save money.\n7. **Stock up and bulk shop**: If you have the storage space, consider buying non-perishable items in bulk to save money in the long run.\n8. **Digital coupon aggregators**: Websites like RetailMeNot and CouponCabin aggregate coupons and promo codes for various stores, including Publix and Target.\n9. **Follow your local stores on social media**: Sometimes, stores will post exclusive deals or promotions on their social media channels.\n10. **Check with local newspapers and mailers**: You might still receive physical coupons or flyers in the mail, so keep an eye out for those as well.\n\nRemember to always check the expiration dates and terms of any coupons or promo codes you find to ensure they're valid for your shopping trip. Happy meal prepping!",
