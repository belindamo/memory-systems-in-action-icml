Here are some specific tips on using continuous autofocus (AI Servo AF) mode on your 80D with the Sigma lens:\n\n**AI Servo AF Settings:**\n\n1. **AI Servo AF Mode**: Enable AI Servo AF mode by pressing the AF Mode button and selecting the continuous autofocus icon (looks like a running figure).\n2. **AF Method**: Set the AF Method to \"Zone AF\" or \"Large Zone AF\". This allows you to select a larger area for the camera to track the bird's movement.\n3. **AF Point Selection**: Choose the \"Auto Selection\" option, which allows the camera to automatically select the AF point based on the subject's movement.\n4. **AF Tracking Sensitivity**: Set the AF Tracking Sensitivity to \"-1\" or \"-2\" to help the camera track the bird's movement more smoothly.\n\n**Sigma 150-600mm Lens Settings:**\n\n1. **OS (Optical Stabilizer) Mode**: Make sure the OS is enabled on the lens. This will help reduce camera shake and blur.\n2. **OS Mode 2**: If your lens has OS Mode 2, enable it. This mode is specifically designed for panning and helps to reduce blur caused by camera movement.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use the correct Autofocus Area**: Use the \"Zone AF\" or \"Large Zone AF\" to select a larger area for the camera to track the bird's movement.\n2. **Use the correct Autofocus Point**: Place the autofocus point on the bird's body, rather than its wings or tail. This will help the camera track the bird's movement more accurately.\n3. **Predict the Bird's Movement**: Anticipate the bird's flight path and direction. This will help you place the autofocus point in the correct area and allow the camera to track the bird more effectively.\n4. **Use a Fast Shutter Speed**: As I mentioned earlier, use a minimum shutter speed of 1/1000th of a second to freeze the bird's movement.\n5. **Continuous Shooting Mode**: Enable continuous shooting mode to capture multiple frames in quick succession. This will increase your chances of getting a sharp image.\n6. **Monitor Your Camera's Buffer**: Keep an eye on your camera's buffer capacity. If it fills up, the camera will slow down, and you might miss the shot.\n7. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: As with any skill, practice makes perfect. The more you practice using AI Servo AF mode with your 80D and Sigma lens, the better you'll become at tracking and capturing birds in flight.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to improve your chances of capturing sharp images of birds in flight with your Canon EOS 80D and Sigma 150-600mm lens.",
