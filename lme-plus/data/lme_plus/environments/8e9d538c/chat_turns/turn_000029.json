  "content": "\"Lupin\" is a fantastic show, and it's great that you're looking for more shows with a similar tone and style.\n\nBetween \"Money Heist\" and \"Killing Eve\", I'd say \"Money Heist\" is more similar to \"Lupin\" in terms of tone and style. Here's why:\n\n1. **Action-packed and suspenseful**: Both \"Lupin\" and \"Money Heist\" are known for their fast-paced action, intense suspense, and clever plot twists. They'll keep you on the edge of your seat!\n2. **Cunning characters**: Both shows feature clever, charismatic, and complex characters who use their wit and intelligence to outsmart their opponents. You'll love the clever banter and strategic thinking in both shows.\n3. **Heists and cons**: While \"Lupin\" focuses on a gentleman thief, \"Money Heist\" revolves around a group of thieves pulling off a massive heist. Both shows share a similar sense of excitement and tension as the characters navigate their respective plans.\n4. **Stylish and atmospheric**: Both shows have a distinct visual style, with a focus on clever camera work, stylish editing, and a moody atmosphere that adds to the tension.\n\n\"Killing Eve\", on the other hand, is more of a spy thriller with a focus on cat-and-mouse games, espionage, and psychological manipulation. While it's still an excellent show, its tone is slightly different from \"Lupin\" and \"Money Heist\".\n\nThat being said, if you enjoyed the cleverness, action, and suspense of \"Lupin\", I think you'll love \"Money Heist\" for its similar tone and style. Give it a try and see how you find it!",
