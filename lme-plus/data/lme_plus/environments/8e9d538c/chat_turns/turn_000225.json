  "content": "To add support for setting form sequence for a workflow, we can modify the `Workflow` class to have a list of `Form` objects in the order they should appear in the workflow. We can add methods to add and remove `Form` objects from this list and to get the list of `Form` objects in the correct order.\n\nHere's an updated implementation of the `Workflow` class with support for form sequence:\n```typescript\npublic class Workflow {\n    private String name;\n    private List<Form> forms;\n    \n    public Workflow(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n        forms = new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n    \n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n    \n    public void addForm(Form form) {\n        forms.add(form);\n    }\n    \n    public void removeForm(Form form) {\n        forms.remove(form);\n    }\n    \n    public List<Form> getForms() {\n        // Return a copy of the list to prevent modification of the original list\n        return new ArrayList<>(forms);\n    }\n    \n    public List<Field> getAllFields() {\n        List<Field> fields = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Form form : forms) {\n            fields.addAll(form.getFields());\n        }\n        return fields;\n    }\n    \n    public Form getFormById(int formId) {\n        for (Form form : forms) {\n            if (form.getId() == formId) {\n                return form;\n            }\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n    \n    public List<Submission> getSubmissions() {\n        List<Submission> submissions = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Form form : forms) {\n            submissions.addAll(form.getSubmissions());\n        }\n        return submissions;\n    }\n    \n    public List<Submission> getSubmissionsByUser(User user) {\n        List<Submission> submissions = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Form form : forms) {\n            submissions.addAll(form.getSubmissionsByUser(user));\n        }\n        return submissions;\n    }\n    \n    public List<Submission> getSubmissionsByStatus(SubmissionStatus status) {\n        List<Submission> submissions = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Form form : forms) {\n            submissions.addAll(form.getSubmissionsByStatus(status));\n        }\n        return submissions;\n    }\n    \n    public List<Submission> getSubmissionsByUserAndStatus(User user, SubmissionStatus status) {\n        List<Submission> submissions = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Form form : forms) {\n            submissions.addAll(form.getSubmissionsByUserAndStatus(user, status));\n        }\n        return submissions;\n    }\n    \n    public List<Submission> getSubmissionsByDateRange(Date startDate, Date endDate) {\n        List<Submission> submissions = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Form form : forms) {\n            submissions.addAll(form.getSubmissionsByDateRange(startDate, endDate));\n        }\n        return submissions;\n    }\n    \n    public List<Submission> getSubmissionsByUserAndDateRange(User user, Date startDate, Date endDate) {\n        List<Submission> submissions = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Form form : forms) {\n            submissions.addAll(form.getSubmissionsByUserAndDateRange(user, startDate, endDate));\n        }\n        return submissions;\n    }\n}\n```\nWe can then use this updated `Workflow` class to set the form sequence for a workflow by adding `Form` objects to the list in the desired order:\n```java\nWorkflow workflow = new Workflow(\"Example Workflow\");\nForm form1 = new Form(\"Form 1\");\nForm form2 = new Form(\"Form 2\");\nForm form3 = new Form(\"Form 3\");\nworkflow.addForm(form1);\nworkflow.addForm(form2);\nworkflow.addForm(form3);\n```\nIn this example, `Form 1` will be the first form in the workflow, followed by",
