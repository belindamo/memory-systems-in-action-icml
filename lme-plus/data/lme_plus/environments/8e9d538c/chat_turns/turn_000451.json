  "content": "Fetal cardiac surgery, including interventions for ventricular abnormalities, is a relatively new field of medicine that has developed over the past few decades. \n\nOne of the earliest fetal cardiac operations was performed in 1981 by Dr. Michael Harrison at the University of California, San Francisco. The surgery was done to treat a fetus with urinary tract obstruction.\n\nThe first successful fetal cardiac surgery was performed in 1993 by a team led by Dr. Mark Sklansky at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The surgery was done to treat hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and the infant was born healthy and had successful outcome from the procedure.\n\nSince then, advances in medical technology and increasing experience have enabled more sophisticated prenatal procedures, including fetal cardiac surgery in utero. However, these procedures are still performed at a limited number of specialized centers around the world and are reserved for the most severe or life-threatening cases.",
