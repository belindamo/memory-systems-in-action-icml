  "content": "I'm looking for some new tea blends to try. I've recently switched from coffee to tea, specifically a green tea with lemon, and I'm enjoying the subtle flavor. By the way, I used to drink a medium-sized coffee from the caf\u00e9 down the street every morning on my way to work, and it was around $3.50 a cup. Do you have any recommendations for similar tea blends or flavor profiles?",
