I'm happy to help you explore new tea blends and flavor profiles.\n\nConsidering your background in coffee, I'll suggest some tea options that might appeal to your taste buds. Since you enjoy the subtle flavor of green tea with lemon, I'll focus on tea blends that offer a similar brightness and freshness.\n\n1. **Genmaicha**: A Japanese green tea blend that combines the freshness of green tea with the nutty flavor of roasted brown rice. The subtle sweetness and hint of roasted notes might remind you of coffee.\n2. **Sencha with Mint**: A Japanese green tea blended with peppermint or spearmint leaves. The cooling effect of mint will awaken your senses, much like the brightness of lemon in your current green tea.\n3. **Dragonwell**: A Chinese green tea known for its delicate flavor profile, with hints of chestnut and a subtle sweetness. Its smooth, refreshing taste might appeal to those who enjoy a lighter tea.\n4. **White Peony**: A Chinese white tea that's minimally processed, retaining its delicate flavor and floral notes. This tea is perfect for those who prefer a light, subtle taste without bitterness.\n5. **Chrysanthemum Tea**: A floral herbal tea that's caffeine-free and offers a sweet, slightly earthy flavor profile. This tea is often enjoyed in the afternoon or evening, but it can also make a lovely morning pick-me-up.\n6. **Lemon Ginger**: A herbal tea blend that combines the brightness of lemon with the spicy warmth of ginger. This tea is perfect for those who enjoy a citrusy flavor profile with a hint of zing.\n7. **Rooibos Chai**: A caffeine-free herbal tea blend that combines the nutty flavor of rooibos with warming spices like cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom. This tea offers a comforting, slightly sweet flavor profile.\n\nAs for the cost, you can find these tea blends at various price points, depending on the brand, quality, and packaging. However, on average, a high-quality tea blend can cost between $5 to $10 per ounce, which can make around 20-30 cups of tea. This works out to around $0.25 to $0.50 per cup, a significant saving compared to your previous coffee habit!\n\nFeel free to experiment with these options and adjust the steeping times to your liking. You might also consider purchasing tea samples or trial packs to explore different flavors before committing to a larger quantity. Happy sipping!",
