  "content": "Great choices! Both \"Money Heist\" and \"Killing Eve\" are binge-worthy shows that can be devoured quickly.\n\nTo help you gauge how long it'll take to finish these shows, here's a rough estimate of the number of episodes and total runtime for each:\n\n* **Money Heist (La Casa de Papel)**: 4 seasons, 41 episodes, approximately 45-50 minutes per episode. Total runtime: around 32-34 hours.\n* **Killing Eve**: 3 seasons, 24 episodes, approximately 45-50 minutes per episode. Total runtime: around 18-20 hours.\n\nAssuming you watch 2-3 episodes per day during your lunch breaks, here's a rough estimate of how long it'll take to finish each show:\n\n* **Money Heist**: With 2 episodes per day, you'll finish the show in around 20-22 days. With 3 episodes per day, you'll finish in around 13-15 days.\n* **Killing Eve**: With 2 episodes per day, you'll finish the show in around 12-13 days. With 3 episodes per day, you'll finish in around 8-10 days.\n\nConsidering you have around 28 days left in February, you should be able to finish at least one of these shows before the end of the month, even if you stick to 2 episodes per day. If you can manage 3 episodes per day, you might be able to finish both shows!\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and you might find yourself bingeing more episodes than planned due to the addictive nature of these shows. Enjoy your watch!",
