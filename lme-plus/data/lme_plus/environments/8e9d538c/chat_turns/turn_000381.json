As a beginner, it's essential to start with a high-quality white tea that's easy to brew and accessible. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Beginner-friendly White Teas:**\n\n1. **Silver Needle (Bai Mu Dan)**: A classic Chinese white tea known for its delicate, floral flavor and silky texture. It's a great introduction to white tea, and its light flavor won't overwhelm your palate.\n2. **White Peony (Bai Mu Xi)**: Another popular Chinese white tea, White Peony offers a slightly sweeter and more floral flavor profile than Silver Needle. It's a great choice for those who prefer a hint of sweetness in their tea.\n3. **Shou Mei**: A lesser-known white tea from China, Shou Mei offers a light, fruity flavor with hints of honey and floral notes. It's a great value for the price and a nice introduction to white tea.\n\n**Easy-to-brew White Teas:**\n\n1. **TeaVivre's Silver Needle**: This Chinese white tea is known for its delicate flavor and is extremely easy to brew. Simply steep 1-2 teaspoons of leaves in 8 oz of water at 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C) for 2-3 minutes.\n2. **Adagio Teas' White Peony**: Adagio offers a high-quality White Peony that's easy to brew and has a light, floral flavor. Steep 1 teaspoon of leaves in 8 oz of water at 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) for 2-3 minutes.\n\n**Budget-friendly Options:**\n\n1. **Harney & Sons' White Tea**: This American tea company offers a high-quality White Peony at an affordable price. It's a great introduction to white tea without breaking the bank.\n2. **The Republic of Tea's White Tea**: This company offers a range of white teas, including a Silver Needle and a White Peony, at an affordable price point.\n\n**Tips for Brewing White Tea:**\n\n1. **Use good quality water**: White tea is sensitive to water quality, so use filtered or bottled water to bring out the best flavor.\n2. **Use the right temperature**: White tea prefers lower temperatures, between 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C) and 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C), to prevent bitterness.\n3. **Steep for the right amount of time**: Steep white tea for 2-3 minutes to bring out the delicate flavors.\n4. **Use the right amount of leaves**: Use 1-2 teaspoons of leaves per 8 oz of water to prevent over-extraction.\n\nWhen it comes to price, you can expect to pay between $5 to $15 per ounce (28g) for high-quality white tea. This may seem steep, but a little white tea goes a long way, and you can brew multiple cups from a single ounce.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your white tea journey!",
