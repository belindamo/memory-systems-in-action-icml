  "content": "Yes, here are a few statistics on the negative impact of social media use on mental health:\n\n1. A study conducted by the Royal Society for Public Health found that social media platforms, particularly Instagram, are harmful to mental health. About 70% of young people reported experiencing sleep problems, anxiety, depression, and negative body image due to social media use.\n\n2. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that a significant proportion of people in the U.S. feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content on social media. About 43% of Americans reported experiencing emotional or mental distress caused by social media use.\n\n3. A study published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology found that limiting social media use to 30 minutes a day can result in improvements in well-being, including reduced depression and loneliness.\n\nThese statistics suggest that social media use can have negative effects on mental health and well-being. However, it's important to note that the impact can vary from person to person and depends on several individual and environmental factors.",
