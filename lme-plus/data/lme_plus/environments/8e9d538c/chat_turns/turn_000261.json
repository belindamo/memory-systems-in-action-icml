  "content": "This is a motivational speech that encourages people to take risks and not be afraid of failure. The speaker quotes Nelson Mandela and encourages listeners to pursue their passions and not settle for a life that is less than they are capable of living. The speaker challenges the concept of having something to fall back on, stating that they would rather fall forward and see what they are going to hit. The speech also references an old IQ test that required people to think outside the box and draw lines without lifting the pencil, and encourages listeners to not be afraid to think outside the box and fail big. The speaker references Reggie Jackson and Thomas Edison, both of whom experienced many failures before achieving great success. The overall message of the speech is to not be afraid to take risks and fail, as failure is often a necessary step on the path to success.",
