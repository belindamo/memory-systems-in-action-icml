  "content": "Great job on misting Lola and getting a humidifier! That's excellent care.\n\nFertilizing Lola can definitely help her thrive, especially since you've already addressed the humidity issue. Spider plants are light feeders, so they don't require a lot of fertilizer. Here's a general guideline:\n\n**Fertilization frequency:**\n\n* Feed Lola with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) once a month during the growing season (spring and summer).\n* During the dormant season (fall and winter), you can reduce fertilization to every 6-8 weeks.\n\n**Fertilization tips:**\n\n* Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning Lola's roots.\n* Fertilize Lola when the soil is moist, but not waterlogged. This will help the fertilizer absorb better.\n* You can also use a fertilizer specifically formulated for tropical plants or houseplants, as they often contain micronutrients that benefit Spider plants.\n\n**Some additional notes:**\n\n* If you're using a high-quality potting mix, it may contain slow-release fertilizers that provide nutrients for several months. Check the packaging or manufacturer's instructions to see if this is the case.\n* If Lola is producing a lot of baby plants (spiderettes), you can fertilize her more frequently (every 2-3 weeks) to promote healthy growth.\n\nRemember, fertilizing is just one aspect of plant care. Make sure to continue monitoring Lola's overall health, adjusting her care as needed, and addressing any potential issues promptly.\n\nBy the way, 2 hours of humidifier use per day is a great start! You can adjust the duration based on the humidity levels in your room and Lola's response. Keep an eye on her, and if you notice any signs of over-humidification (like root rot or fungal issues), you can reduce the humidifier's runtime.",
