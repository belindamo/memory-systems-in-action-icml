  "content": "While fetal surgery has advanced significantly in recent years, it is unlikely that all surgeries will be performed in utero in the future. Some conditions may still be better treated after birth, depending on the severity and nature of the anomaly. Moreover, fetal surgery is not without risks and involves significant ethical considerations.\n\nHowever, as technology continues to advance and the understanding of fetal diseases becomes more sophisticated, it is possible that fetal surgery will become more common for treating certain conditions that are currently untreatable or difficult to manage. In the future, surgeons may be able to perform increasingly complex procedures with greater accuracy, safety, and improved long-term outcomes. \n\nUltimately, the decision to perform fetal surgery will always depend on the specific condition of the fetus, the risks and benefits of the procedure, and the preferences of the parents. Fetal surgery is a complex and evolving field, and a consultation with a specialized medical team is crucial to determine the best course of action for each case.",
