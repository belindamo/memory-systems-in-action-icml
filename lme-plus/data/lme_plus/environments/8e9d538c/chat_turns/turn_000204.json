When used in combination with back-button autofocus, you'll have even more control over your camera and can minimize camera movement.\n\n**Tips for Using a Remote Shutter Release:**\n\n1. **Use it in conjunction with BBAF**: With back-button autofocus, you'll be able to focus on the bird without taking a photo. Then, use the remote shutter release to take the photo, reducing camera shake and blur.\n2. **Use a short release delay**: Set the remote shutter release to a short delay (e.g., 2-3 seconds) to minimize camera movement. This will give the camera time to settle before taking the photo.\n3. **Use a comfortable position**: Hold the camera and remote shutter release in a comfortable position, allowing you to maintain a steady hand and reduce camera movement.\n4. **Practice your technique**: Get familiar with using the remote shutter release and back-button autofocus together. Practice your technique to ensure you're getting the best results.\n\n**Additional Benefits of a Remote Shutter Release:**\n\n1. **Reduced Camera Movement**: By using a remote shutter release, you'll reduce camera movement and blur caused by pressing the shutter button.\n2. **Improved Composition**: With a remote shutter release, you can focus on composition and framing without worrying about camera shake.\n3. **Increased Flexibility**: A remote shutter release gives you more flexibility when shooting in tight spaces or from unusual angles.\n\nBy combining back-button autofocus, a remote shutter release, and the AF Customization settings on your Sigma lens and AF Case settings on your Canon EOS 80D, you'll be well-equipped to tackle the challenges of bird photography. Remember to practice and adjust your techniques as needed to get the best results.",
