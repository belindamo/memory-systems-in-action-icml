  "content": "I've been thinking about experimenting with different clays and materials for my next project. I've had a great experience with the classes at Sculpture Haven, where I learned the basics of sculpting with clay. My instructor, Rachel, was amazing and really helped me improve my techniques. I'm thinking of trying out some new clays and materials, so I'd love to learn more about their properties and how to work with them.",
