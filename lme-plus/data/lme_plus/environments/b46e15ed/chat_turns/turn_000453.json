  "content": "Let's get your black boots added to the spreadsheet.\n\nHere's an example of what the entry might look like:\n\n| **Date** | **Shoe Type** | **Shoe Name** | **Wear Count** | **Notes** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023-02-10 | Boots | Black Boots | 5 |  |\n\nSince you bought the boots on February 10th, we'll use that as the start date. The wear count is 5, which means you've worn them 5 times since you got them.\n\nYou can add any notes or comments about the boots in the **Notes** column. For example, you might want to note that they need polishing, or that they're comfortable, or that you've had issues with the buckles.\n\nHere are a few questions to help you fill out the **Notes** column:\n\n* Have you noticed any wear and tear on the boots, such as scuffs or scratches?\n* Are there any maintenance tasks you need to perform, like conditioning the leather or cleaning the soles?\n* How do the boots fit and feel? Are they comfortable, or do you need to break them in further?\n\nFeel free to add any relevant information in the **Notes** column. This will help you keep track of your boots' condition and ensure you're taking good care of them.\n\nOnce you've added the entry, you can move on to your next pair of shoes. Remember to update the spreadsheet regularly to keep your shoe wear data accurate and up-to-date!",
