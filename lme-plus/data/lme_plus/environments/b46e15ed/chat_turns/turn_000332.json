Their debut album \"My Mind Makes Noises\" is a great starting point.\n2. **The Neighbourhood**: This American indie-rock band has a similar moody, synth-heavy sound to The 1975. Check out their album \"Wiped Out!\" for a taste.\n3. **Arctic Monkeys**: While not as overtly pop-oriented as The 1975, Arctic Monkeys' blend of indie rock and psychedelia might appeal to fans of The 1975's earlier work.
