Filon's stomach grumbled at the thought of all the delicious options available to them.\n\n\"Hey Xiangling, have you ever tried Neapolitan-style pizza?\" Filon asked, his eyes sparkling with excitement.\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" Xiangling replied, looking intrigued. \"What's Neapolitan-style pizza?\"\n\n\"It's a traditional Italian pizza that originated in Naples,\" Filon explained. \"It's made with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil, and it's cooked in a wood-fired oven at a high temperature for a short amount of time.
