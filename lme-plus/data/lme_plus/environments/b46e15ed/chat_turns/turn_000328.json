It describes the rust and wear on the vehicle, but it also speaks about its strength and durability, how it is built to last and endure rough terrain and how it has a rugged spirit that allows it to carry on and continue to roam the land. It also mentions that even though it may not be the most beautiful to behold, but it is not forlorn in its strength.",
