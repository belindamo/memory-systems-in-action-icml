  "content": "As the Industrial Revolution progressed, the government did take some steps to address the issues faced by the working-class people. Here are some of the actions taken by the government during that time:\n\n1. Factory Acts: In the early 19th century, the government passed several Factory Acts that placed restrictions on working hours for women and children, and mandated certain safety measures in factories.\n\n2. Public Health Acts: Starting in the mid-19th century, the government passed several Public Health Acts that aimed to improve sanitation, cleanliness, and public health. This led to the creation of public water supplies, sewage systems, and the appointment of medical officers to oversee public health.\n\n3. Education Acts: In the mid-19th century, the government passed Education Acts that provided for mandatory education for all children up to the age of 10. This led to the establishment of public schools that provided basic education to children from all backgrounds.\n\n4. Housing Acts: The government passed several Housing Acts that aimed to improve the living conditions of working-class people by providing better housing and sanitation.\n\nWhile these measures helped to some extent, they were not comprehensive and didn't solve all the problems. The working conditions and living conditions of the working-class people continued to be a concern well into the 20th century, and many of the issues faced by people during the Industrial Revolution are still present in some parts of the world today.",
