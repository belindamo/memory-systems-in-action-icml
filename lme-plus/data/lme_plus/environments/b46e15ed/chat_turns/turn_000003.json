  "content": "Let's get your tasks organized to help you achieve your short-term goal of getting an MVP out to pilot customers.\n\nTo start, can you share the tasks you have in mind for your MVP development? These can be high-level or detailed, and don't worry too much about their order or priority at this point. Just brain dump everything that comes to mind.\n\nSome examples to get you started:\n\n* Development tasks: features to build, bugs to fix, infrastructure setup, etc.\n* Team-building tasks: finding developers, conducting interviews, onboarding new team members, etc.\n* Design tasks: user experience, user interface, branding, etc.\n* Business tasks: marketing, sales, customer acquisition, etc.\n\nOnce you share your tasks, I can help you:\n\n* Group similar tasks together (e.g., all development tasks, all team-building tasks, etc.)\n* Identify dependencies between tasks (e.g., you need to finish the infrastructure setup before building certain features)\n* Prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency for your MVP\n* Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks\n* Create a rough timeline for completing tasks, assuming you find the right team members soon\n\nRemember, this is a collaborative process, and we can refine your task list as needed.\n\nType away, and let's get started!",
