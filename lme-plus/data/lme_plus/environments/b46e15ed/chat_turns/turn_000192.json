  "content": "I think that's a beautiful idea! Having photos and mementos of your great aunt on display during the reunion would be a wonderful way to keep her memory present and celebrated throughout the day. It would also give family members a chance to reflect on their own memories of her and share them with each other.\n\nSetting up a little area with some of her favorite things, like her favorite books or hobbies, would be a lovely tribute to her life and legacy. It would also provide a conversation starter and help to create a sense of connection among family members.\n\nI think it's a great way to honor her memory and make the reunion feel more personal and meaningful. It's not just a celebration of the family, but also a celebration of her life and the impact she had on everyone.\n\nAs for recruiting volunteers, that's a great idea too! Getting everyone involved in the planning and execution of the reunion can help to build excitement and create a sense of ownership among family members. By making a list of supplies and tasks and having people sign up in advance, you can ensure that everything gets covered and that no one person is overwhelmed with responsibilities.\n\nIt's also a good way to involve family members who may not be able to attend the reunion in person, but can still contribute in other ways, such as by providing photos or mementos, or helping with preparations remotely.\n\nOverall, I think you're on the right track with your planning, and these ideas will help to make the reunion a special and memorable event for everyone involved.",
