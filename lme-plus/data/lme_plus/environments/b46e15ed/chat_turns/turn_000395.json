  "content": "Filon continued cooking, carefully spreading out the tomato sauce on the dough and adding slices of mozzarella cheese. He carefully placed the pizza in the oven, setting a timer for 15 minutes.\n\nAs he waited for the pizza to cook, Filon chatted with Ganyu and Ningguang about his travels and experiences in Italy. Ganyu listened with interest, asking questions about the different regions and their cuisine. Ningguang seemed more skeptical, but was intrigued by the idea of a Neapolitan-style pizza.\n\nFinally, the timer went off and Filon carefully removed the pizza from the oven. He garnished it with fresh basil leaves and cut it into slices.\n\nGanyu eagerly took a slice and took a bite, savoring the flavors. \"This is delicious,\" she exclaimed.\n\nNingguang took a more cautious approach, taking a small bite and nodding in approval. \"Not bad,\" she said. \"The tomato sauce is very flavorful and the cheese is melted perfectly.\"\n\nFilon beamed with pride at the positive reactions. \"I'm glad you like it,\" he said. \"I learned to make it when I was studying in Italy. It's a classic dish from the region of Naples.\"\n\nGanyu and Ningguang continued to eat the pizza, praising Filon's cooking skills. Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as he watched his friends enjoy his food.",
