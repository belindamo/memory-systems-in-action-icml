I'd be happy to help you organize your to-do list and build on that momentum.\n\nTo get started, can you please share your tasks with me? You can share as many or as few tasks as you have, and I'll help you categorize, prioritize, and organize them.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to know:\n\n1. What kind of product are you working on (software, hardware, service, etc.)?\n2. What are your short-term and long-term goals for the product?\n3. Are there any specific areas you're struggling with or feeling overwhelmed about?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your tasks and goals, I can help you:\n\n* Categorize tasks into themes or groups\n* Identify dependencies between tasks\n* Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency\n* Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks\n* Create a rough timeline for completing tasks\n\nLet's get started!",
