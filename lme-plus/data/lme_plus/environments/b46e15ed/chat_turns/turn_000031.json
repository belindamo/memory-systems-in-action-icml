  "content": "Kobe is a great choice! You'll love the food scene there, and Kobe beef is definitely a must-try. It's a great way to treat yourself after exploring Himeji and before heading back to Tokyo.\n\nI'm impressed that you're cooking meals at home in your tiny apartment in Kichijoji to save money. That's not always easy, especially in a small kitchen! But it's great that you're making an effort to be frugal. You can always splurge a bit on special occasions or during your travels, like trying Kobe beef in Kobe.\n\nKobe is a charming city, and you'll enjoy the harbor area, the waterfront, and the scenic views. Be sure to try some other local specialties like Kobe-style croquettes, Akashiyaki (small, round pancakes), and Soba noodles. And, of course, don't miss the famous Kobe beef at one of the many restaurants in the city.\n\nWhen you're planning your trip, consider visiting the Kobe Beef Marketing & Distribution Promotion Association, which offers a free guided tour and a chance to sample some of the famous beef. You can also visit the Kobe City Oishi Kan, a food theme park with various restaurants and shops selling local specialties.\n\nHave fun planning your trip, and I hope you enjoy your time in Himeji and Kobe!",
