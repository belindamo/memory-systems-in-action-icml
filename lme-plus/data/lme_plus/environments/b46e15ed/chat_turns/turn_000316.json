Shape into patties and pan-fry until crispy. Serve with a refreshing asparagus slaw made by chopping the leftover asparagus, adding some diced red onion, lemon juice, and a drizzle of olive oil.\n\n**Wednesday:**\n\n* **Quinoa and Veggie Stir-Fry**: Use the leftover quinoa as the base for a quick and easy stir-fry. Add your favorite veggies (bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, etc.) and some oil, garlic, and ginger for flavor. You can also add some protein like tofu, chicken, or shrimp if you like.\n\n**Thursday:**\n\n* **Salmon and Asparagus Wrap**: Fill a whole wheat tortilla with leftover salmon, roasted asparagus, mixed greens, and a dollop of tzatziki sauce (or your favorite spread). Add some sliced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, or avocado for extra freshness.\n\n**Friday:**\n\n* **Quinoa and Black Bean Bowl**: Cook some black beans and add them to the leftover quinoa. Top with diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, diced avocado, and a drizzle of your favorite salsa or hot sauce. You can also add some grilled chicken or steak if you like.\n\n**Other ideas:**\n\n* Use leftover quinoa to make a quinoa salad with chopped veggies, feta cheese, and a lemon vinaigrette.\n* Add the leftover asparagus to a frittata or omelette for a nutritious breakfast or brunch.\n* Mix the leftover salmon with some Greek yogurt and dill for a tasty dip or spread.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create some delicious and healthy meals using your leftovers!",
