That's a fantastic combination that will indeed add a touch of elegance and sophistication while keeping the design understated and focused on the beautiful walnut wood.\n\nBrass accents will bring a warm, luxurious feel to your dresser, and the simple knobs will provide a clean, minimalist look that won't distract from the stunning walnut grain pattern. It's a perfect blend of style and subtlety.\n\nRemember to choose a high-quality brass finish that will maintain its beauty over time, and consider using a soft, matte finish to avoid any harsh reflections or glare.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck with your project, and I'm confident that your mid-century modern walnut dresser will turn out to be a stunning piece of furniture that you'll cherish for years to come!",
