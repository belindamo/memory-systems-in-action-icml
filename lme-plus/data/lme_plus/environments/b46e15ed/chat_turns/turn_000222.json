  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot speculate on the intentions of the Iraqi government or individual politicians. However, there are certainly concerns that some politicians in Iraq may be more interested in promoting their own interests than in addressing the country's challenges. \n\nGiven the long history of corruption and political infighting in Iraq, there are certainly reasons to be skeptical about the government's commitment to tackling these problems. However, it is also important to note that there are many people and organizations in Iraq, including civil society groups and activists, who are working hard to promote greater accountability, transparency, and good governance. \n\nFurthermore, there is some evidence that the government is taking steps to address corruption and improve governance, such as the formation of an anti-corruption court and implementation of reforms. Regardless, more needs to be done to combat corruption and promote good governance in Iraq, and it will require sustained efforts from the government and civil society over the long term.",
