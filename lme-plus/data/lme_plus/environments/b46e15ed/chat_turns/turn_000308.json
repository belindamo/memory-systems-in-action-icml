This was done to ensure the safety of both fans and players. The team implemented several measures such as social distancing in seating, the mandatory use of face coverings, and temperature checks to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. The number of fans allowed was capped at 25% of the stadium's capacity, as per the NFL's guidelines. The team has continued with this limited capacity approach for the 2021 season to maintain a safe environment for everyone.",
