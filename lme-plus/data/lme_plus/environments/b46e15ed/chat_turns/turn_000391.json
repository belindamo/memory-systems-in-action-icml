  "content": "As Filon and Xiangling walked through the streets of Liyue, Filon couldn't help but feel a bit nervous. He had been practicing his cooking skills for weeks, trying to perfect a traditional Portuguese dish to impress Xiangling. He had even gone to Ganyu, the secretary of the Liyue Qixing, for advice on where to find the best ingredients.\n\n\"I hope you like this, Xiangling,\" Filon said, trying to sound confident. \"I've been working on it for a while now.\"\n\nXiangling smiled at him. \"I'm sure it will be great, Filon. You're always so thoughtful.\"\n\nAs they approached Filon's mansion, they were greeted by Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing. \"Filon, Xiangling, what a surprise to see you both here,\" she said.\n\nFilon grinned. \"I wanted to cook a special meal for Xiangling, and I thought it would be even better if we had some company.\"\n\nNingguang's eyes lit up. \"Cooking, you say? I happen to be quite skilled in the kitchen myself. Perhaps I could lend a hand?\"\n\nFilon nodded eagerly. \"I would love that, Ningguang. And there's someone else I'd like you to meet.\" He led them into the kitchen, where they were greeted by a tall, dark-haired man with a thick Italian accent.\n\n\"This is my friend Marco, from Sicily,\" Filon explained. \"He's been teaching me how to make Neapolitan-style pizza.\"\n\nMarco grinned and waved. \"Ciao! It's a pleasure to meet you both.\"\n\nAs they set to work, Filon explained the process of making a traditional margherita pizza. He mixed together flour, water, salt, and yeast to create the dough, then rolled it out into a thin, circular shape. Next, he spread a layer of crushed tomatoes over the dough, followed by slices of mozzarella cheese and a few fresh basil leaves.\n\n\"And now, the most important part,\" Marco said, grinning as he pulled out a small jar of olive oil. \"A little bit of this, just around the edges of the crust, and your pizza will be perfect.\"\n\nFilon carefully drizzled the oil over the edges of the crust, then slid the pizza into the oven to bake. As the aroma of freshly baked bread and melted cheese filled the kitchen, Ningguang and Xiangling couldn't help but be impressed.\n\n\"This looks amazing, Filon",
