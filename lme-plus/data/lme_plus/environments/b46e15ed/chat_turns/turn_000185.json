My great aunt lived a long and fulfilling life, and it was amazing to celebrate her life in a place that holds so much significance for me - the same church where I had a significant life event. Anyway, back to the reunion... do you think it's a good idea to have some outdoor activities, like games or a picnic, if the venue allows it?",
