  "content": "That's a great idea about having a potluck and sharing stories and memories of my great aunt! I think that will really add to the sense of community and make the event feel more special.\n\nAs for planning the picnic and lawn games, I think I'll keep things relatively simple and informal. We can set up a few tables and chairs, and have a designated area for the potluck dishes. For lawn games, we can probably just set up a few stations with different activities, like cornhole, giant Jenga, and maybe a few board games or cards for people who want to take a break from the sun.\n\nI don't think we need to have a specific theme or schedule of activities, since the goal is just to have fun and spend time together. We can just let people mingle and do their own thing, and see what happens. And of course, we'll make sure to have plenty of drinks and snacks available to keep everyone hydrated and energized throughout the day.\n\nOne thing",
