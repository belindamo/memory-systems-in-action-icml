  "content": "Yes, you're right. The Keycloak server distribution package is now available on the Keycloak GitHub repository. Here is the revised one-liner command that will download and extract the `kcadm.sh` script from the Keycloak server distribution package version 15.0.2 and copy it to `/usr/local/bin`:\n```bash\nsudo curl -L https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/download/15.0.2/keycloak-15.0.2.tar.gz | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin --strip-components=1 keycloak-15.0.2/bin/kcadm.sh\n```\nThis command downloads the Keycloak server distribution package version 15.0.2 from the Keycloak GitHub repository, extracts the `kcadm.sh` script from the `bin` directory, and copies it to `/usr/local/bin`. The `sudo` command is used to run the command with elevated privileges to allow writing to `/usr/local/bin`.\n\nOnce the command has completed successfully, you can use the `kcadm.sh` script from any directory on your Linux box by simply typing `kcadm.sh` followed by the desired command.",
