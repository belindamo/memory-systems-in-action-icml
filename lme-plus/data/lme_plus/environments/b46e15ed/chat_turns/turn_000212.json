  "content": "The `kcadm.sh` script is designed to work with the version of Keycloak that it was released with, and there is no guarantee that it will work with a different version of Keycloak. It is generally recommended to use the same version of `kcadm.sh` as the Keycloak server that you are managing.\n\nThat being said, minor version differences (e.g., 15.0.2 and 15.0.3) may be compatible with each other and may work without any issues. However, major version differences (e.g., 15.x.x and 16.x.x) are likely to have compatibility issues.\n\nIn summary, it is best to use the same version of `kcadm.sh` as the Keycloak server that you are managing to ensure compatibility and avoid any potential issues.",
