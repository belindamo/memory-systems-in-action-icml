However, as per the latest reports, the Buccaneers have been continually monitoring the situation and working closely with local health officials and the NFL to determine the safest way to host games with fans. It is expected that the capacity for fans allowed in the stadium can be increased as more people get vaccinated, and the situation continues to improve, depending on the recommendations from the health authorities.
