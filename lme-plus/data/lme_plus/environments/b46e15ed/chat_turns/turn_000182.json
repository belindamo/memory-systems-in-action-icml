What a beautiful way to honor your great aunt's memory!\n\nNow, let's focus on finding the perfect venue for your family reunion! \n\nFor an intimate gathering of 50 people, you have several options to consider. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Community Centers**: Many community centers have event spaces that can accommodate small to medium-sized groups. They often offer amenities like tables, chairs, and kitchen facilities, making them a convenient choice.\n2. **Local Parks or Recreation Departments**: Parks and recreation departments often have picnic shelters, pavilions, or event spaces that can be reserved for private events. These outdoor spaces can be lovely for a casual, laid-back reunion.\n3. **Small Event Venues**: Look for independent event spaces in your area that specialize in hosting smaller gatherings. These might be converted warehouses, historic homes, or boutique event spaces with character.\n4. **Restaurants with Private Rooms**: Some restaurants have private dining rooms that can be reserved for events. This option is great if you want to keep things simple and have catering taken care of.\n5. **Family-Friendly Hotels**: If you're planning a multi-day reunion or want to offer accommodations for out-of-town guests, consider a family-friendly hotel with event space. They often have amenities like pools, game rooms, and restaurants on site.\n6. **Historic Mansions or Estates**: If you want to create a memorable and unique experience, look into historic mansions or estates that offer event spaces. These can add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your reunion.\n\nWhen searching for a venue, be sure to consider factors like:\n\n* Capacity: Ensure the venue can comfortably accommodate your expected number of guests.\n* Amenities: Think about the types of amenities you need, such as catering options, audio-visual equipment, and parking.\n* Location: Choose a venue that's easily accessible for your guests, with nearby parking and accommodations if needed.\n* Ambiance: Select a venue that fits your reunion's tone and style.\n\nYou can start your search online by looking up event spaces in your desired location. Websites like Eventbrite, Meetup, or even social media platforms like Facebook can help you discover potential venues.\n\nFeel free to provide more details about your preferences, and I'd be happy to help you narrow down the options!",
