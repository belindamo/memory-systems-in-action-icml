I spent a semester in Naples and became fascinated by their traditional pizza making techniques. When I returned to Mondstadt, I started experimenting with different recipes and ingredients until I finally landed on this one. I'm glad you all enjoy it.\"\n\nGanyu nodded appreciatively as she took another bite of her slice. \"It's definitely a step above the pizzas we get at the local shops. The crust is perfectly chewy and the tomato sauce has such a rich, savory flavor.\"\n\nNingguang, who had been skeptical at first, also seemed to be enjoying her slice. \"I must admit, it's quite good. You have a real talent for cooking, Filon.\"\n\nFilon grinned and thanked everyone for their kind words. As they finished their slices and cleaned up, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. Cooking was a passion of his, and it was gratifying to see others enjoy the dishes he worked so hard to perfect.\"",
