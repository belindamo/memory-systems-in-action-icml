  "content": "The efforts of the leaders and organizations that emerged during the Great Migration had a significant impact on the broader civil rights movement. Their work laid the groundwork for many of the strategies and tactics that would be used in the fight for civil rights in the decades that followed.\n\nFor example, the legal victories achieved by the NAACP in the 1910s and 1920s set important precedents for future civil rights cases. The Urban League's efforts to promote economic opportunity and self-sufficiency for African Americans helped to lay the foundation for later campaigns for economic justice.\n\nMarcus Garvey's promotion of black self-determination and pride in African heritage also had a lasting impact on the civil rights movement. Garvey's ideas were embraced by later figures such as Malcolm X and the Black Power movement, who advocated for black nationalism and self-determination.\n\nOverall, the efforts of these leaders and organizations helped to shape the course of the civil rights movement and lay the groundwork for the gains made in the 1950s and 1960s. Their work remains an important part of the broader struggle for racial justice and equality in the United States.",
