Both Nara and Himeji are wonderful destinations with plenty to offer, and they might be less crowded than Kyoto. Here's a brief rundown of each city to help you decide:\n\n**Nara**:\n\n* Distance from Kyoto: About 1 hour by train (JR Kintetsu Line)\n* Pros:\n\t+ Rich cultural heritage, with many UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including Todai-ji Temple and Kasuga-taisha Shrine\n\t+ Nara Park, a large park with friendly deer that you can feed and pet\n\t+ Relatively fewer tourists compared to Kyoto\n\t+ More affordable accommodations\n* Cons:\n\t+ Still a popular tourist destination, so expect some crowds\n\t+ Limited dining and nightlife options compared to Kyoto\n\n**Himeji**:\n\n* Distance from Kyoto: About 2.5 hours by train (JR Special Rapid Service)\n* Pros:\n\t+ Home to the stunning Himeji Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\t+ Less crowded than Kyoto and Nara, with a more relaxed atmosphere\n\t+ Rich history and cultural attractions, such as the Himeji Castle Park and Kokoen Garden\n\t+ More affordable accommodations\n* Cons:\n\t+ Further from Kyoto, so you'll need to plan your day trips carefully\n\t+ Limited dining and nightlife options compared to Kyoto\n\nRegarding language concerns, you'll still be able to communicate with locals in Nara and Himeji, especially in tourist areas. Many restaurants, shops, and attractions have English menus and signs, and some locals may speak basic English. You can also:\n\n* Download a translation app like Google Translate or TripLingo to help with communication\n* Learn basic Japanese phrases, which will be appreciated by the locals\n* Carry a phrasebook or print out essential phrases to show to locals\n* Ask your Airbnb host for recommendations and assistance, as they may be able to provide valuable insights and language help\n\nIf you're comfortable with a more laid-back atmosphere and don't mind exploring a smaller town, Nara or Himeji could be an excellent choice. However, if you're set on experiencing the vibrant atmosphere and numerous attractions of Kyoto, consider booking your accommodations and popular attractions in advance to minimize the impact of the crowds.\n\nRemember, as an English teacher in Roppongi, you're already making an effort to learn Japanese, and that will certainly help you during your trip. Ganbatte (good luck), and I hope you have a wonderful time in Japan!",
