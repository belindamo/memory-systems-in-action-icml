For instance, take a few deep breaths in the morning before you start your day. 2. Make it a daily habit: Consistency is key to forming a habit. Aim to practice your chosen mindfulness routine at the same time every day, like before breakfast or after your daily walk. 3. Set reminders: Set reminders in your phone or put post-it notes in visible places to remind yourself to do your mindfulness practice. 4. Find an accountability partner: Find someone who can support and encourage you to stick to your mindfulness routine. You can also practice together or have check-ins to help you stay motivated. 5. Celebrate small wins: Celebrate when you stick to your mindfulness routine to motivate yourself to continue. Positive reinforcement can help solidify the habit. Remember, it's okay to slip up now and then. If you miss a day or two, just start again. The key to forming a habit is consistency and persistence.",
