  "content": "Yes, that's definitely one way to look at it. The Industrial Revolution brought about significant economic growth, but this growth often came at the expense of the working-class people who were seen as expendable laborers whose sole purpose was to keep the economy running.\n\nFor much of the Industrial Revolution, the government's primary concern was maximizing economic output, with less consideration given to the welfare and rights of workers. This resulted in poor working conditions, low wages, and a lack of protections for workers. \n\nIt wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that substantial improvements were made in the rights and conditions of workers. The labor movement played a key role in pushing for and achieving these changes, including the establishment of minimum wages, better working conditions, and the right to unionize.\n\nOverall, the Industrial Revolution was a complex period with both positive and negative outcomes. While it brought about significant economic growth, it also had profound consequences for the working-class people who were often marginalized and exploited.",
