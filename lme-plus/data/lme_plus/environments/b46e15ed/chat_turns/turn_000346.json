  "content": "Renewing your passport is a great priority before applying for a visa.\n\nIt's recommended to renew your passport before applying for an Indian visa. Here's why:\n\n1. **Passport validity:** As you mentioned, your passport expires in 6 months, which is the minimum validity required for an Indian visa. If your passport expires before the visa's validity period, you might face issues during your trip.\n2. **Visa application:** The Indian visa application process requires your passport details, including the passport number, issue date, and expiry date. With a new passport, you'll have a new passport number, which you'll need to provide in your visa application.\n3. **Avoid potential delays:** If you apply for a visa with an expiring passport, the Indian authorities might request additional documentation or delay your application until you obtain a new passport. This could lead to processing delays and affect your travel plans.\n\nTo avoid any complications, it's best to:\n\n1. Renew your passport first: Apply for a passport renewal and wait for the new passport to arrive.\n2. Update your details: Once you receive your new passport, update your personal details, including your passport number, on the Indian visa application portal (if you've already started the application process).\n3. Apply for the visa: With your new passport in hand, you can proceed with the visa application process.\n\nHowever, if you're short on time, you can apply for both simultaneously, but be prepared for the following:\n\n1. **Potential delays:** Your visa application might be delayed until your new passport arrives.\n2. **Additional documentation:** You might need to provide additional documentation, such as proof of passport renewal, to the Indian authorities.\n\nTo minimize delays, consider the following:\n\n1. **Expedited passport renewal:** If you're in a hurry, consider expedited passport renewal services, which can take 2-3 weeks.\n2. **Track your applications:** Keep track of both your passport renewal and visa applications to ensure you receive updates and can respond promptly to any requests.\n\nRemember to plan ahead, and it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to travel documentation.",
