  "content": "During the Industrial Revolution, the government's primary focus was on promoting economic growth, rather than creating a more equitable society. There was a belief that economic growth would eventually lead to better living and working conditions for everyone, including the working-class people.\n\nHowever, there were also movements and individuals who advocated for greater social and economic equality during the period. For example, socialists and trade unionists called for better wages, working conditions, and universal suffrage. They argued that the government should do more to address the problems of the working-class people, rather than simply making superficial changes.\n\nThe government's response to these demands varied. Some reforms, such as the Factory Acts and Public Health Acts, were passed in response to pressure from activists and social reformers. However, the government was often reluctant to take more radical steps, fearing that it would harm economic growth and the interests of business owners.\n\nIn summary, while there were voices calling for greater social and economic equality during the Industrial Revolution, the government's primary focus was largely on promoting economic growth, and there was often resistance to more radical reforms.",
