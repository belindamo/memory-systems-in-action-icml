In some cases, you might be:\n\n1. **Denied Entry:** You might be denied entry into India if your passport doesn't meet the blank page requirement.\n2. **Required to Obtain a New Passport:** In extreme cases, you might be asked to obtain a new passport with sufficient blank pages before being allowed to enter India.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Check your passport:** Before applying for an Indian visa, ensure your passport has at least two blank pages.\n2. **Renew your passport:** If your passport is nearing expiration or has fewer than two blank pages, consider renewing it before applying for an Indian visa.\n3. **Plan ahead:** Leave some extra blank pages in your passport for future travel, as you never know when you might need them.\n\nNow that you know, make sure to check your passport and plan accordingly. Safe travels to India!",
