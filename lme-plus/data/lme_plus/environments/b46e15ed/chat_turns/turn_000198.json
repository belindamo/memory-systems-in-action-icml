  "content": "Yes, you can install the `kcadm.sh` CLI on the same machine where you have installed the Keycloak server. In fact, the `kcadm.sh` CLI comes bundled with the Keycloak server distribution package, so if you have installed Keycloak on your Linux box, the CLI should already be available.\n\nTo check if the `kcadm.sh` CLI is available on your machine, navigate to the `bin` directory where Keycloak is installed and look for the `kcadm.sh` script. You can use the following command to navigate to the Keycloak installation directory:\n```bash\ncd /path/to/keycloak-<version>/bin/\n```\nReplace `/path/to/keycloak-<version>/` with the actual path where Keycloak is installed and `<version>` with the version number of Keycloak that you have installed.\n\nOnce you are in the `bin` directory, you can run the `kcadm.sh` script to execute Keycloak commands using the CLI.\n\nNote that you may need to add execute permission to the `kcadm.sh` script before running it. You can do so using the following command:\n```bash\nchmod +x kcadm.sh\n```\nThis will give the execute permission to the `kcadm.sh` script, allowing you to run it.",
