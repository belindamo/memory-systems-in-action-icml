  "content": "Yes, the standalone `kcadm.sh` script extracted from the Keycloak server distribution package should work properly as long as it is compatible with the version of Keycloak you are using.\n\nThe `kcadm.sh` script is essentially a command-line interface for Keycloak's REST API, so it depends on the Keycloak server to function properly. However, since the `kcadm.sh` script does not require any server-side components to be installed, it can be used independently of the Keycloak server.\n\nWhen you extract the `kcadm.sh` script from the Keycloak server distribution package, you are essentially extracting a standalone version of the script that can be used to manage Keycloak instances. As long as the version of the standalone `kcadm.sh` script matches the version of the Keycloak server you are using, it should work properly.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that when you use the standalone `kcadm.sh` script, you will need to specify the Keycloak server URL, admin username, and password for each command you execute. If you install the full Keycloak server on your machine, you can avoid having to specify these details each time you execute a command by configuring the Keycloak server instance to use an embedded H2 database and creating an initial admin user.",
