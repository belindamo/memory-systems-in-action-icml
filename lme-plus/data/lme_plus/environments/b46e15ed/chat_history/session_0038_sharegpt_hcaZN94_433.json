      "content": "As Filon and Xiangling walked through the streets of Liyue, Filon couldn't help but feel a bit nervous. He had been practicing his cooking skills for weeks, trying to perfect a traditional Portuguese dish to impress Xiangling. He had even gone to Ganyu, the secretary of the Liyue Qixing, for advice on where to find the best ingredients.\n\n\"I hope you like this, Xiangling,\" Filon said, trying to sound confident. \"I've been working on it for a while now.\"\n\nXiangling smiled at him. \"I'm sure it will be great, Filon. You're always so thoughtful.\"\n\nAs they approached Filon's mansion, they were greeted by Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing. \"Filon, Xiangling, what a surprise to see you both here,\" she said.\n\nFilon grinned. \"I wanted to cook a special meal for Xiangling, and I thought it would be even better if we had some company.\"\n\nNingguang's eyes lit up. \"Cooking, you say? I happen to be quite skilled in the kitchen myself. Perhaps I could lend a hand?\"\n\nFilon nodded eagerly. \"I would love that, Ningguang. And there's someone else I'd like you to meet.\" He led them into the kitchen, where they were greeted by a tall, dark-haired man with a thick Italian accent.\n\n\"This is my friend Marco, from Sicily,\" Filon explained. \"He's been teaching me how to make Neapolitan-style pizza.\"\n\nMarco grinned and waved. \"Ciao! It's a pleasure to meet you both.\"\n\nAs they set to work, Filon explained the process of making a traditional margherita pizza. He mixed together flour, water, salt, and yeast to create the dough, then rolled it out into a thin, circular shape. Next, he spread a layer of crushed tomatoes over the dough, followed by slices of mozzarella cheese and a few fresh basil leaves.\n\n\"And now, the most important part,\" Marco said, grinning as he pulled out a small jar of olive oil. \"A little bit of this, just around the edges of the crust, and your pizza will be perfect.\"\n\nFilon carefully drizzled the oil over the edges of the crust, then slid the pizza into the oven to bake. As the aroma of freshly baked bread and melted cheese filled the kitchen, Ningguang and Xiangling couldn't help but be impressed.\n\n\"This looks amazing, Filon"

      "content": "Filon and Xiangling walked through the bustling streets of Liyue, the fragrant smells of various foods filling the air. Filon's stomach grumbled at the thought of all the delicious options available to them.\n\n\"Hey Xiangling, have you ever tried Neapolitan-style pizza?\" Filon asked, his eyes sparkling with excitement.\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" Xiangling replied, looking intrigued. \"What's Neapolitan-style pizza?\"\n\n\"It's a traditional Italian pizza that originated in Naples,\" Filon explained. \"It's made with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil, and it's cooked in a wood-fired oven at a high temperature for a short amount of time. It's one of my favorite dishes to cook.\"\n\n\"It sounds delicious,\" Xiangling said, a smile spreading across her face. \"Do you think you could make some for us?\"\n\nFilon grinned. \"Absolutely! I'd love to show off my pizza-making skills. Let's go to the market and pick up some ingredients.\"\n\nThe two of them made their way to the market, where Filon carefully selected the freshest tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil he could find. They also grabbed some flour, yeast, and olive oil.\n\nOnce they had everything they needed, Filon led Xiangling back to his mansion, where he set to work on the pizza. He mixed the flour, yeast, and water to create the dough, then let it rise for a few hours.\n\nWhile they waited, Filon and Xiangling chatted and enjoyed each other's company. Finally, the dough was ready. Filon carefully stretched it out into a thin circle and placed it on a baking sheet. He then topped it with the sliced tomatoes, shreds of mozzarella, and a sprinkle of basil.\n\n\"This looks amazing,\" Xiangling said, her eyes wide with excitement.\n\nFilon chuckled and placed the pizza in the oven. As it cooked, the aroma of the melting cheese and the sizzling crust filled the kitchen.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, Filon pulled the pizza out of the oven and sliced it into wedges. He and Xiangling sat down at the kitchen table and dug in, savoring the gooey cheese and the tangy tomato sauce.\n\n\"This is the best pizza I've ever had,\" Xiangling said, grinning from ear to ear.\n\nFilon beamed with pride. \"I'm glad you like it. I learned to make it when I"

      "content": "Filon continued cooking, carefully spreading out the tomato sauce on the dough and adding slices of mozzarella cheese. He carefully placed the pizza in the oven, setting a timer for 15 minutes.\n\nAs he waited for the pizza to cook, Filon chatted with Ganyu and Ningguang about his travels and experiences in Italy. Ganyu listened with interest, asking questions about the different regions and their cuisine. Ningguang seemed more skeptical, but was intrigued by the idea of a Neapolitan-style pizza.\n\nFinally, the timer went off and Filon carefully removed the pizza from the oven. He garnished it with fresh basil leaves and cut it into slices.\n\nGanyu eagerly took a slice and took a bite, savoring the flavors. \"This is delicious,\" she exclaimed.\n\nNingguang took a more cautious approach, taking a small bite and nodding in approval. \"Not bad,\" she said. \"The tomato sauce is very flavorful and the cheese is melted perfectly.\"\n\nFilon beamed with pride at the positive reactions. \"I'm glad you like it,\" he said. \"I learned to make it when I was studying in Italy. It's a classic dish from the region of Naples.\"\n\nGanyu and Ningguang continued to eat the pizza, praising Filon's cooking skills. Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as he watched his friends enjoy his food."

I fell in love with the art of pizza making, and decided to bring some of those techniques back with me. I'm glad you all enjoyed it.\"\n\nGanyu nodded appreciatively, her eyes closed as she savored the flavors on her tongue. \"This is truly a culinary masterpiece. I can't believe you managed to capture the authenticity of a Neapolitan-style pizza margherita here in Liyue. Your skills are truly impressive, Filon.\"\n\nNingguang, who had been hesitant to try the pizza at first, took another slice and nodded in agreement. \"I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this. Your cooking skills are quite impressive, Filon. You should consider opening a restaurant.\"\n\nFilon chuckled at the suggestion. \"I appreciate the compliment, but I'm afraid I'm not ready to take on such a daunting task. For now, I'm happy to share my love of cooking with friends and family.\"\n\nAs they finished the last slices of the delicious pizza, Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had always enjoyed cooking, but sharing his passion with others and seeing their enjoyment was truly fulfilling. He made a mental note to continue honing his skills and experimenting with new dishes in the future."

I spent a semester in Naples and became fascinated by their traditional pizza making techniques. When I returned to Mondstadt, I started experimenting with different recipes and ingredients until I finally landed on this one. I'm glad you all enjoy it.\"\n\nGanyu nodded appreciatively as she took another bite of her slice. \"It's definitely a step above the pizzas we get at the local shops. The crust is perfectly chewy and the tomato sauce has such a rich, savory flavor.\"\n\nNingguang, who had been skeptical at first, also seemed to be enjoying her slice. \"I must admit, it's quite good. You have a real talent for cooking, Filon.\"\n\nFilon grinned and thanked everyone for their kind words. As they finished their slices and cleaned up, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. Cooking was a passion of his, and it was gratifying to see others enjoy the dishes he worked so hard to perfect.\""
