      "content": "Barry, the Toyota Landcruiser of old\nWith rust upon thy frame, and paint so worn\nThou may not be the beauty to behold\nBut in thy strength, thou art not forlorn\n\nThy engine may not purr as it once did\nAnd gears may grind, with each shift of thy hand\nBut with each mile, thy spirit is not hid\nFor thou art built, to roam this land so grand\n\nWith every journey, thou dost carry on\nThrough rough terrain, and roads that are not kind\nThy strength and durability, anon\nA testament, to the ruggedness of thy mind\n\nBarry, the Toyota Landcruiser of old\nWith rust upon thy frame, and paint so worn\nThou may not be the beauty to behold\nBut in thy strength, thou art not forlorn\n\nThis sonnet is about an old Toyota Landcruiser, named Barry. It describes the rust and wear on the vehicle, but it also speaks about its strength and durability, how it is built to last and endure rough terrain and how it has a rugged spirit that allows it to carry on and continue to roam the land. It also mentions that even though it may not be the most beautiful to behold, but it is not forlorn in its strength."
