Allotments help agencies manage inventory and pricing, while group bookings offer discounted fares and special perks for large groups."

      "content": "The main difference in the booking process between group bookings and allotment bookings lies in the reservation and pricing approach:\n\nGroup Booking Process:\n\n1. A representative of the group (individual, travel agency, or tour operator) contacts the airline directly or uses a dedicated booking platform.\n2. The airline provides a quote based on group size, travel dates, and other factors.\n3. The representative negotiates the terms, such as pricing, deadlines, and deposit requirements.\n4. Once the terms are agreed upon, the representative secures the booking by paying the deposit or following the agreed-upon payment schedule.\n\nAllotment Booking Process:\n\n1. A travel agency or tour operator negotiates a fixed number of seats and rates with the airline for specific routes and travel dates in advance.\n2. The agency or tour operator sells the allotted seats to individual customers at agreed-upon rates.\n3. Unsold seats can be returned to the airline before a specified deadline without penalties.\n4. The agency or tour operator manages inventory and pricing based on the allotment agreement.\n\nIn short, group bookings involve negotiating and reserving seats for a specific group of passengers, while allotment bookings involve selling pre-negotiated seats reserved for a travel agency or tour operator."
