  "content": "the set of circumstances or conditions that surround a written text and provide clues to its meaning and purpose.\n2. Show an example of a written text and ask students to brainstorm the different contexts that could have influenced its development (e.g., historical events, cultural norms, personal experiences).\n\n1. Distribute the graphic organizer and ask students to use it to map out the different contexts present in the text. For example, they could use a timeline to trace the historical events that influenced the text's development, or a web diagram to map out the intertextual connections with other texts or media.\n2. Once students have identified and analyzed the contexts in the text, ask them to reflect on how these contexts affect their interpretation and understanding of the text.\n3. Repeat the exercise with different texts with different contexts, and encourage students to share their observations and insights with the class.\n\nAssessment:\nStudents can be assessed on their ability to identify and analyze the different contexts in a written text using the graphic organizer. They can also be assessed on their ability to reflect on how these contexts affect their interpretation and understanding of the text.",
