Lesson Plan: Critical Reading as Looking for Ways of Thinking\n\nObjective: Students will be able to identify and analyze the ways of thinking present in a written text using critical reading strategies.\n\nInstructional Materials:\n\n* Texts with different ways of thinking (e.g., persuasive, analytical, informative)\n* Graphic organizer (e.g., mind map, concept map, Venn diagram)\n* Highlighters or colored pens\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Begin the lesson by introducing the concept of critical reading as a way of actively engaging with written texts to identify and analyze the ways of thinking present in them.\n2. Show an example of a written text with a particular way of thinking (e.g., persuasive) and ask students to identify the elements that make it persuasive.\n3. Distribute the graphic organizer and ask students to use it to map out the different ways of thinking present in the text. For example, they could use different colors to highlight persuasive language, logical arguments, emotional appeals, etc.\n4. Once students have identified and analyzed the ways of thinking present in the text, ask them to reflect on how these strategies were effective in achieving the author's purpose.\n5. Repeat the exercise with different texts with different ways of thinking, and encourage students to share their observations and insights with the class.\n\nAssessment:\nStudents can be assessed on their ability to identify and analyze the ways of thinking present in a written text using the graphic organizer. They can also be assessed on their ability to reflect on the effectiveness of these strategies in achieving the author's purpose.\n\n1. Lesson Plan: Identifying Claims in a Written Text\n\nObjective: Students will be able to identify and categorize the claims explicitly or implicitly made in a written text (claim of fact, claim of value, claim of policy) using critical reading strategies.\n\nInstructional Materials:\n\n* Texts with different types of claims (e.g., news articles, opinion pieces, essays)\n* Graphic organizer (e.g., T-chart, matrix, Venn diagram)\n* Highlighters or colored pens\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Begin the lesson by introducing the concept of claims as statements that can be supported or refuted with evidence, and explain the different types of claims (fact, value, policy).\n2. Show an example of a written text with a claim (e.g., an opinion piece with a claim of value) and ask students to identify the claim and the evidence used to support it.\n3. Distribute the graphic organizer and ask students to categorize the different claims made in the text using the T-chart, matrix or Venn diagram. For example, they could use different colors to identify claims of fact, value, or policy, and map out the evidence used to support or refute them.\n4. Once students have identified and categorized the claims in the text, ask them to reflect on how these claims relate to the author's purpose and audience.\n5. Repeat the exercise with different texts with different types of claims, and encourage students to share their observations and insights with the class.\n\nAssessment:\nStudents can be assessed on their ability to identify and categorize the claims made in a written text using the graphic organizer. They can also be assessed on their ability to analyze the evidence used to support or refute these claims, and how they relate to the author's purpose and audience.\n\n1. Lesson Plan: Identifying the Context of a Text\n\nObjective: Students will be able to identify and analyze the context in which a text was developed (hypertext, intertext) using critical reading strategies.\n\nInstructional Materials:\n\n* Texts with different contexts (e.g., historical, cultural, personal)\n* Graphic organizer (e.g., timeline, web diagram, mind map)\n* Highlighters or colored pens\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Begin the lesson by introducing the concept of context as",
