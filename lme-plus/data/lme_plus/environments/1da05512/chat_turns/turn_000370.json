  "content": "You're welcome! I'm thrilled that you found the suggestions helpful. The lactation cookies, herbal teas, and gourmet coffee will surely be appreciated by Michael's wife, and the gift card to a local coffee shop or cafe is a thoughtful touch that will give them a chance to take a break and recharge.\n\nRemember, it's the thought and love behind the gift that matters most. You're showing Michael and his family that you care about them and are excited to support them on this new journey. I'm sure they'll appreciate the gift basket and the thoughtfulness you've put into it.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further suggestions, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope Michael and his family enjoy the gift basket and that Sophia brings joy and happiness to their lives!",
