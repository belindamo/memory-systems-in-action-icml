  "content": "To disable other keyboard, mouse, and touch input during the game, you can use event listeners that capture and prevent the default behavior of these events. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Update the JavaScript file (game.js) to add event listeners that prevent the default behavior:\n```javascript\n// Add the following code at the bottom of the game.js file\n\nfunction disableEvent(event) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {\n  // Allow arrow keys and space for game control\n  if (![32, 37, 38, 39, 40].includes(event.keyCode)) {\n    disableEvent(event);\n  }\n});\n\ndocument.addEventListener('mousedown', disableEvent);\ndocument.addEventListener('mousemove', disableEvent);\ndocument.addEventListener('mouseup', disableEvent);\n\ndocument.addEventListener('touchstart', disableEvent);\ndocument.addEventListener('touchmove', disableEvent);\ndocument.addEventListener('touchend', disableEvent);\n```\nThis code adds event listeners for the keyboard, mouse, and touch events. The `disableEvent` function is used to prevent the default behavior of these events.\n\nFor the `keydown` event, it checks if the event's `keyCode` is not one of the allowed keys (32 for space, 37 for left arrow, 38 for up arrow, 39 for right arrow, and 40 for down arrow). If the key code is not in the allowed list, the event is disabled.\n\nThe `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events are disabled for the mouse, and the `touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend` events are disabled for touch input.\n\nThese changes should prevent other keyboard, mouse, and touch input during the game, ensuring that only the allowed controls can be used.",
