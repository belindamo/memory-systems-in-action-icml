  "content": "To make the game screen responsive and adapt to mobile devices, you can use CSS media queries and update the existing styles. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Update the CSS file (styles.css) to add media queries for smaller screens:\n```css\n/* Add the following to your existing styles.css file */\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n  body {\n    font-size: 14px;\n  }\n\n  #game-container {\n    max-width: 100%;\n  }\n\n  #board {\n    max-width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n    font-size: 1.5em;\n  }\n\n  #game-controls {\n    flex-direction: column;\n    align-items: center;\n  }\n\n  #game-info {\n    font-size: 1.2em;\n  }\n\n  #difficulty-control {\n    margin: 10px 0;\n  }\n\n  #mobile-controls {\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n  }\n\n  #mobile-controls button {\n    width: 40px;\n    height: 40px;\n  }\n}\n```\nThis media query targets screens with a maximum width of 600px (which should cover most mobile devices). The styles within this media query will only apply when the screen size meets this condition.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes made for mobile devices:\n\n* The base font size is reduced to 14px.\n* The game container and board elements are set to have a maximum width of 100%.\n* The board height is set to auto, and the font size is increased to 1.5em for better visibility.\n* The game controls are displayed in a column layout with center alignment.\n* The difficulty control and mobile controls have adjusted margins.\n* The mobile control buttons have increased width and height for easier interaction.\n\nThese changes should make the game screen adapt better to mobile devices and improve usability. You can further adjust the styles and breakpoints as needed to better suit your target devices.",
