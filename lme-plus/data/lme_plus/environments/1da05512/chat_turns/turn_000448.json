  "content": "I'm looking for some crafting inspiration. I've been working on a granny square blanket and I'm thinking of making some coasters to match. Do you have any ideas for decoupage designs that would complement my blanket's color scheme of pink, blue, and yellow? By the way, I've had some experience with decoupage before, I made a set of 12 coasters, divided into 4 sets of 3 coasters each, on February 20th.",
