Here are some tips to help you prepare your tiles:\n\n1. **Cleanliness is key**: Thoroughly clean the ceramic tiles with soap and water to remove any dirt, grime, or oils from your hands. This will help the decoupage medium adhere better.\n2. **Sand the tiles**: Lightly sand the tiles to create a rough surface for the decoupage medium to bond with. Use a fine-grit sandpaper (220-320 grit) and wipe away any dust with a damp cloth.\n3. **Prime the tiles (optional)**: If your tiles have a glossy finish or are particularly porous, consider applying a primer specifically designed for ceramics. This will help create a stronger bond between the tile and the decoupage medium.\n4. **Apply a coat of gesso (optional)**: Gesso is a primer-like substance that can help create a smooth surface for decoupage. Apply a thin coat of gesso to the tile, following the manufacturer's instructions. Let it dry completely before proceeding.\n5. **Choose the right decoupage medium**: Select a decoupage medium specifically designed for ceramics, such as Mod Podge, DecoArt, or varnish. Make sure to follow the product's instructions for application and drying times.\n6. **Apply a thin coat of decoupage medium**: Use a foam brush or a soft cloth to apply a thin, even layer of decoupage medium to the tile. This will help the paper adhere and prevent air bubbles.\n7. **Allow the medium to dry**: Let the decoupage medium dry completely according to the product's instructions, usually between 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the brand and environmental conditions.\n\nOnce you've prepared your tiles, you're ready to apply your vintage floral designs using the decoupage technique. Remember to handle the tiles carefully to avoid fingerprints or oils, which can affect the decoupage process.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!",
