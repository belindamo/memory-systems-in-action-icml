  "content": "I think the High Sierra Camp Loop sounds amazing, but I'm a bit concerned about the difficulty level and elevation gain. I've done some challenging hikes before, like the hike to Vernal Falls in Yosemite, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for a 7,000-foot elevation gain over 40 miles. Can you tell me more about the terrain and what to expect on this route?",
