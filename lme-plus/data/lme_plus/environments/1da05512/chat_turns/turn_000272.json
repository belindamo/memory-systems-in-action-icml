However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences, so I didn't meet you at El Patio or any other location. I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries.\n\nNow, let's get to the recipe! Spicy tuna rolls are a popular favorite, and making them at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the spicy tuna mixture:\n\n* 1 can of sushi-grade tuna (drained and flaked)\n* 1/4 cup of mayonnaise\n* 1-2 teaspoons of sriracha sauce (adjust to your desired level of spiciness)\n* 1 tablespoon of soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon of chopped green onions for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nFor the sushi rice:\n\n* 1 cup of short-grain Japanese rice (such as Koshihikari or Akita Komachi)\n* 1 3/4 cups of water\n* 1/4 cup of rice vinegar\n* 2 tablespoons of sugar\n* 1 teaspoon of salt\n\nFor assembling the rolls:\n\n* Nori sheets (dried seaweed sheets)\n* Sesame seeds and chopped green onions for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the sushi rice according to the package instructions. Typically, it involves rinsing the rice, cooking it with the right amount of water, and then seasoning it with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Let the rice cool down to room temperature.\n2. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the tuna, mayonnaise, sriracha sauce, and soy sauce until well combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n3. Lay a nori sheet flat on a sushi mat or a piece of parchment paper. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice onto the nori, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top.\n4. Place the spicy tuna mixture in the middle of the rice, leaving a small border around it.\n5. Roll the sushi using the mat or parchment paper, applying gentle pressure to form a compact roll.\n6. Slice the roll into 8 equal pieces using a sharp knife.\n7. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger, if desired. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to handle the sushi rice gently to avoid breaking the grains.\n* Adjust the level of spiciness to your liking by adding more or less sriracha sauce.\n* For an added crunch, you can top the roll with toasted sesame seeds or chopped tempura bits.\n* Experiment with different types of fish or add-ins, such as cucumber or avocado, to create unique flavor combinations.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and devouring your spicy tuna rolls!",
