However, some people may view paganism as dangerous or strange due to a lack of understanding or knowledge about the faith. Paganism is often linked to witchcraft, which has historically been associated with devil worship and seen as a threat to the authority of the church.\n\nAdditionally, some people may perceive paganism as strange or irrational because it emphasizes the importance of nature, intuition, and subjective experience over traditional religious dogma or scripture. This can be difficult for some to understand or accept, especially those who come from more conservative or orthodox religious traditions.\n\nFinally, pagan beliefs and practices can be quite diverse, which can make it difficult for those outside of the faith to understand or relate to it. From Wicca to Heathenry to Druidism, there are many different branches of paganism, each with their own unique beliefs, practices, and rituals. This diversity can be both a strength and a challenge for pagans who seek to engage with wider society.",
