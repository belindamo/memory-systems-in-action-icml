  "content": "Hi! I'm looking for some recipe ideas for a summer BBQ I'm hosting soon. My mom and I recently spent hours in the kitchen together preparing for my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary dinner at my place about six weeks ago, and I learned a lot of new recipes. I'm thinking of making some of those dishes again, but I also want to try out some new ones. Do you have any suggestions?",
