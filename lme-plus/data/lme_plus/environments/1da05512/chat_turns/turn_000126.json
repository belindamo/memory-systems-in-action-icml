When you're done reading, tell me you're \"Done and are ready for the next part\": I enjoy trying to trying to put together a playlist that I literally can pull out whenever I need it, right, so let's say I'm having a cookout or something. And so that way, I don't have to do more work. I don't have to sit on the iPads, trying to find songs like something that can run like trying to put, like trying to put together a playlist of songs for like, four and five hours. Like, that's a lot of song. But like trying, so I but I enjoy doing that. Because, you know, I'm a I fancy myself a music kid. And I like to believe that I'm up on things other people aren't. So that's part of it, too. I like I like feeling like I'm adding songs that other people might not know. So if they discovered the playlist or if they hear it, they're gonna hear something that they might that they otherwise wouldn't know, which I've been pretty good at doing. I think, even with old music, not even just new stuff, but like, oh, you know, all these and the kind of stuff you got to dig through the crates to find.\nRight. Okay, cool. And then, while on that topic, what are some aspects of creating a music playlist that you not enjoy?\nIt's exhausting. At times, like, one like why am I even creating a playlist? I don't have to you don't have to do this anymore. Like, Spotify will do it for you. Right? Like most of these things, if you want you can you find a song, you can go go to Radio, and it'll just literally play songs until you turn that thing off. So you know, that's something I'm like, sometimes I feel like I'm just wasting my time, because why am I even doing this? Unless they're just songs I have to have, but I probably already made that playlist anyway. The other thing that I don't enjoy, and I think this was this is more of a statement about the time we're in. There's this so much music and there's so many artists that I have never heard of that I'm sure after I after I move on from this I'll never hear again and I know it was like that growing up and you know, the the more you dig into the more you find exists. But it just seems that there's way too much music now to go through. So it's like the fun of creating the playlist isn't there as much as it used to be for me because I'm just like, I know I'm missing things because I'm never gonna get to the all the music that's out here. And not even a joint all this stuff. So I'm basically just making playlists of music that I used to love over and over again. That's what I feel like I'm doing you know, making a different version like how many? How many like r&b jams playlists can you make you know what I'm saying? Like you really just need one go one.\nYeah. Okay. And then so last question. What's the last black old streetwear brand that you bought?\nI bought stuff from bricks and wood.\nOkay. Okay,\nyeah, they're based in LA Yeah, they're there South Central LA. They had this amazing shirt like I'm not from LA but it said like from South Central with love. I love that. I don't know why but I love that wording from South Central with love and I bought that. I bought that shirt.\nOkay, all right, cool. Well, yeah, that's it.",
