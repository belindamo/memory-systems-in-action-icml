I've been experimenting with different flavors and ingredients in my own cooking, and I recently bought some Korean chili flakes and kimchi-making ingredients at the Korean market last weekend. I'm planning to try making kimchi at home soon. Do you have any tips for making kimchi or any recommended kimchi recipes?",
