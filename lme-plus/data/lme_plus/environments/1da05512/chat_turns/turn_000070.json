  "content": "I've seen \"The Wicker Man\" before, but I'll definitely check out the other recommendations. I've been on a roll with horror films lately, and attending film festivals has been a great way to discover new titles and meet fellow horror fans. Speaking of which, I was just talking to my cousin about \"The Cabin in the Woods\" and how much we both loved it. We actually met up at FrightFest in London, where I attended the sneak peek screening on August 12th. Do you have any recommendations for horror movies that feature a similar blend of humor and horror, like \"Cabin in the Woods\"?",
