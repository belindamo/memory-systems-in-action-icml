  "content": "My apologies for the confusion in my previous response. I realize I made a typo in the provided JavaScript code. It should be `movePlayer` instead of `movePlayet`. I will provide the implementation for the `movePlayer` function below.\n\nIn the `game.js` file, you should already have a `movePlayer` function that handles the player's movement based on the arrow keys. Here is the implementation of the `movePlayer` function:\n```javascript\nfunction movePlayer(dx, dy) {\n  const newX = player.x + dx;\n  const newY = player.y + dy;\n\n  if (isInBounds(newX, newY) && !isCellOccupiedByBot(newX, newY) && !isCellOccupiedByObject(newX, newY)) {\n    board[player.y][player.x].classList.remove('player');\n    player.x = newX;\n    player.y = newY;\n    board[player.y][player.x].classList.add('player');\n\n    checkForPackageCollision();\n    checkForTargetCollision();\n  }\n}\n```\nThis function takes two arguments, `dx` and `dy`, which represent the change in the player's x and y coordinates, respectively. The function first calculates the new x and y coordinates by adding `dx` and `dy` to the player's current position. Then, it checks if the new position is within the board boundaries, not occupied by a bot, and not occupied by an object. If all these conditions are met, the player is moved to the new position, and the function checks for collisions with the package and the target.\n\nThe mobile controls in my previous response use the `movePlayer` function to control the player's movement when the corresponding buttons are clicked.",
