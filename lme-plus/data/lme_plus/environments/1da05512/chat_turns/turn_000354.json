  "content": "Yes, modern pagans do sometimes face discrimination or hostility because of their beliefs. Some people view paganism as strange or even dangerous, and may hold negative stereotypes about pagans. This can lead to discrimination in the workplace, social exclusion, or even acts of violence.\n\nTo cope with this discrimination and hostility, pagans often turn to supportive communities of fellow believers. Many cities have pagan groups or covens that offer support, fellowship, and protection for those who feel marginalized or under threat. Pagan groups may also offer advice and resources for legal or community support in cases of discrimination or harassment.\n\nIn addition to seeking out supportive communities, some pagans may choose to practice their faith in more private or discreet ways in order to avoid negative attention. This may involve practicing at home instead of in public spaces or keeping their religious beliefs private from coworkers or acquaintances.\n\nFinally, some pagans choose to engage in activism or advocacy work to promote greater understanding and acceptance of their faith. This can include working with interfaith groups, participating in public events or rallies, and advocating for legal protections for religious minorities.",
