  "content": "My apologies for the confusion. The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that the `loadSound` function is returning a promise, but we're not awaiting its resolution. To fix this issue, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Update the JavaScript file (game.js) to load the sound files asynchronously:\n```javascript\n// Modify these lines at the top of the game.js file\n\nlet successSound;\nlet collisionSound;\n\n(async function () {\n  successSound = await loadSound('success.mp3');\n  collisionSound = await loadSound('collision.mp3');\n})();\n```\nThis change wraps the loading of the sound files in an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to ensure that the promises returned by the `loadSound` function are resolved before attempting to play the sounds.\n\nNow, the game should play the `success.mp3` sound effect when the player reaches the target and the `collision.mp3` sound effect when the player encounters a bot without throwing any errors.",
