Here are some tips on how to reduce food waste in your household:\n\n1. Plan meals and shopping: Plan meals ahead of time and make a shopping list, so you only buy what you need. This will help prevent impulse purchases and reduce the amount of food that goes to waste.\n\n2. Store food properly: Properly storing food can help extend its shelf life. For example, storing fruits and vegetables separately can help prevent them from spoiling prematurely. Also, check the expiration date of food items and place those that are expiring soon at the front of the fridge or pantry so you can use them first.\n\n3. Use leftovers creatively: Leftovers can be repurposed in many different ways. For example, you can turn leftover vegetables into a soup, or use leftover chicken to make a sandwich. Get creative with your leftovers and you might be surprised at what you can come up with!\n\n4. Compost food scraps: Composting is a great way to reduce food waste and it also helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfills. You can compost food scraps including vegetable and fruit peels, coffee grounds, and eggshells.\n\n5.
