  "content": "I'm planning to make around 50-60 samosas for the BBQ. I think that should be enough for our guests. I'm also thinking of making some extra for my family to enjoy later. I was wondering if you could suggest some dipping sauces for the samosas? We had a spicy chutney at my grandparents' anniversary dinner that was a hit, but I'd like to offer some other options as well.",
