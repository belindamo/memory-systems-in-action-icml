Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Nimitz Way Trail:**\n\n* Distance: Approximately 4.5 miles out-and-back (9 miles round-trip)\n* Elevation gain: 1,000 feet\n* Difficulty: Moderate\n* Time: 3-4 hours (depending on your pace and how long you linger at the viewpoints)\n\nThe Nimitz Way Trail is a gentle, graded trail that takes you through a mix of forests and open grasslands. You'll enjoy stunning views of the Bay Area, San Francisco, and the Golden Gate Bridge from the various viewpoints along the way. The trail is well-marked and well-maintained, making it a great option for those looking for a moderate, scenic hike.\n\n**Wildcat Gorge Trail:**\n\n* Distance: Approximately 5.5 miles out-and-back (11 miles round-trip)\n* Elevation gain: 1,200 feet\n* Difficulty: Moderate to challenging\n* Time: 4-5 hours (depending on your pace and how long you explore the gorge)\n\nThe Wildcat Gorge Trail is a bit more challenging than Nimitz Way, with steeper sections and more varied terrain.

The trail eventually opens up to stunning views of the Bay Area from the ridge. Be prepared for some stream crossings and potential mud during the wet season.\n\nKeep in mind that these times are estimates, and you should factor in your own pace, the amount of time you spend enjoying the views, and any breaks you take along the way.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection.\n* Wear comfortable hiking shoes or boots with good traction.\n* Check the Tilden Regional Park website for up-to-date trail information and any specific regulations.\n\nHave a fantastic hike, and enjoy those panoramic views!",
