  "content": "As an American Airlines Silver elite member, your priority boarding benefits do extend to connecting flights, but with a slight caveat.\n\nWhen you have a connecting flight, you'll still get to board the second leg of your journey with priority boarding, but you won't necessarily get to board at the same time as you would if you were on a non-stop flight.\n\nHere's what you can expect:\n\n* On the first leg of your journey, you'll board with Group 2, which is the priority boarding group for Silver elite members.\n* When you arrive at your connecting airport, you'll need to check the boarding group for your second flight. If you're still in Group 2, you'll board with the same priority boarding group.\n* However, if the second flight has already started boarding by the time you arrive, you might not be able to board immediately. You'll need to wait until the current boarding group is finished before you can board with your priority boarding privileges.\n\nKeep in mind that the boarding process can vary depending on the airport, the flight, and the circumstances. But in general, as a Silver elite member, you should be able to board your connecting flight with some priority, even if it's not exactly at the same time as you would on a non-stop flight.\n\nEnjoy your connecting flight from Dallas to San Antonio!",
