  "content": "Horror TV shows can be a great way to get your fix of scares and laughs.\n\nYes, I do have some recommendations for horror TV series that blend humor and horror, similar to \"The Cabin in the Woods\". Here are a few:\n\n**Horror TV Shows with a Similar Blend:**\n\n1. **Ash vs. Evil Dead (2015-2018)**: A horror-comedy series that continues the story of Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) from the Evil Dead franchise. It's a perfect blend of humor, gore, and horror.\n2. **What We Do in the Shadows (TV series, 2019-present)**: A mockumentary-style horror-comedy series based on the 2014 film of the same name. It follows a group of vampires living in New York City, and it's hilarious and spooky at the same time.\n3. **Santa Clarita Diet (2017-2019)**: A horror-comedy series that follows a suburban couple whose lives are turned upside down when the wife becomes a zombie.\n4. **iZombie (2015-2019)**: A supernatural procedural drama that combines elements of horror, comedy, and crime fiction. It's based on the DC Comics Vertigo imprint and follows a medical student-turned-zombie who works in a coroner's office.\n5. **Scream Queens (2015-2016)**: A horror-comedy series created by Ryan Murphy, which follows a group of college students who are stalked by a serial killer. It's a great blend of humor, satire, and horror.\n6. **Stan Against Evil (2016-2018)**: A horror-comedy series that follows a former sheriff who must team up with the new sheriff to battle supernatural forces in their small town.\n7. **NOS4A2 (2019-2020)**: A supernatural horror series based on the novel of the same name. It follows a young artist who discovers she has the power to track a supernatural villain who feeds on children's souls.\n\n**Other Horror TV Shows:**\n\n1. **The Haunting of Hill House (2018-2019)**: A horror series that follows a family's supernatural experiences in a haunted house. It's more atmospheric and psychologically complex than humorous, but it's a great horror series.\n2. **Stranger Things (2016-present)**: A sci-fi horror series that pays homage to the classics of the 1980s. It's not as overtly comedic as some of the other shows on this list, but it has a great sense of nostalgia and adventure.\n3. **The Terror (2018-2019)**: A historical horror series based on true events. It's more atmospheric and suspenseful than humorous, but it's a great horror series that explores the psychological effects of fear.\n\nI hope you find something that piques your interest!",
