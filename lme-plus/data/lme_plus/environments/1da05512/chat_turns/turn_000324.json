Korean BBQ-style burgers and grilled pineapple and jalape\u00f1o skewers will definitely add a unique twist to your BBQ.\n\nSamosas are a great addition to your menu, and I'm happy to help with making them in large quantities. Here are some tips to make the process easier and more efficient:\n\n**Samosa-Making Tips for Large Quantities:**\n\n1. **Make the Filling in Advance**: Prepare the samosa filling (potato, peas, onions, spices, etc.) a day or two in advance and store it in the refrigerator. This will save you time on the day of the BBQ.\n2. **Use a Samosa Pastry Shortcut**: Instead of making samosa pastry from scratch, use store-bought samosa wrappers or wonton wrappers. This will save you a significant amount of time and effort.\n3. **Assemble in Batches**: Divide your filling and wrappers into smaller batches to assemble the samosas. This will prevent the wrappers from becoming too brittle or dry.\n4. **Use a Production Line**: Set up a production line with your filling, wrappers, and a workstation. This will help you assemble the samosas quickly and efficiently.\n5. **Fry in Batches**: Fry the samosas in batches to prevent overcrowding the pot and to maintain the oil temperature. This will ensure crispy, golden samosas.\n6. **Drain Excess Oil**: Place a paper towel-lined plate or tray near the frying area to drain excess oil from the samosas. This will help keep them crispy and prevent sogginess.\n7. **Keep Them Warm**: Keep the fried samosas warm in a low-temperature oven (around 200\u00b0F/90\u00b0C) until serving time. This will help maintain their crispiness.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use a Deep Fryer**: If you have a deep fryer, use it to fry the samosas. It will make the process much easier and safer.\n2. **Don't Overfill**: Don't overfill the samosas, as they will burst open during frying. Leave a small border around the filling to ensure they seal properly.\n3. **Freeze for Later**: If you want to make the samosas ahead of time, you can assemble and freeze them on a baking sheet. Once frozen, transfer them to airtight containers or freezer bags for up to 2 months. Simply fry them frozen when you're ready.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to make a large quantity of samosas efficiently and with ease.\n\nHow many samosas are you planning to make for your BBQ? Do you have any other questions or concerns about making them in large quantities?",
