It's powered by an 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce MX350 graphics.\n* Acer Predator Helios 300: This laptop has a 15.6-inch Full HD display, up to 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It's powered by an 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11800H processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics.\n\n**Lenovo:**\n\n* Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3: This laptop features a 15.6-inch Full HD display, up to 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It's powered by an 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics.\n* Lenovo Legion 5: This laptop has a 15.6-inch Full HD display, up to 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It's powered by an 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11800H processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics.\n\n**HP:**\n\n* HP Pavilion Gaming 15: This laptop features a 15.6-inch Full HD display, up to 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It's powered by an 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics.\n* HP Omen 15: This laptop has a 15.6-inch Full HD display, up to 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It's powered by an 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11800H processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics.\n\nBased on your budget and gaming needs, I'd recommend the following:\n\n**Best Value: Acer Aspire 5**\n\n* Pros: Affordable price, good performance for 1080p gaming, and decent battery life.\n* Cons: Limited upgrade options, and the NVIDIA GeForce MX350 graphics might not be sufficient for more demanding games.\n\n**Best Performance: Acer Predator Helios 300**\n\n* Pros: Powerful performance for 1440p gaming, good cooling system, and plenty of storage and RAM options.\n* Cons: More expensive, and the battery life might not be as good as other options.\n\n**Best Balance: Lenovo Legion 5**\n\n* Pros: Good balance of performance and price, decent battery life, and plenty of storage and RAM options.\n* Cons: The design might not be as premium as other options, and the cooling system could be better.\n\nAll of these laptops should provide smooth performance for gaming and other resource-intensive tasks. However, if you're looking for the best value, the Acer Aspire 5 might be the way to go. If you're willing to spend more for better performance, the Acer Predator Helios 300 is a great option. If you're looking for a good balance between performance and price, the Lenovo Legion 5 is a solid choice.\n\nIt's great to hear that your Belkin wireless charging pad is working well for your S22 Ultra!",
