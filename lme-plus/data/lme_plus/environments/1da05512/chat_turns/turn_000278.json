As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or physical interactions, so I didn't meet you at El Patio or any other location. I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries.\n\nHowever, I'm happy to help you explore new food options and combinations! It's great that you had a fantastic time trying out different tacos and burritos at El Patio. If you're looking for more foodie adventures, I'd be happy to suggest some Japanese-inspired dishes or ramen variations to try.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions or preferences, and I'll do my best to assist you!",
