  "content": "That's a great list! I've seen a few of those already, but there are some new ones I'd love to check out. I'm particularly intrigued by \"Midsommar\" and \"Ready or Not\". I've been on a roll with horror films lately, having just returned from FrightFest in London where I saw \"The Cabin in the Woods\". It was my second festival in a month, following the Asian American International Film Festival in New York City, where I participated in a film critique workshop. Do you have any recommendations for horror films with a similar atmosphere to \"Midsommar\"? I loved the folk horror elements and the sense of unease that permeated the film.",
