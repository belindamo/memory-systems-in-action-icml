  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to specific information about the architecture of Boulogne. However, it can be assumed that the use of materials in Boulogne's architecture has evolved and changed since the city was founded. This is because advancements in technology and changes in building codes and regulations have enabled architects to use new materials and construction techniques. For example, ancient buildings may have been constructed primarily with stone, wood, and clay, while modern buildings can incorporate concrete, steel, glass, and many other materials. Additionally, historical preservation efforts may also influence the use of certain materials in the city's architecture.",
