For your drive to Flagstaff, I've got some tips to help you navigate the roads and minimize traffic:\n\n**Route Options:**\n\n1. **I-40 East**: From California, take I-40 East, which will take you directly to Flagstaff. This route is more straightforward, but it might not be the most scenic.\n2. **US-180 North**: From I-40, take US-180 North, which will take you through the San Francisco Peaks and offer more scenic views. This route might be slower, but it's a great option if you want to enjoy the scenery.\n\n**Traffic Tips:**\n\n1. **Leave Early**: Depart early to avoid rush hour traffic, especially if you're driving from California.\n2. **Avoid Peak Travel Days**: If possible, try to avoid driving on the day before or after major holidays, as these are typically the busiest days.\n3. **Use Traffic Apps**: Download traffic apps like Waze, Google Maps, or Inrix to get real-time traffic updates and find the most efficient routes.\n4. **Take Breaks**: Take regular breaks to rest, stretch your legs, and refuel.
