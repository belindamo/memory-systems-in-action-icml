  "content": "While the Euro is the official currency of France, many businesses in Paris also accept major international credit cards, including American Express, Visa, and Mastercard. In fact, credit cards are widely accepted in Paris, especially at larger businesses, tourist attractions, and restaurants.\n\nThat being said, it's always a good idea to carry some cash with you, especially if you plan on visiting smaller shops or street markets. Many smaller businesses in Paris may prefer cash or have a minimum purchase requirement for credit card transactions.\n\nYou can easily withdraw Euros from ATMs using your debit card, but make sure to check with your bank about fees and foreign transaction charges before you leave on your trip. Some banks also offer credit cards with no foreign transaction fees for international travel, so it's worth looking into this option as well.\n\nOverall, it's a good idea to have both cash and credit cards on hand for your trip to Paris. While credit cards are widely accepted, it's always good to have some Euros available for smaller purchases or in case of emergencies.",
