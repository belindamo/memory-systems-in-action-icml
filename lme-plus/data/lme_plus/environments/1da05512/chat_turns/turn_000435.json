Writing a proof of concept IDW can be a complex task depending on the use case you have in mind, but I can provide a simple example to get you started.\n\nFor this example, let's imagine we want to build an IDW that can automate the process of responding to customer emails. Here's a minimal example of what the IDW might look like in Python:\n```python\nimport imaplib\nimport email\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\n# Connect to email account\nmail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')\nmail.login('your_email_address', 'your_password')\nmail.select('inbox')\n\n# Fetch list of emails\ntyp, data = mail.search(None, 'ALL')\nemail_ids = data[0].split()\n\n# Iterate over emails\nfor email_id in email_ids:\n    typ, data = mail.fetch(email_id, '(RFC822)')\n    raw_email = data[0][1]\n    email_message = email.message_from_bytes(raw_email)\n\n    # Extract text from email\n    text = ''\n    if email_message.is_multipart():\n        for part in email_message.walk():\n            content_type = part.get_content_type()\n            if content_type == 'text/plain':\n                text += part.get_payload()\n    else:\n        text = email_message.get_payload()\n\n    # Remove stop words\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)\n    filtered_text = [word for word in tokens if not word.lower() in stop_words]\n\n    # Analyze text and generate response\n    response = ''\n    if 'refund' in filtered_text:\n        response = 'We apologize for the inconvenience. Please provide your order number and we will process your refund as soon as possible.'\n    elif 'product' in filtered_text:\n        response = 'Thank you for your inquiry. Our support team will be in touch with you shortly to assist you with your product issue.'\n    else:\n        response = 'Thank you for your email. A member of our team will be in touch with you shortly.'\n\n    # Send response\n    response_message = email.message.EmailMessage()\n    response_message.set_content(response)\n    response_message['Subject'] = 'Response to your email'\n    response_message['From'] = 'your_email_address'\n    response_message['To'] = email_message['From']\n    mail.append('inbox', '', imaplib.Time2Internaldate(time.time()), str(response_message).encode('utf-8'))\n    mail.store(email_id, '+FLAGS', '\\\\Deleted')\n\n# Logout\nmail.expunge()\nmail.close()\nmail.logout()\n```\nThis IDW uses the Python `imaplib` library to connect to an email account and fetch a list of emails. It then iterates over the emails and extracts the text from each email. It removes stop words using the `nltk` library and analyzes the text to generate a response. Finally, it sends the response to the email address of the sender.\n\nThis is just a very simple example, but it demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of an IDW. Depending on the use case, you may need to add more complex functionality, such as natural language processing or machine learning algorithms.",
