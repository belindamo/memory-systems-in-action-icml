As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences, but I can certainly provide guidance and ideas on experimenting with different shapes and sizes of coasters.\n\nUsing unique shapes and sizes can add an extra layer of creativity and charm to your decoupage coasters. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Floral shapes**: Consider using coaster shapes that match your floral theme, such as flower petals, leaves, or even a silhouette of a flower pot.\n2. **Ovals and eggs**: Oval or egg-shaped coasters can add a touch of elegance and whimsy to your design.\n3. **Hexagons and triangles**: Geometric shapes like hexagons and triangles can create a modern and trendy look that complements your floral design.\n4. **Leaf-shaped coasters**: Use a leaf-shaped coaster to add a natural, earthy feel to your design.\n5. **Custom shapes**: If you're feeling adventurous, you can create custom shapes using a tile nipper or a ceramic cutter. This will allow you to create truly unique coasters that match your vision.\n\nWhen working with unique shapes and sizes, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* **Choose a shape that complements your design**: Select a shape that resonates with your floral theme and doesn't overpower the decoupage design.\n* **Consider the functionality**: Ensure the shape and size of the coaster are still functional and can hold a cup or glass securely.\n* **Adjust your decoupage design**: Be prepared to adjust your decoupage design to fit the unique shape and size of the coaster.\n* **Use a consistent size**: If you're creating a set of coasters, consider using a consistent size or shape to create a cohesive look.\n\nRemember, the key to success lies in balancing creativity with functionality. Don't be afraid to experiment and have fun with different shapes and sizes to find the perfect fit for your floral-themed coasters!",
