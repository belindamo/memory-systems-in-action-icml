There are indeed vintage cameras that can shoot in multiple formats, and I'm happy to guide you through some options.\n\n**Multi-format cameras:**\n\n1. **Mamiya Universal Press Camera**: This camera can shoot 35mm, 120, and even 4x5 inches (large format) film. It's a press camera, so it's designed for handheld use and has a rangefinder viewfinder. Mamiya Universal Press Cameras are highly sought after, so be prepared for a higher price tag.\n2. **Nikon S3 2000**: This camera can shoot 35mm and 120 film using interchangeable backs. It's a rangefinder camera with a 1:1 viewfinder and is known for its compact size and quiet shutter.\n3. **Pentax 645**: Although primarily a medium format camera, the Pentax 645 can be adapted to shoot 35mm film using a special adapter. It's a SLR camera with interchangeable lenses and a vari-angle viewfinder.\n\n**Other options:**\n\n1. **Dual-lens cameras**: Some dual-lens cameras, like the Rolleiflex TLR, can be modified to shoot 35mm film using a special adapter.

However, these backs can be expensive and might require additional accessories.\n\n**Where to find them:**\n\n1. **eBay**: As I mentioned earlier, eBay is a great platform to find vintage cameras. Use specific keywords, like \"Mamiya Universal Press Camera\" or \"Nikon S3 2000,\" and filter by condition, price, and location.\n2. **KEH Camera**: KEH Camera is a reputable online marketplace for used cameras, and they often have a selection of vintage models, including multi-format cameras.\n3. **B&H Photo**: B&H Photo's used department occasionally lists vintage cameras, including rare models. Keep an eye on their website or sign up for their newsletter to stay informed.\n4. **Specialty camera stores**: Visit local camera stores that specialize in vintage cameras or medium format equipment. They might carry or know of multi-format cameras.\n5. **Photography forums and communities**: Join online forums, like Reddit's r/VintageCameras or photography subforums, to connect with other enthusiasts and collectors. They might know of cameras for sale or be able to provide valuable advice.\n\n**Tips and considerations:**\n\n1. **Condition and maintenance**: When purchasing a vintage camera, make sure to inspect its condition thoroughly. Look for signs of wear, damage, or required maintenance.\n2. **Compatibility and accessories**: Check if the camera comes with the necessary accessories, such as lenses, viewfinders, or backs, to shoot in multiple formats.\n3. **Price and rarity**: Multi-format cameras can be rare and expensive. Be prepared to invest time and money in finding the right camera.\n4. **Modification and adaptation**: If you're considering modifying a camera to shoot multiple formats, research the process thoroughly and ensure you have the necessary skills or resources.\n\nI hope this helps you in your search for a multi-format vintage camera!",
