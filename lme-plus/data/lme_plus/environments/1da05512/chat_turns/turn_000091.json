However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I won't be able to provide you with specific routes around your area.\n\nBut don't worry, I can offer some general tips to help you find a suitable route for your 60-mile ride:\n\n1. **Use online route-planning tools**: Websites like MapMyRide, Strava, Ride with GPS, or Bikemap allow you to enter your location and desired distance to find pre-made routes or create your own. You can filter by road bike routes, terrain, and other preferences.\n2. **Check local bike maps and websites**: Look for local cycling organizations, bike shops, or government websites that provide bike route maps and recommendations for your area.\n3. **Consider rail trails or bike paths**: These routes are often flat, smooth, and car-free, making them ideal for road bikes. You can search for rail trails or bike paths in your area using online resources like TrailLink or Rails-to-Trails Conservancy.\n4. **Ask local cyclists or bike shops**: Reach out to local cycling clubs, bike shops, or online forums to ask for route recommendations. They can provide valuable insights and suggestions based on their experience.\n\nAs for your mountain bike, it's great to hear that you got it fixed and it's running smoothly! Remember to keep it well-maintained to ensure it continues to perform well.\n\nBefore your 60-mile ride, make sure to:\n\n* Check your road bike's condition, including tire pressure, brakes, and gears.\n* Plan your route in advance and bring a map or GPS device.\n* Pack essentials like water, snacks, and a basic tool kit.\n* Wear comfortable, breathable clothing and a properly fitted helmet.\n* Let someone know your route and expected return time.\n\nHave a great ride!",
