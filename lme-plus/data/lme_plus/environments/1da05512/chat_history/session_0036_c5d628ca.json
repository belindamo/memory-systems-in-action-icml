      "content": "A personalized baby blanket with Sophia's name is a wonderful idea! It's a thoughtful and unique gift that they'll surely cherish.\n\nIncluding a gift card to a baby store is an excellent idea as well! Here's why:\n\n1. **Practicality:** Gift cards allow Michael and his family to choose what they need or want, which might not be immediately apparent when Sophia is first born. As they get to know their baby's preferences and needs, they can use the gift card to get something that's perfect for her.\n2. **Flexibility:** Gift cards give them the freedom to select items from a wide range of products, from essentials like diapers and formula to developmental toys and nursery decor.\n3. **Convenience:** Gift cards are easy to use and can be redeemed online or in-store, making it simple for Michael and his family to get what they need, when they need it.\n4. **Timeline:** A gift card can be used at any time, so even if Sophia has outgrown some of the initial gifts, the gift card can still be used later on.\n\nWhen choosing a gift card, consider the following:\n\n* **Amount:** A $25-$50 gift card is a good starting point, but you can adjust the amount based on your budget and relationship with Michael.\n* **Store selection:** Opt for a popular baby store or online retailer that offers a wide range of products, such as Buy Buy Baby, Baby Depot, or Amazon.\n* **Presentation:** You can include the gift card in a cute card or envelope with a personal message, or attach it to the personalized blanket with a ribbon or clip.\n\nBy including both the personalized blanket and the gift card, you're providing a thoughtful, unique gift that's both immediate and long-term. Michael and his family will appreciate the gesture, and Sophia will surely love the blanket and the goodies they'll get with the gift card!"
