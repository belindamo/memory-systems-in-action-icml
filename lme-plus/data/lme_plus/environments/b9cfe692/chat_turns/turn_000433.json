Tracking your macros and calories using an app can be a helpful way to ensure you're fueling your body properly for optimal performance.\n\nLean protein sources, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats are all important for supporting athletic performance and recovery. Here are some additional tips to consider:\n\n**Lean Protein Sources:**\n\n* Focus on lean protein sources like chicken, fish, turkey, beans, lentils, and dairy products.\n* Aim to consume 1.2-1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily.\n\n**Complex Carbohydrates:**\n\n* Focus on complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n* Aim to consume 2-3 grams of complex carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight daily.\n\n**Healthy Fats:**\n\n* Focus on healthy fats like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil.\n* Aim to consume 0.5-1 gram of healthy fats per kilogram of body weight daily.\n\n**Hydration:**\n\n* Aim to consume at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.\n* Make sure to drink water during and after exercise to stay hydrated.\n\n**Electrolytes:**\n\n* Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium are important for athletic performance.\n* Consider consuming electrolyte-rich foods like bananas, dates, and coconut water.\n\n**Post-Workout Nutrition:**\n\n* After exercise, consume a meal or snack that includes a mix of carbohydrates and protein within 30-60 minutes.\n* This can help with recovery and muscle repair.\n\n**Periodized Nutrition:**\n\n* Consider periodizing your nutrition to match your training phases.\n* For example, during high-intensity training phases, you may need to increase your carbohydrate intake to support energy needs.\n\nRemember, everyone's nutritional needs are different, and it may take some trial and error to find what works best for you. Keep tracking your progress and adjusting your nutrition plan as needed.\n\nHow's your recovery going after your 5K event?
