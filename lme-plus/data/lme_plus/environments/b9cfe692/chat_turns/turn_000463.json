Research online or in local fishing guides: Use online resources or local fishing guides to learn about watersheds, lakes, rivers or streams in the area. These resources can also help determine which species of fish are available, and what time of year they are typically active. 2. Ask for advice: Ask locals like bait and tackle shop employees, fishing guides or park rangers about good fishing spots in the area, they will often have insider knowledge. 3. Look for natural feeding grounds: When scouting potential fishing spots, look for areas where the water flows into or near natural feeding grounds for fish. Examples of natural feeding grounds include the mouths of streams and creeks, along weed lines or near drop-offs in the lake bed. 4. Observe the surrounding environment: Look for areas where wildlife such as birds, otters or beavers are congregated, as these animals are often drawn to areas rich in fish. 5. Check for recent stocking: Check with state or local wildlife management agencies to see if recent stocking of game fish has occurred in the area. 6. Be adventurous: When exploring a new area with water, try to take less-travelled paths, look for new fishing grounds that few others have discovered. Remember that finding a good fishing spot often comes down to a matter of timing and technique so keep experimenting till you find what works the best.",
