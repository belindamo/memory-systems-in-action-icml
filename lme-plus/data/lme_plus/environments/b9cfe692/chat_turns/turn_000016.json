I'll also take a look at Freedom and StayFocused to help me stay focused during my morning hours.\n\nBy the way, I've been trying to limit my screen time in the evenings, so I've been reading a book before bed, usually from 10:00 pm to 10:30 pm. Do you have any book recommendations that can help me relax and unwind before sleep?",
