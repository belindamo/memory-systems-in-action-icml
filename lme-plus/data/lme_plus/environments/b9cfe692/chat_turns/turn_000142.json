  "content": "Yes, I can help with that! Dried pasta typically has a long shelf life, so it's a great pantry staple to have on hand. As a general rule, you can store dried pasta in a cool, dry place for up to two years.\n\nHowever, the exact shelf life can depend on several factors, such as the storage conditions, type of pasta, and whether it's packaged or not. For example, pasta stored in a humid environment may go bad more quickly. It's also important to note that whole grain pasta may have a shorter shelf life than regular pasta due to its higher oil content.\n\nTo extend the shelf life of your dried pasta, store it in an airtight container to keep out moisture and insects. You can also store it in the fridge or freezer if you want to keep it for an even longer period.\n\nIn general, it's always a good idea to check the expiration date on the package and give the pasta a sniff and a visual check before cooking, especially if it's been sitting in your pantry for a while. If the pasta has an off smell or looks moldy, toss it and don't cook it.",
