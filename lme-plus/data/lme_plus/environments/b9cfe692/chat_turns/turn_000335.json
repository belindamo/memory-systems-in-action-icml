It's also relatively inexpensive compared to other types of fish.\n\n**Handling and storing fish:**\n\n1. **Freshness matters**: Always purchase fish from a reputable source, and make sure it's fresh. Fresh fish should have a mild smell, firm texture, and shiny skin.\n2. **Store in the refrigerator**: Store fish in a covered container or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate at a temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C).\n3. **Freeze for sushi-grade**: To make fish sushi-grade, it needs to be frozen to kill parasites.

Never thaw fish at room temperature, as this can cause bacterial growth.\n5. **Handle with care**: Always handle fish gently to prevent damage and bruising. Use a cutting board and sharp knife to slice the fish, and make sure your hands and utensils are clean and sanitized.\n6. **Slice fish just before serving**: Slice the fish just before serving to ensure freshness and food safety.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Check the fish's origin**: Make sure the fish is from a sustainable and responsible source.\n2. **Use sashimi-grade fish**: If you're planning to serve raw fish, make sure it's sashimi-grade and has been handled and stored properly.\n3. **Follow local food safety guidelines**: Check with your local health department for guidelines on handling and storing fish for consumption.\n\nRemember to always prioritize food safety and handle fish with care. With practice and patience, you'll become a sushi master in no time!",
