Now, let's get you back on track with some healthy and easy meal ideas for the week.\n\nBefore we dive in, can you give me a little more information about your preferences? Do you:\n\n1. Have any dietary restrictions or allergies (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)?\n2. Have a slow cooker or Instant Pot? If so, would you like some recipes that utilize these appliances?\n3. Have a rough idea of how much time you can dedicate to cooking each day?\n4. Have any ingredients or leftovers you'd like to use up?\n5. Prefer meals that can be reheated for lunch or are easy to pack for work/school?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your needs and preferences, I can provide you with some personalized meal ideas and suggestions to help you get back on track!",
