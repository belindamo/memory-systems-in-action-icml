  "content": "The narrator of the audiobook, Zach Appelman, has a clear, smooth, and expressive voice that should be easy to follow even at a faster speed. He does an excellent job of conveying the emotions and atmosphere of the story, and his pacing is well-suited for a historical fiction novel like \"All the Light We Cannot See\".\n\nAt 1.25x speed, you might need to adjust slightly to the faster pace, but Appelman's narration should remain clear and easy to follow. His voice is not overly dramatic or theatrical, which makes it well-suited for a faster listening speed.\n\nThat being said, it's always a good idea to start with the standard 1x speed and get accustomed to the narrator's voice and style. Once you're comfortable, you can try increasing the speed to 1.25x or even 1.5x, depending on your personal preference.\n\nKeep in mind that increasing the speed might affect your comprehension and emotional connection to the story. While it's great to finish the book faster, it's essential to ensure you're still absorbing the narrative and enjoying the experience.\n\nIf you do decide to listen at a faster speed, pay attention to how you're feeling about the story and the characters. If you find yourself getting lost or struggling to follow the plot, you can always adjust the speed back down to 1x.\n\nOverall, I think you'll find Zach Appelman's narration to be engaging and easy to follow, even at a faster speed. Enjoy your listening experience!",
