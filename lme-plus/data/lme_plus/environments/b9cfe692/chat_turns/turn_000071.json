Sweet potatoes are an amazing addition to breakfast burritos! \n\nCooking sweet potatoes to perfection can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you achieve tender, delicious sweet potatoes:\n\n1. **Bake or Boil?**: You can either bake or boil sweet potatoes to cook them. Baking is a great way to bring out their natural sweetness, while boiling helps retain more nutrients. For breakfast burritos, I recommend baking for a slightly caramelized flavor.\n2. **Choose the Right Sweet Potatoes**: Look for sweet potatoes that are high in moisture, like Yukon Gold or Jewel varieties. These will yield a tender, creamy texture.\n3. **Pierce and Bake**: Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Pierce the sweet potatoes several times with a fork to allow steam to escape. Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until they're tender when pierced with a fork.\n4. **Microwave Option**: If you're short on time, you can microwave sweet potatoes for 3-4 minutes, or until they're tender. Check on them every minute to avoid overcooking.\n5. **Dice and Saut\u00e9**: Once cooked, let the sweet potatoes cool, then dice them into small pieces. Saut\u00e9 them in a pan with a little oil until they're lightly browned and crispy on the outside. This step adds texture and flavor to your breakfast burrito.\n6. **Don't Overcook**: Sweet potatoes can become mushy if overcooked. Check on them regularly during the cooking process to avoid overcooking.\n7. **Add Aromatics**: While saut\u00e9ing the sweet potatoes, add some aromatics like onions, garlic, or bell peppers to enhance the flavor.\n8. **Season to Taste**: Season the sweet potatoes with salt, pepper, and any other spices you like (e.g., cumin, paprika, or chili powder) to match your breakfast burrito's flavor profile.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll end up with tender, flavorful sweet potatoes that will elevate your breakfast burrito game!",
