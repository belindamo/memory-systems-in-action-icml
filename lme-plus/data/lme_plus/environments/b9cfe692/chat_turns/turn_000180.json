I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you need:\n\n1. **Check your flight itinerary**: Take a look at your flight confirmation email or the airline's website to see if they provide information about your layover, including the arrival and departure gates, as well as the layover duration.\n2. **Contact your airline**: Reach out to JetBlue's customer service department directly to ask about your layover details. They should be able to provide you with the information you need.\n3. **Use a flight tracking app**: Download a flight tracking app like FlightAware or FlightRadar24 to get real-time information about your flight, including layover details.\n\nOnce you have this information, you can plan your layover activities accordingly. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) has a few amenities and restaurants to explore, including:\n\n* **Terminals**: FLL has four terminals (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each terminal has its own security checkpoint, so be sure to check which terminal your flight is arriving at and plan accordingly.\n* **Food and drink**: FLL has a variety of restaurants, cafes, and bars throughout the terminals, including options like Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, and Burger King.\n* **Shopping**: You'll find several shops, including newsstands, souvenir stores, and duty-free shops.\n* **Lounges**: If you have lounge access or want to pay for a day pass, FLL has several lounges, including the Delta Sky Club and the United Club.\n\nKeep in mind that layovers can be unpredictable, so it's always a good idea to check for any updates or changes to your flight schedule before planning your activities.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a smooth and enjoyable layover!",
