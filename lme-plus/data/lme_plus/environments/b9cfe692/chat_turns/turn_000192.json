  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! By setting up a separate table for more complex games, you're catering to different tastes and skill levels, ensuring that all your guests have a great time. The \"Game Guru\" concept is also brilliant, as it will provide a gentle learning curve for those interested in exploring Carcassonne and Pandemic.\n\n**Tips for Your \"Game Guru\" Station:**\n\n* Choose a knowledgeable and patient \"Game Guru\" who's familiar with the games and can explain the rules clearly.\n* Provide a brief introduction to the games, highlighting their unique features and gameplay mechanics.\n* Consider having a \"Quick Start\" guide or a simplified rulesheet for guests to refer to.\n* Encourage guests to ask questions and seek guidance throughout the game.\n* Make sure the \"Game Guru\" is available to answer questions and provide feedback, but also allow guests to learn and discover the game at their own pace.\n\nBy offering this separate table and \"Game Guru\" guidance, you're creating a welcoming environment for guests to explore new games and expand their gaming horizons. Kudos to you for considering the needs of all your guests!\n\nNow, I think you've got a solid plan in place for a fantastic board game party. You're offering a variety of games, catering to different tastes, and providing a supportive environment for guests to learn and have fun. I'm confident your party will be a huge success!",
