  "content": "Based on your previous question, I provided a solution that should adjust the width of the chat container to be suitable for mobile devices. However, there may be other factors that are preventing the page from being properly displayed on mobile.\n\nOne common issue is that the viewport meta tag is not set correctly in the HTML head. Make sure you have the following code in your HTML head:\n```html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n```\nThis tells the browser to set the width of the viewport to the width of the device, and to set the initial zoom level to 1.0. Without this meta tag, the browser may not be able to properly scale the page for mobile devices.\n\nIf you've already included the viewport meta tag and the issue persists, please let me know and I can try to provide further assistance.",
