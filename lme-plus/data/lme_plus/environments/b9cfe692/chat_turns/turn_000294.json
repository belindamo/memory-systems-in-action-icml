I've heard that it's one of the most effective ways to improve your driving technique, and I'd love to get personalized feedback on my driving. I'll make sure to ask them to focus on my braking points and corner speed, especially in turns 1, 3, and 5. Do you think I should also ask them to ride along with me during a few laps to get a better sense of my driving style and provide more detailed feedback?",
