Sniffing and exploring new smells are definitely a big part of the fun for dogs, and it's wonderful that you're able to provide him with that experience.\n\nI completely agree with you about audiobooks making exercise more enjoyable. It's amazing how much of a difference it can make to have a engaging story or interesting information to focus on while you're walking. It's not just about the physical activity, but also about the mental stimulation and relaxation that comes with listening to a good book.\n\nAnd I love that you consider it a reward for yourself after a long day of work! Self-care is so important, and it's great that you've found a way to make exercise feel like a treat rather than a chore.\n\nDo you find that you're able to focus on the story and characters while walking, or do you sometimes get distracted by your surroundings or Max's antics?\n\nAlso, have you considered exploring other types of content beyond audiobooks, like podcasts or educational programs, during your walks?",
