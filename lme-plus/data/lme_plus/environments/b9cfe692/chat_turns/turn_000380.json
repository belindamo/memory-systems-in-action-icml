They're both reputable brands with a wide range of products.\n\nRegarding the scratching post, it's great that you're thinking about Luna's preferences. Both multiple-perch and single-surface scratching posts have their advantages. Here's a brief rundown to help you decide:\n\n**Multiple-perch scratching posts:**\n\n* Provide more opportunities for Luna to climb, scratch, and play\n* Encourage exercise and stretching\n* Often have multiple scratching surfaces, which can help reduce wear and tear on a single area\n* Can be more engaging and stimulating for cats\n\n**Single-surface scratching posts:**\n\n* Often more compact and space-efficient, making them ideal for small apartments\n* Can be more affordable than multiple-perch posts\n* Still provide a dedicated scratching surface for Luna to use\n\nIf you think Luna would enjoy climbing and exploring, a multiple-perch scratching post might be a great option. However, if you're short on space or prefer a more compact design, a single-surface scratching post can still be a great choice.\n\nIt's also worth considering Luna's age, agility, and mobility. If she's older or less active, a single-surface post might be more suitable. If she's younger and more energetic, a multiple-perch post could be a better fit.\n\nAnd yay for finding a cat food flavor that Luna loves! Salmon is a popular flavor among cats, and it's great that you're experimenting to find what works best for her. Remember to always transition to new foods gradually to prevent digestive upset.\n\nWhen you do get the new scratching post, make sure to place it near Luna's favorite scratching areas and encourage her to use it with some treats or toys. You can also try sprinkling some catnip on the post to make it more appealing.",
