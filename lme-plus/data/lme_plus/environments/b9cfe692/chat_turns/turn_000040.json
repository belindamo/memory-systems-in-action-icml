Here are a few ideas:\n\n**5-Minute Fudge**\n\n* 1 can of sweetened condensed milk\n* 1 cup of chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)\n* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)\n* Pinch of salt\n\nCombine the sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, and vanilla extract (if using) in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Pour into a lined baking dish and refrigerate until set. Cut into squares and enjoy!\n\n**Banana Bread**\n\n* 3-4 ripe bananas, mashed\n* 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour\n* 1 tsp baking powder\n* 1/2 tsp salt\n* 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, melted\n* 1 cup of sugar\n* 2 large eggs\n* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)\n\nPreheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Mix the mashed bananas, flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the melted butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract (if using). Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Pour into a greased loaf pan and bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.\n\n**No-Bake Energy Bites**\n\n* 2 cups of rolled oats\n* 1 cup of peanut butter\n* 1/2 cup of honey\n* 1/4 cup of chocolate chips (optional)\n* Pinch of salt\n\nIn a bowl, combine the oats, peanut butter, and honey. Mix until a dough forms. If using chocolate chips, fold them into the dough. Use your hands to shape into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Refrigerate until firm.\n\nThese desserts are all quick, easy, and use common ingredients you might already have at home. Enjoy!\n\nWhich one of these desserts catches your eye?",
