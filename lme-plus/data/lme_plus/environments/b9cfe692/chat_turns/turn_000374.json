  "content": "AI language model: Yes, it's likely that governments will offer retraining programs to help workers transition into new jobs in the transportation industry. The transition to autonomous vehicles is expected to have a profound impact on many traditional transportation roles. Hence, it's vital that policy-makers and industry leaders plan for ways to mitigate this impact and support the workers who are affected.\n\nOne way to achieve this is through publicly funded retraining programs that aim to reskill workers to take on new roles in the autonomous vehicle industry. For example, they could offer training programs in software development, AI, robotics, and maintenance for the autonomous vehicles.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to training programs, policymakers can also work alongside industry leaders to develop policies that encourage investment in new job opportunities. This may include incentivizing startups, creating regulatory sandbox environments to foster innovation or promoting public-private partnerships.\n\nIn general, governments should be proactive in developing a comprehensive plan to support workers through the transition to autonomous vehicles to ensure that the benefits of the technology are realized as broadly as possible.",
