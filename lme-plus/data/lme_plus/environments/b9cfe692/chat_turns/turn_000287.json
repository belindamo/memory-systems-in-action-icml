  "content": "Upgrading to a high-performance tire that can handle track events and still provide good grip on the street is a great move.\n\nRegarding wet performance, it's essential to have a tire that can handle rain and wet roads, especially if you plan to drive aggressively. Here's how the tires I mentioned earlier perform in wet conditions:\n\n1. **Michelin Pilot Sport 4**: The Pilot Sport 4 is known for its exceptional wet performance. It features Michelin's Dynamic Response Technology, which helps to evacuate water and improve grip on wet roads. It's one of the top-performing tires in the wet, and many owners rave about its confidence-inspiring behavior in rainy conditions.\n2. **Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06**: The ExtremeContact DWS 06 is designed to provide excellent wet performance, with features like Continental's SportPlus Technology, which helps to improve grip and handling on wet roads. It's a great all-around tire that performs well in both dry and wet conditions.\n3. **Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3**: The Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 is a high-performance tire that also performs well in wet conditions. It features Goodyear's ActiveBraking Technology, which helps to improve stopping power on wet roads. While it's not as exceptional as the Pilot Sport 4 in the wet, it's still a solid choice.\n4. **Nitto NT05**: The NT05 is a high-performance tire that's more geared towards dry performance, but it still provides decent wet performance. It's not as strong in the wet as some of the other options, but it's still a great choice if you prioritize dry performance.\n5. **Toyo Proxes R888R**: The Proxes R888R is a track-focused tire that's designed for dry performance. While it can handle some wet roads, it's not the best choice for wet performance. If you prioritize wet grip, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nBased on your needs, I'd recommend either the Michelin Pilot Sport 4 or the Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06. Both tires offer exceptional performance in both dry and wet conditions, making them excellent choices for track events and daily driving.\n\nThe Pilot Sport 4 is a more premium option that's known for its exceptional wet performance, while the ExtremeContact DWS 06 is a more affordable option that still provides excellent all-around performance.\n\nDo you have a preference for a more premium or affordable option?",
