Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n**1. Consult Your Doctor or Dentist**: Before starting any exercise routine, consult with your doctor or dentist to ensure it's safe for you to exercise after your wisdom teeth surgery. They may have specific guidelines or restrictions for you to follow.\n\n**2. Start with Low-Impact Exercises**: Opt for low-impact exercises that don't jar your jaw or put excessive strain on your mouth.

Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to your body and stop immediately if you experience any discomfort, pain, or swelling in your jaw or mouth.\n\n**6. Gradually Increase Intensity**: As you get stronger and more comfortable, you can gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts.\n\n**7. Focus on Stretching and Flexibility**: Gentle stretching and flexibility exercises can help improve your overall flexibility and reduce stiffness.
