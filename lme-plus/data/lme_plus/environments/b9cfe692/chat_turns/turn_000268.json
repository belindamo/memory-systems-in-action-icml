  "content": "My mom is doing much better, thank you for asking! She's been making great progress in her physical therapy sessions, and she's slowly getting back to her normal routine. It's been a big relief for both of us. Now that she's more independent, I can finally focus on my own health and fitness goals again. I'm thinking of starting with some light exercises and gradually increasing the intensity as I get stronger. Do you have any tips on how to create a workout routine that's gentle on my body, especially after my recent wisdom teeth surgery?",
