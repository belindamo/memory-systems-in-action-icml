  "content": "I completely understand! Taking care of a loved one, especially after a major surgery, can be incredibly challenging and time-consuming. It's amazing that you've been able to dedicate so much time and energy to helping your mom recover.\n\nIt's great to hear that she's on the mend now, and I'm sure she appreciates all the support you've been providing. As a caregiver, it's essential to remember to prioritize your own well-being, too. Make sure you're taking breaks, resting when you need to, and seeking help if you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nNow that your mom is recovering, you can start focusing on your own health and fitness goals again. You might consider finding exercises that you can do at home or in short bursts, like bodyweight exercises, yoga, or even just taking short walks around the block. Every bit counts, and it's great that you're motivated to get back on track!\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories. You've been through a lot, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. How's your mom doing now? Is she progressing well in her physical therapy sessions?",
