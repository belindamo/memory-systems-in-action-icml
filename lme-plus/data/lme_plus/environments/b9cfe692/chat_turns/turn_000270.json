Remember to listen to your body and stop if you experience any discomfort or pain. It's also essential to stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet to support your recovery.\n\nSpeaking of diet, have you considered incorporating more anti-inflammatory foods into your meals? Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and fiber can help reduce inflammation and promote healing. Some examples include:\n* Fatty fish like salmon and sardines\n* Leafy greens like spinach and kale\n* Nuts and seeds like walnuts and chia seeds\n* Fruits like berries and citrus fruits\n* Whole grains like brown rice and quinoa\n\nIncorporating these foods into your diet can help support your overall health and recovery. Do you have any favorite anti-inflammatory foods or recipes you'd like to share?",
