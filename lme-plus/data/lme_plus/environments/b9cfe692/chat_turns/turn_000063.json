As for storing them, here are some tips to help keep them fresh for a few days:\n\n1. **Cool them completely**: Before storing, make sure the sweet potato fries have cooled down completely to room temperature. This will help prevent moisture from building up and causing them to become soggy.\n2. **Store in an airtight container**: Transfer the cooled sweet potato fries to an airtight container, such as a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. You can also use a paper bag or a zip-top plastic bag, but make sure to press out as much air as possible before sealing.\n3. **Keep them dry**: Store the container in a dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Humidity can cause the fries to become soft and soggy.\n4. **Refrigerate at 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below**: Store the container in the refrigerator at a consistent temperature of 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below. This will help slow down the staling process.\n5. **Use within 3-5 days**: Sweet potato fries typically keep well for 3-5 days when stored properly. If you notice any signs of spoilage, such as an off smell or slimy texture, it's best to err on the side of caution and discard them.\n6. **Freeze for longer storage**: If you want to keep the sweet potato fries for a longer period, consider freezing them. Simply place the cooled fries in an airtight container or freezer bag, making sure to press out as much air as possible before sealing. Frozen sweet potato fries can be stored for up to 3-4 months. When you're ready to serve, simply thaw them in the refrigerator or reheat them in the oven.\n\nSome additional tips to maintain crispiness:\n\n* Before reheating, you can try microwaving the sweet potato fries for 10-15 seconds to help restore some crispiness.\n* If you're reheating in the oven, try baking them at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 5-10 minutes, or until crispy.\n* You can also try reheating them in a pan with a small amount of oil to help crisp them up.\n\nEnjoy your delicious pan-fried sweet potato fries, and I hope these tips help you keep them fresh for a few days!",
