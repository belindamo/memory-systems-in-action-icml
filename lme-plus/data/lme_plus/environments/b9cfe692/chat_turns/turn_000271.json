I'm so glad you brought this up!\n\nIncorporating omega-3 rich foods like salmon and sardines into your diet can help reduce inflammation and promote healing. Leafy greens like spinach and kale are also packed with antioxidants and fiber, which can help reduce inflammation and support overall health.\n\nNuts and seeds like walnuts and chia seeds are great sources of healthy fats and fiber, which can help reduce inflammation and promote digestive health. Fruits like berries and citrus fruits are rich in antioxidants and vitamins, which can help boost your immune system and promote healing.\n\nWhole grains like brown rice and quinoa are rich in fiber and antioxidants, which can help reduce inflammation and support digestive health.\n\nAs for recipes, I have a few favorites that incorporate anti-inflammatory ingredients. One of my favorites is a simple salmon and spinach stir-fry with brown rice. You can saut\u00e9 the salmon and spinach in a little olive oil with some garlic and ginger, and serve it over brown rice. It's a quick, easy, and delicious way to get in some omega-3s and antioxidants!\n\nAnother recipe I love is a berry and chia seed smoothie bowl. You can blend together frozen berries, chia seeds, and some almond milk, then top it with sliced fruit and nuts. It's a great way to get in some antioxidants and fiber to support your recovery.\n\nDo you have any favorite anti-inflammatory recipes or ingredients? I'd love to hear about them!",
