It sounds like you're looking for convenient, waste-reducing, and slow-cooker-friendly meals that'll help you get back on track.\n\nHere are some ideas to get you started:\n\n**Slow Cooker Recipes**\n\n1. **Chicken Fajitas**: Place boneless chicken breasts, sliced bell peppers, onions, fajita seasoning, and diced tomatoes in the slow cooker. Cook on low for 6-8 hours. Serve with tortillas, sour cream, and shredded cheese.\n2. **Lentil Soup**: Add lentils, diced veggies (carrots, celery, onions), broth, and your choice of spices to the slow cooker. Cook on low for 6-8 hours. Blend for a creamy soup or serve with crusty bread.\n3. **Pulled Pork**: Place a pork shoulder, BBQ sauce, and onions in the slow cooker. Cook on low for 8-10 hours. Shred and serve on a bun or with roasted veggies.\n4. **Chili**: Mix ground beef, diced tomatoes, beans, onions, and spices in the slow cooker. Cook on low for 6-8 hours. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips.\n5. **Greek Chicken**: Add chicken breasts, Greek yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and oregano to the slow cooker. Cook on low for 4-6 hours. Serve with roasted veggies and quinoa or rice.\n\n**Meal Prep and Leftover Ideas**\n\n1. **Rice Bowls**: Cook a large batch of rice and top with different ingredients each day, such as grilled chicken, roasted veggies, avocado, and a fried egg.\n2. **Soup and Salad**: Use last night's dinner as a topping for a fresh green salad or as a side to a hearty soup.\n3. **Freezer Burritos**: Fill tortillas with leftover rice, beans, cheese, and veggies, and freeze for up to 3 months. Simply microwave or oven-heat when needed.\n4. **Breakfast Burritos**: Scramble eggs, add shredded cheese, salsa, and leftover veggies, then wrap in tortillas and freeze for a quick breakfast.\n5. **Roasted Veggies**: Roast a large batch of veggies (e.g., broccoli, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts) and use them as a side dish or add to salads, soups, or omelets throughout the week.\n\n**Kitchen Organization Tips**\n\n1. **Purge and categorize**: Clear out expired or unused items from your cabinets and group similar items together (e.g., baking supplies, spices, oils).\n2. **Assign a home**: Designate a specific spot for frequently used items, like oils, spices, or utensils, to make them easily accessible.\n3. **Use vertical space**: Install shelves, hooks, or a pegboard to maximize storage and keep countertops clear.\n4. **Label and date**: Label leftovers and store them in a designated area, like a \"use-up\" shelf, to ensure they get consumed before they go bad.\n\nFeel free to pick and choose from these ideas, and let me know if you have any questions or need more suggestions!",
