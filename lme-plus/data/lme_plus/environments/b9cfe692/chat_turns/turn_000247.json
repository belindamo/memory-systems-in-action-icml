Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Cleaning:**\n\nCarbon fiber wheels are more sensitive to cleaning products and techniques than traditional wheels. Here are some tips:\n\n* Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or high-pressure washes, as they can damage the carbon fiber or strip away the protective coating.\n* Use a mild soap and water solution, and a soft-bristled brush to clean the wheels.\n* Dry the wheels thoroughly with a soft cloth to prevent water spots.\n\n**Tire installation and removal:**\n\nCarbon fiber wheels often require specific tire levers and techniques to avoid damaging the rim. Here are some tips:\n\n* Use a tire lever specifically designed for carbon fiber wheels.\n* Apply a small amount of lubricant to the tire bead and rim to help the tire slide on and off more easily.\n* Avoid using excessive force or twisting motions when installing or removing tires.\n\n**Brake pad selection and maintenance:**\n\nCarbon fiber wheels require specific brake pads designed for carbon fiber rims. Here are some tips:\n\n* Use brake pads specifically designed for carbon fiber wheels.\n* Inspect brake pads regularly for wear and replace them as needed.\n* Avoid using brake pads that are too aggressive, as they can wear down the rim prematurely.\n\n**Rim inspection and maintenance:**\n\nCarbon fiber wheels require regular inspection for signs of damage or wear. Here are some tips:\n\n* Inspect the rim regularly for signs of damage, such as cracks, scratches, or excessive wear.\n* Use a rim inspection tool to check for any damage or wear.\n* Address any issues promptly to prevent them from becoming more serious problems.\n\n**Other considerations:**\n\n* Carbon fiber wheels can be more prone to damage from road debris, potholes, and other hazards. Be mindful of road conditions and take steps to avoid hazards.\n* Carbon fiber wheels may require more frequent truing and tensioning due to their lighter weight and more flexible nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile carbon fiber wheels do require some special care and attention, they're not necessarily high-maintenance. By following these tips and taking the time to properly clean, maintain, and inspect your wheels, you can enjoy the benefits of carbon fiber wheels without worrying about excessive maintenance.",
