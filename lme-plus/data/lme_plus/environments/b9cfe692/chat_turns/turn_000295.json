  "content": "In-car instruction is an excellent way to get personalized feedback and improve your driving technique.\n\nAbsolutely, ask the instructor to ride along with you during a few laps to get a better sense of your driving style and provide more detailed feedback! This will give them a firsthand experience of your driving, allowing them to identify areas for improvement and provide targeted feedback.\n\nRiding along with you will also enable the instructor to:\n\n1. **Observe your driving habits:** They can see how you approach turns, brake, accelerate, and handle the car, which will help them identify areas for improvement.\n2. **Feel the car's behavior:** By experiencing the car's dynamics and your input, the instructor can provide feedback on how to improve your driving technique and get the most out of your car.\n3. **Provide real-time feedback:** During the ride-along, the instructor can provide real-time feedback and guidance, helping you make adjustments on the fly and improve your driving technique.\n\nWhen asking the instructor to ride along with you, be sure to:\n\n1. **Communicate your goals:** Let them know what you're working on improving, such as braking points and corner speed in turns 1, 3, and 5.\n2. **Ask specific questions:** Prepare a list of questions to ask during the ride-along, such as \"What can I do to improve my braking technique?\" or \"How can I carry more speed through this turn?\"\n3. **Be open to feedback:** Remember that the instructor is there to help you improve, so be open to their feedback and suggestions.\n\nBy combining in-car instruction with a ride-along, you'll get personalized feedback and guidance that will help you improve your driving technique and achieve your goals.\n\nHow many laps do you plan to do with the instructor, and do you have any specific questions prepared for them?",
