You can expect to invest around 11-14 hours of listening time for each book.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some rough estimates of how long it might take to finish each audiobook, assuming you listen to them at a moderate pace (e.g., 1-2 hours per day):\n\n* **The Song of Achilles**: 5-7 days\n* **The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao**: 7-10 days\n\nKeep in mind that these are just rough estimates, and your listening pace may vary depending on your schedule and preferences.\n\n**Sampling Tips:**\n\nWhen listening to the samples, pay attention to:\n\n* The narrator's voice, tone, and pace\n* How they convey the characters' emotions and personalities\n* The overall atmosphere and mood they create\n* How easy it is to follow the story and understand the characters\n\nYou can usually find samples on audiobook platforms like Audible, Libro.fm, or your local library's digital collection. Just search for the book title, and look for the \"Sample\" or \"Preview\" button.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance!",
