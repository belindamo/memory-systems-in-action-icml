  "content": "That's fantastic! Congratulations on getting into audiobooks and finishing three in six weeks! I'd be happy to help you with some new recommendations. Can you please tell me a bit more about what you've enjoyed so far? For example:\n\n1. What genres have you been listening to (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, mystery, sci-fi, fantasy, romance, etc.)?\n2. Are there any specific authors or narrators you've enjoyed?\n3. Do you prefer books with complex, thought-provoking themes or light, easy listens?\n4. Are you interested in standalone books or series?\n5. Is there a particular tone you're in the mood for (e.g., humorous, suspenseful, emotional, adventurous)?\n\nFeel free to share as much or as little as you'd like, and I'll do my best to suggest some great audiobook recommendations tailored to your tastes!",
