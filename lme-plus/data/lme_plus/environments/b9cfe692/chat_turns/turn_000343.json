Spray the solution onto the shower curtain and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Rinse with warm water and let it air dry.\n\n**Method 2: White Vinegar and Baking Soda**\n\n* 1 cup white vinegar\n* 2 tablespoons baking soda\n* 10 drops of lemon oil (optional)\n\nMix the white vinegar and baking soda in a spray bottle. The baking soda will help scrub away any tough stains. Spray the solution onto the shower curtain and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Rinse with warm water and let it air dry. If you want a fresh scent, add the lemon oil.\n\n**Method 3: Epsom Salt and Essential Oils**\n\n* 1 cup Epsom salt\n* 1 cup warm water\n* 10 drops of tea tree oil\n* 10 drops of eucalyptus oil\n\nMix the Epsom salt and warm water in a bowl to create a paste. Apply the paste to the shower curtain using a soft cloth or sponge. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Rinse with warm water and let it air dry. The Epsom salt will help remove any soap scum and mildew.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Before cleaning, remove any visible soap scum or mildew with a soft brush or cloth.\n* For tough stains, let the cleaning solution sit for 30 minutes to an hour before rinsing.\n* To prevent mildew and mold, clean your shower curtain every 1-2 months.\n* If you have a fabric shower curtain, you can machine wash it with a gentle cycle and a natural detergent.\n* Consider replacing your shower curtain with a mold- and mildew-resistant one made from materials like PEVA or PVC.\n\nI hope these methods help you keep your shower curtain clean and fresh!",
