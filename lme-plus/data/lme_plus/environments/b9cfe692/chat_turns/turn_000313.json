Chicken fajitas are a great choice for a delicious and easy meal.\n\nFor placemats, I've got some suggestions that are easy to clean and resistant to stains:\n\n1. **Silicone Placemats**: Made from flexible silicone, these placemats are easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth and are resistant to heat, scratches, and stains.\n2. **Vinyl Placemats**: Vinyl placemats are waterproof, easy to clean, and can withstand spills and messes. Look for ones with a textured surface to prevent plates and glasses from slipping.\n3. **Woven Vinyl Placemats**: These placemats combine the durability of vinyl with a woven design, making them easy to clean and resistant to stains.\n4. **Cork Placemats**: Cork placemats are a great eco-friendly option, resistant to water, and easy to clean with a damp cloth. They also provide a natural, rustic look to your table setting.\n5. **Reusable Paper Placemats**: If you're looking for a more affordable and disposable option, reusable paper placemats are a great choice. They're easy to clean and can be reused multiple times.\n\nWhen shopping for placemats, make sure to check the product description or reviews to ensure they meet your specific needs and preferences.\n\nBefore you start purging and categorizing your cabinet contents, here's a bonus tip:\n\n**Use a \"Maybe\" Box**: When decluttering, it can be hard to decide what to keep and what to discard. Use a \"maybe\" box to store items you're unsure about. Set a deadline, like 6 months, and if you haven't used the item by then, get rid of it.\n\nGood luck with your kitchen organization project, and I hope you enjoy your slow-cooked chicken fajitas!",
