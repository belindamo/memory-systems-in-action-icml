  "content": "If you have added an SVG logo to your HTML but it is not visible, there may be several reasons why this is happening. Here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. Make sure the SVG code is valid and complete. Check that there are no syntax errors or missing tags in the SVG code, and that it includes the `viewBox` attribute to specify the dimensions of the SVG.\n2. Check the file path or URL of your SVG. Make sure the path or URL is correct and that the SVG file is accessible.\n3. Check the CSS styling of your SVG. Make sure the SVG is not hidden by setting its `display` property to `block` or `inline-block`, or by removing any `display: none` rules from the CSS. Also, make sure the SVG has a width and height set in CSS, or that it has a `viewBox` attribute set in the SVG code.\n4. If you are using an external CSS file, make sure the CSS rules for the SVG are included in the file and that the file is linked correctly to your HTML file.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, please share your code and I'll take a closer look.",
