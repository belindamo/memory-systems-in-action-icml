If you have a shorter layover (less than 2 hours), it might be a bit tight to grab a bite or do some shopping, especially considering you'll need to factor in security checks, gate changes, and potential delays.\n\nHowever, if you have a longer layover (2-4 hours or more), you should have enough time to grab a meal or do some quick shopping. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) has a decent selection of restaurants and shops, and you can always check out the airport's website or app to plan your layover activities.\n\nHere are some general tips to make the most of your layover:\n\n1. **Plan ahead**: Check your flight itinerary and layover details to determine how much time you have available.\n2. **Research airport amenities**: Look up the airport's website or app to see what restaurants, shops, and amenities are available.\n3. **Prioritize**: Decide what's most important to you during the layover \u2013 grabbing a bite, doing some shopping, or simply relaxing.\n4. **Leave some buffer time**: Factor in some extra time for security checks, gate changes, and potential delays.\n\nRemember to stay relaxed, and don't stress if you can't fit in everything you want to do during the layover. You can always grab a snack or do some shopping at your final destination, Miami!\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a smooth and enjoyable layover!",
