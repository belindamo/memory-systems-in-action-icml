  "content": "I think the brand is just a local brand, nothing too special. I love the spicy kick it has, it's pretty intense. I'm not sure what type of peppers they use, but it's definitely not just sriracha. Maybe it's a blend of different peppers? Anyway, I'm excited to try out this recipe and adjust the spice level to my liking. By the way, do you have any recommendations for a healthy breakfast option that's quick to prepare? I've been obsessed with overnight oats lately, but I'm open to new ideas.",
