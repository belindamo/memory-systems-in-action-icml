  "content": "Local Storage is created and controlled by the client-side JavaScript of a website, which means that it can only be accessed and modified by the website that created it. The browser provides a JavaScript API (Application Programming Interface) that allows a website to create and modify Local Storage data.\n\nFor example, a website's JavaScript code can use the Local Storage API to store data in Local Storage and then retrieve it later. This can be done by setting and getting key-value pairs in Local Storage.\n\nWhile the server can't access the data stored in Local Storage directly, it can still communicate with the client-side JavaScript code to pass data that needs to be stored in Local Storage. The JavaScript code can then store the data in Local Storage and can use it later to access the stored data.\n\nIt's worth noting that Local Storage data is only accessible to the website that created it and is not shared with other websites. This means that a website can only access the data that it has stored in Local Storage.\n\nIn summary, Local Storage is created and controlled by the client-side JavaScript of a website, which means that it can only be accessed and modified by the website that created it.
