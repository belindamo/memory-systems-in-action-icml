  "content": "The \"Set-Cookie\" header is an HTTP header that is used by a server to send a cookie to a client. It is used to create a new cookie or to update an existing cookie on the client's device.\n\nA Set-Cookie header contains one or more name-value pairs that define the cookie, such as the cookie's name, value, expiration date, and other attributes.\n\nHere's an example of a Set-Cookie header:\n```\nSet-Cookie: session_id=12345; expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT; HttpOnly; path=/; secure\n```\nIn this example, the Set-Cookie header is creating a new cookie named \"session\\_id\" with a value of \"12345\". The cookie has an expiration date of \"Wed, 21 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT\", and it is marked as HttpOnly, which means that the cookie can only be accessed via the HTTP protocol and JavaScript will not be able to access the cookie. The path attribute is set to \"/\" which means this cookie will be included in requests to the root path of the domain.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Set-Cookie header can also be used to delete a cookie by setting the expiration date to a date in the past.\n\nIn summary, The \"Set-Cookie\" header is an HTTP header that is used by a server to send a cookie to a client. It contains one or more name-value pairs that define the cookie, such as the cookie's name, value, expiration date, and other attributes. The Set-Cookie header can also be used to delete a cookie by setting the expiration date to a date in the past.",
