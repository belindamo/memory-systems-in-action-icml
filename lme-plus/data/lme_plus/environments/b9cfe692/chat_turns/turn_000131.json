  "content": "I'm able to focus on the story and characters pretty well while walking, but I do get distracted occasionally by interesting sights or sounds around me. Like, if we're walking in a new neighborhood, I might get caught up in looking at the architecture or gardens. And of course, if Max sees a squirrel or another dog, he can get pretty excited! But overall, I find that the audiobook helps me stay engaged and motivated during our walks.\n\nAs for exploring other types of content, I've actually been thinking about trying out some podcasts. I've heard great things about true crime podcasts, and I'm intrigued by the idea of listening to a story unfold over multiple episodes. Do you have any recommendations for true crime podcasts that are well-narrated and engaging?",
