R.F. Kuang's world-building and characters are so immersive, and the story is full of twists and turns.\n\nDo you find that listening to audiobooks during your walks helps you stay motivated to exercise, or is it more of a convenient way to fit in some reading time?\n\nAlso, I'm curious: what's your dog's name, and what's their favorite part of the walk (sniffing, people-watching, or maybe listening to you mutter \"oh wow\" at a plot twist)?",

Sniffing and exploring new smells are definitely a big part of the fun for dogs, and it's wonderful that you're able to provide him with that experience.\n\nI completely agree with you about audiobooks making exercise more enjoyable. It's amazing how much of a difference it can make to have a engaging story or interesting information to focus on while you're walking. It's not just about the physical activity, but also about the mental stimulation and relaxation that comes with listening to a good book.\n\nAnd I love that you consider it a reward for yourself after a long day of work! Self-care is so important, and it's great that you've found a way to make exercise feel like a treat rather than a chore.\n\nDo you find that you're able to focus on the story and characters while walking, or do you sometimes get distracted by your surroundings or Max's antics?\n\nAlso, have you considered exploring other types of content beyond audiobooks, like podcasts or educational programs, during your walks?",

Like, if we're walking in a new neighborhood, I might get caught up in looking at the architecture or gardens. And of course, if Max sees a squirrel or another dog, he can get pretty excited! But overall, I find that the audiobook helps me stay engaged and motivated during our walks.\n\nAs for exploring other types of content, I've actually been thinking about trying out some podcasts. I've heard great things about true crime podcasts, and I'm intrigued by the idea of listening to a story unfold over multiple episodes.

It's great that you're able to balance your focus between the audiobook and your surroundings.\n\nTrue crime podcasts are extremely popular, and there are many excellent ones to choose from.

The hosts are entertaining and well-researched.\n5. **Dr. Death**: A podcast that explores the case of Dr. Christopher Duntsch, a former neurosurgeon who was convicted of multiple counts of aggravated assault and bodily harm.
