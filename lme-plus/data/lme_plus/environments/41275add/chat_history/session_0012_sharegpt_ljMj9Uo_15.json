      "content": "The Texas Secretary of State requires all Texas nonprofits to file an annual report each year. The report is due based on the anniversary date of the entity's formation, and it is usually due on the last day of the month in which the anniversary falls.\n\nFor example, if your nonprofit was incorporated on January 15th, then your annual report would be due on January 31st of each subsequent year.\n\nYou can file your annual report at any time during the year leading up to the deadline. It is recommended to file the annual report early to avoid any potential delays or issues that may arise closer to the deadline.\n\nIf you fail to file your annual report by the deadline, your nonprofit may become delinquent, and you may be subject to late fees or administrative dissolution of your organization."

      "content": "In Texas, the annual report is the primary method for updating the Secretary of State with changes to your nonprofit's Board of Directors and officers. However, you can also file an Amended Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State if you need to make changes to your nonprofit's governing documents or if you want to add or remove directors or officers.\n\nTo file an Amended Certificate of Formation, you will need to submit a completed and signed form to the Secretary of State along with any required fees. The form should include the changes that you are making, such as the addition or removal of directors or officers.\n\nKeep in mind that filing an Amended Certificate of Formation can be a more time-consuming and expensive process than filing an annual report. Therefore, it's generally recommended that you only file an Amended Certificate of Formation if you need to make significant changes to your nonprofit's governance structure."

      "content": "Congratulations on getting your nonprofit approved in Texas! Since you just recently incorporated your nonprofit, it may be a bit early to file your first annual report, as the report is typically due one year after your incorporation date.\n\nHowever, you can still submit an annual report if you would like to update any information that may have changed since your incorporation. It is always a good idea to ensure that your information with the Secretary of State is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nIf you choose to file an annual report early, keep in mind that you will still need to file an additional annual report in the future based on your anniversary date. You can file your annual report online through the Texas Secretary of State website or by mail."
