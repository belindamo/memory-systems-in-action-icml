      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure, I can explain the techniques used in the cinematography of these movies.\n\nIn \"The Revenant\", the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki used a combination of natural light and controlled lighting to create an immersive and realistic visual experience. The film was shot using a combination of wide-angle lenses, aerial shots, and tight close-ups, which helped to capture both the epic scale of the landscape and the intimate details of the characters. Lubezki also used a Steadicam system to allow for smooth, fluid camera movements, which contributed to the film's sense of motion and intensity. In addition, the film was shot in natural light conditions, which required the crew to schedule shoots around the movement of the sun, resulting in a highly authentic visual experience.\n\nIn \"Birdman\", the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki also used a continuous single take technique to create a sense of urgency and immediacy in the story. The film was designed to look like one long take, achieved through the use of hidden cuts and careful choreography of the camera movements. The cinematography in \"Birdman\" used a combination of handheld cameras, cranes, and dollies to create the impression of fluid motion and seamless cuts. Lubezki also used a unique lighting approach for \"Birdman,\" where the entire film was lit with practical lights, such as lamps and windows, giving the movie a unique, theatrical feel.\n\nIn both films, the cinematography was used as an integral element of the story and played a crucial role in delivering a compelling and immersive experience for the viewer. The use of long takes, fluid camera movements, and natural light helped to create a sense of authenticity and realism, which contributed to the success of the films."

      "content": "I can't have an opinion or beliefs, but to answer your question, it's hard to say if these movies would have been as successful without their cinematography because the cinematography was an essential element of both films. the distinctive visual style created by emmanuel lubezki's cinematography was critical to the immersive and captivating experience of \"the revenant\" and \"birdman.\" if the films had used traditional cinematography techniques, it's possible that they would not have been as memorable or have resonated with audiences in the same way.\n\nthe cinematography in both movies helped to engage the viewer on a deeper level, delivering an experience that was more than just a story being told on the screen. in \"the revenant\" and \"birdman,\" the cinematography played a key role in creating a sense of realism and authenticity, which contributed to the films' critical and commercial success. it's safe to say that the cinematography was one of the major factors that contributed to the films' success and integral to their overall impact."
