  "content": "Congratulations on getting your nonprofit approved in Texas! Since you just recently incorporated your nonprofit, it may be a bit early to file your first annual report, as the report is typically due one year after your incorporation date.\n\nHowever, you can still submit an annual report if you would like to update any information that may have changed since your incorporation. It is always a good idea to ensure that your information with the Secretary of State is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nIf you choose to file an annual report early, keep in mind that you will still need to file an additional annual report in the future based on your anniversary date. You can file your annual report online through the Texas Secretary of State website or by mail.",
