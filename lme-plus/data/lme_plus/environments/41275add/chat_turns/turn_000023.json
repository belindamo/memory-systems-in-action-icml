I've got some fun ideas for you!\n\n1. **Scavenger Hunt**: Create a list of items that can be found in nature, such as leaves, rocks, feathers, or specific types of flowers. Divide the kids into teams and see who can find everything on the list first.\n2. **Outdoor Games**: Bring a portable badminton or cornhole set, or play classic games like tag, hide-and-seek, or capture the flag.\n3. **Nature Crafts**: Collect items like sticks, rocks, and leaves to create natural art or collages. You can also bring some sidewalk chalk for kids to draw on the pavement or a large piece of paper.\n4. **Treasure Hunt**: Hide small treats or toys around the picnic area and make a treasure map to help the kids find them.\n5. **Story Time**: Bring a blanket and have a family storytelling session. You can take turns telling stories, making up new ones, or acting out favorite books.\n6. **Picnic Bingo**: Create bingo cards with items commonly found at a picnic (e.g., food, drinks, blankets, etc.). Give each child a card and see who can mark off all their items first.\n7. **Nature Walk**: Take a short, guided walk around the picnic area to explore the surroundings, observe wildlife, and learn about local flora and fauna.\n8. **Kite Flying**: Bring kites or make your own using paper and sticks. This activity is perfect for a breezy day.\n9. **Food-themed Games**: Play \"I Spy\" with food items, have a snack-themed matching game, or set up a \"taste test\" station with different fruits or cheeses.\n10. **Photobooth**: Bring props like hats, sunglasses, and mustaches, and set up a fun photo booth area for kids to take silly pictures with the family.\n\nRemember to keep the activities simple, safe, and enjoyable for all ages. You can always adjust or combine these ideas to suit your family's preferences and abilities.\n\nWhich ones do you think your kids might enjoy the most?",
