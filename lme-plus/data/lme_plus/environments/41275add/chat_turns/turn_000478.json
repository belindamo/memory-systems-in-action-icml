Communicate openly: Schools should openly communicate with students and families about the event and ensure that all students are aware of the event's purpose, activities, and expectations.\n\n2. Involve students and families: School staff can involve students and families in planning and organizing the cultural event. This can help to ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of the school's diverse population.\n\n3. Create a welcoming environment: Schools should create an environment that is welcoming and inclusive by decorating the event space with flags or symbols of different cultures, making sure that all students have access to the activities, and providing materials in multiple languages.\n\n4. Provide support: Schools should provide support to students who may be experiencing anxiety or discomfort by having staff or volunteers available to answer questions or provide assistance as needed.\n\n5. Foster dialogue and respect: Schools can foster dialogue and mutual respect by encouraging students to share their experiences and perspectives with one another. This can help to build a sense of community and promote understanding and respect for different cultures and backgrounds.\n\nOverall, ensuring that students feel comfortable and included in cultural events requires open communication, involvement, support, and a welcoming and respectful environment.",
