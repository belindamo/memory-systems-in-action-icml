  "content": "The Herby Italian-Style Marinade will pair beautifully with a pasta shape that can hold onto the flavorful ingredients. Here are some Italian-style pasta shapes that would be perfect for your salad:\n\n1. **Penne**: A classic choice! Penne's tube shape and ridged texture make it an excellent candidate for holding onto the chunky ingredients like grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and crumbled goat cheese.\n2. **Fusilli**: This corkscrew-shaped pasta is another great option. The twisted shape allows the ingredients to get trapped inside, ensuring every bite is packed with flavor.\n3. **Farfalle**: Also known as bow-tie pasta, farfalle adds a touch of elegance to your salad. Its irregular shape and rough texture make it perfect for holding onto the herby chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and creamy goat cheese.\n4. **Rotini**: A spiral-shaped pasta, rotini is similar to fusilli but has a more delicate texture. It's a great choice if you want a slightly lighter, more refined pasta shape that still holds onto the flavors well.\n5. **Cavatappi**: This pasta shape is similar to penne but has a more rustic, homemade texture. It's a great choice if you want a heartier, more artisanal feel to your salad.\n\nAll of these pasta shapes will work beautifully with the Herby Italian-Style Marinade, grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and goat cheese. You can't go wrong with any of these options!\n\nIf you want to take your salad to the next level, consider adding some toasted pine nuts or chopped fresh parsley to add some crunch and freshness. A drizzle of a good olive oil and a sprinkle of salt will bring everything together.\n\nWhich pasta shape are you leaning towards, or do you have another favorite?",
