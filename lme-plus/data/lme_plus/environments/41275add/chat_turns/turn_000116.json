  "content": "Toasted pine nuts will be a fantastic addition to your salad! They'll add a delightful crunch, a nutty flavor, and a touch of sophistication to the dish. They'll also complement the herby chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and goat cheese beautifully.\n\nTo toast the pine nuts, simply preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast them for about 5-7 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning. Let them cool completely before adding them to the salad.\n\nWith the toasted pine nuts, you'll have a well-rounded and delicious salad that's perfect for a light lunch or dinner. The combination of flavors and textures will be amazing:\n\n* Herby chicken: savory, slightly herby\n* Sun-dried tomatoes: sweet, chewy\n* Goat cheese: tangy, creamy\n* Penne pasta: al dente, slightly firm\n* Roasted zucchini and bell peppers: tender, slightly caramelized\n* Toasted pine nuts: crunchy, nutty\n\nThe Classic Italian Vinaigrette will tie everything together nicely, and you'll have a salad that's sure to impress!\n\nI'm thrilled to have been able to help you with your salad creation. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your delicious salad and have a wonderful time sharing it with your loved ones!",
