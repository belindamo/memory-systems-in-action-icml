Set a reminder on your phone or calendar to start winding down at a specific time, e.g., 9:00 pm or 10:00 pm.\n2. Label the reminder as \"Wind Down Time\" or \"Bedtime Routine\".\n3. Customize the reminder to recur daily or on specific days of the week.\n\n**Option 2: Screen Time Limit**\n\n1. Set a screen time limit on your devices (e.g., phone, tablet, or computer) to restrict usage during your wind-down period.\n2. Use features like Apple's Screen Time or Android's Digital Wellbeing to set a \"Bedtime Mode\" or \"Wind Down\" period.\n3. This will remind you to put away your devices and start winding down.\n\n**Option 3: Alarm Clock App**\n\n1. Use an alarm clock app like Calm, Headspace, or Insight Timer that offers guided meditation and relaxation features.\n2. Set a reminder to start a wind-down session, such as a 10-20 minute meditation or relaxation exercise.\n3. Choose a soothing alarm sound or a gentle wake-up feature to signal the start of your wind-down time.\n\n**Option 4: Smart Speaker or Voice Assistant**\n\n1. Use a smart speaker like Amazon Echo or Google Home to set a reminder or routine.\n2. Say a command like: \"Alexa, remind me to wind down at 9:30 pm every night.\"\n3. You can also use voice assistants to play calming music or nature sounds to help you relax.\n\n**Option 5: Physical Reminder**\n\n1. Place a physical reminder, such as a sticky note or a reminder card, in a visible spot, like your bedside table or bathroom mirror.\n2. Write a gentle reminder, like \"Wind Down Time\" or \"Relax and Unwind\", to signal the start of your bedtime routine.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and you'll be more likely to establish a consistent wind-down routine and improve your sleep quality.",
