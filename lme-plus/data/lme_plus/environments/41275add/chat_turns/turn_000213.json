What is your bus route (approximate start and end points, or the route number)?\n2. Where do you plan to get off the bus to grab coffee (approximate location or intersection)?\n3. Are you open to walking a short distance to get to the coffee shop, or would you prefer one that's directly on your bus route?\n4. What type of coffee shop are you looking for (e.g. chain, independent, specialty coffee, quick grab-and-go)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized recommendations for coffee shops near your bus route!",
