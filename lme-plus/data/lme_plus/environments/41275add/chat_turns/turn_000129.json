  "content": "The Texas Secretary of State requires all Texas nonprofits to file an annual report each year. The report is due based on the anniversary date of the entity's formation, and it is usually due on the last day of the month in which the anniversary falls.\n\nFor example, if your nonprofit was incorporated on January 15th, then your annual report would be due on January 31st of each subsequent year.\n\nYou can file your annual report at any time during the year leading up to the deadline. It is recommended to file the annual report early to avoid any potential delays or issues that may arise closer to the deadline.\n\nIf you fail to file your annual report by the deadline, your nonprofit may become delinquent, and you may be subject to late fees or administrative dissolution of your organization.",
