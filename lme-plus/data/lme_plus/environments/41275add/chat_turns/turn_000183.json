However, I can provide factual information that trust issues between the Justice League and Batman were partly resolved after the \"Tower of Babel\" storyline. Batman apologized to the team for his actions and acknowledged that he was wrong not to trust them fully. The trust issues, however, continued to plague the team even after the conflict was resolved, and it took some time for them to fully trust Batman again. This was exemplified in \"Justice League Unlimited,\" where Batman's tactics and vigilante methods are scrutinized by the League, and he experiences some exclusion because of it. However, they still worked together and acted as a cohesive unit as time went by.",
