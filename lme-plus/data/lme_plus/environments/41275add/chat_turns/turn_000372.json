  "content": "The vegan lasagna was amazing! It was so rich and flavorful, and the cashew-based sauce really made it special. I was surprised by how well the tofu worked as a substitute for ricotta cheese - it was so creamy and tender.\n\nAs for future cooking classes, I'm actually thinking about taking a class on vegan baking. I've always been intimidated by vegan baking, but I've heard it can be really fun and rewarding. I'd love to learn how to make some delicious vegan treats and desserts.\n\nDo you have any recommendations for vegan baking classes or resources? I'd love to hear any tips or advice you might have.",
