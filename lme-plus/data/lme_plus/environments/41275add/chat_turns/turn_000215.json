However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time location data or specific bus routes. But I can offer some general suggestions on how to find a coffee shop near your bus route.\n\nHere are a few options:\n\n1. **Use online mapping tools**: Websites like Google Maps, Apple Maps, or Waze can help you find coffee shops near your bus route. Simply enter your bus stop location (Main St) and search for \"coffee shops near me\" or \"coffee shops near Main St.\" You can then filter the results by distance, rating, or hours of operation.\n2. **Check review websites**: Sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews can provide you with a list of top-rated coffee shops in your area. You can read reviews, check menus, and see photos to find a coffee shop that suits your taste.\n3. **Ask locals or coworkers**: Ask your friends, family, or coworkers who take the same bus route for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge on the best coffee shops in the area.\n4. **Look for coffee shops near your office**: Since you mentioned you get off at the Main St stop, which is a 5-minute walk from your office, you might want to explore coffee shops in the surrounding area. This way, you can grab a coffee and then head to work.\n\nSome popular coffee shop chains that might be near your bus route include:\n\n* Starbucks\n* The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf\n* Peet's Coffee\n* Dunkin' Donuts\n* Caribou Coffee\n\nKeep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, and you might find some amazing independent coffee shops in your area that are worth trying.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find a great coffee shop near your bus route!",
