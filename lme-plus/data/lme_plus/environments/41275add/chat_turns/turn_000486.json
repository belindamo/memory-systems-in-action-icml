  "content": "A new red dress from H&M and a new Urban Decay eyeshadow palette - sounds like the perfect excuse to get creative with your makeup look!\n\nSince you didn't specify the exact palette you got, I'll provide some general suggestions that would complement your red dress and can be adapted to most Urban Decay palettes. Feel free to share the specific palette name if you'd like more tailored advice!\n\nHere are three eyeshadow look ideas to get you started:\n\n**Look 1: Smoky Drama**\n\n* Use a light, shimmery beige or champagne shade all over your lid to act as a base.\n* Apply a medium to dark brown shade (e.g., from the Urban Decay \"Naked\" palette) on the outer corner of your eye, starting from the lash line and blending upwards and outwards to create a subtle smoky effect.\n* Line your upper lash line with a brown or black pencil and smudge it slightly to add depth.\n* Apply a pop of gold or copper shimmer on the inner corner of your eye to brighten up the look and complement the red dress.\n\n**Look 2: Warm Neutrals**\n\n* Start with a light, shimmery peach or coral shade all over your lid to match the warm tones of your red dress.\n* Apply a medium, warm brown shade (e.g., from the Urban Decay \"Heat\" palette) on the crease to add depth and dimension.\n* Use a darker, richer brown shade to define the outer corner of your eye, blending well to prevent harsh lines.\n* Line your upper lash line with a brown pencil and smudge it slightly to add warmth.\n\n**Look 3: Metallic Glam**\n\n* Apply a light, shimmery champagne or beige shade all over your lid to act as a base.\n* Use a metallic copper or bronze shade (e.g., from the Urban Decay \"Naked Heat\" palette) on the lid, starting from the lash line and blending upwards and outwards to create a bold, eye-catching look.\n* Apply a darker, richer brown shade on the outer corner of your eye to add depth and dimension.\n* Line your upper lash line with a black pencil and smudge it slightly to add drama.\n\nRemember to blend, blend, blend! Soft, seamless transitions between shades will make your look more polished and professional.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different shades and combinations to find the perfect look that makes you feel confident and beautiful in your new red dress!",
