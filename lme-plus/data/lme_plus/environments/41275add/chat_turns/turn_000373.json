The cashew-based sauce is definitely a game-changer, and it's great that you're experimenting with different ingredients and techniques.\n\nVegan baking can be a bit more challenging than traditional baking, but it's definitely worth the effort. With the right techniques and ingredients, you can create delicious and innovative vegan treats that are just as good as their non-vegan counterparts.\n\nIf you're interested in taking a vegan baking class, I'd recommend looking for classes that focus on plant-based ingredients and techniques. You might also want to consider classes that cover specific topics, such as vegan cake decorating or vegan pastry-making.\n\nAs for resources, there are many great vegan baking blogs and cookbooks out there that can provide you with inspiration and guidance. Some popular vegan baking blogs include Oh My Veggies, Vegan Richa, and The Full Helping. There are also many great vegan cookbooks, such as \"The Oh She Glows Cookbook\" by Angela Liddon and \"Isa Does It\" by Isa Chandra Moskowitz.\n\nOne tip I would offer is to start with simple recipes and gradually experiment with more complex techniques and ingredients. It's also important to understand the role of different ingredients in vegan baking, such as the importance of using high-quality plant-based milks and the role of leavening agents.\n\nAnother tip is to don't be afraid to experiment and try new things! Vegan baking can be a bit trial-and-error, but it's all part of the fun. And don't worry if your first attempts don't turn out perfectly - it's all about learning and improving with time.\n\nI hope these tips and resources are helpful, and I wish you the best of luck with your vegan baking journey!",
