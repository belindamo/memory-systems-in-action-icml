  "content": "Penne is a fantastic choice! It's a versatile pasta shape that pairs well with a variety of ingredients.\n\nRoasted vegetables are an excellent addition to your pasta salad! They'll add natural sweetness, texture, and depth of flavor. Here are some vegetables that would pair beautifully with the herby chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and goat cheese:\n\n1. **Zucchini**: A classic Italian favorite, zucchini roasts beautifully and adds a delicate flavor to the salad. Its mild taste won't overpower the other ingredients, and its tender texture will complement the al dente penne.\n2. **Bell Peppers**: Sweet or bell peppers add a pop of color and a bit of crunch to the salad. They'll absorb the herby flavors from the chicken and pair nicely with the tangy goat cheese.\n3. **Cherry Tomatoes**: Halved or quartered cherry tomatoes will add natural sweetness and a burst of juicy flavor to the salad. They'll also complement the sun-dried tomatoes nicely.\n4. **Eggplant**: Thinly sliced or cubed eggplant will add a meaty texture and a rich, slightly bitter flavor that will balance out the brightness of the goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes.\n5. **Asparagus**: Blanched or roasted asparagus can add a delightful freshness to the salad. Its subtle bitterness will cut through the richness of the goat cheese, and its crunchy texture will provide a nice contrast to the soft penne.\n6. **Red Onion**: Thinly sliced or caramelized red onion will add a sweet, savory flavor and a crunchy texture. It'll pair nicely with the herby chicken and the tangy goat cheese.\n\nRoasting the vegetables will bring out their natural sweetness and add depth to the salad. Simply toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until they're tender and lightly caramelized.\n\nFeel free to mix and match these vegetables to create a combination that you enjoy. You can't go wrong with a classic zucchini and bell pepper combo, but don't be afraid to experiment and find your favorite pairings!\n\nWhich vegetables are you most interested in adding to your pasta salad?",
