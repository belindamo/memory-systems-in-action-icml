  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. Not all of the examples I provided were under 18 at the time they made their contributions. Here are a few more examples of young women and girls throughout history who made significant contributions before the age of 18:\n\n1. Sacagawea (1788 CE - 1812 CE): a Shoshone woman who, at the age of 16, accompanied the Lewis and Clark expedition across the western United States. She acted as a guide and interpreter for the expedition.\n2. Mary Shelley (1797 CE - 1851 CE): an English writer who wrote the classic novel \"Frankenstein\" when she was just 18 years old.\n3. Anne Frank (1929 CE - 1945 CE): a young Jewish girl who wrote a diary while hiding with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Her diary has been translated into many languages and has become a powerful symbol of the human spirit in the face of oppression.\n4. Claudette Colvin (1939 CE - present): an American civil rights activist who, at the age of 15, refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, nine months before Rosa Parks' more famous act of civil disobedience.\n\nI hope this helps clarify my previous responses.",
