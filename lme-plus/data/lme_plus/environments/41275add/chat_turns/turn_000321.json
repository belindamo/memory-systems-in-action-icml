  "content": "* The path of the novel is a parallel history of the Modern Era.\n* The Good Soldier Schweik is perhaps the last great popular novel, it is a war novel whose action unfolds in the army and at the front, and it is also a comic novel.\n* War has become a paradox; in Schweik, there is no rational argument for war, it is only sheer force willing to assert itself.\n* In the Modern Era, rationality has corroded all inherited values, but just when reason wins a total victory, pure irrationality (force willing only its will) seizes the world stage.\n* Unity of mankind means no escape for anyone anywhere, and war embodies and guarantees this long-desired unity of mankind.\n* Husserl's lectures on the European crisis and on the possible disappearance of European mankind were his philosophical testament.\n* In the novels of Kafka, Hasek, Musil, Broch, the monster comes from outside and is called History; it is impersonal, uncontrollable, incalculable, incomprehensible, and inescapable.",
