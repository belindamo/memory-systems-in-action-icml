It's great that you appreciated the sense of community in the audience, too. That's something that's really special about live music - it has the power to bring people together and create a shared experience.\n\nI think that's one of the reasons why live music can be so inspiring. When you're surrounded by people who are all there for the same reason, it creates this collective energy that's hard to find elsewhere. And when the performer is as charismatic and talented as Billie Eilish, it's like the whole room is electric.\n\nIt's also great that you mentioned the sense of community in the audience. That's something that's really important, especially in today's world. Live music has a way of breaking down barriers and bringing people together, even if it's just for a few hours. It's a reminder that we're all connected, and that we can come together to celebrate our shared love of music.\n\nI think that's part of why you're drawn to jazz and funk, too. Those genres are all about community and collaboration, and they often have a strong sense of improvisation and spontaneity that creates a unique energy in the room. When you're watching a live jazz or funk performance, you can feel the musicians feeding off each other's energy and responding to the audience in real-time. It's a truly special experience.\n\nDo you think you'll continue to explore more live music experiences in the future? Are there any other artists or genres you're interested in checking out?",
