  "content": "That makes total sense! There's something truly special about the energy of live music, isn't there? It's like the performers are feeding off the audience's energy, and the audience is feeding off the performers' energy, creating this incredible feedback loop of excitement and enthusiasm.\n\nI think it's amazing that you've been to four concerts in the past three months - that's a great way to experience the energy of live music and get inspired by the performers' passion and talent. And now, you're looking to explore new genres and artists who can deliver that same level of energy and excitement. Jazz and funk are both genres that are particularly well-suited to live performance, with their emphasis on improvisation and groove.\n\nI'm sure you'll find that Snarky Puppy and Lettuce, as well as the other artists I mentioned, will deliver that same level of energy and excitement in their live performances. And who knows, you might even discover some new favorite artists or bands that you can see live in the future!\n\nDo you have a favorite concert or live music experience that stands out to you? Was there a particular moment or performance that really stuck with you?",
