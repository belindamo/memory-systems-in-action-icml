Yes, you can definitely fit in a 10-minute meditation session on Tuesdays and Thursdays, even with your early gym sessions. Here's a revised morning routine to help you make it work:\n\n**Tuesdays and Thursdays:**\n\n1. Wake up at 5:50 AM\n2. 10-minute meditation session (5:50 - 6:00 AM)\n\t* You can use a guided meditation app, focus on your breath, or simply sit comfortably with your eyes closed, focusing on the present moment.\n3. Get ready for the gym (6:00 - 6:20 AM)\n\t* Quickly get dressed, grab your gym bag, and prep for your workout.\n4. 45-minute gym session (6:20 - 7:05 AM)\n5. Shower and get ready for work (7:05 - 7:30 AM)\n6. Grab breakfast and head to the office (7:30 - 8:00 AM)\n\nOn other weekdays, when you don't have an early gym session, you can adjust your morning routine to fit in a longer meditation session or add other activities, like journaling or reading.\n\n**Tips to make it work:**\n\n1. **Set your meditation timer**: Use a timer to ensure you stick to your 10-minute meditation session.\n2. **Keep it simple**: Don't worry too much about the \"perfect\" meditation session. Focus on showing up and being consistent.\n3. **Make it a habit**: Try to meditate at the same time every day, even on weekends, to make it a consistent part of your routine.\n4. **Be kind to yourself**: If you miss a day or two, don't get discouraged. Simply acknowledge the thought and gently get back on track.\n5. **Adjust as needed**: If you find that you're consistently struggling to fit in meditation, consider adjusting your wake-up time or finding a shorter meditation routine that works for you.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make meditation a sustainable habit that brings you benefits and sets a positive tone for your day. Even 10 minutes can make a significant difference!",
