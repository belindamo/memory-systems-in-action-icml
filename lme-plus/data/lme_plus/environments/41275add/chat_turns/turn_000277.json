Otherwise, you can leave it blank or use a descriptive term like \"High Grade\" or \"Low Grade\".\n* **Notes**: This column is for any additional information you want to track, such as the comic book's significance, rare features, or any restoration work done.\n\nRemember to update the template regularly as your collection grows, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further assistance!",
