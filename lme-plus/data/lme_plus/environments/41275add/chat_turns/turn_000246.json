  "content": "I've been trying to get into meditation and mindfulness lately, but I've been having trouble fitting it into my morning routine. I usually wake up at 6:30 AM on weekdays, but on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I hit the gym before work, so I need to wake up at 5:50 AM to fit in a 45-minute workout. Do you think I could fit in a 10-minute meditation session and still make it to the office on time?",
