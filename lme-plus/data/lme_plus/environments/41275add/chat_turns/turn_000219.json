Consider factors like:\n\t* Getting dressed\n\t* Brushing your teeth and washing your face\n\t* Having a quick breakfast (if you plan to eat at home)\n\t* Packing any essentials like your lunch, water bottle, or bag\n2. **Getting coffee**: You want to grab a coffee on the way to the bus stop. Assume it'll take around 15-20 minutes to get your coffee, depending on the shop's busyness and how complicated your order is.\n3. **Walking to the bus stop**: You mentioned it's a short walk from the coffee shop to the bus stop. Let's assume it takes around 5-10 minutes to get to the bus stop from the coffee shop.\n4. **Bus arrival**: The bus arrives at 7:45 am, so you'll want to be at the bus stop a few minutes early to ensure you get a good seat.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here's a suggested morning routine:\n\n* **Wake-up time**: 6:45 am - 7:00 am\n\t+ This gives you around 45-60 minutes to get ready, which should be plenty of time for most people.\n* **Leave for coffee**: 7:15 am - 7:20 am\n\t+ This allows for a 15-20 minute coffee break, plus some buffer time in case the coffee shop is busy.\n* **Leave for bus stop**: 7:35 am - 7:40 am\n\t+ This gives you 5-10 minutes to walk to the bus stop and grab a good spot before the bus arrives.\n\nOf course, feel free to adjust this routine to suit your individual needs and preferences. If you're not a morning person, you might want to wake up a bit earlier to give yourself more time to get ready. Alternatively, if you're a quick-get-ready kind of person, you might be able to wake up a bit later.\n\nRemember to also consider any potential variables, such as:\n\n* Traffic or road closures that might affect your walk to the bus stop\n* Long lines at the coffee shop\n* Inclement weather that might slow you down\n\nBy planning your morning routine, you can minimize stress and ensure you arrive at the office feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the day!",
