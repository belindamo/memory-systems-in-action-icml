Joan of Arc (1412 CE - 1431 CE): a French heroine who led the French army to several victories during the Hundred Years' War. She was captured and executed by the English for heresy at the age of 19.\n2. Artemisia I of Caria (fl. 480 BCE): a queen of Caria who fought alongside the Persians against the Greeks in the Battle of Salamis. She was the only female commander in the Persian navy and is said to have personally sunk several Greek ships.\n3. Pocahontas (1596 CE - 1617 CE): a Native American woman who played a critical role in the early history of the English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. She was a diplomat and peacemaker between the English colonists and her own people, the Powhatan.\n4. Mary Jones (1784 CE - 1864 CE): a Welsh girl who, at the age of 16, walked 25 miles to purchase a copy of the Bible in Welsh. Her journey inspired the founding of the British and Foreign Bible Society, which sought to make the Bible available in many languages.\n5. Mirabai (1498 CE - 1547 CE): a medieval Indian poet and mystic who composed devotional poetry in the Bhakti tradition. Her work has had a lasting impact on Indian literature and religion.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are certainly many more young women and girls throughout history who made important contributions.",
