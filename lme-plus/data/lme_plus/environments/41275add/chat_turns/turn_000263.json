While June is considered the start of summer in San Francisco, the city's proximity to the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Strait means it can still experience some rain showers. However, June is actually one of the driest months in San Francisco, with an average of only 1.1 inches (28 mm) of rainfall.\n\nYou might encounter some light drizzle or fog, but it's unlikely to be a heavy downpour. That being said, it's always a good idea to pack a lightweight, compact umbrella or rain jacket, just in case. You can always use it as a windbreaker or a sunshade if it doesn't rain.\n\nIf you do decide to pack an umbrella, consider a compact, travel-friendly option that won't take up too much space in your luggage. You can also look into packing a waterproof or water-resistant jacket or windbreaker, which can serve multiple purposes.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here's a rough breakdown of the average rainfall in San Francisco during June:\n\n* Average number of rainy days: 4-5 days\n* Average amount of rainfall: 1.1 inches (28 mm)\n* Chance of precipitation: 15-20%\n\nSo, while it's possible you might encounter some rain, it's unlikely to be a major concern. But, as they say, \"April showers bring May flowers, and June... well, June brings a few occasional drizzles!\"\n\nPack light, be prepared, and you'll be all set for a fantastic trip to San Francisco!",
