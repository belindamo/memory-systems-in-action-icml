  "content": "I apologize if my previous responses gave the impression that only European or American young women and girls have made significant contributions throughout history. That was not my intention. Here are a few examples of young women and girls from other cultures who made important contributions before the age of 18:\n\n1. Hatshepsut (1508 BCE - 1458 BCE): an Egyptian pharaoh who, at the age of 12, was married to her half-brother and future pharaoh Thutmose II. She later became one of the most successful pharaohs in Egyptian history, ruling as a regent for her stepson and eventually taking the throne herself.\n2. Khutulun (1260 CE - 1306 CE): a Mongolian princess and wrestler who, at the age of 16, challenged all suitors to a wrestling match and defeated them all. She later became a skilled warrior and commander in her father's army.\n3. Joan of Arc (1412 CE - 1431 CE): a French heroine who led the French army to several victories during the Hundred Years' War. She was captured and executed by the English for heresy at the age of 19.\n4. Lakshmi Bai (1828 CE - 1858 CE): a queen of the Maratha-ruled princely state of Jhansi in northern India who, at the age of 18, led her army into battle against the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n5. Tomoe Gozen (12th century CE): a female samurai who served in the Japanese Genpei War. She was known for her bravery and martial prowess on the battlefield.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many more young women and girls from diverse cultures throughout history who have made significant contributions before the age of 18.",
