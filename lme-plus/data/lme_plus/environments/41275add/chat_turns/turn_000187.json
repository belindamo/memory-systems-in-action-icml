  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot suggest what the Justice League should or should not do. However, contingency plans are a common practice in many organizations as a way of preparing for emergencies or unforeseen circumstances. The Justice League, being a team of superheroes with different abilities, might benefit from having contingency plans to deal with potential threats, especially when facing powerful villains or significant dangers.\n\nOn the other hand, implementing such plans might still raise trust issues if done without the knowledge and consent of every member of the team. Whether or not contingency plans should be part of the team's overall strategy depends on their effectiveness and the team's consensus about how they should be utilized. Ultimately, it is up to the Justice League members to decide whether implementing contingency plans is necessary or not, and they should ensure that it fosters collaboration and trust among their members.",
