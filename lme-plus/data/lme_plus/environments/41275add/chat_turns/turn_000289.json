I'd be happy to help you with a delicious recipe.\n\nHere's a tried-and-true chicken pot pie recipe that's sure to become a favorite:\n\n**Classic Chicken Pot Pie Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the filling:\n\n* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 medium onion, diced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced\n* 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1 1/2 cups chicken broth\n* 1/2 cup heavy cream\n* 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\nFor the crust:\n\n* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n* 1/4 cup ice-cold water\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and potatoes. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.\n3. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes.\n4. Sprinkle the flour over the chicken and vegetables, and cook for 1 minute.\n5. Gradually pour in the chicken broth and heavy cream, whisking continuously. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Season with thyme, salt, and pepper.\n6. To make the crust, combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the cold butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n7. Gradually add the ice-cold water, stirring with a fork until the dough comes together in a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n8. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Transfer the dough to a 9x13-inch baking dish.\n9. Pour the chicken and vegetable mixture into the dough-lined baking dish.\n10. Roll out the remaining dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Use this dough to cover the filling, pressing the edges to seal. Crimp the edges to form a decorative border.\n11. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.\n12. Brush the top crust with a little bit of milk or beaten egg for a golden glaze.\n13. Bake the pie for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is hot and bubbly.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use leftover roasted chicken or turkey if you have it on hand.\n* Add some frozen peas and carrots for extra color and flavor.\n* Use puff pastry instead of homemade crust for a flaky, buttery crust.\n* Make individual mini pies for a fun and easy dinner party.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe!
