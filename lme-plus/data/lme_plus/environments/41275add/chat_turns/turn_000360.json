I'll start with stream-of-consciousness writing and see how it goes. I'll also try to explore different formats and prompts to keep things interesting. Thanks for the tips and guidance!\n\nNow, I think I'll go ahead and start my journaling journey. I'll make sure to be patient and kind to myself throughout the process.",
