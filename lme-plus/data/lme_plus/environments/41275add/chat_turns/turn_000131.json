  "content": "In Texas, the annual report is the primary method for updating the Secretary of State with changes to your nonprofit's Board of Directors and officers. However, you can also file an Amended Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State if you need to make changes to your nonprofit's governing documents or if you want to add or remove directors or officers.\n\nTo file an Amended Certificate of Formation, you will need to submit a completed and signed form to the Secretary of State along with any required fees. The form should include the changes that you are making, such as the addition or removal of directors or officers.\n\nKeep in mind that filing an Amended Certificate of Formation can be a more time-consuming and expensive process than filing an annual report. Therefore, it's generally recommended that you only file an Amended Certificate of Formation if you need to make significant changes to your nonprofit's governance structure.",
