  "content": "The typical vaccination schedule for horses can vary depending on factors like age, health status, and geographic location. However, here's a general outline of the core vaccinations recommended by the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP):\n\n**Core Vaccinations:**\n\n1. **Eastern and Western Encephalomyelitis (EEE and WEE)**: Vaccinate annually, typically in the spring, to protect against these deadly mosquito-borne diseases.\n2. **Tetanus**: Vaccinate annually, or every 5-7 years if the horse has a robust immune response.\n3. **West Nile Virus (WNV)**: Vaccinate annually, typically in the spring, to protect against this mosquito-borne disease.\n\n**Risk-Based Vaccinations:**\n\n1. **Influenza**: Vaccinate annually, or bi-annually, if the horse is at high risk (e.g., competing, traveling, or in a high-density population).\n2. **Rabies**: Vaccinate annually, or every 3 years, depending on local regulations and risk factors.\n3. **Strangles**: Vaccinate annually, or bi-annually, if the horse is at high risk (e.g., young, in a high-density population, or with a history of the disease).\n\n**Foals and Young Horses:**\n\n1. **Initial Vaccination Series**: Foals typically receive their first vaccinations at 6-8 weeks of age, followed by boosters at 10-12 weeks, and again at 14-16 weeks.\n2. **Boosters**: Young horses may require additional boosters until they reach 1-2 years of age, depending on the specific vaccine and risk factors.\n\n**Consult Your Veterinarian:**\n\nRemember, this is a general outline, and your veterinarian may recommend a customized vaccination schedule based on your horse's individual needs, age, health status, and local disease risks. Be sure to consult with your veterinarian to determine the best vaccination schedule for your horse.\n\nMark your calendar for next month, and schedule those vaccinations to keep your horses protected!",
