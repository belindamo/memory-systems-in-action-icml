However, it can be assumed that the quotes chosen are typically those that are most interesting, insightful, or revealing about the actor or show being discussed. The quotes may also be chosen based on the relevance to the current storyline or upcoming plot twists. Additionally, the quotes may be selected based on the level of interest from the publication's readership or the popularity of the show overall.",
