They would then measure the seed germination rate for each group and analyze the data to determine if there is a significant difference in germination rate based on the type of soil and light exposure. This type of design would allow the researchers to determine the independent and combined effects of each factor on seed germination."

They would then measure the customer purchase behavior for each group and analyze the data to determine if there is a significant difference in purchase behavior based on the advertising type and promotional offer.

Another real-life example of a 2-factor, 2-level DOE experiment could be a study to determine the impact of two production variables on the yield of a chemical reaction:\n\nFactor 1: Temperature (Level 1: 50\u00b0C, Level 2: 60\u00b0C)\nFactor 2: Agitation rate (Level 1: 100 RPM, Level 2: 200 RPM)\n\nIn this experiment, the researchers would conduct a series of trials where they would randomly assign each combination of temperature and agitation rate to a batch of the reaction mixture. They would then measure the yield of the product for each batch and analyze the data to determine if there is a significant difference in yield based on the temperature and agitation rate. This type of design would allow the researchers to determine the independent and combined effects of each factor on the yield of the chemical reaction."
