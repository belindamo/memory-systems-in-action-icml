If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\n65 No provision of the Contract prevented the Council from suing Beckhaus for damages for breach of contract under common law; but that is not to say that, simply by reason of a failure, by the date for practical completion, to complete the work to the standard required, the Council would be entitled to damages for defective or incomplete work.\n66 An important part of the Council\u2019s case at trial was that Beckhaus at no stage achieved practical completion of either Separable Portion A or B. Master Macready upheld this assertion and, for reasons that I later set out, I have come to the same conclusion.\n67 Accordingly, as at the judgment date, the Council rightly denied that practical completion had been achieved. But, it continued - at that stage - to hold Beckhaus to its contractual obligations to perform the work. Thus, on the Council\u2019s contention, at the date of judgment, the work remained in Beckhaus\u2019 possession; the Council, in effect, having refused to accept possession.\n68 While, on this assumption (the Contract still being on foot), the Council may have been entitled to claim damages for delay arising out of Beckhaus\u2019 failure to achieve practical completion by the date for practical completion, it could not sue Beckhaus for defective or incomplete work. As long as the Council maintained that the Contract was alive and had not been terminated, and held Beckhaus to its obligation to complete the work in accordance with the specification, on its contention the work remained lawfully in Beckhaus\u2019 possession. In other words, it was an inevitable incident of the Council\u2019s argument that the work had not been delivered to and accepted by the Council (Beckhaus \u2013 on the Council\u2019s argument \u2013 being in possession of and obliged to complete the work). While the work was in Beckhaus\u2019 possession, the Council suffered no loss by reason of defective or incomplete work; the work, not being in the Council\u2019s possession, did not at that stage form part of its patrimony.\n69 This situation would have changed when the Contract was terminated. When that occurred, the work (in its defective and incomplete state) was handed over to the Council. At that stage, the Council suffered loss by being in possession of defective and incomplete work."

Mr Christie\u2019s concession was rightly made; the conclusion that the parties agreed, by their conduct, to terminate the Contract was inevitable. I shall set out a brief summary of the facts relevant to this issue.\n71 On 18 March 2002 Beckhaus claimed that it had achieved practical completion and requested the superintendent to issue a certificate to that effect. The superintendent failed to do so and requested Beckhaus to produce various test certificates. Beckhaus gave the superintendent certain test results (but not all that had been requested) and on 26 April 2002 submitted progress claim No 7. The superintendent did not issue a certificate of practical completion and, on 27 April 2002, Beckhaus removed its major plant from the site.\n72 On 22 May 2002 Beckhaus served a notice of intention to suspend work pursuant to s 15(2)(b) of the Act. On 27 May 2002 Beckhaus suspended work in reliance on s 27 of the Act for failure to pay progress claim No 7. On 22 August 2003 Beckhaus wrote to the Council asserting that the Contract had not been terminated and was still in existence (this appears to have been an attempted forensic tactic, rather than a step connected to reality).\n73 From the time that Beckhaus left the site, the attitudes of the parties began to harden and, in my opinion, by no later than 15 March 2004 \u2013 when the trial commenced - both parties tacitly accepted that the Contract was at an end. Beckhaus contended that it might have come to an end earlier but this issue depends on a factual inquiry that was not properly investigated at the trial and cannot be determined by this Court. The actual commencement of the hearing of lengthy and expensive litigation, directed to a final resolution of the parties\u2019 rights, was conduct by both parties manifesting an intention wholly inconsistent with any continuing obligation of performance on either side.\n74 Master Macready considered the issue of termination on the assumption that the parties had agreed to rescind the contract ab initio. It is open, however, to parties to a contract to agree that the contract is to be terminated on the basis that there is a mutual release from future performance only and that rights accrued to the date of termination will remain of full force and effect. See, for example, CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1995) 8 ANZ Ins Cases 61-232 at 75-594 per Powell JA (and as to abandonment, generally, see Ryder v Frohlich [2004] NSWCA 472 per McColl JA).\n75 In any event, the issue is now concluded by reason of the Council\u2019s late concession that the Contract was terminated by agreement on the latter basis."
