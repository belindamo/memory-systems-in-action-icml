      "content": "The section describes the design of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that aims to stabilize the system towards a specific equilibrium point denoted by (\u0304u,\ud835\udf12,y), where \u0304u is a control input, \ud835\udf12 is the state, and y is the output. The controller achieves this objective by suitably acting on the control input u while taking advantage of the LSTM network as a prediction model for the system.\n\nThe MPC scheme solves an optimization problem at each sampling time k with the objective of minimizing a cost function J(U(k)) subject to constraints that the control input remains within a bound and the predicted states follow the system dynamics. The future state predictions, \ud835\udf12(k+i), with i \u2208 {1,...,N}, are obtained by iterating the LSTM model (4) starting from the current state estimated by the state observer (19), that is, \ud835\udf12(k)=\u0302\ud835\udf12(k).\n\nThe cost function is a quadratic function of the predicted states and control inputs, with tuning parameters Q, R, and P. Matrix P is chosen to satisfy the Lyapunov condition under the assumption that \ud835\udf0c(A\ud835\udeff)<1, where A\ud835\udeff is the discretized system matrix, and q is the spectral radius of matrix Q. The control input applied to the system is only the first element of the optimal control sequence U(k|k) obtained from solving the optimization problem, according to the Receding Horizon principle.\n\nTheorem 4 guarantees the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point (\u0304u,\ud835\udf12,y) under the proposed control law. The stability analysis relies on the assumption that the plant behaves according to the system model (4) with \ud835\udf0c(A\ud835\udeff)<1 and the state observer satisfies certain conditions."

      "content": "Sure! MPC stands for Model Predictive Control, which is a control strategy that uses a model of the system to make predictions about its future behavior. The idea is to solve an optimization problem at each time step, which tells the controller what actions to take over a short period of time (called the prediction horizon) to achieve a desired objective, such as stabilizing the system or following a trajectory.\n\nIn this paper, the MPC scheme uses an LSTM network as the prediction model of the system. The objective is to stabilize the system towards a specific equilibrium point by acting on the control input. The optimization problem consists of finding the sequence of future control moves that minimizes a cost function while satisfying constraints on the control input and the state of the system. The cost function includes terms that penalize deviations from the desired state, as well as a term that penalizes changes in the control input.\n\nAt each time step, the optimization problem is solved to obtain the sequence of future control moves. However, only the first control move is applied to the system, and the optimization problem is solved again at the next time step using the updated state of the system as the initial condition. This is known as the receding horizon principle.\n\nThe theoretical result (Theorem 4) shows that if the assumptions are satisfied, then the proposed control law will asymptotically stabilize the system towards the desired equilibrium point."

The researchers propose a DRL algorithm that learns to optimize the energy consumption of a multi-zone HVAC system while ensuring occupant comfort. The algorithm uses a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn an optimal control policy from a state-action value function. The researchers use a simulation environment to test the algorithm and compare its performance to other control strategies. They show that the DRL algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of energy consumption and occupant comfort. The article concludes that DRL can be an effective method for controlling HVAC systems in buildings."
