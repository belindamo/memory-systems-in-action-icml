  "content": "Exciting! I'd be happy to help you with that! However, to provide you with accurate information, I'll need to know a bit more about your location and the time of year. Warbler species and their migrations vary greatly depending on the region and season.\n\nCould you please tell me:\n\n1. Where are you located (state/province, country)?\n2. What time of year is your birding trip (month, season)?\n3. Is this a spring or fall migration period for your location?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can give you a better idea of which warbler species you might expect to see during your trip to the nature reserve!",
