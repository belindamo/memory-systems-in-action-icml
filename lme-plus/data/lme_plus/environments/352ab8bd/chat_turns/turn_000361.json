  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences but I can suggest some tips to remember to say affirmations every day:\n\n1. Put reminders in your phone or calendar: Set a daily reminder at a specific time of day to say your affirmations. Choose a time when you can take a few moments to focus on yourself and your mindset.\n\n2. Stick notes: Write down your favorite affirmations and post them in places where you will see them throughout the day, such as your bathroom mirror, on your computer or on the refrigerator.\n\n3. Use affirmations during your daily routine: Incorporate saying your affirmations into your daily routine. For instance, you could recite them while brushing your teeth, taking a shower or driving to work.\n\n4. Find a partner: Find a friend or family member who is also interested in improving their own self-esteem and practice your affirmations together.\n\n5. Create a gratitude journal: At the end of each day, write down what you are grateful for and include a few affirmations as part of your daily routine.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a way that works best for you and to make it a habit by doing it every day.",
