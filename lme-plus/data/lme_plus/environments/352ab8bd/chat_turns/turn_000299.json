Onesie cookies and baby carrot sticks with hummus are perfect for a baby-themed party and will surely be a hit with both kids and adults.\n\nFor games and activities suitable for kids aged 2-5 years old, here are some ideas:\n\n**Games:**\n\n1. **Baby Toy Hunt**: Hide baby toys or soft blocks around the party area and have the kids search for them.\n2. **Pin the Pacifier on the Baby**: A baby-themed spin on the classic game. Create a large picture of a baby, and have the kids take turns blindfolded and try to pin a pacifier on the baby's mouth.\n3. **Baby Bottle Feed**: Fill small bottles with water or juice, and have the kids take turns feeding a doll or stuffed animal.\n4. **Musical Baby Bottles**: Play a baby-themed version of musical chairs. Use baby bottles instead of chairs, and have the kids walk around the bottles until the music stops.\n\n**Activities:**\n\n1. **Baby Station Play**: Set up a play area with baby dolls, playpens, and baby toys. Let the kids take turns playing and caring for the dolls.\n2. **Sensory Bin**: Create a sensory bin filled with rice, beans, or sand and add small baby toys or other objects for the kids to discover and explore.\n3. **Baby Book Nook**: Set up a cozy area with baby books and stuffed animals. Let the kids sit and read or look at the books together.\n4. **Baby Craft Station**: Provide a craft station where kids can make their own baby-themed crafts, such as onesie decorating, baby block painting, or making baby-themed cards.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Keep the games and activities short and simple, as young children may have short attention spans.\n* Ensure the activities are safe and age-appropriate for the children attending the party.\n* Consider having a few adults or volunteers to supervise and assist with the games and activities.\n* Make sure to have a designated area for kids to play and relax, and provide comfortable seating for caregivers to supervise.\n\nThese games and activities should be enjoyable for kids aged 2-5 years old and fit well with the baby theme. Have fun planning, and I'm sure the kids will have a blast!",
