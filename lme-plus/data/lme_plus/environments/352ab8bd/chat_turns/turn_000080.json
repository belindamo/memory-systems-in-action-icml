Losing a charger can be frustrating, so it's wonderful that they were able to hold it for you until you returned. That's excellent customer service!\n\nRegarding the air conditioning, I can understand how that can be a bit of an issue. It's always a delicate balance between keeping the room cool and comfortable, and not making it too cold. I'm sure the hotel would appreciate your feedback on this, and it might help them adjust their HVAC settings for future guests.\n\nIt's great that you had a generally positive experience at the Hilton Chicago, despite being busy with your conference. If you have any other feedback or suggestions, I'm sure they would be happy to hear them.\n\nBy the way, have you thought about exploring any of Chicago's neighborhoods during your upcoming trip? Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Logan Square are all vibrant areas with unique shops, restaurants, and bars. You could also consider taking a stroll along the 606, an elevated trail built on an old rail line, which offers a great perspective on the city.\n\nWhat are your plans for this trip? Are you looking forward to exploring any specific attractions or areas of the city?",
