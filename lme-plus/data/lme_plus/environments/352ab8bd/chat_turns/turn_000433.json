Here are some tips to help you use lavender in baking:\n\n1. **Choose the right type of lavender**: For baking, you'll want to use English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) or sweet lavender (Lavandula latifolia). They have a more delicate flavor and aroma compared to other varieties.\n2. **Use dried lavender buds**: Fresh lavender can be overpowering, so it's best to use dried lavender buds. You can find them at most craft stores, spice shops, or online.\n3. **Use a light hand**: Lavender can be potent, so start with a small amount and adjust to taste. A good rule of thumb is to use 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of dried lavender buds per recipe.\n4. **Infuse the flavor**: To release the flavor and aroma of lavender, you'll need to infuse it in a liquid. This can be done by:\n\t* Steeping the lavender buds in hot water or milk to make a tea.\n\t* Mixing the lavender buds with sugar to create a lavender sugar (let it sit for a few hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld).\n\t* Adding the lavender buds to a mixture of cream, butter, or oil to infuse the flavor.\n5. **Strain the mixture**: Before using the lavender-infused liquid, strain it to remove the buds. You can use a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to do this.\n6. **Pair lavender with complementary flavors**: Lavender pairs well with citrus (like lemon), honey, and creamy ingredients like cream, butter, or mascarpone.\n7. **Taste as you go**: Lavender can be a bit unpredictable, so taste your mixture as you go and adjust the amount of lavender to your liking.\n\nFor the Lemon Lavender Panna Cotta recipe, you can infuse the heavy cream with lavender by steeping 1/4 teaspoon of dried lavender buds in 1 cup of heavy cream for 10-15 minutes. Strain the mixture and discard the lavender buds before using the cream in the recipe.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Lemon Lavender Panna Cotta with Honey-Glazed Pistachios**\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the panna cotta:\n\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1/4 teaspoon dried lavender buds\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup whole milk\n* 1/4 cup lemon juice\n* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* Salt to taste\n\nFor the honey-glazed pistachios:\n\n* 1/2 cup pistachios\n* 2 tablespoons honey\n* Salt to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Infuse the heavy cream with lavender as described above.\n2. In a medium saucepan, combine the lavender-infused cream, sugar, milk, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Heat until the sugar dissolves.\n3. Pour the mixture into individual serving cups or a large baking dish. Refrigerate until set, about 4-6 hours.\n4. For the honey-glazed pistachios, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Toss the pistachios with honey and salt until coated. Spread on a baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly toasted.\n5. Serve the panna cotta chilled, topped with honey-glazed pistachios and a sprinkle of lavender buds, if desired.\n\nI hope this helps!
