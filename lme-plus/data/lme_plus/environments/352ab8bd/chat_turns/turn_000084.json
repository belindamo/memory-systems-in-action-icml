You'll get to see an incredible array of artifacts, including mummies, sarcophagi, temple reliefs, and even a recreated ancient Egyptian tomb.\n\nOne of the highlights of the collection is the Tomb of Unis-Ankh, a 4,500-year-old tomb that was reconstructed in the museum. You'll feel like you're walking through an ancient Egyptian tomb, complete with intricate hieroglyphics and reliefs.\n\nAnd, of course, you can't miss the museum's star attraction: the mummy of Tutankhamun's sister, Ankhesenamun.
