Here are some tips to help you store dried lavender buds:\n\n1. **Airtight container**: Store dried lavender buds in an airtight container, such as a glass jar or airtight tin, to prevent air from entering and causing the lavender to lose its potency.\n2. **Cool, dark place**: Keep the container in a cool, dark place, like a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing lavender near direct sunlight, heat sources, or humid areas, as it can cause the lavender to degrade.\n3. **Protect from light**: Light can cause lavender to lose its color and flavor. If you need to store lavender in a clear container, wrap the container in paper or cloth to block out light.\n4. **Keep it dry**: Moisture can cause lavender to become stale or develop off-flavors. Ensure the container is completely dry before storing the lavender buds.\n5. **Freeze for long-term storage**: If you plan to store dried lavender buds for an extended period (more than 6 months), consider freezing them.
