I'd be happy to help you with some fun game and activity suggestions that are suitable for a mixed group of adults and kids.\n\nBefore we dive into the party ideas, congratulations to Sarah on her second pregnancy! March 15th is just around the corner; I'm sure she must be excited to meet her new bundle of joy.\n\nNow, let's get to the party planning! Here are some fun games and activities that you might consider:\n\n**Games:**\n\n1. **Baby Bingo**: Create bingo cards with baby-related items like diapers, pacifiers, baby blocks, and toys. As guests mingle, they need to find someone who has brought each item and get them to sign the corresponding square.\n2. **Guess the Baby Food**: Prepare several different baby foods, such as applesauce or carrots, and store them in identical containers. Have guests taste and guess the flavors.\n3. **Pin the Pacifier on the Baby**: A baby-themed spin on the classic game. Create a large picture of a baby, and have guests take turns blindfolded and try to pin a pacifier on the baby's mouth.\n4. **Baby Shower Charades**: Write down different baby-related words or phrases (e.g., \"changing a diaper,\" \"rocking a baby to sleep\") on slips of paper, and have guests act them out for the others to guess.\n\n**Activities:**\n\n1. **Baby Advice Station**: Set up a station where guests can write down their best baby advice or tips on cards for the expecting parents. Collect the cards and create a keepsake book for each expecting parent.\n2. **Onesie Decorating**: Provide onesies, fabric paint, and other craft supplies, and let guests get creative with their designs. This can be a fun activity for kids and adults alike!\n3. **Baby Trivia**: Prepare a quiz with questions related to babies and parenting. You can include questions about baby development, parenting tips, and more.\n4. **Kids' Play Area**: Set up a designated play area with soft toys, playmats, and other baby-friendly activities to keep the little ones entertained while their parents socialize.\n\n**Food and Drinks:**\n\n1. **Baby Bottle Refreshments**: Serve drinks in baby bottles or sippy cups for a fun twist.\n2. **Baby-Themed Treats**: Offer baby-themed snacks like \"baby carrots\" (carrot sticks with hummus), \"onesie cookies,\" or \"baby block\" sandwiches.\n3. **Cake and Cupcake Decorating**: Provide plain cupcakes or a large cake, and let guests decorate them with baby-themed toppers, candies, and icing.\n\nRemember to keep the games and activities simple, safe, and enjoyable for everyone involved. With these ideas, you'll have a fun and memorable baby-themed party that celebrates the joys of parenthood!",
