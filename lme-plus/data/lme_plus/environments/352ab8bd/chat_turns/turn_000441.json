  "content": "Toasting pecans for 6 minutes will give them a lovely flavor and texture.\n\nAs for the sugar content, I completely understand. Reducing the sugar in banana bread is a great way to balance out the natural sweetness of the bananas. Here's a rough estimate of sugar reduction you can try:\n\n**Original recipe:** 1 cup granulated sugar\n**Reduced sugar:** 3/4 cup granulated sugar (or even 2/3 cup if you prefer it even less sweet)\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a rough estimate, and you can adjust the sugar content to your taste preferences. If you're unsure, start with the reduced amount and add more sugar to taste.\n\nRemember, the type of sugar you use can also affect the flavor and sweetness of your banana bread. You can try using a combination of white and brown sugar or even honey or maple syrup to add a deeper flavor profile.\n\nNow, go ahead and get baking! Your banana bread with toasted pecans and reduced sugar is going to be amazing!",
