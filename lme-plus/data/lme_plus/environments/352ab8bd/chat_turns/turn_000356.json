If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe agreed termination of the Contract\n70 When Mr Christie eventually accepted that the Contract had been terminated by tacit agreement, the Council thereby, in effect, conceded the point made by Beckhaus\u2019 notice of contention (although the date of termination was left open). Mr Christie\u2019s concession was rightly made; the conclusion that the parties agreed, by their conduct, to terminate the Contract was inevitable. I shall set out a brief summary of the facts relevant to this issue.\n71 On 18 March 2002 Beckhaus claimed that it had achieved practical completion and requested the superintendent to issue a certificate to that effect. The superintendent failed to do so and requested Beckhaus to produce various test certificates. Beckhaus gave the superintendent certain test results (but not all that had been requested) and on 26 April 2002 submitted progress claim No 7. The superintendent did not issue a certificate of practical completion and, on 27 April 2002, Beckhaus removed its major plant from the site.\n72 On 22 May 2002 Beckhaus served a notice of intention to suspend work pursuant to s 15(2)(b) of the Act. On 27 May 2002 Beckhaus suspended work in reliance on s 27 of the Act for failure to pay progress claim No 7. On 22 August 2003 Beckhaus wrote to the Council asserting that the Contract had not been terminated and was still in existence (this appears to have been an attempted forensic tactic, rather than a step connected to reality).\n73 From the time that Beckhaus left the site, the attitudes of the parties began to harden and, in my opinion, by no later than 15 March 2004 \u2013 when the trial commenced - both parties tacitly accepted that the Contract was at an end. Beckhaus contended that it might have come to an end earlier but this issue depends on a factual inquiry that was not properly investigated at the trial and cannot be determined by this Court. The actual commencement of the hearing of lengthy and expensive litigation, directed to a final resolution of the parties\u2019 rights, was conduct by both parties manifesting an intention wholly inconsistent with any continuing obligation of performance on either side.\n74 Master Macready considered the issue of termination on the assumption that the parties had agreed to rescind the contract ab initio. It is open, however, to parties to a contract to agree that the contract is to be terminated on the basis that there is a mutual release from future performance only and that rights accrued to the date of termination will remain of full force and effect. See, for example, CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1995) 8 ANZ Ins Cases 61-232 at 75-594 per Powell JA (and as to abandonment, generally, see Ryder v Frohlich [2004] NSWCA 472 per McColl JA).\n75 In any event, the issue is now concluded by reason of the Council\u2019s late concession that the Contract was terminated by agreement on the latter basis.",
