Here are some tips on how to toast nuts for baking:\n\n**Why toast nuts?**\n\n Toasting nuts can:\n\n* Enhance their flavor and aroma\n* Improve their texture, making them crunchier or chewier\n* Bring out their natural oils, which can add moisture and flavor to your baked goods\n* Help them brown more evenly in the oven\n\n**How to toast nuts:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven**: Set your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n2. **Spread the nuts**: Spread the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. You can use a parchment-lined sheet or a silicone mat to prevent the nuts from sticking.\n3. **Toast in small batches**: Toasting nuts in small batches ensures they cook evenly. Divide the nuts into batches if you're using a large quantity.\n4. **Toast for 5-10 minutes**: Toast the nuts for 5-10 minutes, or until they reach your desired level of toasting. Stir the nuts halfway through the toasting time to ensure even browning.\n5. **Check for doneness**: Check the nuts frequently to avoid over-toasting. They're done when they're lightly browned and fragrant.\n\n**Toasting times for common nuts:**\n\n* Almonds: 5-7 minutes\n* Walnuts: 7-10 minutes\n* Pecans: 5-8 minutes\n* Hazelnuts: 10-12 minutes\n\n**Tips for toasting nuts:**\n\n* Keep an eye on the nuts while they're toasting, as they can quickly go from perfectly toasted to burnt.\n* If you're toasting nuts for a recipe, it's better to err on the side of under-toasting than over-toasting. You can always toast them a bit longer if needed.\n* Toasted nuts can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.\n\nFor your banana bread, you can toast the walnuts or pecans for 5-7 minutes, or until they're lightly browned and fragrant. Chop them coarsely and add them to your banana bread recipe.\n\nNow, you're all set to add some delicious toasted nuts to your banana bread!",
