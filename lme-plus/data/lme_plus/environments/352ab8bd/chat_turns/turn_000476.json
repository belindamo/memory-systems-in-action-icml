  "content": "A real-life example of another 2-factor, 2-level DOE experiment could be a study to determine the impact of two marketing strategies on customer purchase behavior:\n\nFactor 1: Advertising Type (Level 1: Television, Level 2: Social Media)\nFactor 2: Promotional Offer (Level 1: Discount, Level 2: Free Gift)\n\nIn this experiment, the researchers would conduct a series of trials where they would randomly assign each combination of advertising type and promotional offer to a group of customers. They would then measure the customer purchase behavior for each group and analyze the data to determine if there is a significant difference in purchase behavior based on the advertising type and promotional offer. This type of design would allow the researchers to determine the independent and combined effects of each factor on customer purchase behavior.",
