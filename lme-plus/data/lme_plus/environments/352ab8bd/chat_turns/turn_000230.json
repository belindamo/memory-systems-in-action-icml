Set the title as \"Game Night\" or something similar.\n4. Set the date and time to every Thursday at 8:00 pm.\n5. Choose the frequency as \"weekly\" or \"every Thursday\".\n6. Add any additional details, such as the location or a brief description.\n7. Save the event.\n\n**Method 2: Using a Reminders App**\n\n1. Open your reminders app (e.g., Reminders on iOS, Google Keep on Android) on your phone.\n2. Create a new reminder.\n3. Set the title as \"Game Night\" or something similar.\n4.
