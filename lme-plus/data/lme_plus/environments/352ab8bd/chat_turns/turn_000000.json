  "content": "This section discusses the design of a predictive control scheme that takes advantage of the LSTM network (4) as a pre-diction model of the system. The objective of the controller is to stabilize the system toward a generic equilibrium pointdenoted by the triplet(\u0304u,\ud835\udf12,y)(where\u0304u\u2208\ue241and\ud835\udf12=[xT\ud835\udf09T]T) by suitably acting on the control inputu.Letusdefine\u0394=[||x\u2212x||||\ud835\udf09\u2212\ud835\udf09||]\u2208R2.(26)The MPC scheme consists of solving, at each sampling timek, the following optimization problemminU(k)J(U(k)),s.t.u(k+i)\u2208\ue241fori\u2208{0,...,N\u22121},\ud835\udf12(k+i)=f(\ud835\udf12(k),u(k))fori\u2208{1,...,N},(27)TERZI et al.8883wheref(\ud835\udf12,u)is defined by the model dynamics (4a) and (4b), andU(k)=[u(k)...u(k+N\u22121) ]Tis the sequence of futurecontrol moves, which are bounded as in (5), consistently with Assumption 1. The terms\ud835\udf12(k+i),withi\u2208{1,...,N}, arethefuturestatepredictionsfromthecurrenttimeinstanttothepredictionhorizonN.Thesetermsareobtainedbyiterating(4) starting from the current state estimated by the state observer (19), that is,\ud835\udf12(k)=\u0302\ud835\udf12(k). The cost function reads asJ(U(k)) =N\u22121\u2211i=0(||\ud835\udf12(k+i)\u2212\ud835\udf12||2Q+||u(k+i)\u2212\u0304u||2R)+||\u0394(k+N)||2P.(28)MatricesQ\u227b0andR\u227b0 are tuning parameters, and matrixP\u227b0\u2208R2\u00d72satisfies the Lyapunov condition\u2014under theassumption that\ud835\udf0c(A\ud835\udeff)<1:AT\ud835\udeffPA\ud835\udeff\u2212P+qI2\u227a0,(29)whereq=\ud835\udf0c(Q). At time stepk, the solution to the optimization problem is termedU(k|k)=[u(k|k)T...u(k+N\u22121|k)T]T.Only its first element is applied to the system according to the Receding Horizon principle, that is,u(k)=u(k|k).(30)The following result holds, ensuring asymptotic stability of the equilibrium(\u0304u,\ud835\udf12,y)under the proposed control law (30).Theorem 4.If the plant behaves according to (4) with\ud835\udf0c(A\ud835\udeff)<1, the state observer (19) is designed so as to fulfill Theorem3, for example, by means of Proposition 3, then(\u0304u,\ud835\udf12,y)is an asymptotically stable equilibrium under the contr",
