Identifying those potential distractions and schedule disruptions is a great starting point.\n\nSocial media and YouTube can be significant time-suckers, especially if you're not intentional about how you use them. One strategy to consider is setting specific times for social media and YouTube breaks throughout the day. For example, you might allow yourself 15-30 minutes of social media or YouTube time during your lunch break or after you've completed a specific task.\n\nRegarding the meeting that ran longer than expected, it's essential to build some buffer time into your schedule to accommodate unexpected delays or overruns. This will help you avoid feeling frazzled and stressed when things don't go according to plan.\n\nAs you keep your time log, pay attention to how you're using your time before and after meetings. Are you using that time to prep for the meeting, or are you getting sidetracked by other tasks or distractions? Are there ways you can optimize your meeting prep or follow-up to make the most of your time?\n\nRemember, the goal of time tracking is not to be perfect or to create more stress; it's to gain insights and make intentional decisions about how you want to use your time.\n\nHere's a question to consider as you track your time: What are your top three priorities for the day, and are you allocating your time accordingly?\n\nKeep in mind that it might take a few days to get into the habit of tracking your time, but it'll be worth it in the long run. You'll gain a better understanding of your habits, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies to optimize your time management.\n\nHow do you feel about setting specific goals or targets for your time management improvements? Would you like to discuss some potential goals or targets to work towards?",
