  "content": "The paper presents Algorithm 1, which is a policy gradient algorithm for training an RNN policy network. The algorithm takes as input the initial policy parameters, learning rate, update rule, the number of episodes, and the number of epochs. The algorithm updates the policy weights by collecting data from K trajectories with T time steps in Step 1. In Step 2, the policy weights are updated using a policy gradient estimate, and in Step 3, the algorithm either terminates or returns to Step 1. The algorithm is designed to find the optimal policy for a given task.",
