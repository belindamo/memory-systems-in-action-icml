  "content": "Sure, here are some examples of what the color tokens for the tints of the Purple color palette could be:\n\n$gds-color-purple-50 = #E8D8FF\n$gds-color-purple-75 = #D2B9FF\n$gds-color-purple-100 = #BC99FF\n\nTo achieve the lighter shades while keeping the color vibrancy, we can decrease the saturation and increase the lightness of the colors. You can also use color adjusting tools such as color picker to adjust the tints.\n\nPlease note that the color values provided here are just examples, and the actual values may vary depending on the specific design system and branding guidelines.",
