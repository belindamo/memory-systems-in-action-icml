I currently have a 20-gallon tank with some neon tetras, guppies, and a Corydoras catfish. I'm thinking of upgrading to a larger tank in the future, maybe a 55-gallon one, which would give me more options for species selection. What are some good fish species that are suitable for a 55-gallon tank?",
