However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal space, so I can't provide specific recommendations for a nursery near you or see your living room layout.\n\nBut I can offer general advice and suggestions!\n\n**Finding a nursery with succulents:**\n\n1. Online search: Type \"nurseries near me\" or \"succulent nurseries near me\" in a search engine like Google, and it should show you a list of nearby options.\n2. Check online marketplaces: Websites like Yelp, Google Maps, or Facebook can help you find nurseries in your area and read reviews from other customers.\n3. Ask friends or family: Ask your friends, family, or coworkers if they know of any good nurseries that sell succulents.\n4. Check social media: Many nurseries have social media accounts where they showcase their products and share updates. Look for hashtags related to succulents or nurseries in your area.\n\n**Styling your shelves:**\n\n1. **Start with a theme:** Decide on a style or theme for your shelves, such as minimalist, bohemian, or modern. This will help you choose the right decor and arrangement.\n2. **Group similar items together:** Grouping similar items, like vases, books, or decorative objects, can create a visually appealing display.\n3. **Balance and symmetry:** Balance the weight and visual appeal of the items on your shelves by distributing them evenly. You can create symmetry by placing similar items on either side of a central point.\n4. **Add some greenery:** Succulents are a great addition to any shelf! Choose a few small pots or planters and arrange them among your decor.\n5. **Experiment and have fun:** Don't be afraid to try out different arrangements and see what works best for you.\n\n**Your living room layout:**\n\nI'm glad to hear that flipping the couch to the other wall has made a positive impact on your living room! Sometimes, a simple change can make a big difference in the overall feel of a space.\n\nIf you'd like more specific advice on styling your shelves or rearranging your living room, feel free to provide more details about your space, and I'll do my best to offer suggestions!",
