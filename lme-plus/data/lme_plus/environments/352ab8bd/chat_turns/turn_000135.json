  "content": "world scenarios.\n\nTypos\n-----\n\n* None identified.\n\nScore\n-----\n\nI would rate this submission as a weak accept, with a score of 6 out of 10. While the proposed framework presents some improvements in the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in online domain adaptation, these improvements are modest and do not fully justify the complexity of the proposed approach. Additionally, the relevance of the problem addressed in the submission is questionable, as real-time domain adaptation is not a practical concern in most deployment scenarios.\n\nReviewer Confidence\n-------------------\n\nI have a low to medium confidence in my review, as I am not an expert in the field of online domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. However, based on the provided information, the proposed framework presents some improvements in the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, but these improvements are limited and do not fully justify the complexity of the proposed approach.",
