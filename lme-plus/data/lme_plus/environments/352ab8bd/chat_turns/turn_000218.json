  "content": "Traditional costumes in the Caucasus region, including those in Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, have undergone a variety of changes over time. During the Soviet era, for example, traditional dress in the region was discouraged, and people were encouraged to adopt a more \"modern\" style of dress.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, there has been a renewed interest in traditional dress, and efforts have been made to preserve and promote traditional costume. However, many traditional garments have been lost or altered over time, and it can be challenging to recreate them with the same level of craftsmanship and detail as in the past.\n\nIn some cases, traditional costumes have also been influenced by outside sources. For example, Georgian dress has been influenced by Persian and Ottoman styles, while Azerbaijani dress has been influenced by Russian and Turkish styles.\n\nDespite these changes, traditional costumes remain an important part of cultural identity in the Caucasus region, and efforts are being made to preserve and pass on these traditions to future generations.",
