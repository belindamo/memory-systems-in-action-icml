If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\n65 No provision of the Contract prevented the Council from suing Beckhaus for damages for breach of contract under common law; but that is not to say that, simply by reason of a failure, by the date for practical completion, to complete the work to the standard required, the Council would be entitled to damages for defective or incomplete work.\n66 An important part of the Council\u2019s case at trial was that Beckhaus at no stage achieved practical completion of either Separable Portion A or B. Master Macready upheld this assertion and, for reasons that I later set out, I have come to the same conclusion.\n67 Accordingly, as at the judgment date, the Council rightly denied that practical completion had been achieved. But, it continued - at that stage - to hold Beckhaus to its contractual obligations to perform the work. Thus, on the Council\u2019s contention, at the date of judgment, the work remained in Beckhaus\u2019 possession; the Council, in effect, having refused to accept possession.\n68 While, on this assumption (the Contract still being on foot), the Council may have been entitled to claim damages for delay arising out of Beckhaus\u2019 failure to achieve practical completion by the date for practical completion, it could not sue Beckhaus for defective or incomplete work. As long as the Council maintained that the Contract was alive and had not been terminated, and held Beckhaus to its obligation to complete the work in accordance with the specification, on its contention the work remained lawfully in Beckhaus\u2019 possession. In other words, it was an inevitable incident of the Council\u2019s argument that the work had not been delivered to and accepted by the Council (Beckhaus \u2013 on the Council\u2019s argument \u2013 being in possession of and obliged to complete the work). While the work was in Beckhaus\u2019 possession, the Council suffered no loss by reason of defective or incomplete work; the work, not being in the Council\u2019s possession, did not at that stage form part of its patrimony.\n69 This situation would have changed when the Contract was terminated. When that occurred, the work (in its defective and incomplete state) was handed over to the Council. At that stage, the Council suffered loss by being in possession of defective and incomplete work.",
