  "content": "I've been thinking about organizing my pantry for a while now. I've heard that it's a good idea to store food items by category, like all the grains together, all the canned goods together, and so on. But I'm not sure how to implement that in my pantry. Can you give me some more specific advice on how to categorize and store my food items? For example, should I store all the pasta together, or separate the different types of pasta into different containers? And what about snacks, like nuts and dried fruits? Should I store them together or separate them into different categories?",
