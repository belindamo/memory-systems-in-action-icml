By the way, I even received an email from the event organizers saying that I qualified for the \"Golden Gear\" award, which is given to novice drivers who demonstrate exceptional improvement over the course of the event. Do you have any tips on how to continue improving my skills and shaving off precious seconds from my lap times?",
