Oral traditions and storytelling are seen as a way of passing on knowledge and wisdom from one generation to the next.\n\nIn Malawian culture, storytelling is often used as a means of educating the young on the importance of traditional values and culture. Through stories, children learn about the ancestors and the cultural practices that have been passed down through generations.\n\nOral traditions and storytelling are also used to entertain people in Malawi. Stories are a form of relaxation and provide a means of escapism from the daily struggles of life. They are often told during festivals, celebrations or other occasions where people gather to socialize, making storytelling an important part of Malawi's cultural fabric.\n\nMoreover, storytelling has also helped to preserve the language in Malawi. Malawians have many languages, and storytelling helps to preserve their linguistic diversity. Through storytelling, a language can continue to exist even though it may not be widely spoken or used in everyday life.\n\nIn conclusion, storytelling and oral traditions are important components of Malawian culture, helping to pass on knowledge, traditions, and cultural practices, and preserving the language and cultural heritage of the people.",
