  "content": "Yes, another example of a movie where sound editing enhances the tension in the climax is the 2020 thriller movie \"The Invisible Man.\" Towards the end of the movie, the protagonist Cecilia is being stalked by the titular antagonist, who is invisible. In this scene, the sound design is used to great effect to heighten the tension and create a sense of paranoia. The sound of breaths and footsteps, shifting furniture and doors opening and closing, all contribute to the sense of the invisible threat lurking nearby. There are also moments of silence, which adds a lot to the tension because it makes every small sound more significant. The sound editing in this scene is incredibly effective in creating an atmosphere of dread and constantly ratcheting up the tension until the shocking climax.",
