There's this one move called the \"Azonto bump\" that I've been trying to master - it's all about the hip movement and isolations. I've also been working on my polyrhythms, trying to get my arms and legs to move independently to the different drum patterns. It's not easy, but it's so much fun to challenge myself and see improvement over time."

It's incredible how the drum patterns can create a sense of tension and release, and how the polyrhythms can add complexity and depth to the music.\n\nIt's great that you're enjoying the process of learning and challenging yourself. That's what dance is all about \u2013 the journey, not the destination. Seeing improvement over time is the best motivator, and it's amazing how far you can go with consistent practice and dedication.\n\nHave you had a chance to perform or dance with a group while learning Azonto? Dancing with others can be a great way to learn from each other, get feedback, and improve your skills. Plus, it's always more fun to dance with a community of like-minded people!\n\nAlso, have you explored the cultural significance of Azonto and its origins in Ghana? Understanding the history and context of the dance style can add a deeper layer of appreciation and meaning to your practice."
