The first and second three months are during the spring semester when the student is taking a full load of 15-18 credits. The third three months are during the summer when the student may not have any classes or only part-time classes. The fourth three months are during the fall semester when the student is taking a full load of 15-18 credits again. The plan is still broken down into four segments with specific actions to be taken in each segment, but the timeline is adjusted to fit the academic schedule and account for potential differences in workload during the summer.",
