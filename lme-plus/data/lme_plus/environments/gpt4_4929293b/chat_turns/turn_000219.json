  "content": "It is possible for Curation Engine to create and use its own blockchain for certain purposes, such as storing and tracking metadata about virtual exhibits, or enabling users to securely and transparently buy, sell, and trade virtual assets. However, doing so would require significant technical expertise and resources, and would also introduce additional complexity and costs for the platform.\n\nAlternatively, Curation Engine could integrate with existing blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum or EOS, to access their features and capabilities without the need to develop and maintain its own blockchain. This approach would be less complex and costly, but would also limit the platform's flexibility and control over the blockchain-based features and capabilities it offers. Ultimately, the decision to create and use its own blockchain would depend on the specific goals and requirements of Curation Engine, and the tradeoffs and risks involved in doing so.",
