  "content": "I actually just watched the Taylor Swift documentary on Netflix and it was really interesting. It gave me a new perspective on her songwriting process and the music industry as a whole. I've also been keeping up with \"All Songs Considered\" and \"How I Built This\", which often feature interviews with musicians and entrepreneurs in the music industry. I find it fascinating to learn about the business side of music and how artists navigate the industry.",
