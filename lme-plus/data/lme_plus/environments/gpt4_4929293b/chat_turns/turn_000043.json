  "content": "Cooking the chili in advance and refrigerating or freezing it can actually help the flavors meld together even better.\n\n**Refrigerating:**\n\n* Let the chili cool completely to room temperature to prevent bacterial growth.\n* Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days.\n* Reheat the chili gently over low-medium heat, whisking occasionally, until warmed through.\n\n**Freezing:**\n\n* Let the chili cool completely to room temperature.\n* Transfer the chili to an airtight, freezer-safe container or freezer bag, making sure to remove as much air as possible before sealing.\n* Label and date the container/bag.\n* Store in the freezer for up to 3-4 months.\n* When you're ready to eat it, thaw the chili overnight in the refrigerator or reheat it from frozen in the Instant Pot or on the stovetop.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* If you're freezing the chili, it's best to under-season it slightly, as the flavors can become more concentrated during the freezing process. You can always add more seasonings when you reheat it.\n* When reheating frozen chili, you may need to add a bit more broth or water to achieve the desired consistency.\n* Cooked chili can also be portioned into individual servings and frozen for convenient lunches or dinners.\n\nNow, go ahead and cook that chili, and enjoy it whenever you're ready!",
