  "content": "Dear [Name],\n\nI wanted to take a moment to provide feedback on your performance as a Junior 3D Artist. While I recognize your efforts, I must say that I have some concerns about your work. Your performance rating for this evaluation period is low, and there are a few areas where you need improvement.\n\nFirstly, your art fundamentals require attention. Improving your color theory, composition, lighting, and texturing skills are essential for your role as a 3D artist. You can focus on studying the basics, practicing different techniques, and seeking feedback from senior artists to improve your skill set.\n\nSecondly, I have noticed that you struggle with understanding feedback. As a junior artist, it's essential to be open to constructive criticism and use it to improve your work. Please demonstrate a willingness to learn and implement feedback received.\n\nThirdly, I believe that you need to increase your velocity in completing assigned tasks. Prioritizing your workload and delivering quality work within the given deadlines is crucial. If there are any delays, please communicate with your supervisor and provide reasonable solutions to complete the work.\n\nAdditionally, it would be great if you could demonstrate autonomy in your work. Taking ownership of your assigned tasks and working independently is an essential skill. You should be proactive in seeking assistance and resources needed to complete your work, and produce quality work under minimal supervision.\n\nFinally, your communication skills need improvement. Effective communication with your colleagues, superiors, and clients is crucial. Please demonstrate active listening skills, clarity in your communication, and ask relevant questions to ensure you understand the task requirements.\n\nIn summary, I believe you have the potential to improve in all areas identified above. Please be open to feedback and actively work on improving your skills. Focus on building a strong foundation of art fundamentals, increasing your velocity in completing tasks, demonstrating autonomy in your work, and improving your communication skills.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]",
