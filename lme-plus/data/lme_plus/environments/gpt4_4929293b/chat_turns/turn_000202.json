  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot provide personal opinions or justify societal discrimination. However, historically, discrimination against women in the fishing industry was often based on traditional gender roles and stereotypes that women were better suited for household tasks and men were better suited for physically demanding tasks such as fishing. Additionally, access to capital and resources needed to enter the fishing industry was often controlled by men, making it difficult for women to break into the industry. These societal attitudes and norms contributed to the discrimination against women in the fishing industry, especially as official fish harvesters. Such discrimination is now recognized as unacceptable and efforts are being made to promote gender equality in the industry.",
