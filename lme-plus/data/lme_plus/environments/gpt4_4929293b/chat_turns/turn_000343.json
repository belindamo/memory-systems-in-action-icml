By the way, I was thinking of buying a new pair of jeans from Madewell - I've been eyeing their new summer collection and I think I'll pick up a few pieces. I've also been wanting to try out their personalized denim service where they embroider your name or initials on the jeans. That would make for a really cool and unique gift for my sister's birthday which is coming up in July.",
