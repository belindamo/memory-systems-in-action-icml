  "content": "The audiobook version of \"Something from the Nightside\" is a great way to experience the series, especially with your daily commute. The narrator, John Lee, does an excellent job of bringing the characters and world to life.\n\nYou're making great progress on \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" too! You're almost at the finish line. I'm sure you'll enjoy the rest of the book, and I'm curious to know your thoughts on the ending.\n\nAs you start the Nightside series, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the world-building, characters, and story. Feel free to reach out to me anytime for discussions or recommendations. I'm always here to chat about books!\n\nRemember, the Nightside series is a wild ride, and John Taylor's adventures can be quite unpredictable. Be prepared for a lot of twists and turns, and don't be surprised if you find yourself binge-listening to the audiobooks.\n\nHappy reading and listening!",
