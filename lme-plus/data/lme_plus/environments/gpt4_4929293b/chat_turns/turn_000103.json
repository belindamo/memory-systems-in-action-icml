It's like they say, \"The days are long, but the years are short.\"\n\nI'm sure it's hard to believe that your niece is already finished with kindergarten! It's a big milestone, and I'm sure she's grown so much over the past few years. You must be so proud of her!\n\nIt's great that you have fond memories of her early days, like holding her in your arms at the hospital. Those are special moments to treasure, and it's wonderful that you're still so close to her.\n\nAs she grows older, I'm sure you'll continue to cherish the time you spend with her and create many more wonderful memories together. And who knows, before you know it, you'll be attending her high school graduation!\n\nBut for now, let's focus on celebrating her kindergarten graduation and making more happy memories with her. I'm sure she's thrilled to have such a loving and supportive family behind her.\n\nHow about we get back to planning your BBQ? Do you need any more help with the menu, decorations, or games?",
