  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer, but historically, women's work in the fishing industry was often overlooked and undervalued due to gender norms and stereotypes. They were seen as better suited to domestic roles and their contributions to the industry were not recognized or compensated.\n\nMoreover, the legislative frameworks in many countries did not consider women's contributions to the fishing industry, and this contributed to their exclusion from official recognition and participation in the industry. In addition, access to capital and resources necessary for entering the industry was often controlled by men, making it difficult for women to break into the profession.\n\nAs society has changed and greater awareness has been placed on the issue, women's contributions to the fishing industry have come to light and policies have been put in place to promote greater gender equality. However, it is essential to recognize that achieving gender equality is an ongoing process and requires continued efforts to overcome the cultural biases that have existed for centuries.",
