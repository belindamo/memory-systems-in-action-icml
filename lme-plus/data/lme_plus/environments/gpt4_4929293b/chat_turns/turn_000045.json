  "content": "You can definitely use frozen ground beef in this recipe. In fact, frozen ground beef can be a convenient and cost-effective option. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n**Thawing frozen ground beef:**\n\n* You can thaw the frozen ground beef in the refrigerator overnight or thaw it quickly by submerging the package in cold water.\n\n**Cooking frozen ground beef in the Instant Pot:**\n\n* When cooking frozen ground beef in the Instant Pot, it's essential to break it up into small pieces as it cooks to prevent large clumps from forming. You can do this by using a spoon or spatula to break up the meat as it cooks.\n* Cooking time might be slightly longer than with fresh ground beef, as the frozen meat will need to thaw and cook through. Just keep an eye on the chili's progress and adjust the cooking time as needed.\n\n**Some things to consider:**\n\n* Frozen ground beef can be more prone to drying out than fresh ground beef, so make sure to not overcook the chili. Check the meat's texture and adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n* If you're using a lower-quality frozen ground beef, it might have a higher water content, which can affect the overall consistency of the chili. You can try to cook off some of the excess moisture by browning the meat longer or adding less broth to the recipe.\n\nIn general, using frozen ground beef will still result in a delicious and flavorful chili. Just be prepared for a slightly different texture and cooking time. Happy cooking!",
