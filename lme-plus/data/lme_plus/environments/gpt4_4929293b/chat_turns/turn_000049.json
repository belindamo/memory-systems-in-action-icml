Here's a simple recipe for Instant Pot No-Knead Bread:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n* 1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast\n* 1 cup water\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, sugar, and yeast.\n2. Add water to the dry ingredients and mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let the dough rest for 10-15 minutes.\n4. Place the dough in a greased Instant Pot stainless steel insert or a silicone bread pan.\n5. Add 1 cup of water to the Instant Pot and place the insert or bread pan inside.\n6. Close the lid and make sure the valve is set to \"Sealing\".\n7. Press the \"Yogurt\" button or \"Manual\" mode and set the cooking time to 30 minutes at high pressure.\n8. Let the pressure release naturally for 10-15 minutes, then quick-release any remaining pressure.\n9. Remove the bread from the Instant Pot and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing.\n\nThat's it! You'll have a delicious, crusty bread to enjoy with your chili. This recipe makes a small to medium-sized loaf, perfect for a weeknight dinner.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a high-quality all-purpose flour for the best results.\n* Make sure the yeast is active and not expired.\n* Don't overmix the dough, as it can lead to a dense bread.\n* If you prefer a crisper crust, you can broil the bread for 2-3 minutes after it's cooled slightly.\n\nHappy baking, and I hope you enjoy your chili and freshly baked bread together!",
