  "content": "The climb to the top of the staircase at the Dolmen de San Juan de Gaztelugatxe consists of 241 steps, and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. Although it's not an extremely strenuous climb, it may be challenging for people with mobility issues or those who are not used to physical activity. However, there are several rest stops along the way that provide visitors with stunning views of the surroundings and plenty of opportunities to rest and catch their breath.\n\nChildren, elderly people, and those with mobility issues may find the climb to the top of the staircase challenging. Nevertheless, there is a shuttle service available that takes visitors to the halfway point, which may be a good option for those who are unable to do the entire climb. Overall, it's recommended that visitors wear comfortable shoes and bring water to stay hydrated during the climb.",
