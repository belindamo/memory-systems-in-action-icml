  "content": "I'm considering adding a floor lamp with a warm, soft glow to create a cozy atmosphere. I also want to incorporate some textiles like throws and pillows in soft, calming colors. I'm thinking of using a comfortable, oversized armchair with a matching ottoman to create a snug and inviting space. And, of course, I'll add some plants to bring in a touch of nature. Do you have any recommendations for plants that are low-maintenance and suitable for a bedroom?",
