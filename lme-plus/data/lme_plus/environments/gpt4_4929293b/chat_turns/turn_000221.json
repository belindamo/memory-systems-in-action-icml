  "content": "It is not possible to provide a complete Ruby code sample for creating a blockchain solution for Curation Engine from scratch within the scope of this conversation. Developing a blockchain-based solution for Curation Engine would require significant technical expertise and knowledge of blockchain technology, as well as a detailed understanding of the specific requirements and goals of the platform.\n\nHowever, as a general starting point, the following Ruby code sample illustrates how a simple blockchain class could be defined, with methods for adding new blocks to the chain, verifying the integrity of the chain, and printing the contents of the chain to the console:\n```\nclass Blockchain\n  # Initialize the blockchain with the first \"genesis\" block\n  def initialize\n    @chain = [genesis_block]\n  end\n\n  # Add a new block to the end of the chain\n  def add_block(data)\n    last_block = @chain[-1]\n    new_block = Block.new(last_block.index + 1, last_block.hash, data)\n    @chain << new_block\n  end\n\n  # Verify that the chain is valid and has not been tampered with\n  def valid?\n    @chain.each_cons(2) do |prev_block, block|\n      return false unless block.valid?(prev_block)\n    end\n    true\n  end\n\n  # Print the contents of the entire chain to the console\n  def print_chain\n    @chain.each do |block|\n      puts block\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  # Define the first \"genesis\" block in the chain\n  def genesis_block\n    Block.new(0, \"0\" * 64, \"Genesis block\")\n  end\nend\n```\nThis code sample defines a `Blockchain` class, with methods for adding new blocks to the chain, verifying its integrity, and printing its contents. It also includes a private `genesis_block` method for defining the first block in the chain, known as the \"genesis\" block.\n\nNote that this code sample is intended only as a starting point, and would need to be extended and modified to meet the specific requirements and goals of Curation Engine and its blockchain-based features and capabilities.",
