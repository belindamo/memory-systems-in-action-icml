That's fantastic motivation to keep going!\n\nRegarding your practice schedule, both short intervals with breaks and one long practice session have their benefits. It ultimately depends on your personal learning style, schedule, and goals. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to help you decide:\n\n**Short intervals with breaks:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Improved retention**: Breaking practice into shorter sessions with breaks can help solidify information in your long-term memory.\n2. **Reduced burnout**: Shorter sessions can prevent mental and physical fatigue, making practice feel less overwhelming.\n3. **Increased frequency**: You can practice more frequently, even if it's just for a short time, which can lead to consistent progress.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Lack of depth**: Short sessions might not allow for in-depth exploration of a piece or technique.\n2. **Inconsistent focus**: You might struggle to maintain focus and intensity throughout multiple short sessions.\n\n**One long practice session:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **In-depth exploration**: Longer sessions allow for more thorough practice and exploration of complex pieces or techniques.\n2. **Improved focus**: You can maintain focus and intensity for a longer period, leading to more productive practice.\n3. **Better flow**: Longer sessions can help you get into a flow state, where you're fully engaged and immersed in the music.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Burnout and fatigue**: Long practice sessions can lead to mental and physical exhaustion, especially for beginners.\n2. **Inconsistent practice**: If you only practice once a day, you might not practice at all on busy days.\n\nConsider a **hybrid approach**:\n\n1. **Warm-up and cool-down**: Start with a 5-10 minute warm-up session to get your hands and mind ready, followed by a 10-20 minute focused practice session.\n2. **Short sessions with a long session**: Alternate between short daily sessions (10-15 minutes) and one longer session (30-45 minutes) on the weekends or days off.\n3. **Practice in focused chunks**: Divide your practice into focused chunks, like 20 minutes of technique practice, followed by 10-15 minutes of repertoire practice, and finally 10-15 minutes of sight-reading or exploration.\n\nExperiment with different approaches to find what works best for you. If you're struggling to practice daily, start with 3-4 times a week and gradually increase frequency. Remember, consistency is key, but it's also important to listen to your body and mind.\n\nHow do you think you might incorporate a hybrid approach into your practice routine?",
