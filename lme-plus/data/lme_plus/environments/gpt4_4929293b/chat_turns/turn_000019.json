Encore! is a great show, and I think you'll really enjoy it.\n\nAs for American Horror Story, the new season, titled American Horror Story: Double Feature, is set to premiere on August 25, 2021, on FX. The season will consist of 10 episodes, and it's been reported that the story will be split into two separate tales, with the first five episodes focusing on one story and the remaining five episodes telling a different story.\n\nThe theme and plot details are still largely under wraps, but the title \"Double Feature\" suggests that the season might explore two distinct horror stories, possibly with different settings, characters, and tones. Ryan Murphy, the creator of the series, has hinted that the season will be inspired by classic horror movies and will feature a mix of old and new characters.\n\nMark your calendars for August 25, and get ready for another terrifying ride with American Horror Story!",
