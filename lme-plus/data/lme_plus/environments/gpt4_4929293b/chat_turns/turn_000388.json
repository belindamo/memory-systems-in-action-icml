  "content": "Adding more tankmates to distract the platies is an excellent idea! Harlequin rasboras (Trigonostigma heteromorpha) and lemon tetras (Hyphessobrycon citrinus) are both excellent choices for this purpose. Here's why:\n\n* **Harlequin rasboras**: These peaceful, active swimmers are easy to care for and can thrive in a community tank. They're also very tolerant of changes in water conditions, making them a great addition to a tank with platies. Rasboras are shoaling fish, so a small school of 6-10 would be ideal.\n* **Lemon tetras**: Like harlequin rasboras, lemon tetras are active, peaceful, and easy to care for. They're also very fast swimmers, which can help distract the platies from nipping the neon tetras. A school of 6-10 lemon tetras would be a great addition to your tank.\n\nOther fish that could work well as dither fish to distract the platies include:\n\n* **Zebra danios** (Danio rerio): These active, hardy fish are easy to care for and can tolerate a range of water conditions. They're also very fast swimmers, making them a great choice to distract platies.\n* **Corydoras catfish** (Corydoras spp.): While catfish are bottom-dwellers, they can still help distract platies from nipping the neon tetras. Corydoras are peaceful, small, and easy to care for, making them a great addition to a community tank.\n* **Dwarf gouramis** (Colisa spp.): Some species of dwarf gouramis, like the honey gourami (Colisa chuna) or the sparkling gourami (Colisa lalia), can make good dither fish. However, be cautious when introducing gouramis to a community tank, as some species can be territorial or aggressive.\n\nRemember to research each species' specific care requirements, compatibility, and social needs before adding them to your tank. It's essential to ensure that the new additions will thrive in your tank and won't introduce new problems.\n\nWhen introducing new fish, follow these tips to minimize stress and aggression:\n\n* Acclimate the new fish slowly and carefully to your tank's water conditions.\n* Add the new fish in small schools or groups to reduce aggression and stress.\n* Introduce the new fish during a time when the platies are less active, such as during a water change or feeding time.\n* Monitor the behavior of all fish closely after the introduction, and be prepared to separate them if necessary.\n\nBy adding some well-chosen dither fish, you should be able to reduce the fin nipping and create a more peaceful community tank.",
