  "content": "Certainly, I understand. Here are some suggestions for a character with a similar background who might belong to a different clan:\n\n1. Clan: Since your character is a former street kid with a network of contacts and informants, they might belong to the Nosferatu clan. The Nosferatu are known for their ability to gather information and move about unnoticed due to their hideous appearance, which might be an asset for a former street kid.\n2. Faction: If your character is not aligned with the Sabbat or Camarilla, they might align with the Anarchs. The Anarchs often have a diverse group of vampires who band together to push back against the Camarilla's control, which would be a natural fit for your character.\n3. Attributes: Given your character's background, they would likely have high levels of Streetwise and Subterfuge. Additionally, they might have high levels of Dexterity, Stealth, and Brawl, which would allow them to move about unnoticed and defend themselves if necessary.\n4. Abilities: Your character's ability to gather information and make deals suggests that they would be skilled in abilities such as Investigation, Persuasion, and Streetwise. Additionally, their mastery of disguise and ability to lurk in the shadows suggests that they may have skills such as Stealth and Survival.\n5. Disciplines: Since your character has a network of contacts and informants, they might possess Auspex, which would enhance their perception and allow them to read the emotions and thoughts of others. Additionally, they might possess Obfuscate, which would allow them to move about unnoticed and deceive their enemies.\n6. Weaknesses: The Nosferatu's clan weakness is their hideous appearance, which would make it difficult for them to move about unnoticed among humans. Additionally, your character might have a tendency to act impulsively or make rash decisions, given their background as a former street kid.",
