Here are some tips to help you improve your skills:\n\n**Skin Tones:**\n\n1. **Observe and Study**: Study the skin tones of your subject, paying attention to the subtleties of color and value. Observe how light and shadow interact with the skin.\n2. **Use a Color Wheel**: A color wheel can help you understand the relationships between colors and create harmonious skin tones. Warm colors (orange, yellow, red) tend to dominate the skin, while cool colors (blue, green, purple) are often used for shadows.\n3. **Mix Your Own Skin Tones**: Avoid using pre-mixed skin tone paints. Instead, create your own by mixing earth tones (ochre, sienna, umber) with titanium white and touches of other colors.\n4. **Layering**: Build up skin tones in layers, starting with a warm underpainting and gradually adding cooler layers for shadows and mid-tones.\n5. **Pay Attention to Value**: Value (light and dark) is more important than color when capturing skin tones. Make sure to balance your values to create a sense of depth and dimension.\n\n**Capturing Likeness:**\n\n1. **Start with a Good Drawing**: A accurate drawing is essential for a good likeness. Pay attention to proportions, facial structure, and anatomy.\n2. **Focus on the Eyes**: The eyes are the windows to the soul, and capturing them accurately is crucial for a good likeness. Study the shape, color, and expression of the eyes.\n3. **Observe the Subject's Features**: Study the subject's facial features, including the shape of the nose, mouth, and jawline.\n4. **Use Reference Images**: Use reference images to help you capture the subject's likeness. Take photos from different angles and lighting conditions to get a better understanding of their features.\n5. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: The more you practice, the better you'll become at capturing likenesses. Try drawing and painting different subjects to challenge yourself.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use a Mirror**: Paint or draw yourself to better understand the subtleties of skin tones and facial structures.\n2. **Experiment with Different Brushes**: Try using different brushes to achieve varying textures and effects.\n3. **Don't Overwork**: Know when to stop working on a piece. Overworking can lead to a loss of freshness and spontaneity.\n4. **Get Feedback**: Join a critique group or share your work with others to get feedback and improve your skills.\n\nRemember, practice is key to improving your skills in portrait painting. Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement over time. Good luck with your online course, and have fun exploring the world of portraiture!",
