This should include best practices for password management, phishing prevention, and other strategies for staying safe online.\n\n2. Use two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to login credentials, making it harder for cybercriminals to gain access to sensitive information.\n\n3. Implement a virtual private network (VPN): A VPN encrypts internet traffic and protects it from third-party interception. It is essential for remote workers who frequently access company databases and applications.\n\n4. Secure communication channels: Utilize encrypted communication channels to ensure that conversations made by remote employees remain private, and sensitive information is not exposed.\n\n5. Use endpoint protection: Companies should provide endpoint protection to every employee device that remotely connects to their network. Endpoint protection software protects devices from viruses, malware, and other online threats.\n\n6. Regular updates and patches: Regular updates and patches should be applied to software used by remote employees, including security software, operating systems, and applications.\n\n7. Enforce strong password policies: Password policy should include different criteria for strong passwords, such as requiring a minimum character length, combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\n8. Monitor network activity: Companies should regularly monitor their network for unusual activity and quickly respond to any suspected security incidents.\n\n9. Secure physical workstations: Companies should make sure that remote employees secure their physical workstations and not access sensitive data on unsecured devices.\n\n10. Provide employee support: Companies should provide remote workers with sufficient support to handle any cybersecurity issues that may arise, including up-to-date antivirus software, guidelines on responding to suspicious emails, and maintaining strong workstations.",
