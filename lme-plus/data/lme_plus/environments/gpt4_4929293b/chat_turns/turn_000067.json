  "content": "I cannot predict the future, but it is likely that the new digital and hybrid events will continue even after the pandemic is over. the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and new ways of delivering and consuming cultural experiences. as a result, digital and hybrid events have become more popular and accessible than ever before.\n\nmoreover, digital platforms have the potential to reach wider audiences and offer new opportunities for cultural institutions and artists to showcase their work. they can create new revenue streams and reduce their reliance on physical attendance, which can be limited by space, location, and accessibility.\n\nhowever, it is important to note that digital events cannot fully replace the experience of attending a live event in person. the interaction between artists and audiences, the acoustics and atmosphere of a performance venue, and the social aspect of attending cultural events are all irreplaceable aspects of the live cultural experience.\n\nin conclusion, it is likely that digital and hybrid events will continue to play a role in the cultural scene in kassel and beyond, but they should complement, rather than substitute, the live cultural experience.",
