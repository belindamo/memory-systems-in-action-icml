  "content": "In this chapter, the authors present the problem of navigating through areas for visually impaired individuals as the main challenge they face every day. They propose using deep learning models and computer vision to quickly and precisely detect objects in order to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating. They also discuss the importance of eye care and the classification of different degrees of visual impairment. The authors also provide an overview of visual assistive technology, specifically focusing on visual substitution and the use of electronic travel aids. They recommend that the device should have real-time object detection, multiple feedback mechanisms, be user-friendly, provide appropriate amount of information, not be burdensome to use and learn, be simple and not awkward to use in public, and prioritize privacy and security. They also mention previous work on visual assistive technology, specifically head wear with a wearable travel aid for environment perception and navigation of visually impaired people.",
