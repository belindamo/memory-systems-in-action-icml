  "content": "That's wonderful! It's great that you're drawing inspiration from your cousin's wedding and thinking about how to create a unique and intimate atmosphere at your own wedding.\n\nVenues can really set the tone for the entire wedding, and it sounds like you're taking the time to find the perfect one for your special day. Considering the details that will make the space feel intimate and special is a great approach.\n\nAs you continue to explore venues, you might want to ask yourself some questions to help you visualize and create the atmosphere you want:\n\n* What are the must-haves for your wedding ceremony and reception? (e.g., natural light, outdoor space, specific decor, etc.)\n* How do you want your guests to feel when they arrive at the venue? (e.g., welcome, relaxed, excited, etc.)\n* What kind of ambiance do you want to create with lighting, music, and decor?\n* Are there any personal touches or meaningful elements you want to incorporate into the space?\n\nBy thinking through these questions, you'll be able to find a venue that fits your vision and create an atmosphere that's truly reflective of your personal style and love story.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you got to experience being a bridesmaid at your cousin's wedding. That can be such a special and inspiring experience! Did you learn anything from that experience that you're applying to your own wedding planning process?",
