  "content": "Maxime is a resourceful and independent vampire who prefers to feed on animals rather than humans. As a Gangrel, he has a natural affinity for the Animalism discipline, which allows him to communicate with and control animals.\n\nMaxime has built up a network of animal contacts in the city of Reims, ranging from rats and mice to stray cats and dogs. He uses his Animalism powers to locate and call animals to him, and then feeds on them without causing any harm or lasting damage. He sees feeding on animals as a way to stay connected to his natural, animalistic side and avoid the moral complications of feeding on humans.\n\nHowever, in a pinch, Maxime is also capable of feeding on humans if necessary. He is careful to choose his prey carefully, preferring to target those who are already in difficult or dangerous situations - such as drug addicts or criminals. He tries to avoid killing his prey, but is not above using his strength and ferocity to defend himself if necessary.",
