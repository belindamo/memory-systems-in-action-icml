However, I can provide you with an answer based on research.\n\nWomen have played an important role in the traditional fishing industry of Newfoundland and Labrador, particularly in the processing and marketing of fish. They were responsible for tasks such as salting and drying fish, cleaning and packaging, as well as selling the fish in local markets. In coastal communities, women were also involved in the collecting of shellfish and seaweed.\n\nIn earlier times, women in fishing families played a crucial role, as husbands and sons were often away fishing for extended periods. Women were responsible for managing the household and raising children. They often supplemented their income with fishing-related activities like selling fish, making fishing gear, and preparing the catch for market.\n\nHowever, women's contributions to the fishing industry were often overlooked and undervalued. They were not recognized as official fish harvesters until the 1980s, and even then, they faced discrimination in the form of lower quotas and lack of access to capital.\n\nToday, women continue to play an important role in the fishing industry, but still face barriers to equal participation and recognition. However, efforts are being made to address these issues and promote greater gender equality in the industry.",
