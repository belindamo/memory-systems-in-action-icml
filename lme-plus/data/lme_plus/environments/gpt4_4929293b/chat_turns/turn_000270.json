  "content": "Maxime has a rugged, streetwise appearance that belies his inner toughness and resilience. As a human, he had a thin, wiry build from his years of surviving on the streets. Since his embrace, his features have become more chiseled, with sharper cheekbones and a stronger jawline.\n\nMaxime's skin is a deep tan from years of exposure to the sun, and he has a few small scars on his face and hands from his former life as a drug dealer. His eyes are a piercing green color that glint with a hint of animalistic ferocity.\n\nIn his Gangrel form, Maxime's features become even more pronounced, with a slight ridge of fur along his spine and a subtle sharpening of his teeth and claws. He is able to shift into various animal forms, but his favorite is a large black panther - a sleek and deadly predator that embodies his fierce, independent spirit.",
