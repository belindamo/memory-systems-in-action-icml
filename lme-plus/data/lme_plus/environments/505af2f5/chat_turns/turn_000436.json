It features customizable backlighting with 16.8 million color options, macro capabilities, and Razer's proprietary Romer-G switches. You can sync the lighting with your DeathAdder Elite using Razer's Synapse software.\n2. **Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless**: This keyboard offers customizable lighting, macro keys, and Romer-G switches. It's a wireless keyboard, which might appeal to you if you prefer a clutter-free setup. Logitech's software allows for easy macro creation and customization.\n3. **Corsair K95 RGB Platinum**: This keyboard boasts a range of macro keys, customizable lighting, and Cherry MX switches. The K95 has a more extensive macro system than the other two options, with 18 programmable keys. Corsair's iCUE software allows for detailed customization and synchronization with other Corsair devices.\n4. **SteelSeries Apex 7 TKL**: This keyboard features customizable lighting, macro keys, and SteelSeries' proprietary switches. It's a tenkeyless design, which might appeal to you if you prefer a more compact setup. SteelSeries' Engine software allows for easy customization and macro creation.\n\nAll of these keyboards have macro capabilities, so you can create custom keybinds for League of Legends. The Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2 and Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless have a more streamlined macro system, while the Corsair K95 RGB Platinum offers a more extensive macro system with more programmable keys.\n\nRegarding switch types, here's a brief overview:\n\n* **Romer-G switches** (Razer, Logitech): Known for their tactile feedback, Romer-G switches are designed for gaming and offer a smooth, linear feel.\n* **Cherry MX switches** (Corsair): Cherry MX switches are a popular choice among gamers, offering a range of switch types (e.g., Cherry MX Red, Cherry MX Black) with different tactile feedback and actuation forces.\n* **SteelSeries switches** (SteelSeries): SteelSeries' proprietary switches are designed for gaming, offering a smooth, linear feel with a shorter actuation distance than Cherry MX switches.\n\nIf you're new to mechanical switches, you might want to try out different switch types before committing to a specific keyboard. Many gaming stores offer demo units or switch testers that allow you to try before you buy.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these keyboards or switch types?",
