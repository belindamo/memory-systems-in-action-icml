  "content": "Raiden Shogun is a powerful Electro character in Genshin Impact who can deal massive damage with her unique abilities. Here are some tips on how to maximize her damage output:\n\n1. Build her correctly: Raiden Shogun's abilities scale with her Energy Recharge, so focus on equipping her with artifacts and weapons that increase her Energy Recharge rate. Additionally, boosting her Elemental Mastery and Electro damage can significantly increase her damage output.\n2. Utilize her Elemental Skill and Burst: Raiden Shogun's Elemental Skill, Transcendence: Baleful Omen, summons a Thunder Orb that deals Electro damage and can be charged up for additional damage. Her Elemental Burst, Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu, deals massive Electro damage to enemies within a large area. Use these abilities together to deal massive damage to groups of enemies.\n3. Use her Normal and Charged Attacks: Raiden Shogun's Normal and Charged Attacks deal Electro damage and can generate energy particles, which can help charge her Elemental Burst faster. Use these attacks to supplement her Elemental Skill and Burst.\n4. Pair her with the right teammates: Raiden Shogun works well with teammates who can provide additional Electro support or Elemental Mastery, such as Fischl, Beidou, and Sucrose. Additionally, characters who can generate energy particles, such as Venti or Kazuha, can help charge her Elemental Burst even faster.\n5. Take advantage of her Elemental Resonance effect: Having two or more Electro characters in your party grants a passive bonus to your team's Energy Recharge rate. This can help Raiden Shogun charge her abilities faster and deal more damage.\n\nRemember, Raiden Shogun is a powerful character who can deal massive Electro damage, but she requires careful planning and execution to reach her full potential. Practice using her abilities and experiment with different team compositions to find the setup that works best for you.",
