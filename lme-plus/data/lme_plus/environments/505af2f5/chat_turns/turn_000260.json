That's what cycling is all about, right?\n\nRegarding your Cannondale, yeah, it's always a good idea to get your bike serviced regularly to keep it running smoothly. Sticky suspension can be a real nuisance, especially on hilly trails. You might want to check with local bike shops in your area to see if they can take a look at it for you. They can give your bike a once-over, adjust the suspension, and make any necessary repairs to get it feeling like new again.\n\nAs for planning your next bike trip, I'd be happy to help you explore other trails in your area. Since you mentioned you don't know the exact name of the park, could you give me an idea of your general location? City, state, or even zip code would help me narrow down some options for you.\n\nLet me know, and I can start suggesting some new trails for you to explore!",
