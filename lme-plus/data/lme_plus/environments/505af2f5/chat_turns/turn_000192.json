The recipe notes that you can add a low-carb sweetener to taste.\n3. Low-Carb Smoothie Bowl with Berries [[6](https://diabetesstrong.com/low-carb-smoothie-bowl-with-berries/)] - This smoothie bowl recipe uses almond milk, coconut oil, crushed ice, vanilla protein powder, strawberries, and optional stevia or other low-carb sweetener.
