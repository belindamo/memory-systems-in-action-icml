  "content": "Yes, there are many benthic species that prefer more sheltered areas in the intertidal zone. For example, some species of sea anemones, soft corals, and sponges prefer sheltered areas such as crevices, rock pools, and shallow caves. These areas provide protection from wave action, desiccation, and predation. Other examples of benthic species that prefer sheltered areas include small crabs, gastropod snails, and various species of algae. Many of these species are adapted to living in areas of low water flow and limited exposure to sunlight, which can directly influence their distribution patterns.",
