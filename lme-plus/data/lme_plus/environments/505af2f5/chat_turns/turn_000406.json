  "content": "Eula is a powerful Cryo character in Genshin Impact who specializes in dealing massive physical damage. Here are some tips on how to maximize her damage output:\n\n1. Build her correctly: Eula relies heavily on her critical hit rate and damage. Focus on leveling up her talents, equipping her with the right artifacts, and upgrading her weapon to increase her critical hit rate and damage. You can also use a Cryo damage bonus goblet to further boost her damage.\n2. Utilize her Elemental Skill and Burst: Eula's Elemental Skill, Icetide Vortex, creates a spinning blade that deals Cryo damage and pulls enemies towards her. Her Elemental Burst, Glacial Illumination, deals massive Cryo damage and increases her physical damage for a short time. Use these abilities together to deal massive damage to groups of enemies.\n3. Use her Charged Attack: Eula's Charged Attack is a powerful move that deals physical damage and has a chance to crit. Use it after her Elemental Skill or Burst to maximize the damage.\n4. Use Cryo reactions: Eula can trigger Cryo reactions such as Superconduct and Frozen with her abilities. Superconduct reduces enemy physical resistance, while Frozen deals bonus damage. Use these reactions to increase her damage output.\n5. Pair her with the right teammates: Eula benefits from teammates who can provide additional Cryo support, increase her critical hit rate, or debuff enemies. Some good teammates to consider include Kaeya, Diona, and Bennett.\n\nRemember, Eula is a hard-hitting character who can deal massive physical damage, but she requires careful planning and execution to reach her full potential. Practice using her abilities and experiment with different team compositions to find the setup that works best for you.",
