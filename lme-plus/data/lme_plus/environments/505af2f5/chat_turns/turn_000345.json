  "content": "Yes, nausea or motion sickness is a common side effect of VR use, and it can be a particular issue for patients using the technology in hospitals. When using VR, patients may feel disoriented due to the sensory disconnection between what they see and what their body feels, which can trigger nausea.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, hospitals can take several steps:\n\n1. Limit the duration of VR sessions: Healthcare providers can limit the length of VR sessions to avoid overstimulating patients and reduce the risk of nausea.\n\n2. Provide breaks: Patients can take short breaks between VR sessions to prevent the onset of motion sickness or other side effects.\n\n3. Use high-quality hardware: High-quality VR headsets that offer high refresh rates and low latency are less likely to cause motion sickness.\n\n4. Movement mechanics: VR developers can implement movement mechanics like smooth, slower movements or teleportation to reduce the likelihood of patients experiencing motion sickness.\n\nIn summary, while nausea or motion sickness is a common side effect of VR, there are several steps providers can take to mitigate the risk and ensure that patients have a comfortable VR experience.",
