  "content": "I'd love to explore more about the Impressionist movement and its connection to modern art. Since I visited the \"Impressionist Masterpieces\" exhibition, I've been thinking about how Impressionist artists like Monet and Renoir influenced the development of modern art. Can you recommend any museums or exhibitions that showcase the transition from Impressionism to modern art movements like Cubism, Fauvism, or Expressionism?",
