Pain management: VR can be used as a distraction technique to help manage pain during medical procedures or physical therapy sessions, reducing the need for medication and resulting in a more pleasant experience for the patient.\n\n2. Rehabilitation: By incorporating VR into physical therapy, patients can perform exercises in a virtual environment that mimics real-life situations. This helps to improve balance, coordination, and overall physical function.\n\n3. Education and training: VR can be used to create realistic simulations for medical students to practice surgical procedures or for healthcare professionals to receive training on new medical equipment or procedures.\n\n4. Mental health: VR has been found to be effective in treating anxiety, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n5. Accessibility: VR provides an opportunity for patients who are unable to leave their homes or are physically unable to travel to receive medical treatment or therapy remotely.\n\n6. Patient engagement: VR can be used to engage patients in their own healthcare by providing interactive experiences that educate them about their condition and treatment options.\n\n7.
