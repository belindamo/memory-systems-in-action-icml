Our members are always eager to learn from each other and bring new ideas to the table, so I think your expertise will be a great fit.\n\nI just wanted to touch base regarding the focus of your talk. Our group is all about community building, knowledge sharing, and discussions. We'd love for you to share your experiences and insights, but maybe not so much about the promotion or advertisement of your products.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns. I can't wait to hear what you have to say!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
