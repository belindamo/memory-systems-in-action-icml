Sequoia National Park is an incredible destination, and I'd be happy to recommend some hiking trails with scenic views similar to Yosemite's Vernal Falls.\n\nWhile Sequoia National Park doesn't have a waterfall exactly like Vernal Falls, it has its own unique charm and breathtaking vistas. Here are a few trails that might satisfy your craving for scenic views:\n\n1. **High Sierra Trail to Hamilton Lakes**: This trail is a bit longer (about 12 miles round-trip), but the views are stunning. You'll hike through a lush forest, cross the Kern River, and eventually reach the picturesque Hamilton Lakes, surrounded by towering peaks.\n2. **Alta Peak Trail**: This trail is a bit more challenging (about 14 miles round-trip), but the panoramic views from the highest peak in Sequoia National Park (11,200 ft) are unbeatable. On a clear day, you can see the Great Western Divide, the Kaweah Range, and even the Sierra Nevada mountains.\n3. **Marble Falls Trail**: This trail is about 4 miles round-trip and takes you to a beautiful waterfall, Marble Falls. While not as large as Vernal Falls, it's still an impressive sight, and the trail passes through a lush forest and along the Crystal Cave Road.\n4. **Big Trees Trail to Moro Rock**: This shorter trail (about 2 miles round-trip) takes you through a stunning grove of giant sequoias, including the General Sherman Tree, and ends at Moro Rock, a granite dome with spectacular views of the surrounding mountains.\n5. **Congress Trail**: This trail is about 2 miles round-trip and takes you through a beautiful forest of giant sequoias, including the Congress Grove. While not a waterfall trail, the scenery is still breathtaking, and you'll have the opportunity to see some of the largest trees on Earth.\n\nRemember to check trail conditions, difficulty levels, and any necessary permits or restrictions before you head out. It's always a good idea to stop by the park's visitor center for up-to-date information and advice from park rangers.\n\nHave a fantastic time exploring Sequoia National Park, and I hope you create many wonderful memories on your solo adventure!",
