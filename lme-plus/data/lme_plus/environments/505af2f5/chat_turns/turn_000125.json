  "content": "The HIA (Housing Industry Association) is a leading industry body in the Australian residential building sector. The HIA provides a range of model contracts, including the HIA Standard Form of Contract for Housing and Residential Works, which is widely used in the industry. This contract regulates the relationship between the builder and the homeowner, outlining their rights, obligations, and liabilities. It is important for homeowners to understand the terms and clauses of the contract before signing it, as it will govern the construction process and the parties' rights and obligations throughout the project. One of the most critical clauses for homeowners to understand is Clause 21, which sets out the requirements for Practical Completion of the works. This clause is fundamental to determining when the builder has completed the works and when the homeowner must pay the final payment. Understanding this clause is crucial to managing the risks and ensuring a successful project outcome.",
