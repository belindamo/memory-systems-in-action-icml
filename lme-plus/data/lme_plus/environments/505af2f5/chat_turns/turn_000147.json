It was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\n\nThe construction of the Eiffel Tower began in 1887 and was completed in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. At the time, it was the tallest structure in the world, standing at 1,063 feet (324 meters) tall.\n\nInitially, the tower was not well received by the public and many criticized its design as an eyesore. However, over time it became an iconic symbol of Paris, and its popularity grew.\n\nThe tower has had a significant impact on the tourism industry in Paris. It has become the most visited paid monument in the world, with over 7 million visitors annually. Its popularity as a tourist attraction has helped to make Paris one of the top tourist destinations in the world.\n\nIn addition to its impact on tourism, the Eiffel Tower has also played a role in scientific research and communication.
