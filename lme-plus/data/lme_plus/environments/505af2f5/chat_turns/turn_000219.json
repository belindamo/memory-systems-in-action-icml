I've been enjoying the Vinyasa flow classes at my studio, but I want to focus on restorative yoga at home, especially on Sundays. I've been going three times a week to the studio, and I'm really enjoying Rachel's 7 pm Tuesday class. Do you have any tips on how to incorporate restorative yoga into my daily routine, even on days when I'm not practicing at home?",
