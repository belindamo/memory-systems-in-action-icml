  "content": "Hi [Speaker],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm super excited that you're coming to speak at our community group. Our members are always eager to learn from each other and bring new ideas to the table, so I think your expertise will be a great fit.\n\nJust a heads up, I wanted to ask if you could steer clear of any sales pitches during your talk. Our group is all about community building, knowledge sharing, and discussions. I know you have a lot of great insights to share, so I'm hoping you can focus on that instead.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns. I can't wait to hear what you have to say!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
