  "content": "To build a more comprehensive and sophisticated Tradingview-like application, you can extend the example provided above in several ways. Here are some ideas:\n\n* Use more advanced Bokeh features, such as hover tools and legends, to enhance the interactivity and usability of the visualizations.\n* Add more chart types, such as candlestick charts, to support different types of data and analysis.\n* Use database queries to filter and aggregate the data, and to support different time frames and scales in the visualizations.\n* Implement authentication and authorization to restrict access to certain data or features, and to support multiple users and user profiles.\n* Use JavaScript and other web technologies, such as WebSockets, to implement real-time updates and push notifications for new data.\n* Use machine learning algorithms, such as time series forecasting, to provide predictions and insights based on the data.\n\nBuilding a Tradingview-like application is a complex and challenging task, but it is also a rewarding and exciting project that can provide powerful tools for data analysis and visualization. With the right combination of Python libraries and frameworks, and a strong focus on usability and performance, you can create a world-class web application for real-time data analysis and visualization.",
