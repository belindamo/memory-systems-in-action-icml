  "content": "Yes, you can change the metadata schema of a digital collection even after you have uploaded materials. However, this may require some additional work to modify or add new metadata to the existing resources. If the changes you make to the metadata schema are significant, you may want to reassess the quality and consistency of the metadata before publishing the updated collection.\n\nIt is essential to have a versioning system for the digital collection, so users can identify which version of the metadata was used for specific materials. With this approach, users can access and use the metadata describing the items they need, regardless of changes to the schema.\n\nIf you have many resources, you could prioritize the ones with high demand and significant value to your audience. Note that any changes made to the metadata schema after uploading materials can have search or discoverability implications, so you should plan the change carefully to minimize any negative effects on the collection.",
