Taking regular breaks to avoid burnout or writer's block.\n4. Setting daily or weekly writing goals to stay focused and productive.\n5. Keeping a writing journal or notebook to jot down ideas, observations, or notes.\n6. Free writing for a few minutes each day to help generate new ideas or to loosen up before a writing session.\n7.
