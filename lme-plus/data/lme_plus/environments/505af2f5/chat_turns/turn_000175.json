  "content": "To design a Tradingview-like real-time interactive web-based application in Python, you can use a combination of several Python libraries and frameworks. Here is one possible approach:\n\n1. Use the Flask web framework to build the web application and handle HTTP requests and responses. Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that makes it easy to build web applications.\n2. Use the Bokeh library to build the interactive visualizations. Bokeh is a Python library for creating interactive plots and charts that can be embedded in web applications. It provides a high-level interface for creating beautiful and customizable visualizations.\n3. Use the Pandas library to handle the data. Pandas is a powerful and flexible Python library for data analysis and manipulation. It provides efficient data structures and operations for working with structured data, such as time series data.\n4. Use the Requests library to fetch data from external sources, such as stock market APIs. Requests is a Python library for making HTTP requests, which makes it easy to fetch data from the internet.\n5. Use a database, such as SQLite or MongoDB, to store the data and make it accessible to the web application. This will allow you to persist the data and easily query it to power the interactive visualizations.\n\nOverall, building a Tradingview-like application in Python will require a combination of web development, data analysis, and visualization skills. Using the libraries and frameworks mentioned above, you can create a powerful and interactive web application for visualizing real-time data.",
