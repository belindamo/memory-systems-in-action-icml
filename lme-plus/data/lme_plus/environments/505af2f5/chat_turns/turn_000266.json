Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation, and I don't retain any information from previous chats.\n\nSo, while it's great that you remember taking your Trek hybrid bike to the local bike shop on March 15th, I don't have any knowledge of that event or any other personal details. I'm here to provide general information and answer questions to the best of my abilities, but I don't have access to your personal calendar or history.\n\nIf you're ready to plan a bike trip or explore new trails, I'd be happy to help! Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll do my best to assist you.",
