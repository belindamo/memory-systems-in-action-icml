  "content": "Hemp seeds are an excellent addition to your guava oatmeal, providing a nutty flavor, extra protein, and a boost of omega-3s. Here's a recommended amount and some tips on how to incorporate them:\n\n**Recommended Amount:**\n\n* Start with 1-2 tablespoons of hemp seeds per serving. This will provide about 5-10 grams of protein and 1-2 grams of omega-3s.\n\n**Tips for Incorporating Hemp Seeds:**\n\n1. **Grind them up**: Hemp seeds can be a bit dense and crunchy, so grinding them in a coffee grinder or food processor can help them mix better with your oatmeal.\n2. **Mix with liquid first**: Mix the ground hemp seeds with a small amount of liquid, such as almond milk or water, to create a paste. This will help them distribute evenly throughout your oatmeal.\n3. **Add to oatmeal**: Mix the hemp seed paste with your cooked oatmeal, guava, and any other desired toppings.\n4. **Start small**: If you're new to hemp seeds, start with a small amount (1 tablespoon) and adjust to taste. Some people may find the nutty flavor overpowering, so it's better to start slow.\n5. **Store them properly**: Hemp seeds can go rancid quickly, so store them in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer to preserve their nutritional value.\n\n**Benefits of Hemp Seeds:**\n\n* High-quality protein source (about 20% protein by weight)\n* Rich in omega-3 fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA)\n* Good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals (like magnesium, potassium, and iron)\n* May help with heart health, inflammation, and digestion\n\nBy incorporating hemp seeds into your guava oatmeal, you'll not only add protein and omega-3s but also a nutty flavor and a satisfying crunch. Enjoy!",
