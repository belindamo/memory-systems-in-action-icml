By the way, my friend Maddie and I had a blast at the Stranger Things haunted house at Halloween Horror Nights. We visited the event twice, on October 15th and 22nd, and loved every minute of it. Do you have any suggestions for some spooky music playlists or Halloween-themed games to play at my party?",
