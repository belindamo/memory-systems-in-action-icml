  "content": "Thank you for offering! I think I've got everything I need to get started with the Korean-style marinade and cooking the chicken. If I have any more questions or need further assistance, I'll definitely reach out.\n\nThanks again for the help and guidance. I'm excited to try out the marinade and cooking methods you've suggested. Who knows, maybe I'll even start meal prepping like a pro and reduce my reliance on food delivery services like Grubhub!\n\nHave a great day, and happy cooking!",
