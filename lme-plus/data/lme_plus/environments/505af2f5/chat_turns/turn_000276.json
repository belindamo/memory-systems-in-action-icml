When you earn more stamps or redeem a reward, we can update the table accordingly.\n\nNote that The Daily Grind's loyalty program uses stamps instead of points, so we've adapted the table to accommodate that. If you have any other programs that use different reward systems, feel free to let me know and we can adjust the table as needed.\n\nHow's that? Do you have any other loyalty programs you'd like to add to the list?",
