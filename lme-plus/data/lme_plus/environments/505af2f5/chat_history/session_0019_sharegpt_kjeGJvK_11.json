      "content": "If you're looking for a low carb smoothie bowl recipe that includes coffee and cocoa, you have a few options to choose from based on the search results. Here are a few recipes and ingredients you might want to consider:\n\n1. Chocolate Low Carb Smoothie [[3](https://www.liveeatlearn.com/chocolate-low-carb-smoothie/)] - This recipe calls for unsweetened almond milk, canned coconut milk, unsweetened cocoa powder, nut butter, and your favorite sugar-free sweetener. The almond milk is frozen into cubes before blending to create a thicker consistency.\n2. Keto Coffee Smoothie [[5](https://www.sweetashoney.co/keto-coffee-smoothie/)] - This smoothie recipe is a refreshing coffee shake that uses chilled brewed coffee, coconut cream, almond milk, chia seeds, vanilla extract, and ice cubes. The recipe notes that you can add a low-carb sweetener to taste.\n3. Low-Carb Smoothie Bowl with Berries [[6](https://diabetesstrong.com/low-carb-smoothie-bowl-with-berries/)] - This smoothie bowl recipe uses almond milk, coconut oil, crushed ice, vanilla protein powder, strawberries, and optional stevia or other low-carb sweetener. The recipe suggests adding toppings like nuts, seeds, or shredded coconut for crunch.\n\nWhile these recipes don't all include cocoa and coffee together, they offer some good starting points for creating your own low-carb smoothie bowl with those ingredients. You could experiment with adding coffee to the Chocolate Low Carb Smoothie, or adding cocoa to the Keto Coffee Smoothie, for example. As always, be mindful of the carb counts of any ingredients you add and adjust the recipe as needed to fit your dietary goals."
