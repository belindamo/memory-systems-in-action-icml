      "content": "There is no reason not to trust birds in general. However, wild birds may carry diseases and it's best to avoid handling them or coming into contact with their droppings. Also, Some bird species, such as pigeons, can carry diseases such as histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. So it's better to take precautions when interacting with wild birds."

      "content": "It is unlikely that birds are trying to take your eyes. Birds generally do not have a tendency to attack humans, and even if they do, their beaks are not strong enough to cause significant harm to human eyes. The behavior you are describing sounds unusual and may be caused by a specific bird or situation. It is possible that you may have a phobia of birds (ornithophobia) or a traumatic experience with birds that causes you to perceive them as a threat. It's best to speak with a therapist or counselor to work through any issues you may have with birds."
