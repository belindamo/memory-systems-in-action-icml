I'll rephrase my response.\n\nI'm excited to hear that you're planning to attend the festival on both days! I recommend checking the official All Things Go Fall Classic website or their social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) for updates on the set times and schedules. They will likely release the schedule a few days before the event, so keep an eye out for that.",
