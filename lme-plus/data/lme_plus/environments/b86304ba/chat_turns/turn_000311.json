  "content": "You're being strategic about your festival planning, and that's awesome!\n\nWhile it's possible that Outside Lands might announce additional headliners or big-name acts before the daily lineups are released, it's less likely at this point. The initial lineup announcement usually includes the main headliners and a good chunk of the acts, and subsequent announcements are often focused on adding more mid-tier and local acts to the lineup.\n\nThat being said, it's not unprecedented for festivals to make late additions to the lineup, especially if there's a high demand for a particular artist or if there's a scheduling conflict that needs to be addressed.\n\nIf you're interested in catching other artists you haven't seen live before, I'd recommend checking out the current lineup and seeing if there are any acts that really stand out to you. You might be surprised by some of the hidden gems on the lineup!\n\nAdditionally, you could also keep an eye on the festival's social media accounts and website for any updates on the lineup. If they do announce any additional headliners or big-name acts, you'll be the first to know!\n\nIn the meantime, you can start exploring the current lineup and making a list of the artists you'd love to see. That way, when the daily lineups are announced, you can quickly grab your single-day pass and plan your festival experience around your favorite acts!",
