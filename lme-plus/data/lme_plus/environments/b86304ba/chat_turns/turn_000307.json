  "content": "Outside Lands is a fantastic festival, and San Francisco is a great city to host it.\n\nAs for the lineup, the initial lineup announcement usually includes the headliners and a good chunk of the acts, but it's common for festivals to add more artists in the following weeks or months leading up to the event. These additional acts are often referred to as \" lineup additions\" or \"late adds.\"\n\nOutside Lands usually follows this pattern, so it's likely that they'll announce more artists in the coming weeks. They might add a few more headliners, some mid-tier acts, and even some local or up-and-coming artists to round out the lineup.\n\nKeep an eye on the Outside Lands social media accounts and website, as they'll usually announce new additions and provide updates on the lineup. You can also sign up for their newsletter or follow music news outlets to stay informed about any lineup updates.\n\nIn the past, Outside Lands has added artists like Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd, and H.E.R. as late additions, so it's definitely worth keeping an eye out for any new announcements!\n\nIf you're interested in attending, I recommend checking the festival's website for ticket availability and pricing. They often offer different tiers of tickets, including single-day passes and three-day general admission or VIP passes.",
