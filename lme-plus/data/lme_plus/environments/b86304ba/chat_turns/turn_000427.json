  "content": "Both \"by\" and \"from\" can be used to indicate the author of a book. In this case, both \"by the Brazilian author Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa\" and \"from the Brazilian author Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa\" are grammatically correct and convey the same meaning.\n\nHowever, \"by\" is more commonly used to indicate the author of a book, while \"from\" is more often used to indicate the place of origin or the source of something. In this case, it would be more natural to use \"by\" since we are referring to the authorship of the book.\n\nSo, your translation \"from the Brazilian author Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa\" is also grammatically correct, but \"by the Brazilian author Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa\" would be a more common and natural way of expressing the same idea.",
