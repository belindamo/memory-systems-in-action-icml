  "content": "As of now, there are no plans to update or change the designs of the Slovenian circulation coins in the near future. The current designs have been in use since Slovenia adopted the euro in 2007, and they have become an integral part of the country's identity.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) have introduced guidelines for the gradual redesign of euro coins. The goal is to update the designs to make them more modern, accessible, and secure.\n\nIn 2020, the ECB announced a new euro coin design series, which will be introduced gradually starting from 2023. The new series will feature a common design on the obverse (front side) of the coins, showcasing the European Union's values and symbols, such as the European flag, the European map, and the euro symbol. The reverse (back side) of the coins will continue to feature national designs, like the Slovenian circulation coins.\n\nSlovenia, as an EU member state, will need to adopt the new design series eventually. However, the timeline for implementing the changes has not been announced yet. It's likely that Slovenia will introduce the new designs gradually, starting with the lower-denomination coins, and then moving to the higher-denomination coins.\n\nWhen the changes do occur, it will be an exciting opportunity for collectors and numismatists to acquire new coins featuring Slovenia's unique cultural and natural heritage.",
