I'll make sure to express my excitement for her future and offer my support throughout the process.\n\nBy the way, speaking of celebrations, I'm also looking forward to attending my husband's company's graduation party for one of his colleagues, who's completing his MBA program. I need to RSVP by tomorrow, so I should probably get on that soon.\n\nDo you have any tips on what to wear to a graduation party? Should I dress formally or keep it casual?",
