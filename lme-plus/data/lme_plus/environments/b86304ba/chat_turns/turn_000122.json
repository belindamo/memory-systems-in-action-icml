Thanks for the Merriweather Post Pavilion connections too - I've been meaning to explore more of Vampire Weekend's discography. By the way, do you have any recommendations for jazz artists similar to Herbie Hancock? I recently saw him perform at the Kennedy Center and was blown away by his skill.",
