Christine was raised in a strict form of conservative christianity within an insular community structure and has lived experience with religious trauma. In her 20s, she deconverted from christianity and began a journey of discovery. Her own struggles encouraged her to help those who have had negative experiences in religion. As she furthered her research and understanding of the experiences of religious trauma, Christine stumbled upon Marlene\u2019s articles on Religious Trauma Syndrome and immediately felt seen. From there Christine joined Marlene\u2019s Helping Professionals Group and joined Journey Free to further support folks recovering from adverse religious experiences. She moderates the groups, Making Connections/Friends and Dealing with Believers And The Church.\nJanice Selbie was born and raised in a Canadian evangelical Christian home with parents who believed the Bible was literal and inerrant. She married a man who became a pastor and they were married for nearly 20 years, raising two daughters. In her late 30s, Janice experienced a series of tragedies which caused her sufficient doubt in the God of the bible that it shook her loose from her cognitive dissonance and prompted her to start researching other religions and exploring all that she had denied herself. After her divorce, she went back to school to become a Registered Professional Counsellor. She was thrilled to discover Marlene online and attend some of her retreats in San Francisco. Interacting with others who could relate to her own painful transition out of religious life prompted Janice to develop the Divorcing Religion Workshop.\n\n \n\nCoco Owen grew up in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. She left after a crisis of faith at age 21, and began a deconstruction journey that led her to pursue graduate degrees in comparative literature and clinical psychology.\n\nShe is now a licensed psychologist in Los Angeles, CA, and has an all-telehealth private practice. She has two young-adult children, loves animals, and is happy to have joined the Journey Free community. Coco moderates the \u201cCreativity\u201d group.\n\n \n\nKevin Davison recalls an early Southern Illinois Pentecostal church (at age 7), where he first spoke in tongues after a laying on of hands in the children\u2019s church basement. Many memories of children\u2019s bible stories and restrictions on music prevailed, but with a close and loving family\u2019s support. Jesus was the beginning and the end to a very conflicting social life until graduating from CFNI in \u201995 to only become a failed missionary evangelist (to Brazil), by choice. He disappointed his family to leave \u201cGod\u2019s plan.\u201d He chose a different career in technology and then followed a long, drawn out, but adventurous deconstruction of his faith.\n\nWith help from a beautiful community of Reclaimers\u2014attending retreats with accompanying therapy/coaching from Marlene and this wonderful group, he\u2019s recovering. Now, facilitating conference calls, moderating groups, and providing technical web support.\n\n \nChase Marks was raised as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and after deciding to leave the religion in his mid-20s, he faced the reality of losing his family, friends, community, world view, and sense of self. The intense confusion, fear, shame, and anger was too much for him to deal with. Not knowing he was experiencing symptoms of religious trauma and having no tools to navigate them, he was left in a very dark and lonely place. After some time, Chase found that deep down he knew there must be more to life. That\u2019s when he began his healing journey. He began looking into religions and spiritual practices outside of Christianity. He began working with and studying under traditional healers and medicine people. Little by little, he was finding his own path and his own answers. Ultimately, Chase realized that his healing would not come from someone else\u2019s teachings or holy books. It would come from his own experiences and his own beliefs. Now, many years later, Chase is grateful to offer his services as a religious recovery consultant to those who are facing similar challenges leaving harmful religion. Chase is a trained health and wellness coach and he facilitates the Saturday support group for Release & Reclaim. Chase also moderates two groups for Release & Reclaim \u2013 \u201cSex and Pleasure\u201d, and \u201cDeath, Mortality, Fear of Hell.\u201d\n\n \nModeraters\nThese are the people who help keep our groups safe and productive.\nJessica (Humor and Fun, Parenting) was raised as an evangelical Christian, and while would have identified as a \u201cprogressive Christian\u201d for most of her adult life, finally left religion altogether in 2017. Jessica is a Clinical Social Worker practicing in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Her practice focuses mostly work around trauma with children and teens. She read Marlene\u2019s book Leaving the Fold in the summer of 2021 and joined the group Journey Free to both give and receive support from people who have similar lived experiences.\n\nJessica lives with her three awesome kids and her husband in Southeastern, PA. \n\n \n \n\nTim (Spirituality and New Philosophies, Videos, Movies, Books, Articles) grew up in an evangelical Christian home and in his younger years attended various conservative churches (Charismatic, Presbyterian, Methodist, etc). He became disenchanted with the Evangelical world view however today he still gets value in exploring different forms of Spirituality. He moderates the Spirituality board on this site and helps out with moderating other boards too. \n\nTim is a retired software engineer who has run a travel agency with his wife for over 20 years. Having traveled to many countries and meeting people of different cultures has also expanded his world view.\n\nDr Winell writes in Leaving the Fold: \u201cThis book is not anti-God, anti-church, or anti-spirituality, but it is anti-dogma.\u201d Tim follows this non-dogmatic approach to exploring spirituality!\n\n \n\nMK (Mary Karol) McGee (Science & Skepticism, Idea Monster Taming) was raised as a conservative Evangelical Christian and adhered to this way of life until she started deconstructing in the early 2000s. She followed the questions (is the young-earth creation story true? Does hell really exist? Does the Holy Spirit really change people? Did Jesus really rise from the dead?) and this led to the unraveling of her belief system into something new. She joined \u201cRelease and Reclaim\u201d in December 2019, and participated in a book study of Marlene\u2019s book, which gave her the freedom to truly break free. MK now enjoys the beauty of compassion, connection, and learning how to be human day by day.\n\n \n \nKeep an eye out for our other moderators.
