It was characterized by a sense of freedom, luxury, and modernity. In the world of jewelry and fashion, Art Deco was marked by:\n\n1. Geometric shapes: Clean lines, triangles, circles, and squares were used to create intricate designs.\n2. Metallic materials: Platinum, white gold, and silver were popular, often paired with diamonds, pearls, and other precious stones.\n3. Egyptian and African influences: The discovery of King Tut's tomb in 1922 sparked a fascination with ancient cultures, leading to the incorporation of Egyptian and African motifs into jewelry designs.\n4. Bold and bright colors: Jewelry featured vibrant colors, often achieved through the use of enamel, lacquer, and gemstones like rubies, emeralds, and sapphires.\n5. Modernity and innovation: Art Deco jewelry designers experimented with new techniques, such as filigree, milgrain, and engraving, to create intricate, three-dimensional pieces.\n\nArt Deco jewelry was often worn to make a statement, showcasing the wearer's wealth, status, and fashion sense.
