The scenarios you provided are very useful, especially the ones related to uncovering a hidden world within their own city. I think I'll try to combine some of these prompts to create a more complex scenario. For instance, what if my character received a cryptic message that leads them to a hidden entrance or portal, but when they get there, they're kidnapped by a group claiming to be from the hidden world? How would they react to that situation?",
