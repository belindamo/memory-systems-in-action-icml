  "content": "I'm currently making my overnight oats with almond milk, chia seeds, and some vanilla extract. I'm excited to try adding some fresh fruit like berries or sliced bananas, and maybe some chopped nuts like almonds or walnuts. I'm also curious about trying different spices like cinnamon or nutmeg to add some warmth to my oats. Do you have any suggestions for how to incorporate these ingredients into my current recipe?",
