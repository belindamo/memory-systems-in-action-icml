Here's a simple recipe and some tips to help you achieve a smooth, even glaze:\n\n**Powdered Sugar Glaze Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup powdered sugar\n* 2-3 tablespoons milk or heavy cream\n* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract (if using) until smooth.\n2. Start with 2 tablespoons of milk and add more as needed to achieve the desired consistency. You want the glaze to be thick enough to hold its shape, but still be pourable.\n3. Whisk until the glaze is smooth and free of lumps.\n\n**Tips for a Smooth, Even Glaze:**\n\n1. **Sift the Powdered Sugar:** Sift the powdered sugar before using it to remove any lumps and ensure it's evenly incorporated into the glaze.\n2. **Use the Right Consistency:** If the glaze is too thick, it won't pour smoothly. If it's too thin, it will be difficult to control. Aim for a consistency that's similar to thin honey.\n3. **Whisk, Whisk, Whisk:** Whisk the glaze thoroughly to remove any lumps and ensure it's smooth and even.\n4. **Use a Piping Bag or Spatula:** Transfer the glaze to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip or use an offset spatula to drizzle the glaze over the cake. This will give you more control over the flow of the glaze.\n5. **Drizzle in a Steady Stream:** Hold the piping bag or spatula at a 90-degree angle to the cake and drizzle the glaze in a steady stream. Move the bag or spatula in a circular motion to create a smooth, even layer.\n6. **Don't Over-Glaze:** Apply the glaze in thin, even layers, allowing each layer to set before adding more. This will prevent the glaze from pooling or becoming too thick.\n7. **Chill the Cake:** Chill the cake in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes before glazing to help the glaze set faster and more evenly.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a smooth, even powdered sugar glaze that adds a touch of elegance to your cake. Happy decorating!",
