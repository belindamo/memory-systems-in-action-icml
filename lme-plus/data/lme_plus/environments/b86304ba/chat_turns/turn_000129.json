You'll get to experience the entire festival and enjoy both days of music, food, and activities.\n\n**Set Times and Schedules:**\n\nThe festival organizers usually release the set times and schedules a few days before the event. I recommend checking the official All Things Go Fall Classic website or their social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) for updates.\n\nAs of now, the set times and schedules are not publicly available. However, you can expect the festival to release the schedule around 1-2 weeks before the event. Once the schedule is announced, you'll be able to plan your day and make sure to catch your favorite artists.\n\n**Tips for Planning Your Day:**\n\nUntil the schedule is released, here are some general tips to help you plan your day:\n\n* Arrive early to grab a good spot in the crowd for the opening acts.\n* Check the festival map to familiarize yourself with the stage locations and plan your day accordingly.\n* Prioritize the acts you want to see and plan your day around their set times.\n* Leave some buffer time between sets to grab food, drinks, or explore the festival grounds.\n* Be prepared for changes in the schedule, and stay flexible in case of any last-minute changes.\n\n**Billie Eilish and The 1975's Set Times:**\n\nAs headliners, Billie Eilish and The 1975 will likely perform towards the end of each day. You can expect their set times to be around 8-10 PM, but this is just a rough estimate. Once the schedule is released, you'll be able to plan your day around their performances.\n\nStay tuned to the festival's social media accounts and website for updates on the set times and schedules. I'm sure you'll have an amazing time at the festival, and I hope you enjoy seeing Billie Eilish and The 1975 perform live again!",
