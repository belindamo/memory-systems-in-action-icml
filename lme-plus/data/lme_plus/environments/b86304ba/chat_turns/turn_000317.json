  "content": "Lever harps are well-suited for many different styles of music ranging from traditional Celtic and folk music to modern pop and jazz. They are particularly versatile in accompanying singing since they can easily switch keys, making it simpler for most vocalists. However, the range of music that lever harps can play ultimately depends on the harp's size and the number of strings it has. A smaller lever harp with fewer strings will likely work better for traditional and folk music, while a larger lever harp with more strings can accommodate a broader range of music, including classical, jazz, and contemporary pop genres.",
