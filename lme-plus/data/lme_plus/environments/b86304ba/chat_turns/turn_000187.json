Here's an overview of the Slovenian coins released in 2007:\n\n**Circulation Coins:**\n\n* Slovenia adopted the euro as its official currency on January 1, 2007, replacing the Slovenian tolar (SIT). As a result, a new series of circulation coins was introduced, featuring designs representing Slovenia's natural and cultural heritage. The coins were minted in denominations of 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, \u20ac1, and \u20ac2.\n\n**Commemorative Coins:**\n\n* **Prince's Stone (Kne\u017eji kamen) 2-euro coin**: This is the coin you mentioned, featuring the Prince's Stone design. It was issued on April 25, 2007, to commemorate the 1,200th anniversary of the Prince's Stone, a symbol of Slovenian statehood.\n* **500th Anniversary of the First Slovenian Book 3-euro coin**: This coin was issued on June 28, 2007, to mark the 500th anniversary of the first Slovenian book, \"Sti\u010dna Handbook,\" written by Friderik Berthold. The coin features an image of the book's cover and the author.\n\n**Special Edition Coin:**\n\n* **Slovenia's Entry into the Euro Zone \u20ac10 coin**: This special edition coin was issued on January 1, 2007, to commemorate Slovenia's adoption of the euro. The coin features a design representing the country's transition to the euro zone.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the Prince's Stone 2-euro coin was not a standalone issue in 2007. Slovenia released two commemorative coins that year, as well as a special edition coin, in addition to the new circulation coins.\n\nThese commemorative coins are popular among collectors, and their values can vary depending on their mintage, condition, and demand. If you're interested in learning more about Slovenian coins or expanding your collection, I'd be happy to help!",
