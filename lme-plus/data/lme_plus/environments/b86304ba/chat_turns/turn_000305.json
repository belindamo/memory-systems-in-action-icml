The lineup includes Flume, The Chemical Brothers, and M.I.A., among others.\n* **Treasure Island Music Festival**: October 15-16, 2023, on Treasure Island in San Francisco. The lineup is still TBA, but it usually features a mix of indie, rock, and electronic acts.\n\nThese festivals offer a great opportunity to see multiple artists in one weekend, and the Bay Area has a fantastic festival vibe. If you're interested in attending any of these, I recommend grabbing tickets ASAP, as they tend to sell out quickly!\n\nGovernors Ball is an amazing festival, and I'm sure you had an incredible time with Alex and Emma. If you're looking for more festival recommendations or want to know about other events in the Bay Area, feel free to ask!",
