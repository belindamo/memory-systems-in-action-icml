  "content": "I'm thinking of checking out the single-day passes for Outside Lands, but I want to make sure I don't conflict with the Taylor Swift concert at Levi's Stadium on August 20th. Since I've already seen Billie Eilish at the Los Angeles Forum with my best friend, Rachel, I'm not too concerned about missing her set at Outside Lands. But I do want to catch some other artists that I haven't seen live before. Do you think Outside Lands will announce any more headliners or big-name acts before the daily lineups are released?",
