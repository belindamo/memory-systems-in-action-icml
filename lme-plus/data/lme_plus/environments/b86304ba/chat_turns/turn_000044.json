Toe Raises - Sit on a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Slowly lift your toes off the ground and point them towards the ceiling, hold for a few seconds, and then lower your toes back to the ground. Repeat 10 times. 2. Toe curls - Place a small towel on the ground in front of you. While sitting on a chair, place your foot on top of the towel and use your toes to scrunch the towel towards you. Release and repeat 10 times, then switch to the other foot. 3. Ankle circles - Sit on a chair and lift one foot off the ground. Rotate your ankle in a clockwise motion for 10 seconds, then switch directions and rotate counterclockwise for 10 seconds. Repeat with the other foot. 4. Heel raises - Stand with your feet hip-width apart and slowly raise yourself up onto the balls of your feet. Hold for a few seconds, then slowly lower yourself back down. Repeat 10 times. 5. Tennis ball massage - Sit on a chair and place a tennis ball under one foot. Roll the ball back and forth under your foot for a few minutes, applying moderate pressure. Repeat with the other foot.
