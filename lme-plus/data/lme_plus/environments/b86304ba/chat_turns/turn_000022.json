I'm glad you're a fan of them too!\n\nWhen it comes to packing essentials for Seoul, here are some must-haves to consider:\n\n**Clothing:**\n\n1. **Comfortable shoes:** Seoul is a walking city, so pack comfortable shoes that can handle the miles of walking.\n2. **Layered clothing:** Seoul's weather can be unpredictable, so pack lightweight, layered clothing for easy adjustments.\n3. **Warm clothing:** Winters in Seoul can be chilly, so don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat.\n4. **Rain gear:** Seoul can experience sudden rain showers, so bring a lightweight rain jacket or umbrella.\n\n**Toiletries:**\n\n1. **Travel-sized toiletries:** Pack travel-sized toiletries to save space and weight in your luggage.\n2. **Moisturizer:** Seoul's dry air can be harsh on skin, so bring a good moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated.\n3. **Face masks:** Face masks are a big part of Korean skincare, and you can find a wide variety in Seoul.\n4. **Contact lenses or glasses:** If you wear contacts or glasses, be sure to pack enough supplies and a spare pair.\n\n**Electronics:**\n\n1. **Portable charger:** With all the photo opportunities and map navigation, your phone's battery can drain quickly. Bring a portable charger to stay powered up.\n2. **Travel adapter:** South Korea uses Type C and D power sockets, which are different from those in North America.
