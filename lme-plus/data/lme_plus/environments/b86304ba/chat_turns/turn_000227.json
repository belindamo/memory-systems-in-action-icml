Here are some tips on how to arrange them and keep them fresh:\n\n**Choosing the Right Flowers:**\n\n* Select flowers that are in season and have a delicate, lightweight appearance. Good options include roses, carnations, baby's breath, and violas.\n* Avoid using flowers with strong scents or oils, as they can affect the flavor and aroma of your cake.\n* Consider using edible flowers like violas, pansies, or lavender for a more rustic, whimsical look.\n\n**Preparing the Flowers:**\n\n* Gently wash the flowers with cold water to remove any dirt or debris.\n* Pat the flowers dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n* Remove any excess leaves or stems that will be below the cake's surface.\n\n**Arranging the Flowers:**\n\n* Use a small amount of piping gel or a dab of buttercream to attach the flowers to the cake. This will help them stick in place.\n* Start with a central flower or focal point, then arrange the remaining flowers around it in a loose, organic pattern.\n* Experiment with different heights and angles to create visual interest.\n* Keep the arrangement simple and understated, as you want the cake to be the main focus.\n\n**Keeping the Flowers Fresh:**\n\n* Place the cake in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before serving to help the flowers stay fresh.\n* Avoid placing the cake in direct sunlight or near a heat source, as this can cause the flowers to wilt.\n* Use a small amount of floral wire or a toothpick to secure the stems of the flowers to the cake, if needed. This will help them stay in place and prevent them from drooping.\n\n**Safety First:**\n\n* Make sure to use flowers that are safe for consumption, in case any petals or leaves accidentally fall onto the cake.\n* Avoid using flowers that have been treated with pesticides or other chemicals.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to create a beautiful, festive cake that's perfect for your sister's birthday celebration. Happy decorating!",
