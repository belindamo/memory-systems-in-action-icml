Here are some tips:\n\n**Cooked Quinoa:**\n\n1. **Cool it down**: Let the cooked quinoa cool down to room temperature to prevent bacterial growth.\n2. **Air-tight containers**: Store the cooled quinoa in airtight containers, such as glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids.\n3. **Refrigerate**: Refrigerate the quinoa within 2 hours of cooking. It can be stored for 3 to 5 days in the fridge.\n4. **Freeze**: If you don't plan to use the quinoa within 5 days, consider freezing it. Cooked quinoa can be frozen for up to 3 months. Simply scoop the cooled quinoa into airtight containers or freezer bags, press out as much air as possible, and label.\n5. **Reheat safely**: When reheating, make sure the quinoa reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n\n**Roasted Vegetables:**\n\n1. **Cooling**: Let the roasted vegetables cool down to room temperature to prevent moisture buildup.\n2. **Airtight containers**: Store the cooled vegetables in airtight containers, such as glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids.\n3. **Refrigerate**: Refrigerate the roasted vegetables within 2 hours of cooling.
