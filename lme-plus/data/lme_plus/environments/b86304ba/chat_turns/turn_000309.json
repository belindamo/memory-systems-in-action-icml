You definitely want to avoid conflicting with the Taylor Swift concert, and it's great that you're planning ahead.\n\nOutside Lands usually releases their daily lineups in the summer, around June or July, although the exact date can vary from year to year. They typically announce the daily schedules about 4-6 weeks before the festival, so you can expect to see the daily lineups in late July or early August.\n\nOnce the daily lineups are announced, you'll be able to see which artists are performing on which day, and you can plan your single-day pass accordingly. Keep an eye on the Outside Lands website and social media accounts, as they'll likely make a big announcement when the daily lineups are released.\n\nIn the meantime, you can also try to make an educated guess about which day certain artists might perform based on their tour schedules and other festival appearances. For example, if an artist is playing a show in LA or Sacramento a few days before Outside Lands, they might be more likely to perform on the Friday or Saturday of the festival.\n\nAs soon as the daily lineups are announced, you can grab your single-day pass and plan your festival experience around your favorite artists and, of course, avoid conflicting with the Taylor Swift concert!",
