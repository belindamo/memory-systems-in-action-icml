Really get to know my writing style with this one:\n\"\nTherapeutic ultrasound has been used for imaging and treating various conditions due to its penetration depth and thermal effects[19.]. Similar to electromagnetic radiation, the penetration depth of ultrasound is highly dependent on the signal frequency. Typically ultrasound can be categorized by low power/low frequency or high power/high frequency. High-intensity ultrasound, often over 1000W/cm2, generally is used for its thermal properties as the vibrations cause heat to be generated in the target tissue. 1 MHz ultrasound has been shown to penetrate up to 2.3 to 5 cm, while 3 MHz ultrasound can penetrate up to 0.8 to 1.6 cm deep[19.]. Generally, ultrasound cannot be applied across the skull because of the massive attenuation at the skin-bone interface. The attenuation causes heat as the lost acoustic energy is converted into thermal energy. However, to account for the attenuation through the skull, phased \nSignal Type\nPenetration Depth\nSpatial Resolution\nNIR light\n2mm\n0.05mm\nMicrowaves\n50mm\n4mm\nUltrasound\n30mm\n1-2mm\nMagnetic Fields\n50mm \n10mm\n\nTable 2: Comparison of the three primary signals\n There exists an inverse relationship between penetration depth and spatial resolution in primary signals. As depicted in Table 2, NIR light, the ideal visible light primary signal, can only penetrate 4.4mm into tissue allowing for stimulation of the cerebral cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain. Microwaves and TMS can penetrate approximately 50mm into the brain, which would allow for stimulation of the entirety of the cerebrum. However, NIR light can be focused on a near-nanoscale under ideal conditions, while TMS and microwaves can only be focused on a centimeter scale. Transcranial Doppler can penetrate 30mm into the brain while having a millimeter-scale resolution, falling between the two extremes. Given the inverse relationship of penetration depth to spatial resolution, the primary signals could be combined by utilizing different nFNIs to achieve deep stimulation without sacrificing spatial resolution.\nNano Functional Neural Interfaces\n Nano functional neural interfaces are an emerging field within Functional Neural Interfaces that could potentially revolutionize neuroscience as a whole. As shown in figure 1, nFNIs are nanotransducers capable of converting a primary external signal to a secondary form of energy that can activate an ion channel. Likewise, they can receive the secondary form of energy from the ion channel/neuron and convert it into the primary form of energy. As discussed in the Primary Signals section, electromagnetic radiation, Ultrasound, and Magnetic force are the three primary signals used in nFNIs. However, various forms of energy can be used as a secondary signal, such as electrical, magnetic, thermal, optical, and mechanical energies[7.]. \nNumber\nPrimary Signal\nSecondary Signal\nMaterial\nBinding Target\n1\nVIS light\nElectric field\nQuantum Dots(CdSe)\nMembrane/intracellular/\nvoltage-gated ion channels\n2\nMagnetic Field\nElectric field\nCoFe2O4-BaTiO3\nMembrane/intracellular/\nvoltage-gated ion channels\n3\nUltrasound\nElectric field\nPiezocrystals(Barium Titanate)\nMembrane/intracellular/\nvoltage-gated ion channels\n4\nVIS/NIR light\nHeat\nGold nanomaterials\nTRPV1 Ion channels\n5\nMagnetic field\nHeat\nSuperparamagnetic materials(Manganese ferrite)\nTRPV1 Ion channels\n6\nNIR light\nUV/Vis\nNaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles\nlight-sensitive ion channels (ChRs, Chrimson, Jaws)\n7\nMagnetic Field\nMechanical Force\nMagnetite nanoparticles\nMembrane/mechano-gated ion channels(DEG, K2P)\n\n Table 3: Comparing the current state of art nano functional neural interfaces[7,20, 35,36]. The first three nFNIs listed are nano electrotransducers(optoelectric, magnetoelectric, and piezoelectric). Rows 4 and 5 depicted Nano thermotransducers(optothermal and magnetothermal). Row 6 shows a nano optotransducer, and Row 7 depicts a nano mechanotransducer.\n As depicted in Table 3, there are currently seven nanotransducers that promise to create a stable nFNI. The seven transducers can be broken into four groups: electrotransducers, thermotransducers, optotransducers, and mechanotransducers. \nOptotransducers utilize optogenetics to stimulate the ion channel. In optogenetics, creatures are genetically engineered to have light-sensitive ion channels called opsins onto the plasma membrane or have them artificially inserted[7.]. Opsins are engineered ion channels or pumps that respond to specific wavelengths of light to either inhibit or excite neurons. Three examples of opsins are depicted in Table 3. However, another method would be needed to detect the activity of the neuron. While light can stimulate the ion channel, the ion channel would not, in turn, produce light. Therefore, optotransducers would work as stimulators only.\nThermotransducers can take primary signals such as light or magnetic fields to create localized heat. TRP channels, specifically TRPV1, have been shown to be effective temperature-gated ion channels. The channels could be used to inhibit or excite neurons based on localized heating caused by these materials. Ferrous materials such as Manganese ferrite have been shown to be effective magnetothermal transducers[36]. \nOf the seven transducers, optoelectronic, magnetoelectric, piezoelectric, and magnetomechanical nanotransducers will be explored as options for an nFNI because the above-listed transducers are bidirectional. \nOptoelectronic Transducers\nQuantum dots (QD) are semiconducting nanocrystals with properties that allow them to transport electrons. Cadmium selenide (CdSe) is the most common QD, consisting of heavy metal and a nonmetal. The heavy metal acts as the core of the QD, and an additional coating is typically added for stability and biocompatibility. Depending on their material, size, and shape, QDs can be fine-tuned to emit or absorb specific wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR) due to quantum confinement[9.]. Quantum confinement occurs when the particle size is too small to be comparable to the wavelength of an electron. The phenomenon allows for high photostability and quantum efficiency. For these reasons, quantum dots are being used more readily for clinical purposes such as fluorescent labeling, cancer treatment, and drug delivery[9.]. They are useful in these applications due to their ability to be used as a platform to image while also being small enough to travel through the bloodstream. \nQD exhibits optoelectric properties to generate photocurrent [9.]. Once excited, QDs momentarily create an electric dipole moment, which induces an electric field. If a QD can be coupled with a neuron within 10 nm[20.] of the plasma membrane either by use of an anchor protein or floating in a substrate, the electric field generated may be enough to create an action potential. Neurons typically have a resting voltage of approximately -70mV. For the neuron to begin depolarizing, creating an action potential, the voltage would need to be raised to -55mV meaning the nFNIs would need to transduce 15mV to cause the neuron to fire[21.].While additional research is require to demonstrate the energy conversion efficiency of QDs on a nanoscale, QDs have been used for photovoltaics in recent studies that demonstrated, on a macroscale, an efficiency of 66%[37]. \nWhile QDs can allow for an attenuated signal to generate an action potential, NIR light would first need to make it to the transducers to stimulate the QDs. A benefit to this model is that QDs can be tailored to their needed application, but if the coating is degraded, the heavy metal core could be toxic[12.]. They have shown cytotoxicity towards cells in vitro due to the release of free Cadmium[22.]. However, quantum dots have not been shown to be toxic in humans, so further experimentation should be done before the assumption that QDs are toxic in humans would be needed. \nMagnetic Transducers \nMagnetic nanoparticles have been investigated for medical applications such as magnetic separation of biological entities, nano-drug delivery, cancer treatment, and MRI. However, there has been a recent push in using magnetic particles for neural interfacing. Similar to QDs, magnetic nanoparticles typically consist of a metallic core paired with a shell to make the interface biocompatible and stable. Typically the internal cores can be made from iron-cobalt alloys with a coating that protects the interface from oxidation[23.]. Still, once again, the coating of the interface is highly dependent on the nature of the tasks. In the following section, magnetoelectric nanoparticles(MENs) and magnetomechanical nanoparticles(MMNs) will be investigated. \nMagnetoelectric Nanotransducers \nIn a study conducted by Gudurut et al., EEG waveforms of live mice were shown to be modulated by 30nm CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 magnetoelectric core-shell nanoparticles under low energy magnetic fields(20 Oe at 20 Hz).CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 was chosen specifically for this study due to its powerful magneto-electric effect due to strain-induced coupling between the magnetostrictive cobalt ferrite cores and piezoelectric barium titanate shells [24.]. In another investigation conducted by Nguyen et al., it was found that by using magnetic nanoparticles localized to a specific region of the brain, a local electric field of 1000V/m could be induced with roughly 50 mT at 10 Hz. The result is especially significant because standard transcranial magnetic stimulation requires approximately 1T to produce a similar effect[25.].\nWhile the initial finding for MENs shows they have promise as stable nFNIs, further investigation is needed to confirm their properties. In the study conducted by Gudurut et al., the cytotoxicity of MENs was performed. In this study, the magnetic nanoparticles were coated with glycerol mono-oleate. They found no significant toxicity for human neuron cells in vitro in a concentration range up to 200 \u03bcg/ml[25.].\nMagnetomechanical Nanotransducers\nMMNs capable of mechanically modulating cell response has been established in the field. Typically, MMNs are bound to the plasma membrane using collagen or an equivalent binding protein. They are able to apply pico-newton forces to stretch ion channels via particle twisting[26.]. MMNs can have iron oxide, magnetite, or hematite cores, and they can also have silica, collagen, starch, or dextran coatings, depending on the type of cell they are being bound to[26.]. While most studies conducted on MMNs were conducted in non-excitable cells, the activation of mechanosensitive ion channels can be transferred to neural modulation. In particular, one study demonstrates the potential for MMNs[27.]. They used MMNs with magnetite cores coated with starch to target ion channels attempting to cause a calcium influx in cortical neurons. By utilizing a magnetic field of 110mT, they were able to induce a significant calcium influx in transgenic mechanosensitive ion channels, which is a tenth of the energy needed to induce a calcium influx using TMS[28.]. \n\""
