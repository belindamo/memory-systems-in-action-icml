Eastern Catalan: This accent is spoken in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands. It is considered the standard accent of Catalan and is the most widely spoken. The pronunciation is clear and distinct.\n\n2. Western Catalan: This accent is spoken in the western part of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the eastern part of Aragon. It has a more melodic and softer pronunciation than the eastern accent.\n\n3. Northern Catalan: Spoken in Northern Catalonia, which is part of France, this accent has some French influence in pronunciation and intonation.\n\n4. Southern Catalan: Spoken in the southernmost part of Catalonia and in some regions of Valencia, this accent has a distinctive pattern in vowel pronunciation, which makes it easier to distinguish from other Catalan accents.\n\n5. Insular Catalan: Spoken in the Balearic Islands, this accent has a more relaxed and slower pace than other Catalan accents, with a unique intonation pattern.\n\nOverall, the differences in accent are not necessarily vast, but they add to the rich linguistic and cultural diversity of the Catalan language."
