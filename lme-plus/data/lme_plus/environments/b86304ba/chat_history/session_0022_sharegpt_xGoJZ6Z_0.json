reality creation that has\n0:08\ncompletely changed not only my life but\n0:10\nevery single client that I've ever\n0:12\nworked with every single person that\n0:13\nI've met has in one way or another\n0:15\napplied this one principle and this is\n0:19\nthe mirror principle throughout this\n0:22\nvideo what I'm going to share with you\n0:24\nis not only how the mirror principle\n0:26\nworks I'm going to share with you four\n0:28\nlaws that you must understand to\n0:32\nmanifesting your dream life\n0:34\nfour keys to unlock these four laws and\n0:38\nreal life case studies of people and how\n0:40\nthey've used this law for themselves\n0:42\nokay this law allowed me to quit a\n0:46\nsoul-sucking corporate career that I was\n0:48\nstuck in not knowing what to do with my\n0:50\nlife feeling stuck going from that to\n0:53\nstarting up and doing something that I'm\n0:55\npassionate about and being able to grow\n0:56\nthat to seven figures and actually\n0:58\nliving my dream life okay this video is\n1:02\nprobably going to be one of the most\n1:04\nvaluable videos that you see on YouTube\n1:06\nand it's probably going to be more\n1:08\nvaluable than some people's paid\n1:10\nprograms I really really want you to pay\n1:12\nclose attention to this even save this\n1:14\nvideo somewhere to revisit it because\n1:16\nthere's a reason why I'm talking about\n1:18\nthe mirror principle without further\n1:21\ndelay let's go right ahead and get\n1:23\nstarted so to begin with let's\n1:25\nunderstand what the fundamental idea of\n1:27\nthe mirror principle is the fundamental\n1:29\nidea of the mirror principle is our\n1:32\nouter world is a reflection okay what\n1:35\nwe're seeing outside all the material\n1:37\neverything around us our current\n1:39\ncircumstances it is a reflection that is\n1:43\nformed by an image and that image is our\n1:46\ninternal world so I want you to remember\n1:48\nthis very crucial point the outer world\n1:50\nis merely a reflection formed by the\n1:54\nimage of which is essentially another\n1:57\nway of saying our internal World okay\n1:59\nwhy I truly believe this is the most\n2:02\npowerful principle is every single Guru\n2:05\nor person who talks about the law of\n2:08\nattraction like even Neville Godad you\n2:09\nknow he talks about how reality is a\n2:12\nmirror and what we try to do is we try\n2:15\nto manipulate this mirror if we want to\n2:18\nchange the reflection we're seeing in\n2:20\nthe mirror what most people do is they\n2:22\ntake this mirror try to shatter it and\n2:24\nmanipulate it to change the image\n2:26\ninstead of changing the image that we're\n2:29\npresenting in front of the mirror okay\n2:31\nthis is very crucial we must not try to\n2:34\ndirectly impact the reflection we're\n2:37\nseeing through manipulation we have to\n2:39\nlearn to indirectly change the\n2:42\nReflection by presenting a different\n2:43\nimage to it it's kind of like when you\n2:47\ntry to influence someone and you\n2:49\ndirectly tell them hey don't do this all\n2:51\nthey're going to do is just that right\n2:53\ninstead if you motivate them and Inspire\n2:55\nthem and give them a good enough reason\n2:56\nnot to do something explain to them this\n2:59\ncould be detrimental to you this might\n3:01\nnot help you out you can do it you're\n3:02\ncompletely free to do it nothing is\n3:04\nstopping you from doing it but it's not\n3:06\nultimately best for you then they're\n3:08\nmore likely to listen and be influenced\n3:09\nso we need to learn how to influence our\n3:12\nworld indirectly and there is no better\n3:15\ntime than right now in the 21st century\n3:18\nthe year 2022 to be doing this as 2023\n3:23\napproaches why if you look around you\n3:25\nright now everyone is progressively\n3:27\ngetting focused more and more on the\n3:29\nouter world we have lost all of this the\n3:31\ninner technology that we once had access\n3:33\nto and everyone's focusing on the outer\n3:36\nWorld social media technology growing\n3:40\nthrough external technology we have lost\n3:42\ninner technology so someone who can\n3:45\nreally turn within at this moment in\n3:48\ntime will have an unfair advantage to\n3:50\nthe rest of the world now is the perfect\n3:53\ntime for you to become the best you and\n3:56\nlearn how to influence your world\n3:58\nindirectly through internal technology\n4:01\nso without further delay let's go\n4:04\nstraight into the four laws that will\n4:07\nallow you to learn to bend reality to\n4:10\nyour will and create exactly what you\n4:13\nwant and then we're going to move to the\n4:15\nFour Keys that will help you unlock\n4:16\nthese laws and finally we're going to\n4:19\nget to the case studies to show you real\n4:21\nlife situations of people actually\n4:23\napplying this okay so now let's get to\n4:26\nthe four laws four keys to the case\n4:28\nstudies to helping you completely\n4:29\nunderstand how this mirror principle\n4:31\nworks and please stay to the very\n4:34\nbecause I am saving the best for lost in\n4:36\nshowing you how the mirror Cycle Works\n4:39\nthat is going to change everything for\n4:40\nyou so let's begin with law number one\n4:43\nwhat you've got to understand is that\n4:45\nthe mirror of reality reflects two\n4:48\nthings your relationship to yourself and\n4:51\nto the world or the mirror itself the\n4:54\nmirror of reality reflects relationship\n4:56\nto self and world what do I mean by that\n4:59\nwell if you look at yourself and you\n5:02\nbelieve you are not good enough then the\n5:04\nmirror will simply reflect that oh I'm\n5:07\nnot good enough I can't do this because\n5:08\nI'm not good enough oh you're not good\n5:10\nenough here you go here's more proof of\n5:12\nwhere you're not good enough so the\n5:14\nreflection keeps forming on whatever\n5:16\nyou're confirming okay you keep telling\n5:18\nyourself you're not good enough for\n5:19\nsomething the mirror will show you the\n5:21\nworld will show you more reasons why\n5:23\nyou're not good enough it simply\n5:25\ncompounds what you say similarly\n5:28\nwhatever your world view is how you view\n5:30\nthe world oh now is not the right time\n5:32\nto start a business now is not the right\n5:33\ntime to become an entrepreneur now is\n5:36\nnot the right time to invest my money in\n5:38\nthis oh it's not here you go here's more\n5:40\ninstances of why you shouldn't oh look\n5:43\nrecession oh look interest rates are\n5:45\nrising right so the mirror will always\n5:47\nreflect whatever it is you're holding\n5:50\ntrue in your mind both about yourself\n5:52\nyou and your worldview your identity and\n5:55\nyour Paradigm please remember this one\n5:57\nof the most crucial laws now the\n5:59\nquestion becomes how can we change this\n6:02\nokay how can we interrupt this pattern\n6:05\nand consciously choose what we want\n6:07\nyou've got to form your own identity and\n6:10\nParadigm and by Paradigm I mean how you\n6:14\nview the world and don't worry I'm going\n6:16\nto give an example to give you an\n6:18\nexample how you form your identity first\n6:20\nof all is simply by getting clear on\n6:22\nwhat you want longer term 10 years from\n6:25\nnow ultimately in that final picture\n6:27\nwhat's one picture that you can craft\n6:30\nthat you see yourself doing in activity\n6:32\nevery single day\n6:33\nthings that you own that make your life\n6:36\na continual vacation now ask yourself\n6:39\nwho am I being what characteristics what\n6:42\ntraits do I have when I'm achieving\n6:44\nhaving and doing all of those things\n6:46\nvery important next what world view do I\n6:50\nhave what's my view of the world when I\n6:52\nhave all those I just want you to take a\n6:54\nmoment right now to write those two\n6:56\nthings down form a self view how you\n6:59\nview yourself this could be a statement\n7:00\nof I am worthy I'm good enough things\n7:03\ncome to me in abundance because I am\n7:05\nthis way because I have this straight\n7:07\npick a couple of words to describe this\n7:10\ntrait you could say I have the touch of\n7:12\nan alchemist I have the touch of a\n7:14\nmaestro whatever it could be and I want\n7:17\nyou to read that every day and also form\n7:19\na paradigm or a world view the way in\n7:22\nwhich you view the world the world is\n7:24\nalways taking care of me everything is\n7:26\nalways going my way everything is\n7:28\nunfolding as it should so form two\n7:31\nstatements a statement about an idea\n7:33\nidentity something that you want to\n7:35\nembody every single day and a statement\n7:37\nabout your world view as you keep saying\n7:41\nthis statement every single day and\n7:42\nreminding yourself of it prepare to see\n7:44\nhow your reflection the reflection\n7:47\nyou're seeing how your world begins to\n7:49\nchange right before your very eyes this\n7:51\nis something I've been doing for the\n7:52\npast four years and when I began I was\n7:54\nnervous about making YouTube videos I\n7:56\ncouldn't imagine making this video right\n7:58\nnow but here I am my business depends on\n8:01\nme making videos and talking to clients\n8:03\nbut back then I was so shy and nervous I\n8:05\ndidn't want to put myself out there\n8:07\nright so I've become a completely\n8:09\ndifferent person even if you look back\n8:11\nthree four years ago my first video\n8:13\nlooked like versus who I am and how I'm\n8:15\nconducting myself now it's a completely\n8:17\ndifferent me and my world view has\n8:20\nallowed me to go from that place where I\n8:22\nwas stuck in that corporate career\n8:24\nbelieving that the job was the only way\n8:26\nto go there's no other way to make money\n8:28\nand I'm trapped here forever to\n8:30\nbelieving that wait a second the world\n8:32\nis completely abundant things are coming\n8:33\nto mean abundance and that's exactly\n8:35\nwhat's happening for me please do this\n8:37\nexercise right now it's going to\n8:39\ncompletely change your life now let's\n8:40\nget to key number two what you've got to\n8:43\nunderstand is this reflection that we're\n8:46\nseeing in our material world is formed\n8:48\nwith a delay why do I say that here's\n8:51\nwhy if you look around you right now in\n8:53\nour internal world we can craft a\n8:55\npicture immediately close our eyes and\n8:57\nwe look at the picture that we want to\n8:58\nlook at that's how that Dimension works\n9:02\nbut this physical Dimension the third\n9:05\ndimension if you will it works with a\n9:07\ndelay because of the inert quality of\n9:09\nmatter because of how gross matter is it\n9:13\ncan't violate the laws of nature and\n9:15\njust make everything manifest\n9:17\ninstantaneously it takes a little bit of\n9:20\ntime so this brings me to the next key\n9:23\nwhich is you must stay with the\n9:27\nassumption that you've made for long\n9:29\nenough until whatever you wanted\n9:32\nmanifests okay\n9:34\nso what I mean by that is every identity\n9:38\nand every Paradigm that you have stay\n9:41\nwith it for long enough until your goal\n9:44\nshows itself who you pretend to be is\n9:47\nwho you'll become if you're wanting to\n9:49\nbe a successful business owner you begin\n9:52\nwith the identity of who would I be if I\n9:55\nwere a successful business owner how\n9:56\nwould I act stay with it for long enough\n9:59\nan interesting phenomenon that occurs\n10:01\nwhen people begin to experiment with\n10:04\nthis and kind of understand it is they\n10:06\nstart to see that their lives are going\n10:09\nin waves you begin with some assumption\n10:11\nyou begin with some Identity or Paradigm\n10:13\nand you hope that your goal will\n10:16\nmanifest but what starts to happen very\n10:18\nquickly is it doesn't show up it doesn't\n10:21\nshow up reality takes some time to\n10:23\nreflect it it doesn't show up yet and\n10:26\nthen your mood starts to deteriorate\n10:28\nalong with it and so now once your mood\n10:32\nhas gone to its lowest all of a sudden\n10:34\nyour manifestation shows itself but when\n10:37\nit shows itself now it starts to reflect\n10:39\nyour previous negative attitude with a\n10:41\ndelay so now whatever shirt itself\n10:44\nstarts to deteriorate out back again\n10:46\nbecause it's simply reflecting how\n10:48\nyou're feeling in this way there is a\n10:50\nway there is this wave this cycle that's\n10:53\nhappening in your life and you can't\n10:55\nescape it you have some highs and some\n10:57\nlows and you can't be Beyond it so the\n11:00\nkey is you must always stay with the\n11:03\nidentity and the Paradigm that you've\n11:05\ncreated for yourself and that's the best\n11:07\nway you can make any sort of fundamental\n11:09\nchange happen in your life let's get to\n11:11\nthe next key which I truly believe was\n11:15\none of the profound ones for me that\n11:16\nI've been practicing every single day\n11:18\nokay what you have to understand is that\n11:20\nthe mirror of reality reflects not the\n11:24\nnature of your thoughts but the purified\n11:26\ncontent of it I'm going to explain what\n11:29\nI mean in just a second think about it\n11:31\nthis way if I keep expressing\n11:34\ndissatisfaction but there's a content to\n11:37\nmy dissatisfaction I hate the dead end\n11:40\njob that I'm in I hate my boss I hate my\n11:43\nspouse or partner I hate the bills that\n11:46\nI have it doesn't reflect my hate it\n11:49\njust gives me the content of my hate the\n11:52\nmirror reflects the content of my hatred\n11:55\nI hate the bills you'll get more bills I\n11:58\nhate my student alone you'll get more\n12:00\nstudent loan and more things happening\n12:01\nthat will put you in debt I hate my job\n12:03\nmore things will come up in your job to\n12:06\nliterally piss you off okay that's\n12:08\nexactly how it happens this is why the\n12:11\nrich keep getting richer and the poor\n12:12\nkeep getting poorer because the poor\n12:14\nkeep complaining about what they don't\n12:15\nhave and what they don't want and it\n12:17\nkeeps reflecting what they don't have\n12:18\nand what they don't want gives them more\n12:20\nreason to confirm their world view and\n12:23\ntheir identity whereas the rich they're\n12:25\nlike oh I have this and I want this and\n12:26\nI have this and I want this so this is\n12:28\nwhy the most successful people are\n12:30\nalways focused on what they want every\n12:32\nsingle client that I've seen they've\n12:34\nbecome successful by focusing on what\n12:36\nthey have and what they want because\n12:38\nwhen you do that guess what the mirror\n12:40\nhas no choice but to reflect more of\n12:42\nwhat you have more of what you want and\n12:44\ngive it to you in abundance so this is\n12:46\nthe fundamental difference between a\n12:48\nscarcity and an abundance mindset\n12:51\nsimply looking at the glass as half full\n12:54\nrather than half empty so now the key to\n12:58\nunlocking this law for yourself is\n13:00\nsimply to just focus on what is wanted\n13:02\nand what you have\n13:04\nI want to share with you an example that\n13:06\nis going to illuminate this for you a\n13:08\nlot more\n13:09\nwhen I see a lot of people in corporate\n13:11\ncareers and they want to transition out\n13:13\nbecause they feel burnt out in their\n13:14\njobs and they want to get into\n13:16\nentrepreneurship they have no clue what\n13:18\nthey want to do they have a lack of\n13:19\nclarity on their purpose and what they\n13:21\ndo is they keep focusing on the lack of\n13:23\nclarity oh I don't know what I want to\n13:25\ndo oh do I want to try this do I want to\n13:26\ntry that an example like to give is if\n13:29\nyou were in the mail room picking up a\n13:31\npackage and you kind of maybe you knew\n13:34\nthat the package was there maybe you\n13:36\ndidn't know maybe you're confused\n13:38\nwhatever\n13:39\nso you kind of half-heartedly search for\n13:41\nit but then you get a notification on\n13:43\nyour phone that the package has\n13:44\ndefinitely been delivered by Amazon\n13:46\nnow your search takes on a whole new\n13:49\nlevel of conviction once you get to that\n13:52\nlevel of conviction that level of\n13:54\nclarity on what you want with your life\n13:56\nthen the search that you have to search\n13:59\nthis the corporate people have then\n14:02\nthey're able to fully make that\n14:03\ntransition the only way to get to that\n14:05\nis to stop looking at what you're not\n14:08\nclear about and stop looking at what you\n14:10\ndon't have and begin to look at what you\n14:12\ndo have and what you do want if you're\n14:15\nan entrepreneur and you're stuck at a\n14:16\ncertain business level and you look at\n14:18\nyour business you're like why am I not\n14:19\nmaking this much money you're looking at\n14:21\nsomeone else who's making that much\n14:22\nmoney makes you compare yourself to them\n14:24\nwhy am I not at six figures why am I not\n14:26\nat 20K a month doing that makes the\n14:29\nmirror reflect more and more of oh\n14:30\nyou're not at 20K a month here's more\n14:33\nreason to stay stuck at 5K 10K a month\n14:36\nor whatever it is you're doing in your\n14:37\nbusiness right so that's exactly how\n14:39\nthis Mirror Works and don't get me wrong\n14:41\nsometimes it's easier for me to forget\n14:43\ntoo all these things but I need to\n14:45\nremind myself that hey I'm focusing more\n14:47\non what I don't have and what I don't\n14:49\nwant which will keep me stuck with what\n14:51\nI don't have and what I don't want in\n14:52\norder to make any change happen you've\n14:54\ngot to begin to shift your focus to what\n14:56\nit is you do have in this very moment\n14:59\nall the clients that you have all the\n15:02\nprogress that you've made the beautiful\n15:03\nfamily that you have the things that you\n15:06\nwant in your life so for the corporate\n15:08\npeople and this is exactly what I did I\n15:11\ndidn't know how I would get my Financial\n15:13\nFreedom right the thing that would get\n15:15\nme out of my corporate job I simply\n15:17\nlooked at longer term what is it that I\n15:19\nwant what would make my life a vacation\n15:21\nfocusing on these the identity in the\n15:23\nParadigm that I need to have what does\n15:24\nthat look like what does it feel like it\n15:26\ncan be a vague picture as long as you're\n15:28\nfocused on what you want and when you do\n15:30\nthat and when you keep focusing on what\n15:32\nyou want\n15:33\nthe gap between your current life and\n15:35\nyour desired Life The Gap starts to get\n15:37\nfilled up because you start to widen the\n15:40\nlimits of your comfort zone for me what\n15:42\nhappened was I had the idea to start\n15:44\nmaking YouTube videos and I just\n15:45\nfollowed it okay this feels right I'm\n15:47\ngonna do it maybe somehow it'll lead me\n15:50\nto that just keep making videos I had no\n15:52\nidea that I wanted to do coaching right\n15:54\nfor all I know I thought I was going to\n15:56\nsell like notebooks and journals and\n15:58\nplanners or merch I didn't know that\n16:00\ncoaching was it but then one day someone\n16:02\nreached out to me for coaching and that\n16:04\ncompletely changed my Paradigm forever\n16:05\nbut that only happened because I kept\n16:07\nfocusing on what I want and what I do\n16:11\nhave do you understand this is very very\n16:13\ncrucial okay so that's key number three\n16:16\nnow let's get to key number four last\n16:20\nbut not least the mirror cycle and this\n16:23\nis going to change everything forever\n16:24\nbecause if you learn to manipulate this\n16:26\nmirror cycle for yourself you will no\n16:29\nlonger be so uncertain about what to do\n16:31\nyou'll literally see reality changing\n16:33\nright before your very eyes here I have\n16:35\nthis beautiful but empty diagram to\n16:38\ndemonstrate to you how this process of\n16:40\nreality creation works so for most\n16:43\npeople what they're doing right now okay\n16:46\npay close attention to this\n16:48\nwhere they begin is with an observation\n16:50\nthey begin looking around them at the\n16:54\nreflection that is already there and\n16:56\nthis is ridiculous because please\n16:58\nremember the present is simply the\n17:00\ndelayed reflection of the past so what\n17:03\nare the delayed attitude that they had\n17:05\nin the past all the complaints or the\n17:07\nshitty things that have happened in the\n17:08\npast or the unconscious choices that\n17:10\nwere made that's the present moment so\n17:12\nthey look at present moment Bill's job I\n17:15\ndon't like stuck at a revenue level they\n17:17\nobserve it and they use that to form\n17:20\ntheir image or their attitude so I'm\n17:22\ngoing to write image here and by image\n17:25\nyou know I mean the internal attitude\n17:26\nthe thoughts and feelings that we\n17:28\npresent to the mirror when they form the\n17:30\nimage the mirror has no choice but to\n17:32\nreflect it and so it reflects and forms\n17:35\nreality accordingly with the image\n17:38\nreflection\n17:39\nand then they observe the reflection\n17:42\nagain and then they keep staying stuck\n17:44\nwith this so This Is The Vicious\n17:46\nfeedback loop most people are in they\n17:48\nlook around them they're like oh bills\n17:50\noh job I don't like this sucks I hate\n17:55\nthis I hate this job I hate the bills I\n17:57\nhate all of it I hate staying stuck here\n17:59\nI've been stuck here forever oh you've\n18:01\nbeen stuck here with this Revenue level\n18:03\nyou've been stuck here at this job here\n18:05\nyou go here's more stuckness here's more\n18:08\nbuilds here's more of this current\n18:11\nRevenue level that you're at damn it it\n18:13\nkeeps happening again and again I don't\n18:15\nknow what I'm doing wrong and then you\n18:17\ntry the different tactics and strategies\n18:19\nyou try the business strategies you try\n18:21\nstarting up a new Drop Shipping business\n18:24\na new funnel or a new ad strategy and\n18:26\nnothing works right like it clicks for a\n18:29\nlittle bit it gets you all excited but\n18:30\nthen you fall back into this pattern\n18:32\nbecause you can't make an internal\n18:34\nchange there is no foundational change\n18:36\nhappening for you in terms of your world\n18:38\nview and your identity so the way to do\n18:41\nthis is to reverse this process for most\n18:44\npeople they begin here this is one this\n18:47\nis two and this is three this is the\n18:51\ncycle for the puppets if you want to\n18:54\nbecome a reality Creator this is how you\n18:57\nreverse this cycle this is what I had to\n18:59\ndo\n19:00\nWe Begin here with the image that we'd\n19:02\nlike to form we turn away from the\n19:04\nreflections we turn away from looking at\n19:07\nour current reality because we begin to\n19:09\nrealize what's around us right now was\n19:11\nmerely formed from decisions made in the\n19:13\npast you have to realize this or else\n19:15\nnothing will change if I want to form\n19:17\ntomorrow I choose today consciously so\n19:19\nwe begin here with the image and when we\n19:22\nchoose the image and we say hey this is\n19:25\nwhat I want and this is what I have the\n19:28\nmirror has no choice but to begin\n19:29\nreflecting it in little amounts little\n19:32\nby little little changes will happen\n19:34\nslowly with a delay and then what we do\n19:38\nnow instead of observing is we confirm\n19:41\nwe Peak we simply peek into the mirror\n19:44\nto look at hey what's working oh this is\n19:47\nworking oh look that has happened oh\n19:49\nlook I wanted to be a confident person\n19:50\nhere look people are receiving me much\n19:52\nbetter oh look I wanted to improve this\n19:54\naspect of my business it's improving I\n19:56\nwanted to improve this aspect of my golf\n19:58\ngame it's improving your whole world\n20:00\ncould be breaking apart but you only\n20:01\nfocus on the things that you'd like to\n20:03\nconfirm the things that correspond with\n20:06\nthis world view and identity that you've\n20:09\nchosen to craft and then you keep using\n20:11\nthat and I swear the more you keep doing\n20:14\nthis it snowballs into something that is\n20:16\ngoing to be beyond anything you've\n20:18\nimagined like when I started off I\n20:20\ndidn't want a seven-figure business I\n20:22\ndidn't want any of this I just wanted it\n20:24\nto have freedom for my nine to five and\n20:26\nall I needed to do was earn 5K a month\n20:30\nto be able to replace what I was getting\n20:32\npaid in that dead end engineering career\n20:34\nthat's what I wanted but now we're doing\n20:36\nsix figure months which was completely\n20:38\nblew my mind how all of this stuff works\n20:40\nso if you begin to use these principles\n20:43\nyour life will completely change I can\n20:45\npromise you that okay so now I want to\n20:47\nshare with you three case studies of\n20:50\nclients of ours who have used these four\n20:54\nlaws of the mirror to completely and\n20:57\ndrastically change their lives let's\n20:59\nbegin with our client Tia when Tia\n21:01\njoined us she was in six figure student\n21:04\nloan debt and she was working two\n21:07\nfull-time jobs 80 hours a week and in\n21:09\none of them she couldn't even stand up\n21:11\nto her boss because you know she was\n21:12\ndoing something she didn't like to do so\n21:15\nshe was mainly struggling with a lack of\n21:16\nconfidence in herself and lack of\n21:18\nclarity on how she would get out of it\n21:21\nand how she would create what she wanted\n21:23\nfor herself and she has kids she has a\n21:25\nhusband and she couldn't spend any time\n21:27\nwith her family after we helped her\n21:30\noperate through these four principles\n21:32\nand shift her identity get clear on what\n21:35\nshe wanted and only focus on that\n21:37\nremember law number one of the mirror\n21:40\nlaws she now makes 40K a month with her\n21:43\nown business two years later and she\n21:45\ngets to spend more time with her family\n21:46\nmore time with her children and she's\n21:49\nvery passionate and very happy about\n21:51\nwhat she's doing instead of stuck in two\n21:53\ndead-end jobs and feeling burned out\n21:54\ntake our client Luis who has her own\n21:57\nmarketing business and during the\n21:59\npandemic her old job was deemed\n22:02\ncompletely irrelevant and it was wiped\n22:04\nout so she transitioned out and tried to\n22:06\nstart it and grow her business but she\n22:07\ncouldn't make it past the six figure\n22:09\nMark she was stuck around 10K a month\n22:12\nand what she was lacking was Clarity and\n22:15\nas a result confidence she couldn't\n22:17\npresent her services with certainty she\n22:20\ndidn't know where to get clients and she\n22:22\ndidn't know who she really wanted to\n22:24\nwork with after working together after\n22:26\nimplementing the mirror principle she\n22:28\nnow makes 30k a month doing what she\n22:30\nwanted and by the way principle number\n22:33\ntwo was very important to her because\n22:34\nshe was about to give up and she was\n22:36\ncompletely done with it and all of a\n22:38\nsudden just when she was giving up boom\n22:40\neverything started to fall right into\n22:42\nplace because she eliminated all of the\n22:44\nimportance on all the meaning that she\n22:46\nhad to whatever she wanted to do number\n22:49\nthree take our client Bastion Bastion\n22:51\nwas an agency owner with his own digital\n22:54\nmarketing agency and he was doing around\n22:55\n20K a month when he joined us his\n22:57\nbiggest problem was the niche that he\n22:59\nwas working in he was completely\n23:01\nnot passionate about it he hated it and\n23:04\nhe was just unclear about the direction\n23:06\nhe wanted to go in and he also had a big\n23:08\ncase of self-doubt when he presented his\n23:11\nservice on his offer he was incompetent\n23:13\nin himself and whether or not he would\n23:15\nbe able to get that result for his\n23:16\nclient because he wasn't confident and\n23:19\nhe wasn't clear around what he wanted\n23:21\nfor his life after we helped him fix\n23:23\nthat implement the mere principles he's\n23:26\ndoing over half a million a month now\n23:28\nhe's completely changed as a person and\n23:31\nthis mirror principle\n23:32\nlearning how to observe and confirm the\n23:35\ncycle was super important to him so look\n23:37\nnow I have a very very important\n23:39\nquestion for you are

      "content": "The speaker discusses the idea that the outer world is a reflection of our internal world and presents the \"mirror principle\" as a powerful way to manifest one's desired reality. They explain that trying to directly impact the reflection of our circumstances through manipulation is not effective, and instead we should learn to indirectly change the reflection by presenting a different image to it. The speaker then outlines four laws and four keys to unlocking them in order to effectively utilize the mirror principle and manifest one's desired reality. They also provide case studies of individuals who have used the mirror principle to bring about positive changes in their lives."
