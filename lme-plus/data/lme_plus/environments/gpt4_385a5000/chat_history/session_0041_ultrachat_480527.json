      "content": "The Bauhaus movement impacted modern design in several ways:\n\n1. Emphasis on functionality: The Bauhaus movement promoted the design of objects that are functional over those that are purely decorative. This approach led to the creation of sleek and simple designs that were efficient and practical.\n\n2. Integration of art and technology: The Bauhaus movement believed that art and technology should work together to create innovative designs. This approach led to the development of new materials, such as steel and glass, that were incorporated into modern buildings and products.\n\n3. Minimalism and simplicity: The Bauhaus movement promoted minimalism and simplicity in design. This approach led to the creation of clean lines, geometric shapes, and a focus on form over ornamentation.\n\n4. Experimentation and innovation: The Bauhaus movement encouraged experimentation and innovation in design. This led to the development of new techniques and methods that are still used in modern design today.\n\nOverall, the Bauhaus movement had a significant impact on modern design by promoting functionality, integration of art and technology, minimalism, simplicity, experimentation, and innovation."
