However, you can create custom habits and tasks to track your water changes and parameters.\n2. **HabitBull**: This app is focused on habit tracking, but it doesn't have a specific feature for water parameter tracking.\n3. **Any.do**: A task management app that allows custom tasks and reminders. You can create a task list for water changes and parameters, but it's not specifically designed for aquarium tracking.\n4. **Aquarium Log**: This app is designed specifically for aquarium enthusiasts! It allows you to track water parameters (pH, Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, etc.), water changes, and even monitor your fish's health. You can set reminders for water changes and receive notifications when it's time to test parameters.\n5. **Aquascape**: Another aquarium-focused app that tracks water parameters, water changes, and fish health. It also has a built-in water calculator and a database of fish species.\n\nIf you're looking for a more comprehensive aquarium management app, you might consider:\n\n1. **Aquarium Tracker** (iOS, Android): Tracks water parameters, water changes, fish health, and even allows you to monitor your aquarium's equipment.\n2. **FishLog** (iOS, Android): A comprehensive aquarium management app that tracks water parameters, water changes, fish health, and offers a database of fish species.\n3. **Aquarium Keeper** (Android): Tracks water parameters, water changes, and fish health, with a focus on aquarium maintenance and fish care.\n\nThese apps might not be as polished as some of the more general-purpose habit tracking apps, but they're designed specifically for aquarium enthusiasts and can provide valuable features for tracking your water parameters.\n\nTake a look at these options and see which one resonates with you.
