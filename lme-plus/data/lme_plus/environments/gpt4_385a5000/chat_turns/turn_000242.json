  "content": "Creating a separate album for your beach trip sunsets is a great idea, as it's a specific theme that can be showcased beautifully.\n\nFor your overall album structure, it's a good idea to strike a balance between granularity and simplicity. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to help you decide:\n\n**Sub-albums for each day of the trip:**\n\nPros:\n\n* You can easily see the progression of your trip day by day.\n* You can relive the memories of each day's activities and events.\n\nCons:\n\n* You may end up with a large number of sub-albums, which can be overwhelming.\n* It might be difficult to find specific photos if you're looking for a particular theme or activity.\n\n**Broader categories like \"Beach,\" \"Town,\" and \"Food\":**\n\nPros:\n\n* You'll have fewer, more general categories, making it easier to navigate.\n* You can group similar photos together, making it easier to find what you're looking for.\n\nCons:\n\n* You might lose the context of each day's events and activities.\n* You might end up with a large number of photos in each category, making it hard to find specific shots.\n\nHere's a suggested compromise:\n\n**Hybrid approach:**\n\n* Create broad categories like \"Beach,\" \"Town,\" and \"Food\" as top-level albums.\n* Within each category, create sub-albums for specific activities or themes, such as:\n\t+ \"Beach\" > \"Sunsets,\" \"Surfing,\" \"Beach Walks\"\n\t+ \"Town\" > \"Shopping,\" \"Dining,\" \"Landmarks\"\n\t+ \"Food\" > \"Breakfast,\" \"Lunch,\" \"Dinner\"\n\nThis approach gives you a good balance between granularity and simplicity. You can still see the overall structure of your trip, while also being able to drill down to specific themes and activities.\n\nFor your sunset photos, you could create a sub-album within the \"Beach\" category, like \"Beach\" > \"Sunsets\" > \"Day 1,\" \"Day 2,\" etc. This way, you can still see the progression of sunsets throughout your trip, while keeping them organized within the broader \"Beach\" category.\n\nRemember, the key is to create an album structure that makes sense to you and is easy to navigate. You can always adjust it later if you find that it's not working for you.",
