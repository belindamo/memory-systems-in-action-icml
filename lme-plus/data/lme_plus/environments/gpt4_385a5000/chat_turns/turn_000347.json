  "content": "Sawing someone in half is indeed a classic magic trick called the sawing illusion. The trick involves an assistant lying on a table with their feet and head sticking out. The magician (or his assistant) then slides a saw blade through a gap in the table, seemingly sawing the assistant in half.\n\nHowever, in reality, the assistant's body is not being cut in half. The table has two hidden compartments, one that the assistant's upper body goes into, and the other for their lower body. The assistant is not cut into two. Instead, their body is simply concealed inside the table.\n\nThe illusion works because audiences are distracted by the sawing action and do not notice that the saw blade is either moving between the concealed compartments or is not sharp at all.\n\nMost modern performances of the trick feature a specially-designed sawblade with no teeth to remain clean and prop-like. Furthermore, the secret remains the same - the compartments allow the illusion to work like magic to the audience.",
