  "content": "Congratulations on successfully introducing your neon tetras to your 10-gallon tank! That's a great start.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a compatible fish to add to your school of neon tetras, there are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Similar water requirements**: Neon tetras are native to soft, slightly acidic waters in South America. Look for fish that thrive in similar conditions (pH 6.5-7.5, soft to moderate water hardness).\n2. **Peaceful and small**: Neon tetras are small, peaceful fish. Avoid introducing larger, aggressive, or fin-nipping fish that might harass them.\n3. **Schooling behavior**: Since neon tetras are schooling fish, it's best to introduce other fish that also school or are comfortable in a community setting.\n\nHere are some compatible fish species that might get along well with your neon tetras:\n\n1. **Harlequin rasboras** (Trigonostigma heteromorpha): These small, peaceful fish are easy to care for and add a nice splash of color to your tank.\n2. **White cloud mountain minnows** (Tanichthys albonubes): These hardy, active fish are tolerant of changes in water conditions and make a great addition to a community tank.\n3. **Dwarf gouramis** (Colisa lalia): While some gouramis can be aggressive, dwarf gouramis are generally peaceful and can thrive in a community setting.\n4. **Corydoras catfish** (Corydoras spp.): These small, armored catfish are great bottom-dwellers that can help with cleaning up food debris and are peaceful cohabitants.\n5. **Honey gouramis** (Colisa chuna): Similar to dwarf gouramis, honey gouramis are peaceful and can add a nice splash of color to your tank.\n\nRemember to research each species' specific needs and ensure that your tank can accommodate their requirements. Also, introduce new fish slowly and in small numbers to prevent stress and territorial behavior.\n\nWhich of these species catches your eye, or do you have another fish in mind?",
