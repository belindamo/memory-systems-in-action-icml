  "content": "Congratulations on starting your seedlings indoors! It's exciting to see them grow.\n\nTo determine the average soil temperature for your area, I'll need to know your location or zip code. Soil temperature varies depending on factors like latitude, elevation, and climate. Once I have your location, I can provide you with the average soil temperature for your area.\n\nIn general, most vegetables and flowers prefer soil temperatures between 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C) for optimal growth. Here are some general guidelines for the soil temperatures required for different plants:\n\n* Tomatoes: 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) to 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C)\n* Peppers: 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C) to 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C)\n* Cucumbers: 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C) to 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C)\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and the specific soil temperature requirements may vary depending on the specific variety of your plants.\n\nOnce you're ready to plant out your seedlings, make sure to harden them off first by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions over the course of 7-10 days. This will help them adjust to the change in temperature, light, and humidity.\n\nPlease share your location or zip code, and I'll do my best to provide you with the average soil temperature for your area.",
