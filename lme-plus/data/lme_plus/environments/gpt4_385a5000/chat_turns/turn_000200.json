  "content": "The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the late 1700s and early 1800s, but it took several decades for the changes to really make a significant impact on society. Initially, the new manufacturing methods were confined to a few industries, such as textiles, but they gradually spread to other industries such as iron and steel. By the mid-19th century, industrialization had become widespread in many European countries and some parts of North America. The Industrial Revolution had multiple effects on society, including changes to the economy, social structure, and working conditions. The effects of the Industrial Revolution were felt for decades, and its impact on modern society can still be seen today.",
