  "content": "When it comes to stocking Corydoras catfish in a 10-gallon tank, a good rule of thumb is to start with a small school of 6-8 individuals. This will allow them to establish a comfortable social hierarchy and provide a good cleaning service for your tank.\n\nAs for the ratio of Cory cats to neon tetras, a general guideline is to aim for 1-2 Corydoras catfish per 5-6 neon tetras. This will ensure that the Cory cats have enough space to roam and forage for food without feeling overwhelmed by the more active, schooling tetras.\n\nFor your 10-gallon tank, you could consider the following stocking scenario:\n\n* 6-8 Corydoras catfish (e.g., 6 Corydoras paleatus or 8 Corydoras hastatus)\n* 15-20 neon tetras (assuming you already have a established school)\n\nThis will provide a good balance between the two species and create a interesting, dynamic environment in your tank. Remember to monitor the bioload and water parameters, and adjust the stocking levels accordingly.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Corydoras catfish are social creatures and prefer to be in a school, so it's best to introduce them in a group rather than individually.\n* Neon tetras are also schooling fish and should be kept in a group of at least 10-15 individuals to reduce stress and promote natural behavior.\n* Make sure to provide plenty of hiding places, plants, and visual barriers to help the Cory cats feel secure and reduce competition for space with the neon tetras.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to create a thriving, harmonious community in your 10-gallon tank!",
