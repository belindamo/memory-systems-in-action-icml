  "content": "The 23456 zip code is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nAccording to historical climate data, the average soil temperature in your area during late March to early April is around 48\u00b0F (9\u00b0C) to 52\u00b0F (11\u00b0C). However, this can vary from year to year, and it's not uncommon for soil temperatures to fluctuate by 2-3\u00b0F (1-2\u00b0C) from day to day.\n\nAs you're planning to plant out your seedlings soon, keep an eye on the weather forecast and wait for a spell of warm weather to increase the soil temperature. You can also take steps to warm up the soil, such as:\n\n1. Mulching: Apply a layer of organic mulch, like straw or grass clippings, to retain heat and moisture in the soil.\n2. Black plastic or row covers: Use black plastic or row covers to trap heat and warm up the soil. These can be removed once the seedlings are planted and the soil has warmed up.\n3. Cold frames or hoop houses: If you have a cold frame or hoop house, use it to extend the growing season and warm up the soil.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been fertilizing your seedlings with a balanced fertilizer and maintaining the right soil moisture levels. This will help them develop strong roots and prepare them for outdoor conditions.\n\nBefore planting out, make sure to harden off your seedlings as I mentioned earlier. This will help them adjust to outdoor conditions and reduce the risk of shock.\n\nOnce you've planted out your seedlings, keep an eye on the weather and be prepared to provide support or protection if needed. Good luck, and happy gardening!",
