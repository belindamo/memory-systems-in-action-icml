Congratulations on getting them to germinate so quickly!\n\nNow, about planting your tomatoes and other seedlings outside...\n\nThe ideal temperature for planting tomatoes and other warm-season crops outside depends on the specific variety, but generally, you want to wait until the soil has warmed up and the air temperature is consistently above a certain threshold.\n\nFor tomatoes, the ideal temperature for planting outside is when the soil temperature reaches around 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) to 60\u00b0F (16\u00b0C). This is usually when the air temperature is around 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) to 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) during the day.\n\nHowever, if you're in a region with frost, you'll want to wait until the last frost date for your area has passed. You can check the average last frost date for your area online.\n\nFor other seedlings, like marigolds, the ideal temperature for planting outside varies. Marigolds are relatively hardy and can tolerate cooler temperatures, but they still prefer warmer weather. A good rule of thumb is to wait until the soil temperature reaches around 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C) to 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) for marigolds.\n\nBefore planting, make sure to harden off your seedlings by gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions over the course of 7-10 days. This will help them adjust to sunlight, wind, and temperature fluctuations.\n\nRemember to also check the specific instructions for each type of seedling or plant you're growing, as some may have different requirements.\n\nGood luck with your planting, and I hope your marigolds continue to thrive!",
