  "content": "While opinions about storylines can be subjective, I can give you an idea of which movies on the list have a similar balance of visual effects and storyline.\n\n**Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets** (2017) is a great example of a movie that, like \"The Adam Project,\" has stunning visual effects that might make up for some narrative shortcomings. The movie's storyline has received mixed reviews, but the visual effects, world-building, and action sequences are widely praised.\n\n**Passengers** (2016) is another movie that has a similar balance. While the storyline has its flaws, the visual effects, cinematography, and production design are top-notch. The movie's visuals are breathtaking, and the spaceship, Avalon, is a character in its own right.\n\n**Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2** (2017) has a more balanced mix of visual effects and storyline. The movie's visuals are stunning, with vibrant colors, impressive action sequences, and lovable characters. The storyline is engaging, with a focus on character development and relationships.\n\n**Dune** (2021) has a more complex balance. The movie's visual effects, world-building, and production design are all highly praised, but the storyline is dense and might not appeal to everyone. If you're familiar with the source material or enjoy complex sci-fi, you might appreciate the movie's ambition. If not, the visuals alone might not be enough to carry the movie.\n\nThe other movies on the list have a more even balance between visual effects and storyline. **Tenet**, **Blade Runner 2049**, **Arrival**, and **Interstellar** are all critically acclaimed for their thought-provoking storylines, strong characters, and impressive visual effects. **Ad Astra** has a more introspective, slower-burning storyline, but the visuals are still stunning, and the movie's themes are thought-provoking.\n\nUltimately, the balance between visual effects and storyline is subjective, so you might find that one of these movies resonates with you more than others.",
