Can you highlight multiple reasons why it worked well (in bullet point format)?\n\nPersonal Statement:\nENTOPTIC PHENOMENA\nI subscribe to what the New York Times dubs \u201cthe most welcomed piece of daily e-mail in cyberspace.\u201d Cat pictures? Kardashian updates? Nope: A Word A Day.\n\nOut of the collection of diverse words I received, one word stuck out to me in particular. \n\nEntoptic: relating to images that originate within the eye (as opposed to from light entering the eye). Examples of entoptic phenomena: floaters, thread-like fragments that appear to float in front of the eye but are caused by matter within the eye. (for a picture: https://wordsmith.org/words/entoptic.html)\n\nAs I read through this entry, I was suddenly transported back to the first grade, when I was playing Pok\u00e9mon Go one day with my friends during recess. Our version was epic: we escaped into virtual reality with our imagination rather than our phone screens, morphing into different Pok\u00e9mon to do battle.\n\nMy friend Ryan had just transformed into an invisible ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon capable of evading my attacks. Flustered, I was attempting to evolve my abilities to learn to see the invisible. Between rubbing my eyes and squinting, I began to make out subtle specks in the air that drifted from place to place. Aha\u2014the traces of the ghost Pok\u00e9mon! I launched a thunderbolt straight through the air and declared a super-effective knockout.\n\n...Of course, I never was able to explain what I was seeing to my bewildered friends that day in first grade. But after learning about entoptic phenomena, I realized that my entoptic adventure was not a hallucination but, in fact, one of my first intellectual milestones, when I was first able to connect meticulous observation of my environment to my imagination.\n\nNowadays, I don\u2019t just see minuscule entoptic phenomena: I see ghosts, too. Two of their names are Larry and Kailan, and they are the top-ranked players in the Exynos League.\n\nExynos is the name of the elaborate basketball league I have created in my imagination over the last ten years of playing basketball on the neighborhood court in the evenings. As I play, I envision Larry and Kailan right there with me: reaching, stealing, and blocking. Undoubtedly, I might look a little silly when I throw the ball backwards as if Larry blocked my layup attempt\u2014but imagining competitors defending me drives me to be precise in my execution of different moves and maneuvers. More than that, it is a constant motivator for all my endeavors: whether I\u2019m researching for debate or studying for the next math contest, I am inventing and personifying new competitive ghosts that are hard at work every minute I\u2019m off task.\n\nBut I perceive perhaps the most vivid images through music, as I tell a different story with each piece I play on the violin. When I play Bach\u2019s lively Prelude in E Major, for example, I visualize a mouse dashing up and down hills and through mazes to escape from an evil cat (\u00e0 la Tom and Jerry). But when I play Tchaikovsky\u2019s Violin Concerto, I describe a relationship plagued by unrequited love. I revel in the intellectual challenge of coming up with a story that is not only consistent with the composer\u2019s annotations but also resonates with my own experiences.\n\nBetween re-living Tom and Jerry episodes and shooting fadeaway three-pointers against ghosts, then, perhaps entoptic phenomena don\u2019t tell my whole story. So, here\u2019s my attempt\u2014in the form of a word of the day, of course:\n\nPok\u00e9mon Boom: a legendary form of augmented reality so pure that it is commonly mistaken for hallucination. Denizens of this world are rumored to watch Netflix re-runs without WiFi and catch many a Pikachu via psychokinesis.",
