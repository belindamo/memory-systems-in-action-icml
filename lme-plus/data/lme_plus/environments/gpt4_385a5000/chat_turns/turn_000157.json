Keep watching to find out what it is.\n\nFirst, let's talk about calories. \n\nWhen it comes to weight loss, calories are king. \n\nYou need to burn more calories than you consume in order to lose weight.\n\nThat's where the concept of calorie deficit comes in. In other words, you need to eat fewer calories than you burn in order to lose weight. \n\nHowever, there's a common misconception that you need to eat as little as possible in order to create a calorie deficit.\n\nThe truth is, if you restrict your calories too much, your body will go into starvation mode and slow down your metabolism to conserve energy, making it harder to lose weight. \n\nSo how can you create a calorie deficit without starving yourself? \n\nThe answer is to eat more of the right foods, specifically foods that are high in protein, fiber, and water content can help boost your metabolism and help you burn more calorie.\n\nSome examples of these foods include lean proteins. \n\nThis can include chicken, which is loaded with protein and is lower in calories than other protein choices since it is lean and low in fat. \n\nFish that is high in omega-3. Fatty acids like salmon, tuna, and trout, can support brain function and are linked to reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer.\n\nAnd finally, legumes. This includes beans, lentils, peas, and chick. Along with whole grains like brown rice and quinoa, they are a nutrient rich food that offers high protein and fiber. \n\nAlso, make sure to include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet as these are high in fiber and other important nutrients.\n\nBy eating more of the right foods, you can actually boost your metabolism and lose weight more effectively. \n\nAnd the best part, you'll feel fuller and more satisfied throughout the. \n\nSo you won't have to rely on willpower to resist unhealthy snacks and treats. \n\nIn addition to eating the right foods, portion control is key.\n\nEating too much of even the healthiest foods can still lead to weight gain. \n\nSo make sure to keep an eye on your portion sizes and aim for balanced meals that include protein, complex carbs, healthy fats, and lots of veggies. \n\nLet's see how we can put this all into action by following these steps. \n\nPLAN AHEAD\n\nTake some time each week to plan out your meals and snacks. \n\nThis will help you make sure you have healthy nutrient dense foods on hand when hunger strikes. \n\nKEEP HEALTHY SNACKS ON HAND\n\nWhen you're in a rush or on the go. It's easy to reach for unhealthy snacks like chips or candy. \n\nInstead, keep healthy snacks like fruit, nuts or veggie sticks on hand for a quick, easy, and nutritious snack.\n\nUSE HERBS AND SPICES TO ADD FLAVOR \n\nEating healthy doesn't have to be boring. \n\nExperiment with different herbs and spices to add flavor to your meals without adding extra calories or unhealthy fats. \n\nCHOOSE LEAN PROTEINS \n\nWhen it comes to protein. Choose lean options like chicken, fish, tofu, or legum. These foods are high in protein, but low in unhealthy fats.\n\nFILL UP ON FIBER \n\nFiber is key for keeping you feeling full and satisfied, which can help you stick to your calorie goals. \n\nAim for plenty of fiber rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.\n\nBE MINDFUL OF PORTION SIZES \n\nEven healthy foods can add up if you eat too much of them. \n\nUse smaller plates and bowls to help you control your portion sizes, and aim to fill half your plate with veggies at each meal. \n\nRemember, making healthy choices is all about balance and finding what works best for your body and lifestyle. \n\nBy incorporating more metabolism, boosting foods into your diet and making healthy choices, you'll be on your way to a healthier, happier you in no time.\n\nSo have you been able to guess what our bonus tip is yet?\n\nDon't worry, we'll get to it in just a minute. \n\nBut first, make sure to hit that like button and let us know in the comments below if you've ever tried incorporating these metabolism boosting foods into your diet. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends.\n\nAnd if you wanna see more health and fitness tips, don't forget to subscribe to our channel and hit that notification bell. \n\nWe love hearing from our viewers, so leave a comment and let us know what you'd like to see next. \n\nNow, here's a bonus tip that can take your weight loss efforts to the next level. \n\nDrink enough water.\n\nWe will make this our last action step.\n\nDRINK PLENTY OF WATER \n\nStaying hydrated is important for overall health and can help boost your metabolism. \n\nAim for at least eight glasses of water a day and try to swap out sugary drinks for water whenever possible. \n\nMaking sure to stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking plenty of water will turbo charge your healthy weight loss journey. \n\nSo there you have it folks. \n\nEating more of the right foods. \n\nPracticing portion control and\n\nstaying hydrated can all help you create a calorie deficit and achieve your weight loss goals. \n\nThanks for watching everyone. \n\nIf you wanna continue learning about healthy weight loss, check out our next video in this series.\n\nAnd don't forget to sign up for our free email course on healthy Weight Loss. \n\nYou will find a link below in the comments. \n\nSee you next time.\"\n\nPlease suggest the b-roll/stock video clips/stock photos , then include the script text for each line in the script.\n\nUse the layout of:\n[Visual] write your suggestion here.\n\n[Script] Repeat the script text here.\n\n[Visual] write your suggestion here.\n\n[Script] Repeat the script text here.\n\n...\nPlease write in English language.",
