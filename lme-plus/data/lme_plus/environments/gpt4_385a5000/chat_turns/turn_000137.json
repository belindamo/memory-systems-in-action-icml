Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Basic Quinoa Cooking Method:**\n\n**Ratio:** 2 cups water or milk to 1 cup quinoa\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Rinse quinoa**: Quinoa has a natural coating called saponin that can give it a bitter taste. Rinsing it before cooking can help remove some of this coating. Rinse the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water, and drain well.\n2. **Add quinoa and liquid**: In a medium saucepan, add the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of water or milk (you can use any type of milk, including almond or soy milk).\n3. **Bring to a boil**: Place the saucepan over high heat and bring the mixture to a boil.\n4. **Reduce heat and simmer**: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the water is absorbed.\n5. **Fluff with a fork**: Once the quinoa is cooked, remove the lid and fluff it with a fork to separate the grains.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a medium saucepan to prevent the quinoa from cooking too quickly or burning.\n* Quinoa can be cooked in a rice cooker or Instant Pot as well. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for cooking times.\n* You can also toast quinoa before cooking it to enhance its nutty flavor. Simply heat a tablespoon of oil in the saucepan, add the quinoa, and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, before adding the liquid.\n\nFor your Cinnamon Apple Quinoa Breakfast Bowl, you can cook the quinoa according to the above method, then mix it with diced apple, almond butter, honey, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.\n\nIf you're short on time, you can also cook quinoa in advance and refrigerate or freeze it for later use. Cooked quinoa can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months.\n\nHow's that? Are you ready to give quinoa a try?",
