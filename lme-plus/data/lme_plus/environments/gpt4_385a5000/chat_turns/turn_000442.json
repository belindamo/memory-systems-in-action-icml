  "content": "This is what someone else had to say about this essay and why it worked well, can you summarize this person's opinion in bullet points?\n\nOpinion on why this essay worked well:\nIt makes tons of uncommon connections. Think about the range of topics covered in this piece: words, Pok\u00e9mon, basketball, ghosts, debate, math, and music (to name just a few). Yet the author uses the idea of imagination and its relation to vision to weave these disparate topics into a coherent narrative. In fact, his ability to do so emphasizes his ability to think creatively in ways that the average person may not. To find these, consider brainstorming everything you want colleges to know about you and then think of interesting ways in which these might intersect. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t try to be overly intellectual. This essay spends most of its time talking about things that we wouldn\u2019t traditionally consider \u201cacademic\u201d or \u201ccollege-y.\u201d In fact, at least a third of it is devoted solely to Pok\u00e9mon. The author briefly touches on his interest in math and debate, but otherwise it\u2019s used more as a short example than a key point. The takeaway is: you don\u2019t have to talk about classes or academic interests to write a killer essay. You absolutely can if you want to, but feel free to let your imagination run wild. If something excites or intrigues you, try writing a draft about it and see where it takes you.\n\nIt\u2019s specific to the author. The combination of examples and insights you see in this essay truly couldn\u2019t have been written by anyone else. Imagine you\u2019re the admissions officer reading this application. It would absolutely stand out from the other essays in the bunch. Sure, other people play basketball. Sure, other people might like Pok\u00e9mon or enjoy music. But, the particular way in which the author articulates his interests and connects them makes it memorable.",
