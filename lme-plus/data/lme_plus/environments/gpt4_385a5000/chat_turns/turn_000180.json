Please follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Access your YouTube watch history**\n\n1. Sign in to your YouTube account.\n2. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner.\n3. Select \"YouTube Studio\" from the dropdown menu.\n4. Click on \"Analytics\" in the left-hand menu.\n5. Scroll down to the \"Reach\" tab.\n6. Click on \"Watch time\" and then \"Watch history\" from the dropdown menu.\n\n**Step 2: Filter by channel**\n\n1. In your watch history, click on the \"Filters\" button at the top right corner.\n2. Select \"Channel\" from the dropdown menu.\n3. Type \"GentleWhispering\" in the search bar and select the channel from the results.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total watch time**\n\n1. Look at the list of videos from GentleWhispering's channel in your watch history.\n2. Note the duration of each video in the \"Duration\" column.\n3. Add up the durations of all the videos to get the total watch time.\n\nFor example, if you have 10 videos from GentleWhispering in your watch history, and their durations are:\n\n* Video 1: 20 minutes\n* Video 2: 15 minutes\n* Video 3: 30 minutes\n* ...\n* Video 10: 25 minutes\n\nThe total watch time would be: 20 + 15 + 30 + ... + 25 = 150 minutes\n\n**Step 4: Convert minutes to hours (optional)**\n\nIf you want to see the total watch time in hours, you can convert the minutes to hours by dividing the total minutes by 60.\n\nIn this example, 150 minutes \u00f7 60 = 2.5 hours\n\nSo, you've spent approximately 2.5 hours watching GentleWhispering's videos.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an estimate, as you might have watched some videos multiple times or paused them during playback. However, this method should give you a good idea of how much time you've spent watching GentleWhispering's content.",
