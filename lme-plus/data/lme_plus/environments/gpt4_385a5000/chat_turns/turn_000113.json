  "content": "Transplanting seedlings can be a delicate process, but with some care, you can minimize the risk of shocking them. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you transplant your seedlings, including marigolds, into larger pots:\n\n1. **Prepare the new pots**: Choose pots that are only 1-2 sizes larger than the current ones. This will prevent the soil from becoming too wet and reduce the risk of root rot. Make sure the new pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil.\n2. **Water the seedlings**: Water the seedlings well the day before transplanting to make the soil easier to handle and reduce stress.\n3. **Gather materials**: You'll need the new pots, a gentle transplanting tool (like a fork or chopstick), and some fresh potting soil.\n4. **Handle the roots with care**: Gently remove the seedling from its pot, taking care not to disturb the roots. If the roots have grown in a circular pattern, gently tease them apart with your fingers or a blunt instrument to encourage them to grow outward.\n5. **Inspect and trim**: Inspect the roots for any signs of rot or damage. Trim any damaged or rotten roots with sterile scissors or pruning shears to prevent the spread of disease.\n6. **Add fresh potting soil**: Fill the new pot with fresh potting soil, leaving enough space for the seedling's roots. You can also mix in some organic fertilizer or compost to give your seedlings a boost.\n7. **Place the seedling**: Gently place the seedling in the new pot, making sure the soil level is the same as it was in the original pot. Add or remove soil as needed to achieve the right level.\n8. **Firm the soil**: Gently firm the soil around the roots to secure the seedling in place. Make sure not to compact the soil too much, as this can cause waterlogging and root rot.\n9. **Water thoroughly**: Water the seedling well after transplanting to settle the soil and provide enough moisture.\n10. **Monitor and adjust**: Keep a close eye on your seedlings after transplanting, and adjust their care as needed. Make sure they're getting enough light, water, and nutrients.\n\nSome additional tips to minimize shock:\n\n* Transplant in the morning or late afternoon to avoid direct sunlight, which can cause stress.\n* Avoid transplanting during extreme weather conditions, like intense heat or cold.\n* Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged during the first week after transplanting.\n* Provide support for seedlings that need it, like marigolds, to prevent them from toppling over in their new pots.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you should be able to transplant your seedlings, including your marigolds, without shocking them. Good luck!",
