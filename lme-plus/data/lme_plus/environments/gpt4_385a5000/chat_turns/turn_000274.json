  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions. However, it's important to acknowledge that there has been a movement towards acceptance and accommodation of neurodivergent individuals in recent years. There has been a growing awareness of the strengths and challenges associated with different neurocognitive conditions, and more discussions about how to support individuals with these conditions.\n\nMany organizations and schools have implemented accommodations and inclusion policies to support neurodivergent individuals, such as providing sensory-friendly environments, providing extra time for tasks or exams, and offering social skills training.\n\nThere is also a growing neurodiversity movement that advocates for the acceptance and inclusion of neurodivergent individuals in society. This movement seeks to promote the understanding that neurodivergent individuals are a natural variation in human diversity rather than a disorder or deficit.\n\nHowever, there is still much work to be done to fully accept and accommodate neurodivergent individuals. There are still many misconceptions and stereotypes about different neurocognitive conditions, and many individuals still face discrimination and challenges in accessing support and opportunities.",
