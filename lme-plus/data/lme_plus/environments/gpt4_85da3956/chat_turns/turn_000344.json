And I like the idea of rolling my necklaces to prevent tangling. I have a few that are always getting knotted up.\n\nBy the way, speaking of necklaces, I lent my pearl necklace to my sister for her job interview two weeks ago. I hope she remembers to give it back to me soon. Do you have any tips on how to politely remind her to return it?",
