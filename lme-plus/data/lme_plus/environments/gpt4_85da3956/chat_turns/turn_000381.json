Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Unknown Mortal Orchestra** - \"Can't Keep Checking My Phone\" or \"Multi-Love\" for a funky, psychedelic soul sound.\n2. **Pond** - \"30000 Megatons\" or \"Sweep Me Off My Feet\" for a trippy, psych-rock vibe.\n3. **King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard** - \"Am I in Heaven?\" or \"The River\" for a high-energy, psychedelic rock sound.\n4. **Mild High Club** - \"Windowpane\" or \"Homage\" for a jazzy, indie-electronic vibe.\n5. **Temples** - \"Shelter Song\" or \"Keep in the Dark\" for a neo-psychedelic, indie-rock sound.\n\nThese artists and songs should complement the vibe you're aiming for, but feel free to explore and find the perfect fit for your playlist.\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and experiment with different genres and styles until you find the perfect blend.
