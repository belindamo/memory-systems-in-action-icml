I've been listening to a lot of music documentaries on Netflix lately, and they've really inspired me to explore different genres and styles. I think adding some newer tracks will keep the playlist fresh and exciting.\n\nI'm also considering adding some songs that I've been listening to on repeat lately, like Billie Eilish's album \"Happier Than Ever\". I've had it on repeat for weeks, and I think some of those tracks would fit well with the vibe I'm going for.",
