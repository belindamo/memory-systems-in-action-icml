  "content": "In this case, the plaintiff and the defendant had agreed to settle a dispute, and the terms of the settlement were agreed upon by both parties. The settlement was to be formalized in a deed, which was drafted and agreed upon by the parties' solicitors. However, there were issues with the execution of the deed.\n\nThe deed was expressed to be a deed but only one director of the plaintiff company signed it, whereas, under the Corporations Act 2001 and the Conveyancing Act 1919, a company can bind itself by a deed if two directors or a director and a company secretary sign it, and if there is only one director, then that director alone can sign it. The document, therefore, failed to comply with the standards of execution required by law.\n\nThe plaintiff argued that the deed was still binding on the company because it had been delivered to the defendant's solicitor, and the plaintiff was willing to perform its part of the agreement. The plaintiff also argued that the defendant was estopped from denying that the document was a deed because the plaintiff's solicitor had represented to the defendant's solicitor that the deed had been executed.\n\nUltimately, the court found that either by estoppel or ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004. However, the court also noted that the execution of the deed did not comply with the standards required by law, which could have caused issues if the defendant had taken a different view.",
