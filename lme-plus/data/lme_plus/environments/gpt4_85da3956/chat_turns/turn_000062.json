  "content": "There are various types of chemical peels with different ingredients, but here are some commonly used ones and their effects on the skin:\n\n1. Alpha-Hydroxy Acid (AHA) - including glycolic, lactic, and mandelic acid. They exfoliate the top layer of dead skin cells, and boost collagen production, reducing fine lines, sun damage, and uneven skin texture.\n\n2. Beta-Hydroxy Acid (BHA) - such as salicylic acid. They penetrate deeper into the pores and exfoliate the inside of the pores, treating acne, blackheads, and oily skin.\n\n3. Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) - They penetrate deeper into the skin, reaching the middle layer (dermis), and are commonly used for treating fine wrinkles, sun damage, and mild skin discoloration.\n\n4. Phenol - strongest type of chemical peel intended for severe wrinkles, and sun damage. They deeply penetrate the skin, targeting the dermis, stimulating collagen production, and tightening the skin.\n\nThese ingredients affect the skin dependent on the concentration and application, sought after outcomes, and patient's skin type. The application of the chemical peel exfoliates the skin cells, and promotes the growth of new cells. Chemical peels help treat concerns like fine lines and wrinkles, sun damage, acne, enlarged pores, oily skin, and hyperpigmentation. The result is glowing, smooth, and youthful-looking skin.",
