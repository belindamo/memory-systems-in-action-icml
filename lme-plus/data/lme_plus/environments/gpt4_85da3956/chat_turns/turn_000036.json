  "content": "This is a judgment in the case of Prime Constructions Pty Ltd v Westbridge Investments Pty Ltd, heard in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 2004. The case concerned a dispute over a settlement agreement for goods sold and delivered. The plaintiff had filed a statement of liquidated claim for $11,754.60 in the Local Court, which was disputed by the defendant. The parties were represented by solicitors.\n\nOn 21 January 2004, the plaintiff's solicitor made an offer to settle the matter for the amount claimed, with each party to pay its own costs, and with a deed of release to be entered into between the parties. The defendant's solicitor accepted this offer on 23 January 2004, and a deed of release was agreed upon by the parties. However, the defendant subsequently reconsidered its position and proposed an additional term about a letter from the plaintiff to the proprietor as to the quality of the works that had been done. This led to further correspondence between the solicitors.\n\nThe central issue in the case was whether there was a final settlement of the proceedings. The court found that there was a final settlement, as the terms of the deed and the settlement had been agreed upon, and all that was left was the mechanics of exchanging the deeds and the settlement cheque.\n\nThe court also considered the effect of the document executed on 9 February 2004, which was in the form of a deed. The court found that while the document was expressed to be a deed, it was not properly executed in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act and the Conveyancing Act. However, the court held that either by estoppel or because of ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004, and the consequences flowed as per the terms of the settlement.\n\nThe court ultimately made a declaration that the defendant was bound by the terms of the deed of release and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $11,721.60, the amount referred to in the deed. The defendant was also ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.",
