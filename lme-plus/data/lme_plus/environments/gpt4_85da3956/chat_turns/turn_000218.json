Here's how it typically works:\n\n* Look for attractions with a single-rider line option, usually marked with a separate queue or sign.\n* If you're willing to ride alone, you can join the single-rider line, which is usually much shorter than the regular line.\n* When you reach the front of the single-rider line, you'll be paired with another single rider or fill an empty seat on the ride vehicle.\n* You'll still experience the same ride as everyone else, but you'll save time by not having to wait in the regular line with your entire group.\n\nKeep in mind that not all attractions offer a single-rider line, and some might have limited capacity or restrictions. It's always a good idea to check with park staff or the Six Flags Magic Mountain app to confirm which rides offer this option during your visit.\n\nAs for the Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle show at Universal Studios Hollywood, I'm happy to chat with you about it! However, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't know you caught the show during the \"Summer Nights\" festival. But I can tell you that the Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle is a popular attraction, and many visitors have raved about its magical experience. It's great to hear you enjoyed it with Rachel and Mike!\n\nNow, back to Six Flags Magic Mountain: Are you planning to hit any specific coasters or attractions during your visit? I can offer some tips on how to maximize your day and make the most of your time at the park!",
