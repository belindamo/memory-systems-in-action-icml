  "content": "I love that approach! Balancing older tracks with newer discoveries is a great way to keep your playlist fresh and exciting. And it's awesome that you've been inspired by music documentaries on Netflix - they can be a great way to discover new artists and genres.\n\nBillie Eilish's \"Happier Than Ever\" is an excellent choice to add to your playlist. Her music often has a moody, atmospheric quality that could complement the vibe you're going for. Which specific tracks from the album do you think would fit well with your playlist? \"Getting Older\", \"NDA\", or maybe \"Male Fantasy\"?\n\nAdding newer tracks can also help to create a sense of continuity and flow in your playlist. You might consider grouping newer tracks together or interspersing them with older tracks to create a sense of contrast and surprise.\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and experiment with different genres and styles until you find the perfect blend. Don't be afraid to try out new songs and artists, and don't worry if your playlist evolves over time. The most important thing is to create a playlist that you enjoy and that enhances your road trip experience!\n\nWhat do you think about adding some newer indie or alternative tracks to your playlist? I can suggest some artists and songs that might fit the vibe you're going for.",
