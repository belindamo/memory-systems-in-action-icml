It's a beautiful way to honor your grandmother's memory and add a personal touch to your outfit.\n\nI'm also happy to hear that you're thinking of pairing the locket with your new earrings. I'm sure they'll look lovely together! However, I have to ask, who's Rachel and what was her birthday bash like? You mentioned it earlier, but I didn't get a chance to respond.\n\nFeel free to share more about Rachel's birthday party and your new earrings. I'm all ears!",
