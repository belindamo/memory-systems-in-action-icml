This can be done by using multiple loyalty programs, credit cards, apps, or promotions simultaneously.\n\n**Examples of stacking rewards:**\n\n1. **Credit card and loyalty program**: Use a credit card that offers cashback or points for purchases, and earn rewards through a store's loyalty program. For instance, you could use a Chase Freedom card (5% cashback on groceries) and earn CVS ExtraBucks rewards on your CVS purchases.\n2. **Loyalty program and app**: Combine a store's loyalty program with a rewards app like Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, or Checkout 51. These apps often offer additional cashback or rewards on specific purchases.\n3. **Multiple loyalty programs**: If you have multiple loyalty programs with overlapping categories (e.g., grocery stores), use the program that offers the best rewards for a specific purchase.\n4. **Sign-up offers and ongoing rewards**: Take advantage of sign-up offers or promotions that provide bonus rewards, and then earn ongoing rewards through the loyalty program.\n5. **Portal shopping and cashback**: Use a cashback portal like Ebates, TopCashback, or BeFrugal, which offers cashback on purchases made through their platform. You can then earn additional rewards through the store's loyalty program.\n\n**Your CVS Example:**\n\nWith your CVS ExtraCare rewards, you're already earning $10 in ExtraBucks every three months. To stack rewards, consider the following:\n\n* Use a credit card that offers cashback on pharmacy or drugstore purchases (e.g., 2% cashback on a Citi Double Cash card).\n* Check apps like Ibotta or Fetch Rewards for additional cashback offers on CVS purchases.\n* Look for sign-up offers or promotions that provide bonus rewards for new CVS ExtraCare members or specific purchases.\n* Consider shopping through a cashback portal like Ebates, which offers 2% cashback on CVS purchases.\n\nBy stacking these rewards, you could potentially earn an additional 2-5% cashback on your CVS purchases, on top of your $10 in ExtraBucks rewards.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of each loyalty program, credit card, and app to understand any restrictions or limitations on stacking rewards.\n\nDo you have any other loyalty programs or rewards you'd like to discuss? I'm here to help you maximize your earnings!",
