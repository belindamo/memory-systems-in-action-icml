  "content": "Excellent choices! Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys are great additions to any playlist, and their songs will likely still resonate with your current vibe. Glass Animals and Pale Waves are also fantastic choices, and their unique sounds will add some nice depth to your playlist.\n\nIt's great that you're considering your personal taste and the atmosphere you want to create with your playlist. By incorporating a mix of old favorites and newer discoveries, you'll end up with a playlist that's both nostalgic and fresh.\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and be true to your musical preferences. Don't be afraid to experiment and try out new songs, but also don't hesitate to include tracks that you know and love.\n\nAs you're adding songs to your playlist, you might also consider the flow and pacing of the tracks. You might want to create a playlist that ebbs and flows, with slower songs followed by more upbeat tracks, or vice versa. This can help create a sense of dynamic energy and keep the listener engaged.\n\nBut ultimately, the most important thing is to create a playlist that you enjoy and that enhances your road trip experience. So, go ahead, add those songs, and have fun with it!",
