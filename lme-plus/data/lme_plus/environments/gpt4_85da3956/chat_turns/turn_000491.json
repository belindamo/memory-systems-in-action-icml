  "content": "Garlic and Rosemary Hash Browns are a fantastic match for Stew Sandwiches. \n\nTo minimize greasiness and achieve crispy, golden hash browns, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Squeeze out excess moisture**: After grating the potatoes, wrap them in a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth and squeeze as much moisture as possible. This step helps remove excess starch, which can contribute to greasiness.\n2. **Dry the grated potatoes**: Spread the grated potatoes on a paper towel-lined plate or tray and let them air dry for about 30 minutes. This helps to further remove excess moisture.\n3. **Use the right potato variety**: Choose high-starch potatoes like Russet or Idaho for hash browns. They'll yield a crisper exterior and fluffier interior.\n4. **Don't over-mix**: Mix the grated potatoes, garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper just until they're combined. Over-mixing can cause the potatoes to release more starch, leading to greasiness.\n5. **Use the right amount of oil**: Use a moderate amount of oil in the cast iron skillet, just enough to coat the bottom. You can always add more oil if needed, but it's harder to remove excess oil.\n6. **Cook over medium-high heat**: Cooking the hash browns over medium-high heat will help them brown quickly and crisp up. This will also help to evaporate some of the excess moisture.\n7. **Don't overcrowd**: Cook the hash browns in batches if necessary, to ensure they have enough room to cook evenly. Overcrowding can lead to steam building up and making the hash browns greasy.\n8. **Drain excess oil**: After cooking the hash browns, place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n9. **Don't overcook**: Cook the hash browns until they're golden brown and crispy. Overcooking can cause them to become greasy and soft.\n10. **Season with care**: Season the hash browns with salt and pepper to taste, but avoid adding too much salt, as it can draw out more moisture.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to crispy, flavorful, and relatively grease-free Garlic and Rosemary Hash Browns to accompany your Stew Sandwiches!",
