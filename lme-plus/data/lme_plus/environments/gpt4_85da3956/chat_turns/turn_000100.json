Here are some recommendations to help you organize your listening schedule:\n\n**1. Create a playlist:** Make a playlist of episodes from the history podcasts I recommended earlier (Hardcore History, Lore, and The Dollop). This will allow you to easily switch between episodes and podcasts without having to navigate through multiple apps.\n\n**2. Alternate between podcasts:** To avoid burnout and keep things fresh, consider alternating between podcasts. For example:\n\t* Monday and Tuesday: Listen to Hardcore History\n\t* Wednesday and Thursday: Listen to Lore\n\t* Friday: Listen to The Dollop\n\n**3. Episode length:** Since your commute is 40 minutes each way, you can aim to listen to episodes that are around 30-60 minutes long. This will give you some buffer time to get settled in or wrap up your commute.\n\n**4. Binge-listen:** If you find an episode particularly engaging, feel free to binge-listen to multiple episodes in a row. This can be especially true for Hardcore History, which often has longer episodes that are part of a series.\n\n**5. Take breaks:** Don't be afraid to take breaks from history podcasts if you need a change of pace. You can always come back to them later or try a different type of podcast to mix things up.\n\n**6. Consider the tone:** If you're having a tough morning, you might want to start with a more lighthearted podcast like The Dollop. If you're in the mood for something more in-depth and serious, Hardcore History or Lore might be a better fit.\n\n**7. Make use of your daily commute:** Since you have a consistent commute, try to make the most of it by listening to podcasts regularly. This will help you stay engaged and motivated to learn more about history.\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a listening schedule that works for you and helps you make the most of your daily commute. Happy listening!",
