However, here are some important principles that graphic designers must keep in mind while working on a project:\n\n1. Balance - a composition should have a balance of elements on both the left and the right, as well as the top and the bottom.\n\n2. Contrast - contrast helps make the design elements distinct from each other, and is used to emphasize certain elements.\n\n3. Alignment - all design elements should be properly aligned, either in a grid or in relation to each other, to make the design look cohesive.\n\n4. Proximity - elements that are related to each other should be grouped together to aid in their interpretation.\n\n5. Repetition - repetition of design elements such as color, shape, and typography can help create consistency and establish a visual identity.\n\n6. Hierarchy - elements should be arranged in order of their importance so that the viewers can easily understand the message.\n\n7. Scale and proportion - using different scale and proportion can add visual interest and hierarchy to the design. \n\n8. Color - color theory is an important consideration in graphic design; choosing the right color combinations can help evoke emotions and create contrast.\n\n9. Typography - typography plays a major role in graphic design. Choosing the right fonts and font size can enhance the visual appeal and readability of the text.\n\n10. White space - sometimes keeping minimal design is effective. Using appropriate spacing and letting design elements breathe can enhance the overall composition.",
