  "content": "I'm planning a solo trip to Southeast Asia and I'm considering Bali as one of my destinations. Can you recommend some affordable accommodations in Ubud? By the way, I'm on a tight budget, but I'm looking for a place with a nice atmosphere and decent amenities. I've heard of hostels that offer great value for money, like the one I stayed at during my last trip to Bali - it was only $15 per night and had a beautiful garden and a pool!",
