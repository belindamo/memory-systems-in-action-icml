  "content": "Mercy's ultimate, Valkyrie, is a game-changer in team fights! Improving your ultimate usage can make a huge difference in your team's performance. Here are some tips to help you optimize your Valkyrie usage:\n\n**1. Timing is everything**: Try to use Valkyrie during intense team fights, when your team is clustered together and the enemy team is focused on you. This increases the chances of getting multiple picks and turning the fight around.\n\n**2. Communication is key**: Call out to your team when you're about to use Valkyrie, so they can prepare and take advantage of the ultimate. You can also ask your team to focus a specific target or area.\n\n**3. Positioning is crucial**: Try to position yourself in a safe location, preferably behind your team or near a health pack, to avoid taking unnecessary damage during the ultimate. This also allows you to quickly reposition and respond to changing circumstances.\n\n**4. Prioritize targets**: Focus on high-priority targets, such as enemy healers, damage dealers, or heroes with powerful ultimates. Taking out key targets can significantly impact the team fight's outcome.\n\n**5. Use your beam wisely**: During Valkyrie, your beam's damage and healing output increase. Focus your beam on allies who need healing or damage, and quickly switch between targets as needed.\n\n**6. Keep moving**: Don't stay in one spot for too long, as you'll become an easy target for the enemy team. Use your increased mobility during Valkyrie to reposition and avoid danger.\n\n**7. Coordinate with your team**: Work with your team to set up ambushes or traps, using Valkyrie to amplify your team's damage output or protect them during a push.\n\n**8. Practice, practice, practice**: The more you play Mercy and use Valkyrie, the better you'll become at judging when to use it and how to optimize its effects.\n\n**9. Watch pro players**: Observe how professional Mercy players use Valkyrie in team fights. Analyze their decision-making, positioning, and target prioritization.\n\n**10. Stay flexible**: Be prepared to adapt your ultimate usage based on the game's progression, the enemy team's composition, and your team's needs.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll improve your Valkyrie usage and become a more effective Mercy player in team fights. Good luck, and have fun watching the OWL matches!",
