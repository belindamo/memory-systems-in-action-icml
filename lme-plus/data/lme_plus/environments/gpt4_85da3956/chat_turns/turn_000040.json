  "content": "Section 127(4) of the Corporations Act 2001 in Australia provides that the section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document, including a deed. The paragraph is discussing the different interpretations of what s 127(4) covers, which has been debated by judges in various cases. The judges have noted that it is not clear what s 127(4) covers, but have suggested that it may cover the common law method of executing a deed, the method of execution prescribed by the company's constitution, or a situation where, by virtue of some estoppel, the deed was binding on the company. In Sunbay Projects Pty Ltd v PR Wieland Holdings Pty Ltd, Ann Lyons J noted that there is no requirement for a particular formality when a document is signed by a corporate entity.",
