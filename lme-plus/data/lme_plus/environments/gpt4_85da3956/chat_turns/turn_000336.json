  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I have a lot of different types of jewelry, so it's good to know the best ways to clean them. I'm especially interested in cleaning my grandmother's old locket, which has been sitting in my jewelry box for months. The clasp is broken, and I want to wear it to my cousin's wedding next month. Do you have any specific tips for cleaning and repairing old or antique jewelry?",
