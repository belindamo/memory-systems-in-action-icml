  "content": "Uninformed search strategies are also known as blind search strategies, as they do not use any additional information about the problem other than the initial state, the goal state, and the actions. Some examples of uninformed search strategies include:\n\n1. Breadth-first search (BFS): This search strategy explores all the nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the next level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored. An example of BFS can be a robot traversing a maze.\n2. Depth-first search (DFS): This search strategy explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored. An example of DFS can be a program that looks for a specific file in a file system.\n3. Depth-limited search (DLS): This search strategy is a modified version of DFS that limits the depth of the search to a certain level. It is useful when searching a large or infinite search space where DFS can get stuck in an infinite loop. An example of DLS can be a game where the player has to find an object within a certain number of steps.\n4. Iterative deepening search (IDS): This search strategy is a combination of depth-first search and depth-limited search. It starts with a small depth limit, and then increases it iteratively until the goal state is found. This strategy uses the advantage of DFS in terms of space complexity and DLS in terms of completeness. An example of IDS can be a search for a specific webpage on the internet, starting with a small search radius and increasing it with each iteration.\n5. Uniform-cost search (UCS): This search strategy expands the node that has the lowest cost from the initial state. It uses a priority queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored. An example of UCS can be a travel agent finding the cheapest flight from one city to another.\n\nAll these uninformed search strategies have the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, but their major disadvantage is that they are not guaranteed to find the optimal solution and may get stuck in an infinite loop.",
