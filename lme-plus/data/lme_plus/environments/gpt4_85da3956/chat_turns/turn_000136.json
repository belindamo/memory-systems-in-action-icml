However, graphic design principles are not strict rules, but guidelines that help designers create effective designs that communicate a message, while also being aesthetically pleasing. Adhering to these principles can help ensure that the design is functional and effective, but it's also important for designers to be creative and think outside the box. Designers may choose to break a principle for a specific design if it helps achieve the desired effect.\n\nHowever, it's still important to understand the principles and why they work, so designers can make informed decisions when breaking them. So, following these principles does not always limit creativity in graphic design, and designers can still create unique designs while adhering to them.",
