  "content": "The extent of downtime following a chemical peel depends on the type of peel and concentration of the ingredients used. Superficial peels, such as glycolic acid, usually have minimal downtime with some mild redness and peeling that typically subsides within a few hours to a day or two. Medium peels, such as TCA peels, can cause redness, swelling, and peeling that may last up to a week or more. In some cases, deeper peels, such as phenol peels, can cause significant downtime with significant peeling, crusting, and redness that may last several weeks.\n\nIt's best to plan the timing of your chemical peel, depending on the peel intensity and your schedule. This will help to minimize any disruption to your daily routine. During the healing process, it is important to avoid direct sunlight, wear sunscreen, avoid picking at peeling skin, and follow any post-peel care instructions provided by your skincare professional. Always speak to a skincare professional to determine the best kind of peel and timing for you.",
