  "content": "As an AI language model, I can suggest some other important principles of graphic design that can be added to this list:\n\n11. Harmony - all the design elements should work together to create a unified composition. \n\n12. Unity - the design should have a consistent look and feel, with all the elements working together to convey a message or tell a story.\n\n13. Grid - using a grid can help maintain consistency and alignment among design elements.\n\n14. Emphasis - design elements that are important should stand out, while less important elements can be de-emphasized. \n\n15. Functionality - the design should not only look good but also serve its intended purpose.\n\n16. Originality - a design should be unique and avoid being too similar to other designs. \n\n17. Simplicity - keeping the design simple can often be more effective, especially when communicating complex information.\n\n18. Contrast and emphasis - a combination of contrast and emphasis can be used to direct the viewer's attention to key messages.\n\n19. Composition- composition with proper design elements heightens the level of visual appeal.\n\n20. Imagery - use of appropriate images and illustrations can help to convey the message and add visual interest to the design.",
