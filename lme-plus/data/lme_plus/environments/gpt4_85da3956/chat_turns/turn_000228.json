  "content": "I do not have access to the latest local news and updates. however, based on my research, there have been a few notable changes that may have affected transportation policy and funding mechanisms in dartford:\n\n1. the opening of the dartford crossing in 1963, which improved the road network and traffic flow between dartford and essex.\n\n2. the introduction of the dartford low emission zone (lez) in 2014, which requires certain vehicles to meet low emissions standards to enter the zone. this has encouraged the use of cleaner vehicles and reduced air pollution in the area.\n\n3. the approval of the lower thames crossing project in 2020, which aims to create a new road tunnel and associated infrastructure to connect kent and essex. this is expected to improve connectivity and reduce congestion in the area, but has also raised concerns about its impact on the environment and local communities.\n\nthese changes may have influenced the development of transportation infrastructure in dartford, but further research is needed to determine their full impact on policy and funding mechanisms.",
