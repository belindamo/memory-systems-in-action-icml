  "content": "Mountainous terrain is important for the generation of hydroelectric power because it provides the necessary elevation for creating the potential energy required for the generation of electric power. Water from high elevations flows downhill through turbines to generate electricity. The greater the elevation difference or drop of the water, the more potential energy is created which can be used for the generation of electricity. Mountainous terrain also provides a source for water that is used to generate electricity as rain and snowmelt flow downhill and create streams and rivers that can be harnessed for power generation. Therefore, mountainous terrain plays a significant role in the generation of hydroelectric power.",
