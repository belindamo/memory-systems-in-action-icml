  "content": "The length of time the results of a chemical peel last depends on several factors, such as the type of chemical peel, the condition of your skin, and your skincare routine.\n\nThe results of a chemical peel can last anywhere from a few weeks to several months or even years. Superficial peels, such as glycolic acid, may require repeated treatments every few months to maintain results. Medium to deep peels, such as TCA or phenol peels, can provide longer-lasting results, ranging from several months to several years.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the results of a chemical peel are not permanent, as aging, sun exposure, and lifestyle factors can continue to impact the appearance of the skin. To maintain the results of a chemical peel, it is important to follow a regular skincare routine that includes daily sun protection, gentle exfoliation, and a consistent use of effective skincare products.\n\nYour skincare professional can advise you on the best way to care for your skin following a chemical peel and to help determine a maintenance schedule to keep your skin looking its best. Regular peels can be part of a preventative skin care program that can have long-lasting, positive results.",
