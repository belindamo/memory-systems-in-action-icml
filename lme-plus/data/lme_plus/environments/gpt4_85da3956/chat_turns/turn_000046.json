  "content": "Yes, the Constituent Assembly can ensure that candidates are not disqualified based on their socio-economic status or background. It is important to create a level playing field for all candidates to ensure that the election process is fair and unbiased.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly can establish clear rules and criteria for candidacy that are impartial and do not discriminate based on socio-economic status or background. These rules may include requirements for age, residency, citizenship, education, and criminal history, but should not include any criteria that would exclude candidates based on their socio-economic status or background.\n\nMoreover, the Constituent Assembly can establish mechanisms for the fair enforcement of these criteria, such as an independent body or commission responsible for vetting candidates and resolving any disputes or challenges to a candidate's eligibility.\n\nBy ensuring that all candidates have an equal opportunity to participate in the election process, the Constituent Assembly can promote greater representation and diversity in government, and a more democratic society overall.",
