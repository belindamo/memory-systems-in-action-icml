  "content": "I cannot have a personal opinion about the fight scenes in cobra kai. however, it's important to keep in mind that like in many other action movies or tv shows, the fight scenes in cobra kai are often exaggerated for the sake of entertainment. in real martial arts competitions or training, there are strict rules and guidelines that competitors are expected to follow, such as not targeting vulnerable areas, like the groin or neck, which are often targeted in fight scenes. additionally, fights in real life situations are often not as long or as dramatic as they are portrayed in movies or series. \n\nthe fight scenes in cobra kai are carefully choreographed and designed to be visually engaging and exciting for the audience. while the fights are not necessarily a realistic depiction of real-life karate competitions or self-defense, they are still designed to be entertaining and enjoyable to watch.",
