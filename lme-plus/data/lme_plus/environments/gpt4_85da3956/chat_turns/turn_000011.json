  "content": "The next step in Pig's design would be to begin creating detailed engineering drawings and plans based on the design requirements we have established. These plans would include specific details on the materials, components, and systems that will be used in the construction of Pig, as well as the exact dimensions and specifications for each part of the aircraft.\n\nOnce the engineering plans are complete, we would move on to the manufacturing stage, where the various parts and systems of Pig would be constructed and assembled. This would involve working with suppliers to acquire the necessary materials and components, as well as assembling the aircraft using skilled technicians and engineers.\n\nAfter the manufacturing stage, we would move on to testing and certification, which would involve putting Pig through a series of rigorous tests to ensure that it meets all of the performance, safety, and reliability requirements we have established. This would include flight testing, as well as testing of all of the aircraft's systems and components.\n\nOnce Pig has successfully passed all of the required tests and certifications, it would be ready for delivery to customers, who could then begin using it for their transportation needs. Throughout this entire process, it would be important to continue monitoring and improving Pig's performance, as well as incorporating new technologies and design improvements as they become available.",
