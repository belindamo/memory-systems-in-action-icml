Here's why:\n\n1. **Palate cleanser**: Sparkling water with lemon or flavored seltzer can help cleanse your guests' palates between bites of the rich and savory appetizers.\n2. **Refreshing and light**: These drinks are light and refreshing, making them perfect for a pre-dinner gathering.\n3. **Low-calorie option**: Both sparkling water and flavored seltzer are low-calorie options, which can be a nice alternative to wine or cocktails for guests who are watching their calorie intake.\n4. **Easy to serve**: Simply slice up some lemons or limes and add them to a pitcher of sparkling water, or offer flavored seltzer with a few slices of lemon or lime on the side.\n\nYou could also consider offering **Iced Tea** or **Infused Water** as additional options. Iced tea can be flavored with fruits or herbs like peach, raspberry, or mint, while infused water can be flavored with fruits, cucumbers, or mint.\n\n**Wine and cocktails** are, of course, also a great option, but it's nice to offer a non-alcoholic alternative for guests who may not be drinking or prefer a lighter option.\n\nOverall, having a few drink options available will ensure that your guests feel welcome and comfortable, and that they can enjoy the company and the food without worrying about what to drink.",
