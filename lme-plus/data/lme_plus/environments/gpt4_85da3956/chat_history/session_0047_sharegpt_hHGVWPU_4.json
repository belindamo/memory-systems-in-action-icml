500.\",\"start\\_time\":\"576.57\"},{\"text\":\"But this is plenty fast\\nin a straight line.\",\"start\\_time\":\"579.39\"},{\"text\":\"It's good for, you know,\\na four-second zero to 60.\",\"start\\_time\":\"581.4\"},{\"text\":\"I think it traps 112 in the quarter mile\",\"start\\_time\":\"584.55\"},{\"text\":\"which is electronically limited top

that\",\"start\\_time\":\"614.73\"},{\"text\":\"before I got in and I started driving\",\"start\\_time\":\"615.57\"},{\"text\":\"and I was turning around\\nin a tight parking spot.\",\"start\\_time\":\"617.01\"},{\"text\":\"And you notice when that\\ntight turning radius\",\"start\\_time\":\"618.9\"},{\"text\":\"is like super clean, you\\ncan get into any spot.\",\"start\\_time\":\"621.69\"},{\"text\":\"Love that.\",\"start\\_time\":\"624.81\"},{\"text\":\"So it has the rear wheel steer\",\"start\\_time\":\"625.643\"},{\"text\":\"and it just has this

more.\",\"start\\_time\":\"650.82\"},{\"text\":\"One of them is that, yes,\\nthere is regen braking\",\"start\\_time\":\"654.63\"},{\"text\":\"when you take your foot\\noff the brake
