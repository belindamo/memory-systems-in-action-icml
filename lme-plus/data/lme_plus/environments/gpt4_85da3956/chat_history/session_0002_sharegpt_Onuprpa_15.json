      "content": "This is a judgment in the case of Prime Constructions Pty Ltd v Westbridge Investments Pty Ltd, heard in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 2004. The case concerned a dispute over a settlement agreement for goods sold and delivered. The plaintiff had filed a statement of liquidated claim for $11,754.60 in the Local Court, which was disputed by the defendant. The parties were represented by solicitors.\n\nOn 21 January 2004, the plaintiff's solicitor made an offer to settle the matter for the amount claimed, with each party to pay its own costs, and with a deed of release to be entered into between the parties. The defendant's solicitor accepted this offer on 23 January 2004, and a deed of release was agreed upon by the parties. However, the defendant subsequently reconsidered its position and proposed an additional term about a letter from the plaintiff to the proprietor as to the quality of the works that had been done. This led to further correspondence between the solicitors.\n\nThe central issue in the case was whether there was a final settlement of the proceedings. The court found that there was a final settlement, as the terms of the deed and the settlement had been agreed upon, and all that was left was the mechanics of exchanging the deeds and the settlement cheque.\n\nThe court also considered the effect of the document executed on 9 February 2004, which was in the form of a deed. The court found that while the document was expressed to be a deed, it was not properly executed in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act and the Conveyancing Act. However, the court held that either by estoppel or because of ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004, and the consequences flowed as per the terms of the settlement.\n\nThe court ultimately made a declaration that the defendant was bound by the terms of the deed of release and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $11,721.60, the amount referred to in the deed. The defendant was also ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings."

      "content": "In this case, the plaintiff and the defendant had agreed to settle a dispute, and the terms of the settlement were agreed upon by both parties. The settlement was to be formalized in a deed, which was drafted and agreed upon by the parties' solicitors. However, there were issues with the execution of the deed.\n\nThe deed was expressed to be a deed but only one director of the plaintiff company signed it, whereas, under the Corporations Act 2001 and the Conveyancing Act 1919, a company can bind itself by a deed if two directors or a director and a company secretary sign it, and if there is only one director, then that director alone can sign it. The document, therefore, failed to comply with the standards of execution required by law.\n\nThe plaintiff argued that the deed was still binding on the company because it had been delivered to the defendant's solicitor, and the plaintiff was willing to perform its part of the agreement. The plaintiff also argued that the defendant was estopped from denying that the document was a deed because the plaintiff's solicitor had represented to the defendant's solicitor that the deed had been executed.\n\nUltimately, the court found that either by estoppel or ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004. However, the court also noted that the execution of the deed did not comply with the standards required by law, which could have caused issues if the defendant had taken a different view."

      "content": "In the case of Boz One Pty Ltd v McLellan [2015] VSCA 68; 105 ACSR 325, paragraph 206 reads:\n\nThe ambit of s 127(4) of the Act was considered by Young CJ in Eq in Prime Constructions Pty Ltd v Westbridge Investments Pty Ltd.[128] He observed that it was not particularly clear what s 127(4) covered, but that it seemed to cover: the common law method of executing a deed; the method of execution that was prescribed by the company's constitution; or a situation where, by virtue of some estoppel, the deed was binding on the company.[129] Einstein J in Guang Dong Zhi Gao Australia Pty Ltd v Fortuna Network Pty Ltd[130] cited Young CJ in Eq\u2019s reasons with approval and similarly stated that it was not particularly clear what s 127(4) covered.[131] In Sunbay Projects Pty Ltd v PR Wieland Holdings Pty Ltd,[132] Ann Lyons J stated, in the context of a discussion of s 127(4), that \u2018there is no requirement that when a document is signed by a corporate entity, there is a particular formality which is required\u2019.[133]\n\nWhat does this mean?"

      "content": "Section 127(4) of the Corporations Act 2001 in Australia provides that the section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document, including a deed. The paragraph is discussing the different interpretations of what s 127(4) covers, which has been debated by judges in various cases. The judges have noted that it is not clear what s 127(4) covers, but have suggested that it may cover the common law method of executing a deed, the method of execution prescribed by the company's constitution, or a situation where, by virtue of some estoppel, the deed was binding on the company. In Sunbay Projects Pty Ltd v PR Wieland Holdings Pty Ltd, Ann Lyons J noted that there is no requirement for a particular formality when a document is signed by a corporate entity."
