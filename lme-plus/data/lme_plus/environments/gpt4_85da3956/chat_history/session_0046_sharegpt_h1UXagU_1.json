      "content": "Part 2 (acknowledge it and wait for parts 2-5 to write your review):\n\nGreater Blairstown (Ridge View Echo)\n\nBlairstown is a small, rural town in northwestern New Jersey near the Pennsylvania border. Three adjacent municipalities \u2013 Frelinghuysen, Hardwick, and Knowlton \u2013 join Blairstown as \u201cfeeder communities\u201d for the local high school, and together constitute greater Blairstown. The population is more than 90% white, and the average household income for the four towns is $100,651. Detailed demographic info for greater Blairstown may be found in Appendix A.\n\nLike the other communities in our study, Blairstown has over the years lost much of its local news coverage, including the main newspaper that served the area, which stopped publishing more than 20 years ago. Also like many other communities, Facebook Groups have formed to fill information gaps; the main Facebook page for the area \u2013 Goings on in Blairstown \u2013 had 10,300 members at last check (of a population of 12,281). \n\nRidge View Echo began as an effort by the Blairstown Enhancement Committee, which includes Keogh-Dwyer and three other volunteers. Because of extremely limited resources, they were \u2014 at the time of our study \u2014 able to cover only a fraction of the news they wanted to provide, and were publishing bi-weekly. Their goal is to provide the kind of local coverage that they lost almost 25 years ago when The Blairstown Press folded. Since then they\u2019ve received only sporadic or very high-level coverage from regional or statewide outlets like The New Jersey Herald (a Gannett paper), or The Express Times, which is based in Pennsylvania. \n\nTo gather the data that informs the analysis below, we conducted an online survey as well as both in-person and virtual focus groups. The number of respondents for the online survey was 170. We had a difficult time getting people to show up to focus groups, both in-person and virtual. For the two scheduled in-person focus groups, 20 and 10 people, respectively, confirmed the day before that they would attend. Of those who confirmed, two people showed up for the morning focus group and zero showed up for the second, afternoon group. As a result, two additional virtual focus groups were planned. For the first, four of the 7 who indicated interest showed up. For the second, zero of the 7 showed up.\nFindings\n\nFrom the focus groups and surveys, we learned from each community what they wanted from local news, where they currently get local news, and how each outlet in question could serve them best. The surveys for Blairstown and Trenton were essentially identical in terms of their questions, and both were distributed via Survey Monkey. All of the focus groups hosted in Blairstown and Trenton were conducted in \nEnglish. The Paterson survey was designed to reach the various non-English-language communities that are prominent there, so it was translated into Spanish, Arabic, and Bengali. One of the three focus groups in Paterson was conducted in Spanish; the other two were conducted in English. \n\nThe findings for each town are presented below; different findings are highlighted for each community, based on the strength of the responses to different questions and what appeared to resonate in each. Therefore findings presented for one town (e.g. satisfaction with quality of life) may not be discussed for the others.\n\nOne condition of the Google News Initiative grant was that after the initial information needs assessments were complete, each outlet was to make improvements to their product based on the findings. Then, community members who had participated in the first round of information gathering were to be asked for their feedback on these improvements. The results of these final follow-up surveys are presented below as well. \n\nPaterson (Paterson Info Hub)\n\nAs a nascent start-up, Paterson Info Hub\u2019s goals were to assess its community\u2019s information needs and desires regarding events around town \u2013 specifically, those put on by, or in service of, the people served by the nonprofits represented by Paterson Alliance. However the information we gathered also addressed views about Paterson as a place to live, topics and other local organizations of interest, and how people in Paterson learn about local news.\n\nThe survey was distributed by multiple means: Paterson Alliance shared it with its listserv and encouraged its member organizations to do the same. In addition, Paterson Alliance and the Paterson Public Library shared a call for participation on their various social media channels. The focus group moderator for Paterson, who had worked with the Alliance before and has deep roots in Paterson, shared it among his networks. Finally, we created a printed flyer that included the information about the survey, as well as the link and a QR code, in all four languages in which the survey was available: English, Spanish, Arabic, and Bengali.\n\nFor each of the towns, we offered a financial incentive of $25 electronic gift cards to 40 randomly selected people who filled out the survey. Because of this, we received a large number of submissions that were clearly bot-generated or completed with nonsense answers that were replicated in submissions over and over again verbatim. After cleaning, the final number of legitimate surveys for Paterson was 67 (note that all survey questions were optional, so the numbers reported below often do not add up to 67). We ran three focus groups in Paterson, two in English and one in Spanish.\n\nViews about the community and life\n\nPaterson survey respondents mostly lived (55%) and/or worked (67%) in the city of Paterson. A few more either lived (11%) or worked (5%) in Passaic County outside of Paterson. The greatest share of survey respondents (43%) have lived in the area for 1-5 years, but a remarkably large number of respondents have lived in the area for six years or more, with more than 15% living there for more than 25 years. All focus group participants lived and/or worked in Paterson.\nSome questions in the survey explored how respondents feel about the community they live in, and what they enjoy or worry about in their own lives. This information can be used to better understand the human experience of potential readers, and to create content that feels more personally relevant to what is on their minds. \n\nOur respondents mostly had positive feelings about living in Paterson. When we asked, \u201cOverall, how would you rate Paterson as a place to live and/or work?\u201d, a total of 12% of people said it\u2019s an \u201cexcellent\u201d place to live, while 56% said it is at least a \u201cgood\u201d place to live, and 11% said it is \u201cpoor\u201d or worse. We asked respondents to describe the community in one sentence; some of their answers (reported verbatim) are below.\n\nMixed but optimistic\nPaterson is a city filled with diversity and multiculturalism but has challenges in affordable housing, cost of living, and transportation. Paterson has multiple programs addressing these challenges but the town continues to carry a shadowy past of crime and desolation.\nA city with mostly good hard working people that are overshadowed by the violent lawless ones.\nIt's nice and kind of bad at the same time.\nPoor, rebounding through community initiatives.\nPaterson is a vibrant city with many different cultures, foods, and people that is often challenged due to a lack of funding and resources.\nA city that is desperate for a rejuvenation plan.\nRebounding.\nIt\u2019s not the worst, but it could be better.\nA city with unlimited potential.\nA town in need of help!\nIt has its good and bad parts.\n\nPraise\nThis is a good city to live in.\nIt's a beautiful city.\nThe city is very nice.\nA vibrant city.\nBeautiful and comfortable place.\nIt's a beautiful city, it has great sports, it's easy to get around, it's clean.\nIt's a nice place to live.\nPaterson is a wonderful place to live.\nA city everyone wants to live in.\nA very beautiful city with a human heart.\nIt's very beautiful.\nThe environment is good.\nIt's a livable city.\nNice place to live and work\nThe neighborhood is comfortable.\nA place where you can settle down.\n\nExpensive\nThe rent is not worth the asking price.\nHigh cost of living.\n\nHistory and tradition\nRich in history.\nThe famous silk industry center in the United States, known as the \"silk city.\u201d\nThe \"silk City\" standing by the Passaic River.\nAn important industrial city.\nThe mighty City of industry.\nThe home of the olive.\nWaterfall Line Cities.\nA very rich library.\n\nDiversity\nHay diversidad de personas.\nDiverse city with a great variety of food.\nPaterson is big and diverse but very dirty and dangerous.\nPaterson is a diverse town, with an incredible history, and fabulous foods!\nA variety of community areas, business centers, low income areas, middle class sections; multinational.\n\nNatural beauty\nThe beautiful scenery of Paterson always makes me feel relaxed and happy.\nThe environment here makes me very comfortable and I like it very much.\nThe living environment in Paterson is very comfortable.\nPeople in the focus groups were also mixed in their assessment of Paterson, focusing on both the good and the bad (as they perceived it). They used words and phrases like, \u201crich with historical value,\u201d \u201cfull of potential,\u201d and \u201cresilient\u201d to describe its positive aspects, while they used words and phrases like \u201cseparated melting pot,\u201d \u201cdangerous,\u201d and \u201cdevolving\u201d to describe its negative aspects."
