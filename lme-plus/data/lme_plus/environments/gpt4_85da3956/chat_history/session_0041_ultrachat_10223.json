However, it's important to understand that self-care is necessary for both mental and physical well-being. Here are some ways to overcome the guilt of prioritizing yourself:\n\n1.

Communicate with loved ones: Tell your loved ones that you need to prioritize yourself and explain how it will benefit everyone in the long run. You can also ask for their support in taking time for yourself.\n\n4. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that taking care of yourself is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\n5. Reflect on the benefits: Reflect on the benefits that come from prioritizing yourself, such as increased energy, better mental health, and improved relationships with loved ones.\n\n6. Seek support: If you're having difficulty overcoming your guilt, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor.
