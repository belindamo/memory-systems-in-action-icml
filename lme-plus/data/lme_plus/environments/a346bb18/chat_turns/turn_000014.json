  "content": "I'd say I'm a beginner in swimming, but I've been attending masters swimming sessions at the community pool every Wednesday evening since mid-January, so I've seen some improvement. As for cycling, I've got some experience from the charity cycling event \"Pedal for a Purpose\" in February, where I completed 30 miles in 2 hours and 15 minutes. I can dedicate 4-5 days a week for training, and I have access to a pool every Wednesday evening. I don't have a road bike yet, but I'm planning to invest in one soon. I've got about 12 weeks until my triathlon. I'd prefer a structured plan with specific workouts and distances.",
