I'd be happy to help you debug your Python script.\n\nPlease share the script you're working on, and describe the issue you're experiencing. What is the script supposed to do, and what error messages or unexpected behavior are you seeing? The more information you provide, the better I'll be able to assist you.\n\nIf you're concerned about sharing your code, you can also provide a minimal, reproducible example (MRE) that demonstrates the issue. This will help me understand the problem without having to look at your entire script.\n\nLet's get started!",
