Here's a possible breakdown:\n\n* Transportation:\n\t+ Car maintenance/repairs: (e.g. recent car service)\n\t+ Parking/tolls: (e.g. that pesky parking ticket)\n\t+ Fuel: (gasoline, diesel, etc.)\n\t+ Insurance: (monthly or annual premium)\n\t+ Other: (any other transportation-related expenses, like public transit costs or parking permits)\n\nCan you tell me how much you spent in each of these subcategories over the past month? Even rough estimates or ranges would be helpful.\n\nAlso, do you have any regular transportation expenses, like a monthly parking pass or a car loan/lease payment?",
