But I'm happy to help you with the release date!\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" is indeed an upcoming HBO original series, and it's scheduled to premiere on August 21, 2022. Mark your calendars!\n\nAs for Marvel, if you've finished binge-watching all the movies on Disney+, you might be excited to know that there are many more Marvel shows and movies in the works, including \"She-Hulk,\" \"Hawkeye,\" and \"Moon Knight\" on Disney+, as well as several films like \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" and \"The Marvels\" coming to theaters soon. Keep an eye out for those release dates!",
