  "content": "If the interviewer presses for a specific salary number during the interview, it's best to provide a range rather than a specific amount. Be prepared with your research and your priorities list to give a reasonable range. However, it's always better to defer the salary discussion until you understand the job scope and requirements, so you can negotiate a salary that reflects your experience, skills, and the scope of work. This way both you and the potential employer are on the same page, and you stand a better chance at earning a competitive salary.",
