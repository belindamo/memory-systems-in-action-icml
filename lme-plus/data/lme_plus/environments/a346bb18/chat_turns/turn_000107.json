They're definitely a team to watch, and their ability to grind out wins has been impressive.\n\nAnd I completely agree with you about Naomi Osaka - she's an incredible athlete with a strong mental game. Her dominance in the Australian Open was impressive, and it's great to see her continuing to excel in the tennis world. Mental toughness is such a crucial aspect of sports, and Osaka has consistently demonstrated her ability to perform under pressure.\n\nIt's great that you were able to catch some of the tournament while doing laundry - multitasking at its finest! Did you have a favorite moment or match from the Australian Open?\n\nAnd now, back to the conversation... what were you going to say about getting back to something? Feel free to pick up where you left off!",
