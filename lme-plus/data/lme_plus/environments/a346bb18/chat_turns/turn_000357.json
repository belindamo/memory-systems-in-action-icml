  "content": "The most relevant result for the Research Question is [1] which discusses the ancient Egyptian numeral system. The ancient Egyptians utilized a numeration system based on multiples of ten and had separate symbols for one unit, one ten, one hundred, one thousand, one ten thousand, one hundred thousand, and one million. This system did not have a place-valued system such as the decimal system but instead utilized hieroglyphs to denote exact finite series notation.\n\nAdditionally, [2] states that ancient Egyptian mathematics included a numeral system for counting and solving written mathematical problems, which often involved multiplication and fractions. [4] provides a broader historical perspective on the evolution of numeral systems and states that the earliest known unambiguous notations for numbers emerged in Mesopotamia about 5000 or 6000 years ago.\n\nFurthermore, [6] discusses positional numeral systems, which the decimal system belongs to. In a positional system, after adopting a base, the digits are given special names, and all larger numbers are written as sequences of these digits.\n\nOverall, these sources provide insight into the evolution of numeral systems and how they were utilized in different civilizations.",
