  "content": "Having the event on a Saturday morning is a great idea, as it's a convenient time for most people.\n\nTwo hours is a good amount of time for a friendly game of basketball with 10-12 people. Here's a rough outline of how you could structure the event:\n\n* Warm-up and introductions (15-20 minutes): Allow players to get comfortable on the court, shoot some hoops, and get to know each other.\n* Game play (1 hour): Divide the group into two teams and play a friendly game of basketball. You could play a standard game with four quarters, or consider a more relaxed format like a \"pick-up game\" style where players can rotate in and out.\n* Break and refreshments (15-20 minutes): Take a break to grab a snack, rehydrate, and socialize. This is a great opportunity to encourage team bonding and chat about the game so far.\n* Additional game play or activities (30-40 minutes): You could continue playing a second game, or consider other activities like a shooting competition, a game of \"Around the World,\" or even a fun basketball-themed challenge like a \"dunk contest\" (if the venue allows it).\n\nHaving two hours will give you enough time to fit in some quality game play, socializing, and relaxation. You can always adjust the format to suit your group's preferences and pace.\n\nRemember to also consider the following:\n\n* Make sure to schedule some buffer time before and after the event to allow for setup, cleanup, and any unexpected delays.\n* Plan for some flexibility in your schedule in case the game runs longer or shorter than expected.\n* Encourage players to arrive 10-15 minutes before the scheduled start time to get settled and ready to play.\n\nOverall, two hours should provide a great balance of activity, socializing, and relaxation for your team-building event.",
