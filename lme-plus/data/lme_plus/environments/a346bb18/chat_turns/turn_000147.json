  "content": "\"Shoplifters\" and \"Roma\" are both excellent choices.\n\nAs for availability on Amazon Prime, here's what I found:\n\n* **Shoplifters (2018)**: Yes, \"Shoplifters\" is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video in the US, UK, and other regions. You can check if it's available in your region by searching for the title on Amazon Prime Video.\n* **Roma (2018)**: \"Roma\" is actually a Netflix Original film, so it's exclusively available on Netflix. If you have a Netflix subscription, you can stream it there. Unfortunately, it's not available on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIf you don't have Netflix, you can consider signing up for a free trial or subscription to watch \"Roma\". Alternatively, you can purchase or rent \"Roma\" on Amazon Video, Google Play, iTunes, or other digital stores.\n\nRemember to check the availability of \"Shoplifters\" and \"Roma\" in your region before watching, as streaming options may vary depending on your location.",
