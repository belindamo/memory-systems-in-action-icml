  "content": "Unfortunately, parking tickets are not typically considered a deductible business expense on your taxes. The IRS has specific rules about what constitutes a legitimate business expense, and parking tickets don't usually qualify.\n\nAccording to the IRS, parking tickets are considered a personal expense, and you can't deduct them as a business expense. This is because parking tickets are considered a penalty or fine, rather than a business-related expense.\n\nHowever, if you're self-employed or have a side hustle, and you use your car for business purposes, you may be able to deduct certain car-related expenses, such as:\n\n* Mileage driven for business purposes (using the standard mileage rate or actual expenses)\n* Business-related tolls and parking fees (not including parking tickets)\n* Car maintenance and repairs (like the air filter replacement you mentioned)\n\nTo deduct these expenses, you'll need to keep accurate records, including receipts, mileage logs, and notes on the business purpose of each trip. You can claim these expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040) if you're self-employed, or on Form 2106 (Employee Business Expenses) if you're an employee with unreimbursed business expenses.\n\nIt's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or accountant to ensure you're taking advantage of all the deductions you're eligible for, and to get guidance on what expenses are legitimate business deductions.",
