Swimming lessons are on Tuesdays and Thursdays, each lasting 45 minutes. I want to cycle at least 3 times a week, with a mix of endurance and interval training. My current fitness level is intermediate, and I'd like to increase my cycling mileage and improve my serving skills in volleyball. I'd like to take one rest day on Fridays.",
