For transportation, I've had some recent expenses - like getting my car serviced on February 10th, which included replacing the air filter for $25. I also filled up the gas tank that day for $30. Oh, and I almost forgot - I took my bike to the shop on January 25th and needed to replace some worn-out cables, which cost me $40.",
