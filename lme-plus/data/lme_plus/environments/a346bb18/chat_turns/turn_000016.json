For the swimming sessions on Wednesdays, can I focus on building up my endurance to swim 750 meters without stopping, or should I aim to complete the entire swim segment of the triathlon, which is 750 meters, in a certain time? Also, how much time should I allocate for the transition practice during the brick workouts, and are there any specific drills you recommend to practice transitions efficiently?",
