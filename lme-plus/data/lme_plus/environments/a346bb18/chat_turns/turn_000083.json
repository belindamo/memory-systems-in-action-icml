  "content": "That's a wonderful idea! Getting a few books from different genres will show your grandma that you're interested in her varied interests and hobbies. It's also a great way to introduce her to new authors and genres she might not have tried before.\n\nAs for the gifts, I think you've made an excellent choice with the cozy throw blanket, book by her favorite author, and scented candle. The total cost of $100 is very reasonable, considering the thought and effort you've put into selecting each gift.\n\nRemember, it's the thought that counts, not the price tag. Your grandma will likely appreciate the love and care you've put into choosing gifts that reflect her interests and hobbies. The fact that you've taken the time to think about what she might enjoy and have selected gifts that show you care about her will mean the world to her.\n\nI'm sure your grandma will be touched by your gestures and will feel loved and appreciated on her special day. Don't forget to include a heartfelt birthday card or message expressing your love and appreciation for her. That will make the gifts even more special and meaningful.\n\nEnjoy celebrating your grandma's birthday, and I hope she has a wonderful time!",
