Would you like to add a \"Total\" column to calculate the total cost for each category (e.g., Car Maintenance, Gas, Bike Maintenance)?\n2. Would you like to include a \"Type\" column to specify the type of vehicle (e.g., Car, Bike, Public Transportation)?\n3. Do you want to track the odometer reading or mileage for your car or bike to calculate fuel efficiency or maintenance costs?\n4. Are there any other transportation-related expenses you'd like to track, such as parking fees, tolls, or public transportation costs?\n\nLet me know your thoughts, and we can refine this tracker to fit your needs!",
