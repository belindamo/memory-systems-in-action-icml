To help you reach your goal, I'd like to offer some advice:\n\n1. **Gradual Progression:** Aim to increase your weekly mileage by 10-15% each week to allow your body to adapt to the demands of cycling. This will help prevent injuries and burnout.\n2. **Consistency:** Aim to cycle at least 3-4 times a week, with one or two rest days in between. Consistency is key to building endurance and increasing mileage.\n3. **Mix it Up:** Vary your route and terrain to avoid boredom and prevent plateaus. Incorporate hills, flats, and different types of rides (e.g., endurance, intervals, recovery) to keep your training interesting and challenging.\n4. **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to your body and take rest days as needed. It's better to take an extra day off than to risk injury or burnout.\n5. **Nutrition and Hydration:** Fuel your body with a balanced diet, and stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after your rides.\n6. **Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help your body recover from the physical demands of cycling.\n\nBy following these tips and staying committed to your training, you'll be well on your way to reaching your goal of 75 miles per week by April!\n\nHow's your current training going? Are there any specific challenges you're facing, or would you like more guidance on creating a training plan?",
