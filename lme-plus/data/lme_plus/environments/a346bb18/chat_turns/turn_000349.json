  "content": "A Marvel movie and anime fan, eh?\n\nI'd be happy to help you with a Marvel movie recommendation that fits your time constraint. Here are a few options around 2 hours long:\n\n1. **Captain America: The First Avenger** (2011) - 124 minutes (2 hours 4 minutes) - A great origin story that's a bit lighter in tone, with plenty of action and nostalgia.\n2. **Doctor Strange** (2016) - 115 minutes (1 hour 55 minutes) - A visually stunning and mind-bending adventure that explores the mystical side of the Marvel Universe.\n3. **Ant-Man** (2015) - 117 minutes (1 hour 57 minutes) - A fun, light-hearted heist movie with plenty of humor and action.\n\nAll of these movies are available on Disney+, and they're relatively shorter than some of the other Marvel movies. You can easily fit one of these in before getting back to your anime on Crunchyroll!\n\nLet me know if you have any other preferences (e.g., a specific hero, tone, or era) and I can give you a more tailored recommendation!",
