  "content": "If the employer offers a salary below your desired range, it's okay to respectfully negotiate for a higher salary. You can try negotiating for a higher salary by reiterating your qualifications and the value you can provide to the company. You should also remain open to other forms of compensation, such as additional vacation days, benefits or remote work. However, you should also be flexible and consider factors such as the company's financial situation and future growth potential while negotiating. If after negotiations, the offer is still significantly below your desired range or the industry average, it may be necessary to decline the offer and search for other opportunities that align with your expectations.",
