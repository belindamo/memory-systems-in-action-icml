Installing Shimano Ultegra pedals is a relatively straightforward process, but it's essential to follow the correct steps to ensure a safe and secure installation. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install your new pedals:\n\n**Tools needed:**\n\n* Shimano Ultegra pedals\n* Pedal wrench (usually provided with the pedals or available at a bike shop)\n* Grease (optional)\n\n**Pre-installation checks:**\n\n1. **Check the pedal compatibility:** Make sure your road bike's crankset is compatible with Shimano Ultegra pedals. Most road bikes have a standard 9/16\" pedal thread, but it's always a good idea to double-check.\n2. **Prepare your shoes:** Ensure you have clipless shoes that are compatible with Shimano SPD-SL (Ultegra) pedals.\n\n**Installation:**\n\n1. **Remove the old pedals:** Use a pedal wrench to loosen and remove the old pedals from your bike. Turn the wrench counterclockwise to loosen, and then pull the pedals straight off the crankset.\n2. **Inspect and clean the crankset:** Inspect the crankset for any dirt, grime, or old pedal grease. Clean the area with a rag and degreaser if necessary.\n3. **Apply grease (optional):** If you want to reduce friction and prevent corrosion, apply a small amount of grease to the pedal threads.\n4. **Install the new pedals:** Hold the pedal with the axle facing the crankset and thread it onto the crankset. Make sure the pedal is properly aligned with the crankset.\n5. **Tighten the pedals:** Use the pedal wrench to tighten the pedals in a star pattern (tightening one side a little, then moving to the next, and so on). Make sure they're snug but not overtightened. The recommended torque specification for Shimano Ultegra pedals is 30-40 Nm.\n6. **Check the pedals:** Double-check that the pedals are securely attached and not loose. Give them a few gentle pulls to ensure they're properly seated.\n\n**Setting up your shoes and pedals:**\n\n1. **Attach the cleats:** Mount the Shimano SPD-SL cleats to your shoes according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n2. **Adjust the cleat position:** Adjust the cleat position on your shoes to match your foot's natural position on the pedal.\n3. **Practice clipping in and out:** Get comfortable clipping in and out of the pedals. Make sure you can easily release your foot from the pedal by twisting your heel outward.\n\n**Final check:**\n\n1. **Double-check the pedals:** Ensure the pedals are still securely attached to the crankset.\n2. **Test ride:** Take your bike for a test ride to ensure everything feels comfortable and secure.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with the installation process or feel uncertain about any step, consider taking your bike to a local bike shop for professional assistance. They can help you with the installation and ensure a safe, secure, and proper setup.\n\nEnjoy your new Shimano Ultegra pedals!",
