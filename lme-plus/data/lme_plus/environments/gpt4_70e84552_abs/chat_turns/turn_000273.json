  "content": "It's understandable to find Meursault's lack of responsibility frustrating. However, it is crucial to note that one of the central themes in The Stranger is the idea of absurdity, which can be seen as the conflict between the human need for purpose and meaning and the indifference of the universe.\n\nIn this sense, Meursault's apathy towards his actions may be seen as a manifestation of the absurd, as he is a character who is detached from the world around him and can only observe its absurdity without the ability to change it. Meursault is a symbol of the human condition of being alone in the world and trying to make sense of it. \n\nCamus also challenges the reader to question their traditional notions of morality through Meursault's lack of remorse, suggesting that the morality we take for granted might be a mere social construct that is, in fact, arbitrary and meaningless.\n\nSo, in essence, Meursault's lack of responsibility may be seen as a manifestation of Camus' philosophical views rather than a character flaw or weakness.",
