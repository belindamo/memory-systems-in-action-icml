Here's a step-by-step example:\n\n**Step 1: Connect your Gmail and Trello accounts to Zapier**\n\n1. Log in to your Zapier account or sign up for a free trial.\n2. Click on the \"Connect Account\" button in the top-right corner.\n3. Search for \"Gmail\" and select the Gmail connector.\n4. Follow the prompts to authenticate your Gmail account with Zapier.\n5. Repeat the process to connect your Trello account to Zapier.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the trigger**\n\n1. Click on the \"Make a Zap\" button.\n2. Choose \"Gmail\" as the trigger app.\n3. Select \"New email from search\" as the trigger event.\n4. Set up the search criteria:\n\t* In the \"From\" field, enter a specific email address or leave it blank to apply to all emails.\n\t* In the \"Subject\" field, enter the specific subject line you want to trigger the zap (e.g., \"New Task Request\").\n\t* Set the \"Label\" field to a specific label or leave it blank to apply to all emails.\n5. Click \"Continue\" to test the trigger.\n\n**Step 3: Set up the action**\n\n1. Choose \"Trello\" as the action app.\n2. Select \"Create card\" as the action event.\n3. Choose the Trello board and list where you want to create the new task.\n4. Map the email data to the Trello card fields:\n\t* Title: Use the email subject or a custom text.\n\t* Description: Use the email body or a custom text.\n\t* Labels: Add specific labels to the card.\n5. Click \"Continue\" to test the action.\n\n**Step 4: Review and enable the zap**\n\n1. Review the zap summary to ensure everything is set up correctly.\n2. Click \"Turn on Zap\" to enable the automation.\n\nFrom now on, whenever a new email is received in your Gmail inbox with the specific subject line, Zapier will automatically create a new task in your Trello board with the email details. You can customize the zap further by adding filters, conditions, or multiple actions to suit your workflow needs.\n\nTips and variations:\n\n* Use Zapier's filtering feature to only trigger the zap for emails from specific senders or with specific keywords.\n* Add multiple actions to the zap, such as sending a notification to a Slack channel or creating a new task in another project management tool.\n* Use Zapier's delay feature to delay the creation of the Trello task by a set amount of time (e.g., to allow for email processing or review).\n\nI hope this example helps you get started with automating your workflow using Zapier!",
