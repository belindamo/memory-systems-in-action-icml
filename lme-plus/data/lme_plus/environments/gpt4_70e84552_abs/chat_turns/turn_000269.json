  "content": "I cannot speak to the author's intentions, however, it is widely believed that camus did intentionally portray meursault as an unlikable character. \n\nmeursault is often characterized as emotionally detached and indifferent to the events happening around him. he displays a distinct lack of empathy towards his mother's death, refuses to engage in traditional mourning practices, and even takes pleasure in physical sensations such as the sun and sexual desire. meursault also does not express remorse for his crime, which makes him appear insensitive.\n\nhowever, it could also be argued that camus challenges the reader to question their traditional notions of likability and morality. meursault's rejection of societal norms and values is a critical theme in the novel, highlighting how western society often prioritizes conformity and the appearance of propriety over individual freedom and expression.",
