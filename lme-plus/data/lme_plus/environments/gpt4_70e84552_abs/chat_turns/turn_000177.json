The implementation of Hashicorp Vault will enable us to centrally manage secrets, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates, and avoid hard-coding sensitive data in our application code or configuration files.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\n* The security team has successfully installed and configured Hashicorp Vault on our Kubernetes clusters. This includes deploying the Vault server, configuring the necessary storage backend, and enabling TLS encryption for secure communication between Vault components.\n* The security team has created and configured policies for different roles and applications accessing the secrets. This includes defining access control rules, creating Vault authentication methods, and configuring the appropriate secrets engines for storing and retrieving secrets.\n* The security team has successfully integrated Hashicorp Vault with Kubernetes, so that our applications running on Kubernetes can retrieve secrets from Vault. This includes configuring Vault authentication for Kubernetes service accounts, creating Kubernetes secrets for Vault credentials, and configuring the necessary annotations and labels for Kubernetes objects.\n* The security team has tested the integration thoroughly to ensure that secrets are being securely retrieved and used by our applications. This includes verifying that the secrets are not leaked in log files or exposed to unauthorized users, and that the access control policies are correctly enforced.\n* The security team has documented the installation, configuration, and integration steps in a clear and concise manner so that it can be easily understood and replicated by other members of the team. This documentation should include best practices for secure secret management and guidelines for updating or revoking secrets as needed.\n* The security team has set up monitoring and alerting to ensure that any issues with the Hashicorp Vault setup are detected and addressed promptly. This includes monitoring Vault metrics, audit logs, and system logs, and setting up alerts for abnormal events or failures.\n* The security team has provided training and support to the development team on how to securely store and retrieve secrets using Hashicorp Vault. This includes educating the team on the importance of secret management, demonstrating how to use the Vault API or CLI, and providing sample code or templates for integrating Vault with common frameworks or libraries.\n\nOnce all acceptance criteria have been met, the Hashicorp Vault implementation will be considered complete and the development team can start using it for securely managing secrets in their applications.",
