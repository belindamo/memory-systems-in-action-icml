Disney+ has a growing collection of rom-coms, and I've got some new ones to recommend:\n\n1. **Sylvie's Love** (2020) - A romantic drama set in the 1960s about a young woman who falls in love with a saxophonist. It's a beautiful, nostalgic film with great music and performances.\n2. **Godmothered** (2020) - A fantasy rom-com about a fairy godmother-in-training who tries to help a single mother find love. It's a heartwarming, feel-good film with a great cast, including Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell.\n3. **Stargirl** (2020) - A sweet and quirky film about a shy teenager who falls for a charismatic musician. It's a great coming-of-age story with a strong focus on self-acceptance and individuality.\n\nAll three of these rom-coms are exclusive to Disney+ and have been released in the past year. If you're looking for more, you can also check out some of the classic rom-coms available on the platform, such as **Enchanted**, **Tangled**, and **The Princess Diaries**.\n\nIf you're open to exploring other genres, Disney+ also has a great selection of movies and original content, including Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and National Geographic documentaries. Let me know if you need more recommendations!",
