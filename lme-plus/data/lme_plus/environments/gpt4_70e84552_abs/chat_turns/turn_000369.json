  "content": "Yes, Cardiff University has specific application deadlines for different scholarship programs. The deadline for each scholarship may vary depending on the program, level of study, and the country of origin of the applicant. \n\nFor instance, the deadline for the Vice-Chancellor's International Scholarship usually falls between February and July, depending on the program's start date. The deadline for the Commonwealth Shared Scholarship Scheme is usually around March/April.\n\nIt is important to note that some scholarships may have earlier application deadlines than the standard admission deadlines; therefore, applicants are urged to check the university's official website for the specific deadlines for each scholarship program.\n\nIt is recommended that international students apply to the university and relevant scholarship programs as soon as possible to ensure ample time for visa application processing and other related preparations.",
