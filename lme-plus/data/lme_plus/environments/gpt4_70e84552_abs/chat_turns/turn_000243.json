  "content": "I'm really enjoying \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" and I'm looking for more audiobooks that have a similar feel to them. I've been listening to a lot of contemporary fiction and women's fiction lately, and I'm in the mood for something that's character-driven and has a strong focus on relationships. Can you recommend some audiobooks that fit the bill?",
