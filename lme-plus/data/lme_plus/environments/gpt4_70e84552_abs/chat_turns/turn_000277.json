  "content": "It is understandable that you may have found Meursault to be a weak and uninteresting character. However, it is worth considering that Camus deliberately wrote The Stranger as an exploration of his existentialist philosophy, which emphasizes individual freedom over societal norms and values. \n\nIn the context of the novel, Meursault's detachment from social conventions, his lack of introspection, and his lack of remorse can be interpreted as a rejection of traditional morality and values, illustrating the absurdity of human existence.\n\nWhile it is true that the novel may not feature traditional character development or a conventional narrative arc, it could be argued that its philosophical and existential themes, as well as its stylistic choices, compensate for these perceived shortcomings. \n\nUltimately, whether or not Meursault is a weak or uninteresting character may come down to the reader's personal taste and their willingness to engage with Camus' philosophical ideas in the story.",
