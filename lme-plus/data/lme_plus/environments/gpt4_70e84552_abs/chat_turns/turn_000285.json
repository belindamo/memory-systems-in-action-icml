Here are some tips to modify your grandma's lasagna recipe to make it more appealing to Emma and Max:\n\n1. **Hide the Veggies**: Finely chop the veggies like onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms, so they're not visible to the kids. This way, they'll still get the nutrients without complaining about the \"green stuff.\"\n2. **Use Mild Sauce**: If your grandma's recipe uses a strong or spicy tomato sauce, consider toning it down with a milder version. You can also add a bit of sugar to balance out the acidity.\n3. **Add Kid-Friendly Meat**: Use ground beef or turkey instead of sausage or meatballs, which can be spicy or have strong flavors. You can also add cooked, diced chicken or ham for added protein.\n4. **Mac 'n Cheese Layer**: Add a layer of macaroni and cheese to the lasagna for a comforting, kid-friendly twist. This can be a fun surprise in the middle of the dish.\n5. **Use Mild Cheese**: Opt for milder cheeses like mozzarella, ricotta, or cottage cheese instead of strong cheeses like parmesan or gorgonzola.\n6. **Add Some Fun Toppings**: Offer toppings like shredded mozzarella, chopped olives, or pepperoni slices to let the kids customize their own lasagna slices.\n7. **Make it Bite-Sized**: Cut the lasagna into bite-sized squares or rectangles to make it easier for the kids to handle and eat.\n8. **Serve with a Side**: Offer a side of garlic bread, fruit, or a simple green salad to provide a refreshing contrast to the rich lasagna.\n9. **Involve the Kids**: Let Emma and Max help with the preparation, like sprinkling cheese or adding toppings. This can make them more excited to try the finished dish.\n10. **Be Flexible**: Be prepared for some kids to be picky, and have some alternative options available, like plain pasta or a simple sandwich.\n\nBy incorporating some or all of these tips, you can create a kid-friendly lasagna that Emma and Max will love. Good luck, and I hope you all have a fantastic game night!",
