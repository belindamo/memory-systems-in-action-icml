  "content": "I can't have an opinion, but i understand how you feel. it's true that writing solely to espouse philosophical ideas can sometimes take away from the depth and richness of a story's characters. some readers may find it difficult to connect with characters that lack introspection or self-awareness, especially in a story where the protagonist's journey is not necessarily about personal growth or change.\n\nat the same time, it's worth considering that camus was deliberately writing in an existentialist style, which emphasizes the absurdity and meaninglessness of human existence. in this context, meursault's detachment from social norms and values, as well as his lack of introspection, can be interpreted as a deliberate narrative choice to reinforce these themes.\n\nultimately, whether or not the novel's lack of character development worked for you is a matter of personal preference. some readers may find the novel to be a profound exploration of existential themes, while others may feel that it lacks depth or complexity. in any case, it's important to approach the novel with an open mind and an awareness of its philosophical and existentialist underpinnings.",
