I've got some tasty recommendations to add to your stash:\n\n1. **Trail Mix:** A classic road trip snack that's easy to customize with your favorite nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. Look for a mix with a good balance of sweet and salty flavors.\n2. **Dried Fruit:** Dried apricots, apples, and mangoes are sweet and healthy options. You can also try dried fruit leathers or fruit roll-ups for a fun twist.\n3. **Jerky Alternatives:** If you're tired of beef jerky, try turkey, chicken, or pork jerky for a change of pace. You can also look for vegan jerky options made from plant-based proteins like soy or pea protein.\n4. **Energy Balls:** No-bake bites made with oats, nuts, and dried fruit are a healthy and sustaining snack. You can also customize them with your favorite flavors like peanut butter or chocolate chips.\n5. **Sandwich Crackers:** Individual packs of crackers with peanut butter, cheese, or hummus make for a satisfying snack. Look for crackers with a long shelf life to avoid spoilage.\n6. **Fresh Fruit:** Apples, oranges, bananas, and grapes are all easy to pack and provide a refreshing break from dried snacks. Consider a cooler with ice packs to keep them fresh.\n7. **Granola:** A sweet and crunchy snack that's perfect for munching on the go.

Look for single-serve packets or instant options for easy brewing.\n\nRemember to pack your snacks in airtight containers to keep them fresh and organized.
