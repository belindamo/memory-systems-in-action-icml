This way, you can stay focused on your run without having to constantly check your watch.\n* **Bluetooth Headphones:** Choose Bluetooth headphones that are designed for running and provide good sound quality and fit comfortably. Some popular options include the Garmin HRM-Dual headphones, Jaybird Vista, or Plantronics BackBeat FIT.\n\nRemember to also follow basic safety guidelines when running with music, such as:\n\n* **Stay aware of your surroundings:** Keep an eye on the road, other runners, and potential hazards like potholes or uneven terrain.\n* **Use reflective gear:** Wear reflective clothing or accessories to increase your visibility, especially if you're running early in the morning or in low-light conditions.\n* **Follow traffic rules:** Obey traffic signals and signs, and always run facing traffic.\n\nWith the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music and some common-sense safety precautions, you'll be all set for a fun and enjoyable run with your group!",
