  "content": "The Synology DiskStation DS920+ is a great choice!\n\nThe DS920+ is a NAS device, not a computer, so it doesn't directly interact with peripherals like keyboards and mice. It's designed to be a file storage and sharing device, accessed through a web-based interface or mobile apps.\n\nAs a result, you won't need to connect your wireless keyboard and mouse combo to the DS920+ directly. Instead, you'll access the NAS using a device like a computer, smartphone, or tablet, which will communicate with the NAS over your network.\n\nThe DS920+ is compatible with a wide range of devices and operating systems, including:\n\n* Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP\n* macOS High Sierra or later\n* Linux (various distributions)\n* Mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone)\n\nTo access the DS920+, you'll need to:\n\n1. Connect the NAS to your router using an Ethernet cable.\n2. Power on the NAS.\n3. Open a web browser on your device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) and access the NAS's web-based interface using its IP address or hostname.\n4. Log in to the NAS using the default admin account (or create a new one).\n5. Configure the NAS settings, create user accounts, and set up file sharing as desired.\n\nSince you won't be directly connecting your wireless keyboard and mouse to the DS920+, you don't need to worry about compatibility with these peripherals. Your keyboard and mouse will continue to work with your computer or other devices as usual.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns about setting up your DS920+ or accessing it with your devices, feel free to ask!",
