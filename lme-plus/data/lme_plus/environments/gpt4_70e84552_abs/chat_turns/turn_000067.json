  "content": "Korean-Style BBQ Chicken is a flavorful and delicious option.\n\nFor side dishes, here are some popular Korean-inspired options that would complement the BBQ chicken well:\n\n1. **Kimchi**: Spicy, fermented Korean kimchi is a classic pairing for BBQ chicken. You can make your own kimchi or use store-bought. It adds a nice crunch, spice, and umami flavor to the dish.\n2. ** Japchae (Stir-Fried Glass Noodles)**: Japchae is a popular Korean side dish made from sweet potato starch noodles, beef, and vegetables. It's easy to make and adds a nice textural contrast to the meal.\n3. **Bokkeumbap (Korean Fried Rice)**: A simple and satisfying side dish, Korean-style fried rice is made with leftover rice, vegetables, and often meat (e.g., chicken or beef). You can customize it to your taste with ingredients like kimchi, green onions, and fried egg.\n4. **Sigeumchi (Boiled Spinach with Garlic and Sesame Oil)**: This simple side dish is a staple in Korean cuisine. Quickly blanch spinach in boiling water, then season with garlic, sesame oil, and salt. It's a refreshing contrast to the rich BBQ chicken.\n5. **Gyeranjjim (Steamed Eggs with Sesame Oil and Soy Sauce)**: Another comforting side dish, steamed eggs are flavored with sesame oil, soy sauce, and garlic. They're easy to make and pair nicely with the bold flavors of the BBQ chicken.\n\nAs for cooking in bulk and meal prep, that's a great habit to develop! It can save time, reduce food waste, and help you eat healthier. Korean-Style BBQ Chicken is a great candidate for meal prep, as it reheats well and can be stored in the fridge for up to 3-4 days or frozen for later use.\n\nDo you have a favorite meal prep strategy or container system that works for you?",
