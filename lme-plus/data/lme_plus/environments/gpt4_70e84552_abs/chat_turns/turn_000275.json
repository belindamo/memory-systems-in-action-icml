  "content": "It's understandable that you feel that way. However, it's worth noting that Camus deliberately wrote The Stranger as a critique of society's obsession with individual responsibility and moral values. The existential philosophy embraced by Camus suggests that human beings are fundamentally alone in the world, and our lives are governed by the absurd conditions we find ourselves in.\n\nCamus seemed to believe that the human condition was essentially illogical and meaningless, so it's possible that he would argue that Meursault's lack of responsibility wasn't a cop-out, but a reflection of the absurdity of existence itself.\n\nWhile it may be unsatisfying to see a character not take responsibility for his actions, Camus' decision to portray Meursault as such highlights one of the novel's major themes: the insignificance of traditional morality and values in the face of the absurdity of existence.\n\nIn retrospect, Meursault's lack of responsibility contributes to the novel's sense of detachment and alienation, which - in turn - reinforces its core philosophical and existential themes.",
