Jumping jacks: Stand with your feet together, and arms at your sides. Jump your feet out to the sides while raising your arms above your head. Jump back to the starting position, and repeat for 30-60 seconds. 2. Skaters: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Take a big jump to your right, landing on your right foot and crossing your left foot behind your right leg. Then, jump to the left, landing on your left foot and crossing your right foot behind your left leg. Repeat for 30-60 seconds. 3. Butt kickers: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Bring your right heel to your buttocks while staying on the ball of your right foot. Lower your right foot to the ground and repeat with your left leg. Alternate legs for 30-60 seconds. 4. High knees: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Take a step forward with your right leg, lifting your left knee towards your chest at the same time. Lower your left foot to the ground and repeat with your right leg. Keep alternating legs for 30-60 seconds. 5. Inchworms: Start in a standing position with your feet hip-width apart. Bend forward, placing your hands on the ground in front of you. Walk your hands forward until you're in a plank position, then walk your feet forward until they're close to your hands. Stand back up and repeat for 30-60 seconds. Remember to tailor your warm-up to your fitness goals and any injuries or medical conditions you may have. These exercises can be combined or modified to fit your needs. Warm-up exercises should be done at a moderate intensity and gradually increased as your body warms up.",
