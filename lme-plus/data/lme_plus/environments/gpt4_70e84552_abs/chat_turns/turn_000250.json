Some examples include a fruit smoothie with Greek yogurt, a banana with peanut butter, or a protein shake with a piece of fruit. Be sure to also drink plenty of water to rehydrate and avoid sugary or processed foods. It's always a good idea to consult with a registered dietitian or certified personal trainer to create a customized nutrition plan that fits your specific fitness goals and needs. Happy working out!",
