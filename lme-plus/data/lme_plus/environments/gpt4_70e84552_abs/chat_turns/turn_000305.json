I'd be happy to help you find your next great read.\n\nTo give you personalized recommendations, could you please tell me a bit more about the books you just finished? What genre were they?

A similar genre (e.g., if you just finished a thriller, do you want another thriller)?\n2. Something completely different (e.g., if you just finished a romance, do you want a sci-fi or fantasy book)?\n3. A light, easy read or something more challenging?\n4. A standalone book or a series?\n5. A book with a specific theme or setting (e.g., historical, contemporary, fantasy world)?\n\nAny additional information you can provide will help me give you more targeted book recommendations.",
