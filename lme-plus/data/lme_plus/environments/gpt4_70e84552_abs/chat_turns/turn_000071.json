Glass containers are perfect for soups, stews, or meals that need to be reheated, while bento boxes are ideal for meals with multiple components, like rice, protein, and vegetables.\n\nSeparate compartments will definitely help keep your meals organized and make it easier to grab-and-go. It's also a great way to ensure you're getting a balanced meal with the right portions.\n\nHere are a few more tips to consider when using bento boxes:\n\n* Use the compartments to separate food groups, such as protein, carbs, and veggies.\n* Pack a variety of foods to keep your meals interesting and prevent boredom.\n* Consider using small containers or cups for sauces, dressings, or condiments to add flavor to your meals.\n* Label your containers with the date, meal name, and any reheating instructions to make meal prep a breeze.\n\nRemember, meal prep is all about finding a system that works for you and your lifestyle. Experiment with different containers, portion sizes, and meal ideas until you find what keeps you motivated and excited about cooking at home.\n\nDo you have any favorite meal prep recipes or ideas that you're excited to try with your new containers?",
