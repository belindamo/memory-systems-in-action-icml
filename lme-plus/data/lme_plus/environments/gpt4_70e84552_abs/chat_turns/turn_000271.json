  "content": "I cannot speak for the author's intention, but it is true that meursault appears to lack introspection and is not inclined to analyze his actions or their consequences. this trait is precisely what complicates meursault's characterization, as it makes him difficult to understand and relate to on an emotional level.\n\nhowever, camus deliberately portrays meursault as a passive, detached observer of life. by depriving him of introspection, camus reinforces the idea that meursault is an outsider in a society that values conformity and emotional expression. meursault's lack of self-awareness and introspection could be seen as a deliberate attempt to highlight the significance of individual freedom and the rejection of societal pressure for conformity.\n\nin summary, the lack of reflection and introspection by meursault is an essential aspect of his characterization in the novel, as it highlights the absurdist nature of humanity and the importance of seeking individual freedom in a society that values conformity.",
