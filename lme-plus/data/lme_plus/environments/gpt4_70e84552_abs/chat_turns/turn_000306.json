  "content": "The books I finished were self-help and memoirs, and I really enjoyed them. They were thought-provoking and helped me reflect on my life. I'm in the mood for something different, maybe a fiction novel that's easy to get into. I've had a pretty relaxed pace lately, like during my social media break from February 10th to 20th when I had more time to focus on reading and other activities.",
