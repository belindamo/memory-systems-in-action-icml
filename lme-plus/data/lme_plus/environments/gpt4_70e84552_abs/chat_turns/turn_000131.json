  "content": "For a typical home user like you, I'd recommend the following RAM and storage capacity for a NAS device:\n\n**RAM:**\n\n* 4 GB of RAM is a good starting point for most home users. This will provide a smooth experience for file sharing, media streaming, and data backup. With 4 GB of RAM, you can expect:\n\t+ Fast file access and transfer speeds\n\t+ Smooth media streaming (up to 4K resolution)\n\t+ Support for multiple simultaneous connections (up to 10-15 devices)\n* If you plan to use your NAS for more demanding tasks, such as:\n\t+ Heavy media transcoding (e.g., converting video files on the fly)\n\t+ Running multiple virtual machines or Docker containers\n\t+ Supporting a large number of users (more than 15-20 devices)\n\t+ Running resource-intensive applications (e.g., surveillance cameras, Plex media server)\n\t...then consider 8 GB or more of RAM.\n\n**Storage Capacity:**\n\n* For a typical home user, a minimum of 2-4 TB of storage capacity is recommended. This will provide enough space for:\n\t+ Storing files, documents, and media (music, videos, photos)\n\t+ Backing up data from multiple devices (laptops, desktops, smartphones, tablets)\n\t+ Storing media libraries for streaming\n* If you have a large media collection or plan to store a lot of data, consider:\n\t+ 6-8 TB or more for a larger media library or multiple backup sets\n\t+ 10-12 TB or more for a massive media library or a large number of backup sets\n\n**Why these recommendations?**\n\n* 4 GB of RAM provides a good balance between performance and cost. It's sufficient for most home users, but you can always upgrade to 8 GB or more if needed.\n* 2-4 TB of storage capacity is a good starting point for most home users. It provides enough space for storing files, backing up data, and streaming media. If you need more storage, you can always expand your NAS with additional drives or upgrade to a larger model.\n\n**Synology DS920+ specifics:**\n\n* The Synology DS920+ comes with 4 GB of RAM, which is a good starting point for most home users.\n* The NAS has four bays, allowing you to install up to 4 x 16 TB hard drives, for a total capacity of 64 TB. You can start with 2-4 TB drives and upgrade as needed.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general recommendations, and your specific needs may vary.
