  "content": "Adding a mac 'n cheese layer and using mild cheese will definitely make the lasagna more kid-friendly.\n\nFor a fun and interactive dessert, I have a few ideas that the kids can help with:\n\n1. **Make-Your-Own Sundae Bar**: Set up a sundae bar with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, sprinkles, chopped nuts, and other toppings. Let the kids create their own sundaes and get creative with their toppings.\n2. **Fruit Kebabs**: Cut up fresh fruit like grapes, strawberries, and pineapple, and let the kids thread them onto skewers to create colorful fruit kebabs. You can also add a dollop of whipped cream or yogurt for extra fun.\n3. **Rice Krispy Treats**: Make a batch of Rice Krispy treats and let the kids help shape them into fun shapes using cookie cutters or their hands. You can also add food coloring to make them more vibrant.\n4. **Banana Bites**: Cut bananas into bite-sized pieces and let the kids dip them in melted chocolate (with adult supervision, of course!). Add sprinkles or chopped nuts before the chocolate hardens for a fun treat.\n5. **Cookie Decorating**: Bake a batch of sugar cookies and let the kids decorate them with frosting, sprinkles, and other toppings. This can be a great way to get creative and have fun.\n\nThese activities are all easy to set up and allow the kids to get involved in the dessert-making process. It's a great way to spend quality time together and create sweet memories!\n\nWhich one of these ideas do you think Emma and Max would enjoy the most?",
