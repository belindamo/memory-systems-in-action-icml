  "content": "GPS accuracy is crucial for runners, especially when tracking distance and pace. Here's a breakdown of the GPS capabilities for each of the watches I mentioned earlier:\n\n**Budget-Friendly Options (Under $200)**\n\n1. **Fitbit Versa 2**: The Versa 2 uses a combination of GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems to provide accurate distance tracking. While it's not as precise as high-end GPS watches, it's still reliable for tracking runs up to 10 km. However, some users have reported slight discrepancies in distance tracking, especially in areas with heavy tree cover or tall buildings.\n2. **Garmin Vivosport**: The Vivosport uses GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems, and it's known for its accurate distance tracking. It's suitable for runs up to 10 km and provides reliable pace and distance data.\n\n**Mid-Range Options ( $200-$400)**\n\n1. **Garmin Forerunner 245 Music**: The Forerunner 245 Music uses GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems, and it's designed for runners who need accurate distance and pace tracking. It's highly accurate for runs up to 20 km and provides features like pace alerts and lap tracking.\n2. **Polar M430**: The M430 uses GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems, and it's known for its accurate distance tracking. It's suitable for runs up to 20 km and provides features like running power metrics and stride detection.\n\n**High-End Options ( $400-$600)**\n\n1. **Garmin Forerunner 945**: The Forerunner 945 uses GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou satellite systems, making it one of the most accurate GPS watches on the market. It's suitable for runs of any distance and provides advanced features like performance condition, lactate threshold, and route planning.\n2. **Suunto 3 Fitness**: The Suunto 3 Fitness uses GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo satellite systems, and it's designed for runners who need accurate distance and pace tracking. It's suitable for runs up to 20 km and provides features like route planning and storm alerts.\n\n**Premium Options (Over $600)**\n\n1. **Garmin Fenix 6X Pro**: The Fenix 6X Pro uses GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou satellite systems, making it one of the most accurate GPS watches on the market. It's suitable for runs of any distance and provides advanced features like navigation, route planning, and music storage.\n2. **Apple Watch Series 7**: The Apple Watch Series 7 uses GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and QZSS satellite systems, and it's designed for runners who need accurate distance and pace tracking. It's suitable for runs up to 20 km and provides features like music storage and integration with Apple Health.\n\nIn your case, since you're running around the lake and covering a distance of 6-8 km, I'd recommend the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music or the Polar M430. Both of these watches are designed for runners and provide accurate distance and pace tracking. They're also waterproof and have a battery life that can last several days.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to invest in a high-end watch, the Garmin Forerunner 945 or the Garmin Fenix 6X Pro would provide you with even more advanced features and accuracy.",
