Has affinity groups that support \u201cmultigenerational\u201d solutions\n\u00b7 Benefits that acknowledge some people who have Medicare want a Medicare supplement instead of basic health insurance\n\u00b7 Provides hours for care-taking as a benefit. Grandparents need this for different reasons than parents but everyone needs it at some point.\n\u00b7 Is employee-owned. Employee owned-companies just make sense. \n\u00b7 Has a handle on how to measure results. I am a fan of John Doerr and his thoughts on measuring what matters, but anyone who wrestles with a focus on results is wrestling with the right angel.\n\u00b7 Offers base compensation with an annual bonus based on goals I get to negotiate with my boss.\n\u00b7 Does not require performance reviews. Instead, my boss and I would go over my portfolio of results once a year. My boss would be relieved not to have to write a stack of reviews and I would be relieved not to hear about my character flaws."
