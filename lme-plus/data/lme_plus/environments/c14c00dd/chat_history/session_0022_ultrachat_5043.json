Non-judgmental mindfulness involves observing one's thoughts and feelings without labeling them as good or bad. By doing this, individuals can learn to accept their emotions without getting caught up in them, leading to reduced stress, anxiety, and depression. This can lead to an overall increase in positive emotions such as happiness, contentment, and peace. It can also help individuals to identify and address negative thought patterns, leading to improved emotional regulation and wellbeing."
