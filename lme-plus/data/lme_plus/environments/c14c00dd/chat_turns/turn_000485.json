This could include unusual materials, asymmetrical shapes, or unexpected colors.\n\n2. Consider the scale of the light fixture in relation to your space. If you have a small apartment, a large, oversized light fixture could overwhelm the room.\n\n3. Pay attention to the type of light that the fixture emits. You want to choose a light that illuminates your space well, while also creating a warm and inviting ambiance.\n\n4. Choose a light fixture that complements your existing decor. If you have a modern apartment, a sleek and minimalist light fixture may be a good choice.
