If you do run into issues, it's always good to have a backup plan.\n\nAs for a good plumber in your area, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or direct recommendations. However, I can suggest a few ways to find a reliable plumber:\n\n1. **Online Review Sites**: Check websites like Yelp, Google Reviews, or Angie's List to find plumbers in your area with good reviews and ratings.\n2. **Word of Mouth**: Ask friends, family, or neighbors who have had positive experiences with plumbers in the past.\n3. **Professional Associations**: Look for plumbers who are members of professional associations like the National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA) or the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors Association (PHCC).\n4. **Licenses and Certifications**: Make sure the plumber is licensed and certified in your state and has the necessary qualifications for your specific issue.\n5. **Get Multiple Quotes**: Get quotes from multiple plumbers to compare prices and services.\n\nRemember to always research and vet any potential plumber before hiring them. Good luck with your DIY project, and I hope you're able to fix the leaky faucet successfully!",
