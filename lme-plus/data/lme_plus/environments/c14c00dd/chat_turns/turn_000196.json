Practice self-compassion: Be kind and patient with yourself as you navigate mindfulness practice. Remember that non-judgmental mindfulness involves self-acceptance and self-compassion.\n\n3. Practice awareness in your daily life: During your daily activities, pay attention to your thoughts and emotions without judgment. Observe them as they arise and let them go.\n\n4. Practice gratitude: Focus on things you are grateful for each day to promote positive thinking and reduce negative thoughts.\n\n5. Seek guidance: Consider attending a mindfulness group or seeking guidance from a mental health professional to deepen your practice or address any barriers that may arise.\n\nRemember, practicing non-judgment in mindfulness can be challenging at first but with time, it can help you cultivate a positive and peaceful state of mind.",
