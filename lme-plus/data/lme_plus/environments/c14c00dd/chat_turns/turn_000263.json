  "content": "Using Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a great way to track form submissions without modifying your website's code. I'll guide you through the process of setting up a tag and trigger in GTM for the form submission event.\n\n**Step 1: Create a new tag in GTM**\n\n1. Log in to your Google Tag Manager account and select the container for your website.\n2. Click on \"Tags\" in the top menu and then click \"New\" to create a new tag.\n3. Choose \"Google Analytics\" as the tag type.\n4. Select \"Universal Analytics\" as the Google Analytics type.\n5. Enter a name for your tag, such as \"Form Submission Tracking\".\n6. Set the \"Track Type\" to \"Event\".\n7. In the \"Event\" section, enter the following settings:\n\t* Category: Form\n\t* Action: Submission\n\t* Label: [Optional, but you can enter a label like \"Contact Form\" to differentiate between forms]\n\t* Value: [Optional, but you can enter a value like 1 to track the number of form submissions]\n8. Click \"Save\" to save the tag.\n\n**Step 2: Create a new trigger in GTM**\n\n1. Click on \"Triggers\" in the top menu and then click \"New\" to create a new trigger.\n2. Choose \"Form Submission\" as the trigger type.\n3. Select the form submission event that you want to track. You can choose from the following options:\n\t* \"Form ID\": Enter the ID of the form element (e.g., `<form id=\"contact-form\">`).\n\t* \"Form Class\": Enter the class of the form element (e.g., `<form class=\"contact-form\">`).\n\t* \"Form Selector\": Enter a CSS selector that targets the form element (e.g., `#contact-form` or `.contact-form`).\n4. Set the \"Fire on\" option to \"Submit\" to trigger the tag when the form is submitted.\n5. Click \"Save\" to save the trigger.\n\n**Step 3: Link the tag to the trigger**\n\n1. Go back to the \"Tags\" section and find the tag you created earlier.\n2. Click the three vertical dots at the end of the tag row and select \"Edit\".\n3. In the \"Triggers\" section, click the \"+\" icon to add a new trigger.\n4. Select the trigger you created in Step 2.\n5. Click \"Save\" to save the changes.\n\n**Step 4: Publish the GTM container**\n\n1. Click on \"Submit\" in the top-right corner of the GTM interface.\n2. Select \"Publish\" to publish the changes to your GTM container.\n\nOnce you've published the container, the tag will be triggered when the form is submitted, and the event will be sent to Google Analytics. You can then set up a goal in Google Analytics to track the form submissions as conversions.\n\nThat's it! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
