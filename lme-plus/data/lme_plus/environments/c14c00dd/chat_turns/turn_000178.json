Here is the remainder of Example 3:\n\n| Scene | Music | Voiceover |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | Tense chord progressions play | \"I sit down at my desk and start experimenting with different sounds and drums. It's tough going at first, but I'm determined to make this beat a success.\" |\n| 3 | Eerie sound effects play | \"I start to get into a groove, and the beat starts to take shape. But just when I think I've got it all figured out, something goes wrong. The sound starts to glitch and distort, and I can feel the tension mounting.\" |\n| 4 | Tense chord progression builds | \"I don't give up easily, though. I start fiddling with the settings and trying different approaches, determined to get this beat back on track. It's a battle, but I'm not going down without a fight.\" |\n| 5 | Triumphant music plays | \"And then, finally, it happens. The beat comes together, and the glitches disappear. It's a feeling of pure triumph, and I can't wait to share it with all of you. Stay tuned for the final product.\" |\n\nI hope these revised storyboards give you some ideas on how to incorporate tension and suspense into your vlog series while focusing on music production. Good luck with your vlogging!",
