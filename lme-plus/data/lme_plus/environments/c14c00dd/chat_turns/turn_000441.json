  "content": "K-means clustering is a widely used method for clustering in data mining and machine learning. It is a partitional clustering technique that aims to partition a given dataset into k clusters, where k is a user-specified parameter.\n\nThe K-means algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialization: Choose k initial cluster centroids randomly from the data points.\n2. Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n3. Update: Recalculate the centroids of each cluster based on the mean of the data points assigned to it.\n4. Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nThe K-means algorithm aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid. This is known as the objective function or the within-cluster sum of squares.\n\nK-means clustering is widely used in various applications such as image segmentation, document clustering, customer segmentation, and market basket analysis. However, the K-means algorithm suffers from several limitations, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, the need to specify the number of clusters, and the assumption of spherical clusters. Therefore, several extensions and variations of the K-means algorithm have been proposed to overcome these limitations, such as the hierarchical K-means, fuzzy K-means, and spectral clustering algorithms.",
