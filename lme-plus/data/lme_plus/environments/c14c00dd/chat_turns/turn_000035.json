  "content": "That sounds like an amazing finale! A big, energetic dance break with a group of friends is always a crowd-pleaser. I can imagine the energy and excitement of performing together with your group.

Dancing with friends can make the experience even more enjoyable, and it's always more fun to share the experience with people you care about.\n\nAre you planning on inviting friends and family to come watch the showcase, or is it more of an in-studio event?",
