The CB2 Simple Glass Table Lamp is a beautiful piece, and I'm sure it will look great in your bedroom.\n\nAnd congratulations on rearranging your bedroom furniture! It can be refreshing to give your space a new layout. With your bed against the wall with the window, you might want to consider the lamp's placement to ensure it's not obstructing the natural light or creating harsh shadows. You might also want to think about the cord length and outlet placement to make sure the lamp is easily accessible.\n\nSince your desk is now against the wall with the closet, you might want to consider adding some task lighting to that area as well. A desk lamp or a floor lamp could help create a cozy and productive workspace.\n\nRemember to take your time and have fun with the process of decorating your bedroom. It's a great opportunity to express your personal style and create a space that feels relaxing and inviting. If you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask!",
