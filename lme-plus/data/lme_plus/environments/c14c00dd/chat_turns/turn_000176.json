Here is the revised storyboard in table format:\n\n| Scene | Music | Voiceover |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Suspenseful music plays | \"Welcome to my studio, where the magic happens. Today, I'm tackling a new project, and I've got a feeling it's going to be a challenge. But I love a good challenge, especially when it comes to making music.\" |\n| 2 | Tense chord progressions play | \"I've got this idea for a track, but I'm having trouble getting it out of my head and onto the screen. It's like there's this wall blocking my creativity, and I can't seem to break through it.\" |\n| 3 | Eerie sound effects play | \"I've got a feeling that the key to breaking through this wall is to take a risk and try something new. So I start experimenting with some sounds and instruments that I've never used before. The results are strange and unsettling, but I can't help but feel like I'm onto something.\" |\n| 4 | Tense chord progression builds | \"Slowly but surely, I start piecing together a rough draft of the track.

It's tough going at first, but I'm determined to make this track a success.\" |\n| 3 | Eerie sound effects play | \"I start to get into a groove, and the track starts to take shape. But just when I think I've got it all figured out, something goes wrong. The sound starts to glitch and distort, and I can feel the tension mounting.\" |\n| 4 | Tense chord progression builds | \"I don't give up easily, though. I start fiddling with the settings and trying different approaches, determined to get this track back on track. It's a battle, but I'm not going down without a fight.\" |\n| 5 | Triumphant music plays | \"And then, finally, it happens. The track comes together, and the glitches disappear.
