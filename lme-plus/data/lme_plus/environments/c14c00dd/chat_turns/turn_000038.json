  "content": "MK, still shrunk, sneaks through the jungle and eventually finds Mei, Tang, and Macaque. Mei and Tang are trying to make Macaque comfortable, tending to his wounds and giving him water to drink. They look up as MK approaches, and their eyes widen in surprise.\n\n\"MK, you made it!\" Mei exclaimed.\n\n\"We thought you were captured,\" Tang added.\n\nMK shakes his head, \"I managed to escape, but my father knows I'm still alive. We need to come up with a plan to get out of here safely.\"\n\nMacaque, who had been silent until now, speaks up weakly. \"We can't leave yet. We need to take back the kingdom from my brother.\"\n\nMei and Tang nod in agreement, but MK hesitates. \"Are you sure you're up for it? You're in no condition to fight right now.\"\n\nMacaque's expression hardens. \"I may be weak, but I am the true king of this mountain. I won't rest until my kingdom is mine again.\"\n\nMK nods, understanding the determination in Macaque's eyes. \"Okay, then we'll need to come up with a plan to take out Wukong and his army. And we'll need to do it fast, before he has a chance to come after us.\"\n\nThe four of them begin discussing potential strategies, trying to come up with a plan that will give them the upper hand against Wukong's army. As they talk, MK can't help but feel a sense of unease. He knows his father won't give up easily, and he knows the fight ahead of them will be a difficult one. But with Macaque by their side, and the determination of Mei and Tang, he knows they stand a chance. They'll do whatever it takes to take back the kingdom and restore order to the mountain.",
