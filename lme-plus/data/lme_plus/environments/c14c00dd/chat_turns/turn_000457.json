  "content": "1. Rising rent costs: As gentrification progresses, the cost of rent increases. With this, small businesses may find it challenging to afford the rent and end up relocating or shutting down.\n\n2. Increased competition: As developers move in, more businesses may follow, causing oversaturation and increased competition for small businesses that have been in the area for a long time.\n\n3. Cultural displacement: As the gentrification wave reaches East Austin, the original inhabitants, particularly those from minority communities, may have to deal with cultural displacement. Small businesses that have long catered to these communities may struggle to adapt to the changing demographic.\n\n4. Historical erasure: Historical buildings and landmarks in East Austin may be demolished or transformed, changing its rich cultural heritage. This may negatively affect small businesses that rely on the area's cultural identity for attracting customers.\n\n5. Difficulty accessing capital: Small businesses in East Austin may find it challenging to obtain financing since banks and lenders tend to shy away from lending funds to businesses in rapidly gentrifying areas. Lack of capital can hinder business growth and access to resources necessary for competition.",
