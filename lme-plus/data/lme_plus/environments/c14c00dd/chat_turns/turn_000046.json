The cave was dark and foreboding, and he could feel a sense of dread creeping over him. Suddenly, he heard the sound of footsteps approaching.\n\n\"MK, you disappoint me,\" a voice boomed through the cave. It was his father, Sun Wukong.\n\nMK turned to face his father, his heart pounding in his chest. \"Father, I-I'm sorry,\" he stammered.\n\nWukong's face was a mask of anger. \"Sorry? You defied me and helped that traitor escape. You're no son of mine.\"\n\nMK felt a pang of fear and sadness in his chest. \"Please, Father, I only did what I thought was right,\" he pleaded.\n\nWukong sneered at him. \"Right? You're weak, MK. You'll never be a true warrior like me. And now, you've led me right to your little campsite and your friends. They'll all pay for your disobedience.\"\n\nMK woke up with a start, his heart racing. He looked around and saw that he was still in the campsite with Mei, Tang, and Macaque, all of them were asleep. He took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. It was just a dream, but it felt so real. He couldn't shake off the feeling of dread that his father would find them. He knew he had to come up with a plan to protect his friends and regain his father's trust before it was too late.",
