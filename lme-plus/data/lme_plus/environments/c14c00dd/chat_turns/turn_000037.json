  "content": "That's great! It's wonderful that the studio is opening up the showcase to the public, and I'm sure you'll have a good-sized audience cheering you on. Performing in front of an audience can be nerve-wracking, but it's a great way to challenge yourself and gain experience.\n\nRemember that it's normal to feel nervous, but try to focus on the excitement and joy of sharing your passion with others. You've worked hard on the routine, and you're ready for this! Take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy the moment.\n\nIt's also great that you'll have friends and family in the audience to support you. Having a familiar face in the crowd can make a big difference in terms of nerves. Just remember to take in the experience and have fun with it. You got this!\n\nAre you planning on doing anything special to prepare for the showcase, like getting together with your group to rehearse one last time or visualizing your performance?",
