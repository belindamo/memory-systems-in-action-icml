  "content": "A mechanical engineering degree program can give students a strong foundation in mechanical engineering principles and project management theory, which is certainly helpful in managing complex projects. However, managing complex projects often requires experience beyond the classroom and a practical understanding of the industry-specific requirements and regulations.\n\nReal-world experience gained through internships, projects, or industry work can complement the coursework and provide additional insights and skills necessary for managing complex projects. Engineers who work in the industry are exposed to project management techniques, team dynamics, and technical expertise necessary for dealing with project issues as they arise.\n\nTherefore, a combination of education and practical experience can help improve the ability of mechanical engineers to manage complex projects.  Many successful project managers have a lot of experience working in practical settings and have gradually developed their project management skills over many years. The key is to understand the theoretical principles of project management and apply them in practical scenarios through experience.",
