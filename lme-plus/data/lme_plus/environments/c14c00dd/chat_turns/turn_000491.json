  "content": "Great question! Here are some tips on how to choose a statement mirror that will add some style to your space without making it too flashy or tacky:\n\n1. Consider the shape and size of the mirror. A large, rectangular mirror can create a more modern and sleek look, while a round or oval mirror can add a softer touch to your space.\n\n2. Think about the frame of the mirror. A minimal, frameless mirror can create a clean and contemporary look, while a ornate, gilded frame can add some glamour and elegance to your space.\n\n3. Consider the placement of the mirror. Hanging a mirror on a wall opposite a window can reflect natural light and make your space feel brighter and more inviting.\n\n4. Choose a mirror with a purpose. For example, a full-length mirror can be functional for getting ready in the morning, while a mirror with a shelf or hooks can be practical for extra storage.\n\n5. Don't be afraid to mix and match. Pairing a modern mirror with a rustic or vintage decor can create an interesting contrast and add some personality to your space.\n\nHere are some specific statement mirror recommendations that could work well for different styles:\n\n1. West Elm Metal Framed Round Wall Mirror - This round mirror has a sleek, minimal frame that adds a modern touch to any space.\n\n2. Ikea Knapper Standing Mirror - This full-length mirror has built-in hooks for hanging clothes or bags, making it practical and functional for small spaces.\n\n3. Crate & Barrel Jules Brass Round Mirror - This round mirror has a brass finish and a unique shape that adds some glamour and artistry to your space.\n\n4. Anthropologie Camilla Mirror - This ornate, unique mirror features a hand-carved teak frame that adds some bohemian charm to your space.\n\nRemember, a statement mirror doesn't have to be flashy or tacky. By choosing the right shape, size, and frame, and considering its placement and purpose, you can find a mirror that will add some style and elegance to your space without overpowering it.",
