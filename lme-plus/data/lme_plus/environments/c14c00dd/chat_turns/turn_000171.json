My thesis research on vacuum consolidation for soft soil improvement showcases my expertise and passion in the field. With two years of professional experience, I have a proven track record of delivering projects in a timely and efficient manner. I have worked as a junior geotechnical engineer at P.T. NSE, where I designed shallow foundations and mini piles for airport facilities, evaluated soil investigation data and slope stability, and developed soil design parameters. Currently, I work as a junior engineer at P.T. AECOM Indonesia, a multinational company, where I am responsible for document and project control for a port restoration project. My technical skills in PLAXIS, Lpile, Group, Geostudio, Settle3D, and Abaqus, along with my proficiency in Microsoft Office, make me a valuable asset to any organization.
