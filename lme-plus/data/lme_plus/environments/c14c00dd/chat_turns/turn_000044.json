  "content": "Mei looks at Macaque with reverence, \"Your Majesty, please tell us about the mountain before the invasion. We've only heard stories from the golden-haired monkeys, and we want to know the truth.\"\n\nMacaque chuckles and shakes his head, \"Please, call me Mac. I haven't been called 'Your Majesty' in centuries. And as for the mountain, it was a beautiful place. The monkeys lived in harmony, and there was a balance of power between the different tribes. The mountain was alive with magic, and every corner held a new discovery. We had a council of elders that would make decisions for the good of the mountain and all its inhabitants.\"\n\nMK speaks up, \"What happened to the council? Why did the golden-haired monkeys take over?\"\n\nMacaque's expression turns sad, \"The council of elders was betrayed by one of our own. A monkey who was envious of the power the council held. He formed an alliance with the golden-haired monkeys and together they overthrew the council and took over the mountain.\"\n\nTang adds, \"We've heard rumors that the traitor is still alive, and he's the one who's been leading the golden-haired monkeys all these years.\"\n\nMacaque nods, \"Yes, that's true. He's the one who's been keeping me prisoner all these years. But now that I'm free, I plan to take back what's rightfully mine and restore balance to the mountain.\"\n\nThe group falls silent, lost in their own thoughts as they stare into the fire. Macaque's words have given them hope, and they know that reclaiming the mountain won't be easy, but with Macaque leading them, they believe it's possible.",
