Did you choose a specific style or material for the new rug, or was it more of a spontaneous decision?\n\nBy the way, since you mentioned you've rearranged your bedroom furniture, I'm curious: how's the new layout working out for you? Are you enjoying the new configuration, or are there any tweaks you're still making?",
