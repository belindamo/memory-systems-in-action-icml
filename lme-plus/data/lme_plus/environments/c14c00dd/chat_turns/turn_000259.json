Setting up a dashboard in Google Analytics to track conversions is a great way to apply your knowledge. I'd be happy to guide you through the process.\n\n**Step 1: Define Your Conversion Goals**\n\nBefore creating a dashboard, identify what constitutes a conversion for your product launch. Examples of conversions might include:\n\n* Form submissions (e.g., newsletter sign-ups, demo requests, or contact forms)\n* Purchases or transactions\n* Downloads (e.g., e-books, whitepapers, or software trials)\n* Button clicks (e.g., \"Get Started\" or \"Learn More\")\n* Specific page visits (e.g., a thank-you page after a purchase)\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Conversion Tracking in Google Analytics**\n\nTo track conversions, you'll need to set up Goals in Google Analytics. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to your Google Analytics account and navigate to the \"Admin\" section.\n2. Select the property you want to track conversions for.\n3. Click on \"Goals\" under the \"Conversions\" section.\n4. Click \"New Goal\" and choose the type of goal you want to track (e.g., \"Form submission\" or \"Destination\").\n5. Set up the goal details, such as the goal name, description, and value (if applicable).\n6. Set up the trigger for the goal, which is the action that will trigger the conversion (e.g., a form submission or a specific page visit).\n\n**Step 3: Create a Dashboard in Google Analytics**\n\nNow that you've set up your conversion goals, create a dashboard to track them:\n\n1. Navigate to the \"Dashboards\" section in Google Analytics.\n2. Click \"New Dashboard\" and give your dashboard a name (e.g., \"Product Launch Conversions\").\n3. Add widgets to your dashboard by clicking the \"Add Widget\" button.\n4. Choose the \"Metric\" widget type and select the conversion goal you set up earlier.\n5. Customize the widget settings as needed (e.g., choose a specific date range or filter).\n6. Add additional widgets to track other relevant metrics, such as website traffic, bounce rate, or average session duration.\n\n**Step 4: Customize Your Dashboard**\n\nTailor your dashboard to your needs by:\n\n1. Adding multiple widgets to track different conversion goals or metrics.\n2. Using filters to segment your data (e.g., by country, device, or browser).\n3. Creating custom segments to track specific user groups (e.g., users who completed a purchase).\n4. Using annotations to mark important events or milestones in your data.\n\n**Resources to Help You Get Started**\n\n* Google Analytics Academy: A free online course that covers the basics of Google Analytics, including goal setup and dashboard creation.\n* Google Analytics Help Center: Official documentation with step-by-step guides and tutorials on setting up goals and dashboards.\n* Coursera's Google Analytics course: You've already taken this course, but revisit the sections on goal setup and dashboard creation for a refresher.\n\nBy following these steps and leveraging your Coursera knowledge, you'll be able to create a powerful dashboard in Google Analytics to track conversions and gain insights into your product launch performance.
