  "content": "The Breakfast Club is a fantastic spot for a retro-style breakfast experience.\n\nAccording to online reviews and their social media, The Breakfast Club in Riverside does have a small outdoor patio area where you can enjoy your meal. It's not a huge patio, but it's a cozy spot to soak up some sunshine while you indulge in their delicious breakfast dishes. However, please note that patio seating is limited, and it's first-come, first-served, so you might want to plan accordingly.\n\nIf the patio is full or you prefer indoor seating, their retro-themed interior is also a lot of fun! You can sit at the counter, booths, or tables and enjoy the nostalgic vibes.\n\nIt's always a good idea to call ahead or check their social media to confirm their patio availability and hours, especially if you're planning to visit during peak hours or on weekends.\n\nHave a fantastic breakfast at The Breakfast Club, and I hope you enjoy your meal!",
