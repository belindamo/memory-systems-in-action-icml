  "content": "I'd like to propose another idea for joint marketing efforts. How about we create a social media challenge that encourages participants to share their own stories of why they're running for cancer research? We could use a branded hashtag and have participants share photos or videos of themselves training, fundraising, or overcoming obstacles. The cancer society could share their own stories of the impact of cancer research, and we could feature some of these stories on our social media channels as well. This could help create a sense of community and accountability among participants, and also raise awareness about the importance of cancer research. What do you think?",
