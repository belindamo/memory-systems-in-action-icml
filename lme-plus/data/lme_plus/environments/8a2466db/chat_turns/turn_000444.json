Being able to play through the game again with all your upgraded gear and abilities would be incredibly satisfying. Imagine taking on the toughest challenges with your overpowered Kratos, effortlessly tearing through enemies and bosses with ease. It would be a great way to experience the game in a new way, and the sense of accomplishment would be even greater.\n\nAnd, as you mentioned, if the developers add new story content or alternative playstyles, it would be a huge bonus. It would give players even more reason to play through the game again, and it would add more depth and replay value to the game.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that a New Game Plus mode would be a great way to encourage players to try out different playstyles and strategies. With all your upgraded gear and abilities, you could experiment with different tactics and approaches, and try out new things that you might not have been able to do on your first playthrough.\n\nOverall, I think a New Game Plus mode would be an excellent addition to God of War Ragnar\u00f6k, and I hope that the developers consider including it in the game.\n\nWhat do you think about the possibility of a New Game Plus mode with a twist? For example, what if the mode had a unique twist, like a permadeath system, where if Kratos dies, you have to start over from the beginning? Or what if the mode had a unique narrative twist, like a alternate storyline or a different Kratos?",
