Here's what you need to know:\n\nThe Nikon D750 is a full-frame camera, and it's known for its excellent ISO performance. Here's a general breakdown of how it handles different ISO ranges:\n\n* **Base ISO**: 100-400: This is the native ISO range of the camera, where it performs best. You'll get the cleanest images with the least amount of noise.\n* **Good ISO range**: 800-1600: This range is still quite usable, with minimal noise and excellent image quality. You can expect a slight increase in noise, but it's still well-controlled.\n* **High ISO range**: 3200-6400: At these settings, noise starts to become more apparent, but the camera still handles it relatively well. You might need to apply some noise reduction in post-processing.\n* **Pushed ISO range**: 12800-25600: Use these settings sparingly, as noise becomes more pronounced. You might need to apply significant noise reduction, and image quality may suffer.\n* **Extended ISO range**: 51200 and above: These settings are best avoided, as noise becomes extremely noticeable, and image quality degrades significantly.\n\nWhen to use each ISO range:\n\n* **Landscapes and studio work**: Stick to the base ISO range (100-400) for the cleanest images.\n* **Indoor events and low-light portraits**: Use the good ISO range (800-1600) for a balance between image quality and noise control.\n* **Low-light street photography and indoor sports**: Venture into the high ISO range (3200-6400) for acceptable noise levels and decent image quality.\n* **Extremely low-light situations**: Use the pushed ISO range (12800-25600) with caution, as noise will be more pronounced.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and the ideal ISO range may vary depending on your personal preference, the scene, and the lighting conditions.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Nikon D750's ISO performance can be affected by factors like camera settings, lens quality, and post-processing techniques. Experiment with different ISO settings and techniques to find what works best for your style and needs.\n\nI hope this helps you understand your Nikon D750's ISO capabilities better!",
