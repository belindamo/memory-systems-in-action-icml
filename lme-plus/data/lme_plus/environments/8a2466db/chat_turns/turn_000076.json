  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! You mentioned earlier that you bought a Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, but now you're mentioning a Nikon D750 camera body. The Canon lens won't be compatible with your Nikon camera body.\n\nAssuming you meant to say you have a Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, I'd be happy to provide guidance on ISO settings for your Nikon D750.\n\nThe Nikon D750 is a fantastic camera, and its ISO performance is excellent. Here's a general guideline for ISO ranges on your camera:\n\n* **Base ISO**: 100-400: This is the native ISO range of the camera, where it performs best. You'll get the cleanest images with the least amount of noise.\n* **Good ISO range**: 800-1600: This range is still quite usable, with minimal noise and excellent image quality. You can expect a slight increase in noise, but it's still well-controlled.\n* **High ISO range**: 3200-6400: At these settings, noise starts to become more apparent, but the camera still handles it relatively well. You might need to apply some noise reduction in post-processing.\n* **Pushed ISO range**: 12800-25600: Use these settings sparingly, as noise becomes more pronounced. You might need to apply significant noise reduction, and image quality may suffer.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and the ideal ISO range may vary depending on the specific scene, lighting conditions, and your personal preference for noise and image quality.\n\nFor low-light photography, you'll likely need to venture into the higher ISO ranges. However, it's essential to strike a balance between letting enough light into the camera and maintaining acceptable noise levels.\n\nRemember to also consider the lens's capabilities, as some lenses perform better than others in low light. If you're using a Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, it's generally a good performer in low light, and you can expect good results even at higher ISOs.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!",
