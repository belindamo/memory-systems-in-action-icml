  "content": "Adding more plants to your tank is an EXCELLENT idea!\n\nLive plants can greatly benefit your tank's water quality and provide numerous benefits for your fish. Here are a few ways plants can help:\n\n1. **Water purification**: Plants absorb excess nutrients, toxins, and waste products from the water, helping to maintain good water quality and reduce the risk of waterborne diseases.\n2. **Oxygenation**: Plants produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, which can help increase the tank's oxygen levels, especially during the night when fish are more active.\n3. **Hiding places and visual barriers**: As you mentioned, plants provide hiding places and visual barriers for your fish, reducing stress and territorial behavior.\n4. **Food source**: Some plants, like Java moss or Anacharis, can serve as a food source for your fish, especially herbivorous or omnivorous species.\n5. **Stability and consistency**: Plants help maintain a stable and consistent environment, which can reduce stress and promote the overall health of your fish.\n\nWhen choosing plants for your tank, consider the following:\n\n* **Low-maintenance plants**: Neon tetras and harlequin rasboras are relatively low-maintenance fish, so you'll want plants that are easy to care for. Look for plants like Java moss, Anacharis, or Cryptocorynes.\n* **Low-light plants**: Since neon tetras are sensitive to bright light, choose plants that can thrive in low-light conditions, such as Java ferns or Anubias.\n* **Fast-growing plants**: Fast-growing plants like Hornwort or Water Wisteria can help control algae growth and provide a natural food source for your fish.\n\nWhen adding plants to your tank, make sure to:\n\n* **Acclimate them slowly**: Introduce plants gradually to your tank's water conditions to prevent shock or stress.\n* **Choose plants compatible with your tank's water parameters**: Ensure the plants you choose can thrive in your tank's water temperature, pH, and hardness.\n* **Provide proper care**: Research the specific care requirements for your chosen plants, including lighting, fertilization, and pruning.\n\nBy adding plants to your tank, you'll not only improve the water quality and provide hiding places for your fish, but you'll also create a more natural and visually appealing environment.\n\nRemember to monitor your tank's water parameters and fish behavior closely after adding plants, and make adjustments as needed. Good luck, and I hope you'll see an improvement in your neon tetras' behavior soon!",
