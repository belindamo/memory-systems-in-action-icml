  "content": "Sorry to hear that your neon tetras are acting lethargic!\n\nLethargy in neon tetras can be caused by a variety of factors. Given that you've had them for a relatively short period (about 2-3 weeks), it's possible that they're still adjusting to their new environment. However, it's essential to rule out any potential issues to ensure their health and well-being. Here are some common causes of lethargy in neon tetras:\n\n1. **Water quality**: Neon tetras are sensitive to water changes and poor water quality. Ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate spikes can cause lethargy. Make sure you're performing regular water changes (25-50% every 1-2 weeks) and monitoring your tank's water parameters.\n2. **Water temperature**: Neon tetras prefer temperatures between 72\u00b0F to 82\u00b0F (22\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C). If your tank's temperature is consistently above or below this range, it can cause stress and lethargy.\n3. **pH and hardness**: Neon tetras thrive in soft, slightly acidic water (pH 6.5-7.5). If your tank's pH or hardness levels are significantly different, it can cause stress and lethargy.\n4. **Overcrowding**: Neon tetras are schooling fish and prefer to be in groups. However, overcrowding can lead to stress and lethargy. Make sure you're not overstocking your tank.\n5. **Inadequate hiding places**: Neon tetras need plenty of hiding places to feel secure. If your tank lacks sufficient plants, rocks, or decorations, they might feel stressed and lethargic.\n6. **Diet**: Neon tetras have small stomachs and need to eat frequently. Inadequate or poor-quality food can cause lethargy. Ensure you're providing a varied and nutrient-rich diet.\n7. **Disease or parasites**: Neon tetras can be susceptible to diseases like neon tetra disease, ich, or parasites like ichthyophthiriasis. Monitor your fish for any visible signs of disease or parasites.\n8. **Acclimation issues**: When introducing new fish to a tank, they can experience stress due to changes in water chemistry, temperature, or other factors. This can lead to lethargy.\n9. **Tank size and shape**: Neon tetras prefer longer, wider tanks with plenty of swimming space. If your tank is too small or narrow, it can cause stress and lethargy.\n10. **Incompatibility with tankmates**: While harlequin rasboras are generally peaceful, they might be competing with your neon tetras for food or space. Monitor their behavior and ensure they're not harassing your neon tetras.\n\nGiven that you've introduced both species together, it's possible that they're still adjusting to each other's presence. Keep a close eye on their behavior and make sure they're not showing any signs of aggression or competition.\n\nTo address the lethargy, you can try the following:\n\n* Perform a partial water change (25-50%) to refresh the tank's water and remove any built-up toxins.\n* Monitor your tank's water parameters and adjust them if necessary.\n* Ensure your neon tetras are getting enough food and that it's of high quality.\n* Provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers to reduce stress.\n* Observe your fish's behavior to identify any potential issues or conflicts.\n\nIf the lethargy persists or worsens, consider consulting with a local pet store expert or a veterinarian specializing in aquatic animals for further guidance.",
