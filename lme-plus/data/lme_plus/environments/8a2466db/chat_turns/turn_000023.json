  "content": "I understand the confusion! I've searched for music festivals in the Riverside, California area around April 17th and 18th, but I couldn't find any information about a festival featuring The Killers on those specific dates. It's possible that the festival was held at a different location or on different dates.\n\nIf you can remember any other details about the festival, such as the name of the festival, the venue, or any other bands that performed, it might help me narrow down the search. Alternatively, you can also try searching online for \"music festivals in Riverside, CA\" or \"concerts in Riverside, CA\" to see if you can find any information about the event you attended.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're still planning a trip to Riverside, I can suggest some popular restaurants and eateries in the area. Would you like some recommendations?",
