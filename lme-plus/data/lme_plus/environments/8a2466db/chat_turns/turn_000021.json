  "content": "I'm happy to help you with some food recommendations around the Riverside Festival Grounds! However, I have to clarify that there is no Riverside Festival Grounds that I'm aware of, and The Killers didn't have a concert in Riverside on April 17th and 18th. It's possible that you might be thinking of a different location or festival.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the festival you attended or the exact location of the Riverside Festival Grounds you're planning to visit, I'd be happy to try and assist you with some dining recommendations. Alternatively, I can suggest some popular eateries in the city of Riverside, California, if that's where you're headed. Just let me know!",
