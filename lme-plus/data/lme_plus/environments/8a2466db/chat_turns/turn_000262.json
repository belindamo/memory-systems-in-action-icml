  "content": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was born on May 22, 1859, and he died on July 7, 1930. This means that he lived to be 71 years old.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Conan Doyle was a prolific writer and a man of many interests and pursuits. In addition to creating the character of Sherlock Holmes, he wrote a wide variety of other works, including historical novels, science fiction stories, and non-fiction works on subjects like spiritualism and politics.\n\nConan Doyle was also an accomplished athlete and adventurer. He was a keen boxer and played on the first rugby team at the University of Edinburgh. He was also an avid traveler and once embarked on a six-month voyage as a ship's doctor to the Arctic Circle.\n\nDespite his many accomplishments, Conan Doyle is perhaps best remembered for his creation of Sherlock Holmes, which has remained a beloved and enduring figure in popular culture for over a century. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of writers and readers, and his influence on the detective genre is still felt to this day.",
