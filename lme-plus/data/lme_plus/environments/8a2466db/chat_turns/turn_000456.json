It's all about making it easy and convenient for them to participate and share their experiences.\n\nSome other ideas to consider:\n\n* Create a social media template that participants can use to share their stories. This could be a graphic with a quote, a photo, or a video, and a caption that includes the branded hashtag and a call-to-action to donate or register for the charity run.\n* Encourage participants to share photos or videos of themselves training, fundraising, or overcoming obstacles. This can help to make the challenge more engaging and interactive.\n* Consider offering incentives or rewards for participants who share their stories and reach certain fundraising milestones. This could be something like a discount on registration, a free training session, or a chance to win a prize.\n* Make sure to showcase the stories and updates from participants on the charity run's social media channels, and encourage others to do the same. This can help to create a sense of community and accountability among participants.\n* Consider partnering with influencers or cancer survivors to share their stories and help amplify the message. This can help to reach a wider audience and inspire more people to get involved.\n\nBy making it easy and accessible for participants to share their stories, you can create a powerful social media campaign that inspires and motivates others to join the cause. And by showcasing the impact of cancer research and the difference it makes in people's lives, you can help to drive fundraising efforts and make a real difference in the fight against cancer.",
