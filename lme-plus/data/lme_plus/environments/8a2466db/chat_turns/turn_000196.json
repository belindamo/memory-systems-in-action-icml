However, cases of corruption and mismanagement of resources that are supposed to benefit vulnerable people are common. All this is mainly because of the loophole in the manual systems used to monitor and ensure resources are properly utilized. \n\nWith Genius Voucher, beneficiaries receive their Allocations from authorized vendors using a smart card. These transactions are carried out using a POS machine, which issues a receipt to the beneficiaries to confirm that they have received the items or cash equivalent to what is indicated on the receipt. \n\nAll these transactions are monitored in by the project team in real-time, making the whole process transparent. Monitoring user balances in real-time also makes planning for future card top-ups much easier and more efficient. \n\nRemote management \nMost of the remote areas in Africa that NGOs target usually have no internet or slow connectivity. With Genius Voucher, the redemption process of items at the contracted vendors doesn\u2019t require an internet connection. This makes it the perfect solution, especially for remote areas in Africa that don\u2019t have internet. \n\nDuring the distribution process devices are able to sync data locally enabling on time monitoring. While NFC cards hold the beneficiary data enabling beneficiaries redeem good form deferent vendors smoothly. At the end of each round; after finishing a complete offline distribution, devices sync their data to the data base to reflecting the distribution progress.\nFriendly redemption process \n\nThe system is easy to use or user-friendly system that requires simple actions from the BNF side to redeem their voucher during the redemption process. All they have to do tap their smart card on the contracted vendor\u2019s POS terminal , choose their items and enter their pin code to finalize the transaction or validate the redemption This makes the experience of redeeming their allocations very seamless as compared to the manual process that several NGOs are still using. \n\"",
