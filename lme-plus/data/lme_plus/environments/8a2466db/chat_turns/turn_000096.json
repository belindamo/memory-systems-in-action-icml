The Creative panel and the Curves panel are two essential components of the Lumetri Color Panel, and when used together, they can help you create a cohesive look for your video. Here are some tips on how to use them together effectively:\n\n**Step 1: Establish a Base Look with the Creative Panel**\n\nThe Creative panel is a great place to start when establishing a base look for your video. This panel offers a range of presets and creative tools that can help you quickly achieve a specific aesthetic.\n\n* **Choose a Preset**: Start by selecting a preset that closely matches the look you're going for. This will give you a solid foundation to work from.\n* **Adjust the Look**: Use the Look, Color, Tone, and Vibrance controls to fine-tune the preset and create a base look that works for your video.\n\n**Step 2: Refine the Look with the Curves Panel**\n\nOnce you have a base look established, you can use the Curves panel to refine it and add more nuance to your color grade.\n\n* **Adjust the Curve**: Use the Curves panel to adjust the tone and contrast of your image. This is where you can make precise adjustments to the brightness, contrast, and color of your image.\n* **Work in Context**: Remember to work in context, adjusting the curve in conjunction with the Creative panel and other color grading tools.\n\n**Step 3: Balance the Look**\n\nAs you work between the Creative panel and the Curves panel, make sure to balance the look of your video. This means paying attention to the overall brightness, contrast, and color of your image.\n\n* **Check Your Levels**: Use the Histogram and Waveform monitors to ensure that your levels are balanced and not clipping.\n* **Reference Your Work**: Reference your work regularly to ensure that the look is cohesive and working for your video.\n\n**Step 4: Make Local Adjustments**\n\nOnce you have a balanced look, you can make local adjustments to specific areas of the image using the Lumetri Color Panel's local adjustment tools.\n\n* **Use the Color Wheels**: Use the color wheels to make targeted adjustments to specific colors in your image.\n* **Use the Gradient Filter**: Use the gradient filter to make adjustments to specific areas of the image, such as the sky or the foreground.\n\n**Step 5: Fine-Tune and Refine**\n\nFinally, fine-tune and refine your color grade by making small adjustments to the Creative panel and Curves panel.\n\n* **Make Subtle Adjustments**: Make subtle adjustments to the curve and the creative controls to refine the look and ensure it's working for your video.\n* **Check Your Work**: Check your work regularly to ensure that the look is cohesive and working for your video.\n\nBy following these steps and using the Creative panel and Curves panel together, you can create a cohesive look for your video that enhances the mood and atmosphere of your story. Remember to work in context, reference your work regularly, and make subtle adjustments to refine the look. Happy grading!",
