  "content": "The Color Wheels in the Lumetri Color Panel are a powerful tool for making targeted adjustments to the color of your footage.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how they work:\n\nThe Color Wheels are a set of three circular controls that allow you to adjust the hue, saturation, and luminance of specific colors in your footage. Each wheel represents a different color range: shadows, midtones, and highlights.\n\nTo use the Color Wheels, simply click on the color you want to adjust in the wheel, and then drag the cursor to the desired location. This will adjust the hue, saturation, and luminance of that color range.\n\nYou can use the Color Wheels to make a variety of adjustments, such as:\n\n* Warming up or cooling down the overall color tone of your footage\n* Enhancing or muting specific colors in your footage\n* Creating a consistent color look across different shots or scenes\n* Making subtle adjustments to the color of skin tones, skies, or other specific elements in your footage\n\nWhen to use the Color Wheels:\n\n* When you want to make targeted adjustments to specific colors in your footage\n* When you want to create a consistent color look across different shots or scenes\n* When you want to enhance or mute specific colors in your footage\n* When you want to make subtle adjustments to the color of skin tones, skies, or other specific elements in your footage\n\nI hope that helps!
