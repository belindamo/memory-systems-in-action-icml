  "content": "The kraft paper wrap and simple, bold font will give your soap a rustic, earthy feel that complements the cedarwood fragrance perfectly. Adding a small cedar tree or mountain range in the background will enhance the natural, outdoorsy vibe and create a visually appealing design.\n\nIt's great that you were inspired by the vendor's artwork at the community center meeting! Nature-inspired elements can add a touch of sophistication and elegance to your packaging. You could also consider incorporating other natural elements, such as a subtle leaf pattern or a simple, hand-drawn illustration of a forest landscape.\n\nRemember to keep your design simple and uncluttered, as you want the focus to be on the soap and the fragrance. A clean, minimalist design will also make your product stand out in a crowded market.\n\nIf you're not a designer yourself, you could consider hiring a freelance designer or a local artist to help you create a custom design for your label. They can work with you to incorporate your ideas and create a unique, eye-catching design that reflects your brand's personality.\n\nGood luck with your product, and I hope it does well at the Spring Fling Market!",
