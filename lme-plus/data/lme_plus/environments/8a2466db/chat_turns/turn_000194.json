With this platform, NGOs can manage and control all their distribution activities in real-time and generate periodic reports for accountability. It also eliminates the need for manually inputting data every time a set of items or cash is issued to individuals or a group of people that NGOs intend to support. \n\nGenius Voucher is an all-in-one solution that includes the hardware and software NGOs need to manage their distribution activities. The hardware side includes POS machines issued to authorized vendors, plus the smart cards the beneficiaries use to receive items or cash.
