  "content": "Yes, McDonald's does offer some healthier options. For example, they have a range of salads, grilled chicken or fish sandwiches, and snack wraps that are lower in calories and fat than their higher-calorie menu items. Options like the Egg White Delight McMuffin (250 calories) or a Fruit 'N Yogurt Parfait (150 calories) can also be good choices if you're looking for a lighter meal. However, it's important to note that even these options may still contain significant amounts of sodium and other less healthy ingredients, so it's a good idea to check the nutrition information before making your order.",
