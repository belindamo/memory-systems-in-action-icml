  "content": "Congratulations on successfully propagating your Pothos cuttings in water! Seeing tiny roots form is an exciting milestone.\n\n**When to Transplant:**\n\nWait until the roots have developed a bit more, ideally when they're around 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) long. This will give them a better chance of establishing themselves in soil. You can check the roots' progress by gently swirling the water or lifting the cutting out of the water.\n\n**Transplanting:**\n\n1. **Choose a well-draining potting mix:** Select a potting mix that's designed to prevent waterlogging, as Pothos doesn't like wet feet.\n2. **Prepare the pot:** Use a small pot (around 4-6 inches deep) with drainage holes to prevent water from collecting.\n3. **Gently remove the cutting:** Carefully lift the cutting out of the water, taking care not to disturb the roots.\n4. **Trim the roots (optional):** If the roots have become too long, you can trim them to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to encourage new growth.\n5. **Plant the cutting:** Place the cutting in the pot, gently spreading the roots outwards. Add potting mix around the roots, firming it gently as you go. Make sure the node (where the roots meet the stem) is buried in the soil.\n6. **Water thoroughly:** Water the soil well to settle the potting mix and provide enough moisture.\n\n**Post-Transplant Care:**\n\n1. **Watering:** Water your newly transplanted Pothos when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot.\n2. **Humidity:** Maintain a humid environment, especially during the first few weeks after transplanting. You can cover the pot with a clear plastic bag or a cloche to create a mini-greenhouse effect.\n3. **Lighting:** Provide bright, indirect light, but avoid direct sunlight, which can cause the soil to dry out too quickly.\n4. **Temperature:** Keep the temperature between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C), which is ideal for Pothos growth.\n5. **Fertilization:** Feed your Pothos with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) once a month. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n6. **Pruning:** Prune your Pothos regularly to maintain its desired shape and encourage new growth. Remove any leggy stems, and cut back long vines to encourage branching.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you should be able to give your newly transplanted Pothos the best chance to thrive in its new soil home. Good luck!",
