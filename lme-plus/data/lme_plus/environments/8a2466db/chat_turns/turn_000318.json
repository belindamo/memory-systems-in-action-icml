  "content": "Anvil calls their 50/50 fabric blend \"Heather CVC\", which stands for \"Heather Colors with a Vintage Look and Feel\". CVC is short for \"Chief Value Cotton\", which is a term used to describe a cotton/polyester blend that offers a good balance between affordability and quality.\n\nAnvil's Heather CVC fabric blend is made from 60% combed ringspun cotton and 40% polyester, which provides a soft, comfortable feel with good durability and resistance to shrinking. The blend is designed to create a heathered, vintage look and feel, which can be a popular choice for fashion-forward clothing such as T-shirts, hoodies, and sweatshirts.\n\nOverall, Anvil's Heather CVC fabric blend is a good choice for those looking for a high-quality, comfortable fabric with a unique look and feel, similar to American Apparel's 50/50 blend or other brands that offer cotton/polyester blends.",
