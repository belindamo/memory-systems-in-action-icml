  "content": "I've expanded my search to include surrounding areas and cities, but I couldn't find any information about a two-day festival featuring The Killers as headliners on April 17th and 18th. It's possible that the festival was held at a different location or on different dates.\n\nIf you're still unsure about the festival details, you can try checking The Killers' official website or social media pages to see if they have a tour schedule or any information about past shows around that time period. You can also try searching for music festivals in Southern California or the Western United States during April 2023 to see if anything comes up.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're planning a trip to Riverside or the surrounding areas, I'd be happy to provide some general recommendations for food and attractions. Let me know if there's anything specific you're looking for!",
