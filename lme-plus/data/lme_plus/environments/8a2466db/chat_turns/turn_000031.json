  "content": "Wait times can be a bummer, especially when you're eager to start your day.\n\nAccording to online reviews and feedback, The Breakfast Club in Riverside can get quite busy, especially on weekends and during peak breakfast hours (around 9-11 am). You can expect a wait time of around 15-30 minutes on average, but it can vary depending on the day and time of your visit.\n\nIf you're looking to avoid a long wait, I'd recommend planning your visit during off-peak hours, such as:\n\n* Early morning (before 8 am): You might be able to grab a table right away or with a short wait.\n* Late morning (after 11 am): The morning rush has subsided, and you might have a shorter wait or even get seated right away.\n\nAdditionally, you can try calling The Breakfast Club ahead of time to ask about wait times or make a reservation (if they offer it). Some diners might have a waitlist or text notification system, so it's worth asking about those options as well.\n\nIf you're short on time, you could also consider ordering take-out or grabbing a coffee and pastry to-go. That way, you can fuel up quickly and get on with your day.\n\nKeep in mind that wait times are often a sign of a popular spot, and The Breakfast Club is definitely a beloved breakfast destination in Riverside. It might be worth the wait, but it's always good to plan ahead and be prepared!",
