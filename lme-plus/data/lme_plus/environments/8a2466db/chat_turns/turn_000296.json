  "content": "Pricing is a crucial aspect of product development, and I'm glad you brought it up. I've been thinking about pricing, but I'm not entirely sure how to approach it. I want to make sure I'm pricing my scented sprays competitively, while also ensuring I'm making a decent profit margin.\n\nI've been considering factors like production costs, material costs, and the time it takes to create each product. I've also been researching the market to see what similar products are selling for. However, I'm not sure how to balance all these factors to determine the perfect price.\n\nDo you have any tips or advice on how to price scented sprays? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!\n\nAnd, as an aside, I'm really excited to start creating my scented sprays and testing them out. I've got a few different fragrance combinations in mind, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they turn out. Thanks again for all your help and guidance - it's been invaluable!",
