Since you've already experienced slow speeds, you have a solid reason to discuss your concerns with them.\n\nWhen you call your provider, be sure to:\n\n1. **State your case**: Clearly explain the slow speeds you've been experiencing, especially when working from home, and how it's affecting your productivity.\n2. **Know your current plan**: Have your current plan details handy, including your speed tier, data allowance, and pricing.\n3. **Ask about upgrades**: Inquire about upgrading to a faster plan or one that better suits your needs. Be open to exploring different options, such as fiber-optic connections if available in your area.\n4. **Negotiate**: Politely ask if they can offer any discounts, promotions, or loyalty rewards to retain your business. Be willing to walk away if you don't get a satisfactory response.\n5. **Take notes**: Record the date, time, and details of your conversation, including any agreements or promises made by the representative.\n\nRemember to stay calm, patient, and firm during the conversation. You're advocating for better service and a fair deal, so don't be afraid to ask questions or seek a supervisor if needed.\n\nAfter negotiating with your current provider, you can compare their offer to other options you've researched. This will give you a better understanding of the market and help you make an informed decision about whether to stay with your current provider or switch to a new one.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress, and feel free to ask if you have any more questions or need further guidance!",
