  "content": "It is generally best to use live video for training when the subject matter is best demonstrated through real-world examples or when the training requires a high level of realism. For example, live video would be more appropriate for training in fields such as medicine, cooking, or construction where hands-on, real-world examples are necessary for understanding. On the other hand, animation may be more appropriate for training in fields such as software development or abstract concepts where it is more important to clearly convey information rather than realism.",
