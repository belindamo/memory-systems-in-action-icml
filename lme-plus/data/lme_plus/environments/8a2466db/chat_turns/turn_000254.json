  "content": "I'll try to address the lethargy issue with my neon tetras by performing a water change and monitoring the water parameters more closely. I'll also consider adding more plants to my tank, as they can help with water quality and provide more hiding places for my fish. Speaking of plants, I've been having some issues with my live plants, and I'd love to learn more about different plant species and their specific care requirements. Can you recommend some good online resources or books on aquarium plant care?",
