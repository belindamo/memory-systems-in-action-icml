  "content": "Anvil 980 is a style of T-shirt made by the clothing brand Anvil. It is a classic, basic crew neck T-shirt that is popular for its comfort, durability, and affordability. The Anvil 980 is made from 100% combed ringspun cotton, which is a high-quality cotton that is combed to remove impurities and create a smooth, uniform texture.\n\nThe Anvil 980 has a tubular construction, which means that there are no side seams in the shirt. This can provide a more comfortable, seamless fit that reduces irritation and chafing.\n\nThe Anvil 980 is also preshrunk, which means that it has been treated to reduce the amount of shrinkage that may occur in the wash. This can help ensure a consistent fit and prevent the shirt from becoming too small after laundering.\n\nOverall, the Anvil 980 is a popular choice for those looking for a comfortable, affordable, and high-quality basic T-shirt. It is available in a variety of colors and sizes, and can be a good choice for screen printing or customization.",
