  "content": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has living relatives who are direct descendants of his family. While they do not own the copyright to the Sherlock Holmes stories or any of Conan Doyle's other works, they do hold the intellectual property rights to his personal papers and other memorabilia.\n\nIn addition to his literary legacy, Conan Doyle also left behind a significant body of personal and professional correspondence, as well as other materials such as photographs, manuscripts, and other documents. These materials are held by his descendants and are an important resource for scholars and researchers studying Conan Doyle's life and work.\n\nWhile his descendants may not directly benefit from the financial proceeds of Conan Doyle's works, they do play an important role in preserving and promoting his legacy. They have been involved in various efforts to commemorate Conan Doyle's life and work, including the creation of a statue of Sherlock Holmes in Edinburgh, Scotland, where Conan Doyle was born and raised.\n\nOverall, while Conan Doyle's descendants may not be directly involved in the commercial exploitation of his works, they continue to play an important role in preserving and promoting his legacy, and their involvement in these efforts serves as a testament to the enduring appeal and influence of Conan Doyle's work.",
