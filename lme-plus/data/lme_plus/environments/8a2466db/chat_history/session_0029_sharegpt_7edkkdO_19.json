      "content": "In American Apparel, the percentage of cotton and polyester in their poly-cotton fabric can vary depending on the specific product. However, their most common poly-cotton blend is 50% polyester and 50% combed cotton, which is often referred to as \"50/50\" fabric.\n\nAmerican Apparel is known for their high-quality materials and manufacturing processes, and their 50/50 fabric blend is a popular choice for customers who want comfortable, long-lasting clothing with a balance of natural and synthetic fibers. However, they also offer other poly-cotton blends with different percentages of cotton and polyester, such as 65% polyester and 35% cotton, depending on the specific product and style.\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing a specific American Apparel product and want to know the exact percentage of cotton and polyester in the fabric, I would recommend checking the product description or contacting their customer service team for more information."
