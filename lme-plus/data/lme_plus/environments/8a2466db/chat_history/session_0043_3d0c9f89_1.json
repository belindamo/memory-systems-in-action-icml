Congratulations on being part of a great cause.\n\nOf course, I'd be happy to recommend some beginner-friendly yoga poses for you to practice at home. Here are some gentle and accessible poses to get you started:\n\n**Foundational Poses:**\n\n1. **Mountain Pose (Tadasana)**: Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, arms by your sides, and engage your core. This is a foundational standing pose that helps establish good posture.\n2. **Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)**: Start on all fours, then lift your hips up and back, straightening your arms and legs. Keep your palms and heels grounded. This pose stretches the hamstrings, calves, and spine.\n\n**Flexibility and Stretching Poses:**\n\n1. **Seated Forward Fold (Paschimottanasana)**: Sit with your legs extended in front of you. Inhale, lengthen your spine. Exhale, fold forward, reaching for your toes or shins. This pose stretches the hamstrings, calves, and back.\n2. **Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)**: Lie on your stomach with your hands under your shoulders. Inhale, press your palms into the ground, and lift your chest and head off the mat. This pose strengthens the back muscles and opens the chest.\n3. **Seated Twist (Bharadvajasana)**: Sit with your legs crossed. Twist your torso to one side, keeping your hips facing forward. Hold, then repeat on the other side. This pose helps with spinal flexibility and can aid digestion.\n\n**Strength and Balance Poses:**\n\n1. **Tree Pose (Vrksasana)**: Stand on one leg, with the other foot resting against your inner thigh. Engage your core, lift your arms, and gaze forward. This pose improves balance and stability.\n2. **Plank Pose (Phalakasana)**: Start in a high push-up position, with your hands shoulder-width apart. Engage your core, straighten your arms, and keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. This pose strengthens the arms, shoulders, and core.\n\n**Final Relaxation Pose:**\n\n1. **Savasana (Corpse Pose)**: Lie on your back with your arms and legs relaxed. Close your eyes, breathe deeply, and focus on releasing tension in your body. This pose helps with relaxation and reduces stress.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Listen to your body and modify or come out of the pose if you experience any discomfort or pain.\n* Breathe deeply and naturally, without forcing your breath.\n* Practice regularly to build strength, flexibility, and confidence in your yoga practice.\n\nEnjoy your home practice, and congratulations again on supporting a great cause!"

How about we create a social media challenge that encourages participants to share their own stories of why they're running for cancer research? We could use a branded hashtag and have participants share photos or videos of themselves training, fundraising, or overcoming obstacles.
