    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, we would prefer our influencers to be based in the US for this specific campaign. This decision is based on the following reasons:\n\n1. Target Market: Our primary target market for this campaign is the US audience, and having US-based influencers will allow us to better connect and engage with potential customers within that demographic.\n2. Shipping and Logistics: By working with influencers based in the US, we can ensure timely delivery of our products for gifting and promotional purposes, reducing any potential delays and additional costs associated with international shipping.\n3. Cultural Relevance: US-based influencers are more likely to understand and resonate with the cultural nuances and preferences of our target audience, enabling them to create content that is more relatable and effective.\n4. Localized Promotions: Offering localized promotions, such as promo codes and affiliate programs, is more manageable and cost-effective when working with influencers based in the same country.\n\nWhile we prioritize US-based influencers for this campaign, we are open to exploring international influencer partnerships in the future as we expand our brand presence globally."
