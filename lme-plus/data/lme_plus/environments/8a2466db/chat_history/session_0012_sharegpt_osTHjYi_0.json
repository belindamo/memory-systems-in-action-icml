      "content": "It is generally best to use live video for training when the subject matter is best demonstrated through real-world examples or when the training requires a high level of realism. For example, live video would be more appropriate for training in fields such as medicine, cooking, or construction where hands-on, real-world examples are necessary for understanding. On the other hand, animation may be more appropriate for training in fields such as software development or abstract concepts where it is more important to clearly convey information rather than realism."

      "content": "It is generally best to use animation over live video for training when the subject matter is best demonstrated through visual aids and when the training requires a high level of control over the visual representation. For example, animation would be more appropriate for training in fields such as software development, science and math, where it is necessary to clearly demonstrate technical concepts, or when you need to show simulations that would be difficult or impossible to demonstrate with live video, such as a complex mechanical or chemical processes. Additionally, animation allows for greater control over the pacing and presentation of the material, making it easier to explain complex concepts in a step-by-step manner."
