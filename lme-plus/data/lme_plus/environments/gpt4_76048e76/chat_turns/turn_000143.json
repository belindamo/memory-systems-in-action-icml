I also recently borrowed my friend's pulse oximeter to check my oxygen saturation levels when I had a cold last week, and it was nice to have that data on hand. Do you think any of the scales you mentioned can integrate with my Fitbit data, or would I need to use a separate app to track my weight and body fat percentage?",
