Here are some tips to help you freeze and reheat your banana pancakes:\n\n**Freezing Banana Pancakes:**\n\n1. **Cool completely:** Let the pancakes cool completely on a wire rack to prevent moisture from building up and making them soggy.\n2. **Place on a baking sheet:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Place the cooled pancakes on the sheet in a single layer, making sure they don't touch each other.\n3. **Freeze until solid:** Put the baking sheet in the freezer and let the pancakes freeze for about 1-2 hours, or until they're solid and frozen.\n4. **Transfer to airtight container:** Once frozen, transfer the pancakes to an airtight container or freezer bag. You can store them in the freezer for up to 3 months.\n\n**Reheating Frozen Banana Pancakes:**\n\n1. **Toaster or toaster oven:** Place the frozen pancakes in a toaster or toaster oven at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for 2-3 minutes, or until warmed through.\n2. **Microwave:** Wrap a frozen pancake in a damp paper towel and microwave for 20-30 seconds, or until warmed through.
