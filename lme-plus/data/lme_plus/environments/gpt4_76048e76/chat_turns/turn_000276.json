  "content": "I'm looking for some ideas on meal prep for the week. I've been trying to cook more at home, and I want to make sure I'm using up all the ingredients I buy. By the way, I just tried out a recipe for Korean bibimbap from the cooking class's online recipe library, and it was amazing. Do you have any suggestions for meal prep containers that can keep my food fresh for a few days?",
