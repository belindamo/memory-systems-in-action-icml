But, let's focus on the crispy chicken parmesan.\n\nTo achieve crispy chicken parmesan, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Panko breadcrumbs**: Use Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs. Panko breadcrumbs are lighter and crisper, which helps create a crunchier exterior.\n2. **Double-dredge**: Double-dredge your chicken in flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs to create a thick, even coating. This will help the breading adhere to the chicken and create a crunchy exterior.\n3. **Dry the chicken**: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels before dredging it in flour. This helps remove excess moisture, which can prevent the breading from becoming soggy.\n4. **Use the right cheese**: Use a high-quality, dry mozzarella cheese that melts well. Fresh mozzarella can be too wet and prevent the breading from becoming crispy.\n5. **Don't over-bread**: Be gentle when coating the chicken with breadcrumbs. Too much pressure can cause the breadcrumbs to clump and become dense, leading to a soft exterior.\n6. **Fry at the right temperature**: Fry the chicken at the right temperature (around 350\u00b0F/175\u00b0C) to achieve a crispy exterior. If the oil is too hot, the outside will burn before the inside is cooked; if it's too cold, the breading will absorb excess oil and become soggy.\n7. **Don't overcrowd**: Fry the chicken in batches to prevent overcrowding. This ensures each piece cooks evenly and gets a chance to develop a crispy exterior.\n8. **Drain excess oil**: After frying, place the chicken on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. This helps prevent the breading from becoming soggy.\n9. **Broil for extra crispiness**: If you want an extra-crispy exterior, broil the chicken for 1-2 minutes after frying. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning.\n10. **Experiment with different breading mixtures**: Try adding different seasonings, herbs, or spices to your breadcrumb mixture to create a unique flavor and texture.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a crispy and delicious chicken parmesan!",
