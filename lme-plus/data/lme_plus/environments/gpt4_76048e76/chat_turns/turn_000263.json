Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the wax finish.\n\n**Cleaning the Wax Finish:**\n\n1. **Use a gentle cleaner**: For more thorough cleaning, use a gentle cleaner specifically designed for wax finishes. You can also mix a small amount of mild soap, such as diluted dish soap, with warm water.\n2. **Test a small area first**: Before cleaning the entire armchair, test the cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area to ensure it won't damage the finish.\n3. **Use a soft, clean cloth**: Dip a soft, clean cloth into the cleaning solution, wring it out thoroughly, and gently wipe down the armchair. Avoid using too much water, as it can damage the wood or wax finish.\n4. **Dry the area**: Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe away any excess moisture and prevent water spots.\n\n**Avoid Using:**\n\n1. **Harsh chemicals**: Never use harsh chemicals, such as polish, wax removers, or strong cleaners, as they can damage the wax finish or strip it away.\n2. **Abrasive materials**: Avoid using abrasive materials, like steel wool or scouring pads, as they can scratch the finish or damage the wood.\n3. **Excessive water**: Don't use too much water, as it can damage the wood or cause the wax finish to become sticky or soft.\n\n**Reapplying Wax:**\n\n1. **Reapply wax as needed**: Depending on the amount of use and exposure to the elements, you may need to reapply wax to your armchair every 6-12 months.\n2. **Follow the manufacturer's instructions**: Use the same type of wax and follow the manufacturer's instructions for reapplication.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Avoid direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause the wax finish to fade or become brittle.
