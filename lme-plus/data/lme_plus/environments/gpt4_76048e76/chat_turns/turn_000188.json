  "content": "The immune system is the body's defense against infectious diseases. When a foreign substance, such as a virus or bacteria, enters the body, the immune system recognizes it as a threat and responds by generating an immune response.\n\nThere are two types of immunity: innate and adaptive. Innate immunity is the first line of defense and involves physical barriers, such as the skin, that prevent pathogens from entering the body. Adaptive immunity is a more advanced response that specifically targets the pathogen.\n\nThe adaptive immune system creates antibodies that recognize and bind to the pathogen, marking it for destruction by immune cells. Immune cells can also directly attack infected cells in the body.\n\nScientists use several strategies to develop effective vaccines. The most common approach involves exposing the body to a small and safe amount of the pathogen to trigger an immune response. This exposure can be achieved through live attenuated vaccines, which use a weakened form of the pathogen, or inactivated vaccines, which use a dead version of the pathogen.\n\nOther vaccine strategies include using a protein subunit of the pathogen, which triggers an immune response without infecting the individual, or using a viral vector vaccine, which uses a harmless virus to deliver DNA that creates the protein subunit.\n\nUltimately, the goal of vaccines is to stimulate the immune system to prevent future infections by the pathogen. Effective vaccination programs can limit the spread of infectious diseases and protect individuals who might be particularly vulnerable to the disease.",
