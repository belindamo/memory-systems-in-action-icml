I'm excited to try out these recipes and experiment with different combinations of smoky ingredients. By the way, I served up a variety of grilled meats and veggies at my last backyard barbecue, including burgers, hot dogs, chicken breasts, and skewers of bell peppers and onions. I'm looking forward to trying out these new BBQ sauce recipes on my next batch of grilled goodies!",
