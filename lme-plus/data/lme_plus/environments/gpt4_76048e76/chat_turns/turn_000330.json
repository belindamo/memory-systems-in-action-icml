  "content": "While the bands I listed are all from San Francisco and have a similar indie rock sound to The Killers, it's difficult to say for certain whether any of them were the specific opening act you're thinking of.\n\nIf you don't recognize any of the bands I listed, it's possible that the opening act was a lesser-known or up-and-coming band. The Killers often choose opening acts that are local to the area and have a similar sound or style to their own music.\n\nI would recommend continuing to search online and see if you can find any information about the opening act from that specific concert. You might try searching for:\n\n* \"The Killers concert Golden Gate Park June 15th 2023 opening act\"\n* \"Who opened for The Killers at Golden Gate Park on June 15th 2023?\"\n* \"The Killers tour 2023 opening acts\"\n\nYou might also try checking out The Killers' social media accounts or website to see if they mentioned the opening act or posted any photos or videos from the concert.\n\nAdditionally, you could try reaching out to local music bloggers or writers who cover the San Francisco music scene and ask if they know anything about the opening act.\n\nDon't give up! With a little persistence, you might be able to track down the information you're looking for.",
