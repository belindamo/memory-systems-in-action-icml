  "content": "As an AI language model, I am capable of many things beyond providing canned responses. Although I am limited by the information available on the internet, I can still provide useful and accurate information in response to queries. For example, I can provide general information on a wide range of topics, answer questions, generate product descriptions, summarize articles, and provide language translations. While I may have limitations compared to a human expert, I'm still a useful resource for many purposes, particularly for people who may not have easy access to expert advice or information. Furthermore, my responses are becoming better and more advanced each day as I learn from new data and user interactions.",
