  "content": "New bike rack, eh? I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations!\n\nBefore we dive into that, sorry to hear about the issues with your bike. Gear problems can be frustrating, especially when you're in the middle of a ride. Did the repair shop identify the cause of the problem? Was it a worn-out component, misalignment, or something else?\n\nNow, about that bike rack... There are many great options out there, but it depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here are a few questions to help narrow down some recommendations:\n\n1. What type of bike do you have (road, mountain, hybrid, electric)?\n2. How many bikes do you want to carry?\n3. What's your car's make and model?\n4. Do you prefer a roof-mounted, hitch-mounted, or trunk-mounted rack?\n5. Are you looking for a budget-friendly option or are you willing to invest in a high-end rack?\n6. Do you need any additional features, such as tilt functionality or integrated locks?\n\nSome popular bike rack brands include Thule, Yakima, Saris, and Kuat. I can give you more specific recommendations based on your answers to these questions.\n\nLet me know, and we can get started on finding the perfect bike rack for you!",
