Discussing the project scope and roles with your friends is a great first step, and brainstorming and deciding on materials and supplies will help you all get on the same page. Testing out techniques and materials beforehand is also a great idea, as it will help you avoid any potential issues and ensure that you're all comfortable with the materials and techniques you'll be using.\n\nRemember to also have fun and be open to new ideas and suggestions from your friends. Collaborative projects are a great way to learn from each other and grow as artists, so don't be afraid to try new things and take risks.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your project, and I hope it turns out amazing!",
