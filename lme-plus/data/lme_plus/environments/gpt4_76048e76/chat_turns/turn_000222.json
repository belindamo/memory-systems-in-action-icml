  "content": "Hitch-mounted racks are super convenient and easy to use.\n\nBoth the Saris Bones and Kuat Transfer are high-quality hitch-mounted racks, and their installation processes are relatively straightforward. I'll break it down for you:\n\n**Saris Bones Installation:**\n\n1. **Hitch receiver:** First, you'll need to ensure your Toyota Corolla has a hitch receiver installed. If you don't have one, you can purchase a Class I hitch receiver (1.25\" or 2\" receiver) specifically designed for your vehicle. Saris recommends a Class I receiver for the Bones rack.\n2. **Rack assembly:** The Bones rack comes partially assembled. You'll need to attach the arms and the tray to the hitch adapter. This requires a few bolts and screws, which are provided. You'll need a wrench or socket to tighten the bolts.\n3. **Hitch adapter installation:** Attach the hitch adapter to your hitch receiver. This usually involves inserting the adapter into the receiver and tightening the bolt or pin.\n4. **Rack installation:** Place the assembled rack onto the hitch adapter and secure it with the provided bolts or pins.\n5. **Tighten and adjust:** Tighten all bolts and screws, then adjust the rack to fit your bike.\n\n**Kuat Transfer Installation:**\n\n1. **Hitch receiver:** Like the Saris Bones, you'll need a hitch receiver on your Corolla. The Kuat Transfer is compatible with both 1.25\" and 2\" receivers.\n2. **Rack assembly:** The Transfer rack comes mostly assembled. You'll need to attach the arms and the tray to the hitch adapter, similar to the Saris Bones.\n3. **Hitch adapter installation:** Kuat's hitch adapter is a bit more complex, with a few more pieces to assemble. However, the instructions are clear, and it's still a relatively easy process.\n4. **Rack installation:** Place the assembled rack onto the hitch adapter and secure it with the provided bolts or pins.\n5. **Tighten and adjust:** Tighten all bolts and screws, then adjust the rack to fit your bike.\n\nBoth installations are considered \"no-drill\" installations, meaning you won't need to drill any holes in your vehicle. The process typically takes around 30-60 minutes, depending on your comfort level with tools.\n\nIf you're not comfortable with tools or feel unsure about the installation, you can:\n\n* Consult the user manuals and online resources provided by Saris and Kuat.\n* Watch installation videos on YouTube or the manufacturers' websites.\n* Visit a local bike shop or outdoor gear store for assistance or installation.\n* Consider hiring a professional to install the rack for you.\n\nKeep in mind that both racks come with excellent customer support, and the manufacturers are available to answer any questions you may have during the installation process.\n\nHow do you feel about the installation process? Is there anything else you'd like to know before making a decision?",
