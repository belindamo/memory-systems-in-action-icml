However, I can provide information on how the anime has changed the demographics of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise based on research and analysis.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon anime has played a significant role in expanding the audience of the franchise. In the early days, the demographic for the franchise was primarily children and young adults. However, over the years, the anime has attracted a much broader demographic.\n\nOne way in which the anime has done this is by making the show more inclusive for girls and women. The early seasons of the anime primarily focused on Ash's journey as a male protagonist and his male companions. However, in later seasons, more female characters were introduced, and they played a more prominent role in the show.\n\nAdditionally, the anime has also introduced more complex storylines and characters that appeal to older audiences. For example, the movie \"Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie\" dealt with themes of mortality, which resonated with older viewers.\n\nFurthermore, the anime has also introduced new regions and Pok\u00e9mon, which has helped to keep the franchise fresh and exciting for long-time fans. This has also helped to attract new fans who may not have been interested in the franchise before.\n\nOverall, the anime has helped to expand the demographics of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise by making the show more inclusive, introducing complex storylines, characters, and new regions and Pok\u00e9mon.",
