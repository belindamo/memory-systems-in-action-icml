  "content": "**Substituting sugar with honey or maple syrup:**\n\nYou can substitute granulated sugar with honey or maple syrup, but keep in mind that it will affect the flavor and texture of the pancakes. Here's what you need to know:\n\n* **Honey:** Honey is sweeter than sugar, so use 1/2 to 2/3 cup of honey for every 1 cup of sugar called for in the recipe. Honey also contains more moisture, which can make the pancakes more dense and tender. Reduce the amount of milk by 1-2 tablespoons to compensate.\n* **Maple syrup:** Maple syrup is also sweeter than sugar, so use 1/2 to 2/3 cup of maple syrup for every 1 cup of sugar. Maple syrup has a stronger flavor than honey, so start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste. Like honey, maple syrup adds moisture, so reduce the milk by 1-2 tablespoons.\n\nWhen substituting sugar with honey or maple syrup, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the pancakes for a shorter time, as they can burn more easily.\n\n**Storing leftover pancakes:**\n\nTo store leftover pancakes, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Cool completely:** Let the pancakes cool completely on a wire rack to prevent moisture from building up.\n2. **Air-tight container:** Store the cooled pancakes in an air-tight container, such as a zip-top plastic bag, a glass container with a lid, or a stasher bag.\n3. **Room temperature:** Store the pancakes at room temperature for up to 2 days.\n4. **Refrigerate:** Refrigerate the pancakes for up to 5 days. Place a piece of parchment paper or wax paper between each pancake to prevent sticking.\n5. **Freeze:** Freeze the pancakes for up to 2 months. Place the pancakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container.\n\nTo reheat leftover pancakes:\n\n* Microwave: Wrap a pancake in a damp paper towel and microwave for 20-30 seconds.\n* Toaster or toaster oven: Toast or heat the pancakes in a toaster or toaster oven at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for 2-3 minutes.\n* Pan: Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and cook the pancakes for about 30 seconds on each side, until warmed through.\n\nEnjoy your delicious banana pancakes, and I hope you find the perfect way to store and reheat them!",
