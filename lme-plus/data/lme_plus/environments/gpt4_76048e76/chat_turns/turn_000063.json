  "content": "Yes, I think the trend towards inclusive language will continue to grow and become more mainstream in the French language. The use of gender-neutral terminology is becoming more widely recognized as an important step towards achieving gender equality, and many people are becoming more conscious of the need to use language in a way that doesn't exclude or marginalize certain groups of people. As a result, there is likely to be ongoing progress towards the development of more gender-inclusive forms of French, whether through the use of neologisms or the adaptation of existing language structures.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that linguistic changes can take time to become fully established in society, and there may be resistance to these changes from some quarters. Nonetheless, the increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of inclusive language is likely to continue driving progress towards a more equitable and inclusive use of the French language.",
