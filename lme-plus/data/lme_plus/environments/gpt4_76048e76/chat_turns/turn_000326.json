  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I have to correct you - there is no indie band called \"The Neons\" that is a well-known opening act for The Killers. It's possible that the opening act you're thinking of is actually a different band.\n\nThat being said, if you enjoyed the music of the opening act, I can try to help you find similar indie bands based on The Killers' genre and style. The Killers are known for their indie rock, new wave, and post-punk revival sound, so here are some recommendations for indie bands that might fit the bill:\n\n1. The Strokes - A classic indie rock band with a similar garage-rock sound to The Killers.\n2. Arctic Monkeys - A British indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks and guitar-driven melodies.\n3. The Black Keys - A blues-rock duo with a gritty, high-energy sound that might appeal to fans of The Killers' more upbeat tracks.\n4. Two Door Cinema Club - An Irish indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, synth-heavy soundscapes, and danceable beats.\n5. Walk the Moon - An American indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, synth-pop elements, and energetic live performances.\n6. The 1975 - A British indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, synth-heavy soundscapes, and introspective lyrics.\n7. Pale Waves - A British indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, synth-heavy soundscapes, and gothic-inspired aesthetics.\n8. The Vaccines - A British indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, garage-rock energy, and witty lyrics.\n\nIf none of these recommendations resonate with you, please let me know more about the opening act you saw at the concert - what did they sound like? Were they more synth-heavy or guitar-driven? Did they have a male or female lead vocalist? Any details you can provide might help me give you more tailored recommendations!",
