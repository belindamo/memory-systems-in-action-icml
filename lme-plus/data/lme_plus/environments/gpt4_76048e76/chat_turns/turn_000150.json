  "content": "That's great to hear! Pulse oximeters can be really useful for tracking oxygen saturation levels, especially when you're not feeling well. It's wonderful that you were able to borrow one from your friend and get a sense of your oxygen levels during your cold.\n\n**Pulse Oximetry and Health Tracking:**\n\nPulse oximetry is an important aspect of health tracking, especially for people with certain medical conditions or those who engage in high-intensity exercise. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels can help identify potential issues early on and provide valuable insights into your overall health.\n\n**Fitbit and Pulse Oximetry:**\n\nWhile the Fitbit Aria Air doesn't have built-in pulse oximetry features, some Fitbit wearables, like the Fitbit Ionic or Fitbit Venu, do offer pulse oximetry tracking. If you're interested in tracking your oxygen saturation levels regularly, you might consider upgrading to one of these wearables in the future.\n\n**Separate Pulse Oximeter Device:**\n\nIf you don't plan on upgrading to a Fitbit wearable with pulse oximetry, you can always consider purchasing a separate pulse oximeter device. There are many affordable options available, and they can be a useful addition to your health tracking toolkit.\n\nRemember to always consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your oxygen saturation levels or any other aspect of your health.\n\nI'm glad I could help, and I hope you enjoy your new Fitbit Aria Air! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask.",
