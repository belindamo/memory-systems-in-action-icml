Here are some points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Oil changes**: The Corolla Hybrid requires synthetic oil changes, which can cost around $75-$100 per change, depending on the dealership or service center. Toyota recommends oil changes every 5,000 to 7,500 miles.\n2. **Tire rotation**: Regular tire rotation is essential for even wear and tear. You can expect to pay around $20-$30 per rotation, and it's recommended every 5,000 to 8,000 miles.\n3. **Battery maintenance**: The Corolla Hybrid's battery is designed to last the life of the vehicle, but it's still important to keep the terminals clean and secure. You can expect to pay around $20-$50 for a battery maintenance check.\n4. **Hybrid system maintenance**: The Corolla Hybrid's hybrid system is designed to be self-sustaining, but it's still important to follow the recommended maintenance schedule. Toyota recommends replacing the hybrid battery coolant every 30,000 miles, which can cost around $100-$150.\n5. ** Brake pads**: The Corolla Hybrid's brake pads are designed to last longer than those in traditional gas-powered vehicles. You can expect to replace them every 30,000 to 50,000 miles, with costs ranging from $200-$300 per axle.\n\nIt's great that you've been taking care of your current Corolla, and it's even more impressive that you've been doing some maintenance tasks yourself! However, it's always a good idea to have a professional inspect your vehicle regularly to catch any potential issues before they become major problems.\n\nAs for your current Corolla's \"check engine\" light, it's great that you're getting it checked out. The dealership will be able to diagnose the issue and provide a quote for any necessary repairs.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the maintenance costs or would you like to know more about the Corolla Hybrid's features and technologies?",
