      "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the ranking based on the approval rating of the past presidents of Korea is as follows:\n\n1. Kim Young-sam (1993-1998): Kim had an approval rating of 90% during his term, largely due to his efforts to promote democracy and fight corruption.\n2. Roh Moo-hyun (2003-2008): Roh had an approval rating of 70-80% during his term, thanks to his progressive policies and efforts to improve relations with North Korea.\n3. Lee Myung-bak (2008-2013): Lee had an approval rating of around 50% during his term, with his popularity declining towards the end of his presidency due to a number of controversies and scandals.\n4. Kim Dae-jung (1998-2003): Kim had an approval rating of around 30% during his term, but his reputation improved significantly after he left office due to his efforts to promote democracy and human rights in South Korea.\n5. Park Geun-hye (2013-2017): Park had an approval rating of around 30% during her term, but her popularity plummeted after a corruption scandal led to her impeachment and removal from office.\n\nThe approval rating standard is typically based on public opinion polls conducted by various research institutes and media outlets in South Korea. The polls typically ask respondents to rate the performance of the President on a scale from 1 to 10 or to indicate whether they approve or disapprove of the President's job performance. The results of these polls are then used to calculate the President's approval rating, which is often used as a measure of public support for the President and their policies."
