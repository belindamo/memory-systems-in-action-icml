      "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot provide individualized advice, but generally speaking, incorporating bodyweight exercises into your weightlifting routine is unlikely to lead to a significant loss in muscle mass or strength gains, as long as you properly manage your rest and recovery. Bodyweight exercises can help improve muscular endurance, increase range of motion, and improve overall control and stability, which can ultimately enhance your weightlifting performance. However, it's essential to ensure that you're also providing your muscles with the appropriate stimulus and recovery time needed for growth and strength gains specific to your targeted muscle groups."
