      "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I have to correct you - there is no indie band called \"The Neons\" that is a well-known opening act for The Killers. It's possible that the opening act you're thinking of is actually a different band.\n\nThat being said, if you enjoyed the music of the opening act, I can try to help you find similar indie bands based on The Killers' genre and style. The Killers are known for their indie rock, new wave, and post-punk revival sound, so here are some recommendations for indie bands that might fit the bill:\n\n1. The Strokes - A classic indie rock band with a similar garage-rock sound to The Killers.\n2. Arctic Monkeys - A British indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks and guitar-driven melodies.\n3. The Black Keys - A blues-rock duo with a gritty, high-energy sound that might appeal to fans of The Killers' more upbeat tracks.\n4. Two Door Cinema Club - An Irish indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, synth-heavy soundscapes, and danceable beats.\n5. Walk the Moon - An American indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, synth-pop elements, and energetic live performances.\n6. The 1975 - A British indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, synth-heavy soundscapes, and introspective lyrics.\n7. Pale Waves - A British indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, synth-heavy soundscapes, and gothic-inspired aesthetics.\n8. The Vaccines - A British indie rock band with a similar blend of catchy hooks, garage-rock energy, and witty lyrics.\n\nIf none of these recommendations resonate with you, please let me know more about the opening act you saw at the concert - what did they sound like? Were they more synth-heavy or guitar-driven? Did they have a male or female lead vocalist? Any details you can provide might help me give you more tailored recommendations!"

Asking about their process for selecting opening acts could give you some valuable insight into how they choose their openers, and it might even give you a lead on who the opener might have been.\n\nYou could ask something like:\n\n\"I'm also curious about how you guys select your opening acts for tours. Do you have a specific process for finding new talent, or do you typically work with established acts? Are there any particular qualities or characteristics you look for in an opening act?\"\n\nBy asking about their process, you might get some insight into what kind of acts they tend to choose, which could help you narrow down your search. For example, they might say something like:\n\n\"We typically look for local acts that have a similar sound or style to ours, and we try to choose acts that will appeal to our fanbase.\"\n\nOr:\n\n\"We like to mix it up and choose openers from different genres or styles to keep the show interesting.\"\n\nThis kind of information could give you a better idea of what kind of act might have been opening for them, and you could use that to inform your search.\n\nAdditionally, you could also ask if they have any recommendations for up-and-coming bands or artists that they think are worth checking out.
