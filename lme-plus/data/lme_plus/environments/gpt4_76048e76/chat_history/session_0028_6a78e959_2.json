It's amazing how much of a difference making small changes to our diets can make.\n\nLimiting dairy products can be challenging, especially if you're used to consuming them regularly.

I've been wanting to try out some new cuisines, like Korean or Indian food, and I've heard great things about cooking with an Instant Pot. I've never used one before, but I've been tempted to give it a try. I've also been wanting to try out some new spices and seasonings to add more flavor to my dishes.\n\nAs for my garden, I'm planning to start with some herbs like basil, rosemary, and thyme, and then move on to some vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots. I've always loved cooking with fresh herbs, and I think it'll be great to be able to just step outside and pick what I need.\n\nI'm also thinking about trying out some companion planting, where you plant different vegetables and herbs together to help each other grow. I've heard it can be a great way to create a more sustainable and thriving garden.\n\nDo you have"

And don't be afraid to ask for advice or guidance at your local nursery or gardening store - they can offer valuable tips and insights to help you get started.\n\nWhat do you think is the most exciting part of starting your garden?
