      "content": "Before we continue to refine the story outline. Lets consider the following: As part of the story\u2019s development, I'd like for us to consider a plot twist in which Lana is actually Jessica after she had mutated into Lana through the use of the SCAM technology. With this in mind, let\u2019s consider the following:\n1. Early in the story, we establish Lana as a character and create a bond between her and Alex. We also establish that Alex's wife, Jessica, has gone missing and was last seen working at AzurSoft on military applications of the SCAM technology.\n2. As the story progresses, Alex becomes more and more entangled in the dangerous world of Zona Norte and begins to uncover more information about the SCAM technology and its potential uses.\n3. In a climactic scene towards the end of the second act, Alex discovers that Lana is actually Jessica, who has been using the SCAM technology to hide her true identity and avoid detection by those who are after her. The people that could be after her could be People coule that are after her could be PAKAL PALEN. He is interested in obtaining the SCAM technology that she helped develop while working at the AzurSoft corporation. The transnational gangs deal in grey market and inferior version of the SCAM technology coule be after her in order to imrove on the grey market version of the technology. Gustavo coule be after her in order to obtain the SCAM technology as well. \n4. This revelation could create a rift between Alex and Jessica/Lana, as Alex struggles to come to terms with the fact that his wife has been living a secret life in Zona Norte.\n5. The twist could also raise questions about the nature of identity and the use of technology to change one's appearance and behavior. It could also add another layer of tension to the already complex power struggles in Zona Norte.\n\nSome additional things that we should consider with regards to the story's theme are:\na) What does the truth provide? \nb) Is there a price for knowing too much? \nc) Is there such a thing as too much truth? If so, where is the limit? \nd) Is there a price to be paid for having too much freedom with no laws or contracts to constrain human behavior and the ability to do whatever one wants? \ne) Who should be responsible to controlling behavior: Government? Private interests with their own agendas? Powerful corporations? Religious institutions? If so, what should be the scope of control or influence. \nf) What if a broken contract allows one to live forever, what is the cost of living forever? Do we place less value on time, since it is no longer a scarce commodity? This implies no urgency to solve problems because we can always put things off, ect?\n\nLet's also consider the following ideas to inform the development of the story outline: \n1.Godel's incompleteness theorem \n2.Heisenberg's uncertainty principle \n3.The second law of thermodynamics\n\nIt's also important that the Zona Norte story end in irony.\n\nWith this additional information, update and refine the story outline."
