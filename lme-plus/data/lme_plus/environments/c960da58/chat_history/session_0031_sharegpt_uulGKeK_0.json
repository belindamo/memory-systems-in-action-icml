Bar chart of Top 10 movies by income: This chart would display the top 10 movies by their income in descending order, using a bar chart. It would be useful to understand which movies generated the most revenue, which is a key performance indicator for the success of a movie.\n\nColumns: Title, Income\nVisualization Type: Bar chart\n\n2. Stacked column chart of movie genre by year: This chart would display the distribution of movie genres by year using a stacked column chart. This visualization would be helpful in understanding the popularity of different genres over time.\n\nColumns: Year, Genre\nVisualization Type: Stacked column chart\n\n3. Scatter plot of runtime vs. rating: This chart would display the relationship between the runtime of movies and their ratings using a scatter plot. It would be useful in understanding whether there is a correlation between the two variables.\n\nColumns: Runtime, Rating\nVisualization Type: Scatter plot\n\n4. Pie chart of certificate distribution: This chart would display the distribution of movie certificates using a pie chart. It would be useful in understanding what percentage of movies were rated as PG, PG-13, R, etc.\n\nColumns: Certificate\nVisualization Type: Pie chart\n\n5. Map of filming locations: This visualization would show where the top 100 movies were filmed using a map. It would be useful in understanding the geographic distribution of filming locations.\n\nColumns: Filming\\_location\nVisualization Type: Map"

      "content": "Here is a basic structure of a machine learning regression model that can predict the income of a movie based on the input parameters:\n\n1. Data preprocessing: The first step is to preprocess the data by cleaning, transforming, and normalizing it. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.\n2. Feature selection: The next step is to select the most relevant features that can explain the variability in the target variable (income). This involves performing feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and correlation analysis to identify the most important predictors.\n3. Model selection: The third step is to select the appropriate regression algorithm that can accurately predict the income based on the selected features. This involves testing different regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks) and evaluating their performance using various metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared, cross-validation).\n4. Model training: The fourth step is to train the selected model on the training data using the selected features. This involves fitting the model parameters to minimize the prediction error and tuning the hyperparameters to optimize the performance.\n5. Model evaluation: The fifth step is to evaluate the trained model on the testing data to assess its generalization ability. This involves calculating the prediction error on the testing set and comparing it to the training error to ensure that the model is not overfitting.\n6. Model deployment: The final step is to deploy the trained model into a production environment where it can be used to predict the income of new movies based on their data parameters. This involves integrating the model into an application or a service that can receive input data, preprocess it, and generate predictions."

Finally, it makes predictions on the testing set and evaluates the model performance using mean squared error and R-squared score.\n\nNote that this is just a basic prototype, and further improvements can be made to optimize the model performance, such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection."
