However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't aware of a charity yoga event you attended in April. But I'm glad to hear that you're still feeling motivated to continue with yoga!\n\nTo find yoga studios that offer beginner classes in your area, you can try the following options:\n\n1. Online Search: Type \"yoga studios near me\" or \"beginner yoga classes near me\" in a search engine like Google, and it will show you the nearest studios along with their addresses, phone numbers, and websites.\n2. Yoga Studio Directories: Websites like YogaFinder, Yoga International, and DoYouYoga allow you to search for yoga studios and classes in your area. You can filter the results by location, style, and level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).\n3. Social Media: Check out social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where many yoga studios have business pages. You can search for yoga studios in your area and check their pages for schedules, prices, and class descriptions.\n4. Ask Around: Ask friends, family, or coworkers if they know of any good yoga studios in your area. Personal recommendations can be a great way to find a studio that suits your needs.\n5. Check with Local Gyms: Many gyms offer yoga classes as part of their group fitness programs. Check with local gyms in your area to see if they offer yoga classes, especially beginner classes.\n\nOnce you find a few studios that interest you, be sure to check their websites or call them to confirm their schedules, prices, and class levels. It's also a good idea to read reviews and ask about the studio's philosophy, teaching style, and amenities to ensure it's a good fit for you.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and start slowly, especially if you're new to yoga. Beginner classes are a great way to introduce yourself to the practice, and many studios offer workshops or introductory series specifically designed for beginners.\n\nGood luck in your yoga journey, and I hope you find a studio that resonates with you!"

      "content": "Doing your due diligence before donating or participating in a charity event is essential to ensure that your time and resources are being used effectively and efficiently. Here are some ways to research a charity and make informed decisions:\n\n1. **Check their website**: A charity's website should provide information about their mission, goals, programs, financials, and leadership. Look for transparency and clarity on how they use donations.\n2. **Charity Rating Websites**: Websites like:\n\t* Charity Navigator (charitynavigator.org)\n\t* GuideStar (guidestar.org)\n\t* BBB Wise Giving Alliance (give.org)\n\t* GreatNonprofits (greatnonprofits.org)\n\t* Charity Watch (charitywatch.org)\n\t* evaluate charities based on their financial health, accountability, and transparency. They provide ratings and reports to help you make informed decisions.\n3. **Verify 501(c)(3) status**: Ensure the charity is a registered 501(c)(3) organization, which means they're exempt from federal income tax and eligible to receive tax-deductible donations. You can check the IRS website (irs.gov) to verify their status.\n4. **Financial Reports**: Review the charity's financial reports, such as their Form 990, to understand how they allocate their funds. You can find these reports on the charity's website or through the IRS website.\n5. **Programs and Impact**: Research the charity's programs, services, and goals. Understand how they plan to use donations and what impact they aim to make.\n6. **Governance and Leadership**: Look into the charity's leadership, board members, and staff. Ensure they have a diverse and experienced team in place.\n7. **Reviews and Ratings**: Check online reviews from multiple sources, such as Google, Yelp, or Facebook, to get a sense of the charity's reputation and accountability.\n8. **Contact the Charity**: Reach out to the charity directly and ask questions about their programs, financials, and goals. A transparent and accountable charity should be willing to provide information and answer your questions.\n9. **Check for Accreditation**: Some charities may have accreditation from organizations like the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance or the Independent Charities of America. While accreditation doesn't guarantee a charity's effectiveness, it can indicate a certain level of accountability and transparency.\n10. **Use Your Instincts**: If something feels off or you're unsure about a charity, trust your instincts and look for alternative organizations that align with your values and goals.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to make informed decisions about which charities to support and participate in their events."

However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about your personal experiences or events you've attended. I'm a text-based AI assistant, and our conversation just started, so I wasn't aware of your participation in a \"Walk for Cancer\" event on May 15th.\n\nTo find more information about the organization that hosted the event, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Check your event registration or participation materials**: Look for any materials you received during or after the event, such as a registration form, a t-shirt, or a thank-you email. These might have the organization's name, website, or contact information.\n2. **Search online**: Try searching for \"Walk for Cancer\" along with the location where the event took place. This might help you find the organization's website, social media pages, or news articles about the event.\n3. **Contact the event organizers**: If you still have contact information for the event organizers, reach out to them directly and ask about the organization behind the event.\n4. **Check with local charities**: If you remember the location of the event, try contacting local charities that focus on cancer research or support. They might be able to provide information about the organization that hosted the event.\n\nOnce you find the organization, you can use the methods I mentioned earlier to research their legitimacy, financials, and impact.\n\nRemember to stay safe and vigilant when researching charities, and always prioritize verifying the authenticity of the organization before donating or participating in their events."
