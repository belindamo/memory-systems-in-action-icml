  "content": "I've been listening to a mix of Lo-Fi hip hop beats and Tameca Jones' album on repeat lately, and I realized I want to create a new playlist for relaxing music. Can you suggest some mellow artists or songs that might fit the vibe? Also, by the way, I have 20 playlists on Spotify already, and I'm looking to organize them better - do you have any tips on how to categorize them?",
