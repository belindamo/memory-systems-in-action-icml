I've also been tracking my progress in a writing journal, which has been great for reflecting on my writing process and brainstorming ideas for future projects. Speaking of which, I've been wanting to write a short story using a prompt from a writing challenge I participated in last week. Do you have any tips on how to brainstorm ideas for short stories?",
