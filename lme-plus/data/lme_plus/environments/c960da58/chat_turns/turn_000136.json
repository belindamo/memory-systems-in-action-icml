  "content": "Ok, i will tell you the answer, it takes only 7 races. The solution to this problem can be explained in three phases. Phase 1 : In this phase, we will make all the horses to run across 5 different races (A, B, C, D & E) such that no horse runs in two different races. Based on the results, we can number the horses as follows:\nA1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 , C1, \u2026, E5\nwhere A1 represents the horse that came first in race \u2018A\u2019\nPhase 2 : Now that we know the relative speeds of horses in a subgroup, we conduct a cross group race involving all horses that came first in their respective races\ni.e. A1, B1, C1, D1 and E1 will run the 6th race.\nThe winner in this race is the fastest horse in the lot.\nPhase 3 : This is the most critical part, because we have to decide which horses should run the last race. The top three horses in Race 6 will decide which horses will run this last race. Let us assume A1 came first, B1 came second and C1 came third. Hence, the last race will be between\nA2, A3, B1, B2, C1\nThe reasoning behind this is the fact that we know that A1 is faster than B1 and also faster than A2, A3. However, there may be a possibility that A3 can actually be faster than B1. Similar explanation lies in the fact that B2 can actually be faster than C1. The winner of this race will be the second fastest horse and the runner up will be the third fastest.",
