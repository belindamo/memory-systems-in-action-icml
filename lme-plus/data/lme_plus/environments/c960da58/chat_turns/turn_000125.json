I'm happy to help!\n\nUsing a spreadsheet is a great way to track your expenses, and it's awesome that you're already doing that! Here are a few more methods and apps that you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Budgeting apps:** Consider using budgeting apps like Mint, Personal Capital, or YNAB (You Need a Budget) to track your expenses, including gifts. These apps allow you to set budgets, categorize expenses, and receive notifications when you go over budget.\n2. **Gift-tracking apps:** Apps like Giftster, GiftTracker, or Presentkeeper can help you keep track of gifts you've given, including the recipient, occasion, and price. Some apps also allow you to set budgets and receive reminders for upcoming events.\n3. **Digital notes:** You can use digital note-taking apps like Evernote, OneNote, or Simplenote to keep track of your gift expenses. Create a dedicated notebook or tag for gifts, and add notes with details like the occasion, recipient, and price.\n4. **Envelope system:** If you prefer a more analog approach, consider using an envelope system.
