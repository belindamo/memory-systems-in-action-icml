  "content": "The Coffee Plant is a popular spot for students and remote workers, and they're generally very accommodating.\n\nAs for their policies, The Coffee Plant doesn't have a strict time limit on their tables, but they do have a few guidelines to ensure everyone can enjoy the space:\n\n* They encourage customers to purchase a drink or snack every 2-3 hours to support their business and make it possible for them to provide a comfortable space.\n* If you plan to stay for an extended period (more than 4-5 hours), they might ask you to make a small additional purchase or consider sharing your table with others during peak hours.\n* They have a \"laptop-friendly\" policy, which means they welcome customers with laptops, but they might ask you to make room for other customers during busy times or special events.\n* They also have a \"no-camping\" policy, which means they discourage customers from leaving their belongings unattended for extended periods or using the space as a storage area.\n\nThat being said, The Coffee Plant is known for being very relaxed and understanding. If you're planning to stay for a long time, it's always a good idea to check in with the staff and let them know your plans. They'll usually work with you to find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nAdditionally, they offer a few perks for customers who plan to stay for a while, such as:\n\n* A loyalty program that rewards customers for frequent purchases\n* Discounts for students and remote workers who purchase a certain number of drinks within a set timeframe\n* A \"study bundle\" deal that includes a drink, snack, and extended stay for a set price\n\nIt's always a good idea to ask the staff about their current policies and promotions when you visit. They're usually happy to help and want to make sure you have a great experience.\n\nI hope that helps, and I wish you a productive and comfortable study session at The Coffee Plant!",
