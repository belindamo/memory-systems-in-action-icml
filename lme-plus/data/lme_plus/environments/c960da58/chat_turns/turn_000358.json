  "content": "Here is a prototype of a regression model that predicts the income of a movie based on the input parameters using Python:\n```python\n# Import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\n\n# Load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"movies_data.csv\")\n\n# Split the data into input (X) and output (y) variables\nX = data.drop(\"Income\", axis=1)\ny = data[\"Income\"]\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Create a linear regression model and fit it to the training data\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions on the testing set\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate the model performance\nmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\nr2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)\n\nprint(\"Mean squared error:\", mse)\nprint(\"R-squared score:\", r2)\n```\nThis code loads the movies data from a CSV file, splits it into input and output variables, and then splits it into training and testing sets. It then creates a linear regression model and fits it to the training data. Finally, it makes predictions on the testing set and evaluates the model performance using mean squared error and R-squared score.\n\nNote that this is just a basic prototype, and further improvements can be made to optimize the model performance, such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection.",
