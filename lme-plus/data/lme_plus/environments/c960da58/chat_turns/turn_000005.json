Timberland: The outdoor clothing company used AR to allow customers to see what boots would look like on their feet before purchasing. This helped customers visualize the fit, style, and color of the boots before making a purchase.\n\n2. Dulux: The paint manufacturer created an AR app that allowed customers to try out different paint colors on their walls before painting. This helped customers visualize how different colors would look in their room and make a more informed decision.\n\n3. Museum of Modern Art (MoMA): The museum created an AR app that allowed visitors to see additional information about the artworks on display, including background information and audio guides. This enhanced the visitors\u2019 understanding and appreciation of the artworks.\n\n4. IKEA Place: The home furnishing company created an AR app that allowed customers to try out different furniture items in their homes before purchasing.
