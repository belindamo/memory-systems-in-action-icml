Arabesque: Moorish architecture is known for its intricate geometric and floral designs, which are often carved into plaster, wood or stone. These patterns are repeated in a variety of shapes and sizes, giving the buildings a sense of rhythm and continuity.\n\n2. Muqarnas: This type of decorative vaulting is unique to Islamic architecture, and is characterized by its intricate honeycomb-like shapes. Muqarnas often appear in the ceilings of mosques, palaces, and other important buildings.\n\n3. Horseshoe arches: Another distinctive feature of Moorish architecture is the horseshoe arch, which is steeply curved and has a shape that resembles a horseshoe. The arch was first used in Islamic architecture during the 7th century, and later became a defining feature of Moorish architecture in Spain and North Africa.\n\n4. Decorative tilework: Moorish architecture often features elaborate tilework, which can be found on walls, floors, and even in fountains. The tiles are usually brightly colored and feature complex patterns and designs.\n\n5. Courtyards: Many Moorish buildings feature large courtyards or patios, which are surrounded by arches and columns. These courtyards often feature gardens, fountains, and other decorative elements.\n\nOverall, Moorish architecture is characterized by its intricate decoration, unique forms, and emphasis on geometry and symmetry.
