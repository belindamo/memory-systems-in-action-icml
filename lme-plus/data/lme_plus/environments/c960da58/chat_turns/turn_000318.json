As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or knowledge of specific locations.\n\nThat being said, if you've fished the river with your dad last weekend, you might have a good idea of the river's characteristics and potential for holding trout. Here are some general questions to consider:\n\n* Did you catch any trout or see any signs of fish activity during your previous trip?\n* What was the water condition like? Was it clear, murky, or stained?\n* Were there any areas with structure, such as pools, riffles, or undercut banks, that could hold trout?\n* Did you notice any trout habitat, such as aquatic vegetation or submerged logs?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, it's possible that the river could hold trout. However, it's always a good idea to do some additional research and preparation before your trip.\n\nYou might want to consider:\n\n* Checking the local fishing regulations to ensure trout are present in the river and to understand any catch limits or restrictions.\n* Talking to local fishermen, guides, or fly shops to gather more information about the river's fishing conditions and trout behavior.\n* Observing the river's conditions and water levels before your trip to ensure it's fishable.\n\nRemember to always practice responsible and sustainable fishing practices, respect the environment, and follow local regulations.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you a great fishing trip!",
