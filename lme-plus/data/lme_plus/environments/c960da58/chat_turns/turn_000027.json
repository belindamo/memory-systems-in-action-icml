  "content": "I'd be happy to help you search for bird sanctuaries in your area.\n\nTo start, can you give me a rough idea of your location? What state or region are you in? That will help me narrow down the search.\n\nAlso, you can try checking the episode notes or description of \"The Feathered Flock\" podcast to see if they mentioned the name of the sanctuary or any specific details about it. Sometimes, podcasters will include links or resources in their show notes that can be helpful.\n\nIf you're unable to find the name of the sanctuary, we can try searching online for bird sanctuaries in your area. I can give you some tips on how to do that, or I can try searching for you.\n\nLet me know what you'd like to do, and we can go from there!",
