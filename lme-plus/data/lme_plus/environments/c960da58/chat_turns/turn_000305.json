For the Fettuccine Alfredo, I'd love to see a recipe that uses butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. I've heard that's the traditional way to make it. By the way, do you think I could substitute the fettuccine I bought last Thursday with the arrabbiata sauce for the Fettuccine Alfredo recipe, or would that be a bad combination?",
