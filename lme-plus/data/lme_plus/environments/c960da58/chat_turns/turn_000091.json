However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about your personal experiences or events you've attended. I'm a text-based AI assistant, and our conversation just started, so I wasn't aware of your participation in a \"Walk for Cancer\" event on May 15th.\n\nTo find more information about the organization that hosted the event, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Check your event registration or participation materials**: Look for any materials you received during or after the event, such as a registration form, a t-shirt, or a thank-you email. These might have the organization's name, website, or contact information.\n2. **Search online**: Try searching for \"Walk for Cancer\" along with the location where the event took place. This might help you find the organization's website, social media pages, or news articles about the event.\n3. **Contact the event organizers**: If you still have contact information for the event organizers, reach out to them directly and ask about the organization behind the event.\n4. **Check with local charities**: If you remember the location of the event, try contacting local charities that focus on cancer research or support. They might be able to provide information about the organization that hosted the event.\n\nOnce you find the organization, you can use the methods I mentioned earlier to research their legitimacy, financials, and impact.\n\nRemember to stay safe and vigilant when researching charities, and always prioritize verifying the authenticity of the organization before donating or participating in their events.",
