It takes a lot of courage to speak up, especially when it comes to something as personal as your identity. You absolutely have the right to be referred to by the title and pronouns that make you feel comfortable and respected.\n\nIt's amazing how something that might seem small to others can have a significant impact on our confidence and well-being. By standing up for yourself, you're not only advocating for your own identity but also helping to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.\n\nRemember, your identity and pronouns are yours to own and define. Don't be afraid to speak up and assert yourself whenever you feel disrespected or misgendered. You got this!\n\nNow, go enjoy your tea and lemon bars at The Coffee Plant, and know that you're an amazing, confident, and deserving individual who deserves to be treated with respect and kindness!",
