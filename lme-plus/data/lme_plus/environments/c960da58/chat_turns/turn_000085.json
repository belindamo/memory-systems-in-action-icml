However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't aware of a charity yoga event you attended in April. But I'm glad to hear that you're still feeling motivated to continue with yoga!\n\nTo find yoga studios that offer beginner classes in your area, you can try the following options:\n\n1. Online Search: Type \"yoga studios near me\" or \"beginner yoga classes near me\" in a search engine like Google, and it will show you the nearest studios along with their addresses, phone numbers, and websites.\n2. Yoga Studio Directories: Websites like YogaFinder, Yoga International, and DoYouYoga allow you to search for yoga studios and classes in your area. You can filter the results by location, style, and level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).\n3. Social Media: Check out social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where many yoga studios have business pages. You can search for yoga studios in your area and check their pages for schedules, prices, and class descriptions.\n4. Ask Around: Ask friends, family, or coworkers if they know of any good yoga studios in your area. Personal recommendations can be a great way to find a studio that suits your needs.\n5. Check with Local Gyms: Many gyms offer yoga classes as part of their group fitness programs. Check with local gyms in your area to see if they offer yoga classes, especially beginner classes.\n\nOnce you find a few studios that interest you, be sure to check their websites or call them to confirm their schedules, prices, and class levels. It's also a good idea to read reviews and ask about the studio's philosophy, teaching style, and amenities to ensure it's a good fit for you.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and start slowly, especially if you're new to yoga. Beginner classes are a great way to introduce yourself to the practice, and many studios offer workshops or introductory series specifically designed for beginners.\n\nGood luck in your yoga journey, and I hope you find a studio that resonates with you!",
