Here are some popular options:\n\n**By Train:**\n\n1. **Tokyo Monorail**: From Hamamatsucho Station, take the Tokyo Monorail to Haneda Airport (around 15-20 minutes, \u00a5500-1,000). Hamamatsucho is connected to the JR Yamanote Line, which makes it easily accessible from most parts of Tokyo.\n2. **Keikyu Railway**: From Shinbashi Station, take the Keikyu Railway to Haneda Airport (around 15-20 minutes, \u00a5500-1,000). Shinbashi is also connected to the JR Yamanote Line.\n\n**By Bus:**\n\n1. **Airport Limousine**: Bus services operate from various locations in Tokyo, including Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Tokyo Station, to Haneda Airport (around 30-60 minutes, \u00a51,000-2,000).\n2. **Tokyo City Air Terminal (T-CAT)**: From T-CAT in Shiba-Koen, take the bus to Haneda Airport (around 30-40 minutes, \u00a51,000). T-CAT is connected to the JR Yamanote Line.\n\n**By Taxi:**\n\n1. **Regular Taxi**: Available from anywhere in Tokyo, but be prepared for higher costs (around \u00a56,000-10,000 to Haneda Airport, depending on traffic).\n\n**By Private Car or Ride-hailing:**\n\n1. **Uber**: Available in Tokyo, but prices can surge during peak hours.\n2. **Private Car Services**: Various companies offer private car services from Tokyo to Haneda Airport, which can be booked in advance.\n\nConsidering your specific needs, I recommend taking the Tokyo Monorail or Keikyu Railway from Hamamatsucho or Shinbashi, respectively. Both options are efficient, relatively affordable, and easily accessible from most parts of Tokyo.\n\nPlease note that travel times and prices may vary depending on the time of day, traffic, and other factors.
