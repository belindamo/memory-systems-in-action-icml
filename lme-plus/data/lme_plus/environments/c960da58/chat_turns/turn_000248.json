  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have specific information about the selection process for a particular festival. However, in general, film festivals have selection committees or juries consisting of industry professionals like filmmakers, critics, and academics. The committees receive submissions of feature-length films, short films, or both, and they screen them to determine which ones are the most outstanding, fresh, and relevant for their festival's mission, goals, audience, and theme. The criteria the committees use to assess the films may include artistic merit, originality, storytelling, technical proficiency, cultural relevance, and social impact. They may also take into account a film's festival history, market potential, distribution status, and the balance of genres and styles in the final lineup. Generally, festivals aim to showcase a diverse range of films that can contribute to advancing the art of cinema and engaging the public in critical dialogue about the world we live in.",
