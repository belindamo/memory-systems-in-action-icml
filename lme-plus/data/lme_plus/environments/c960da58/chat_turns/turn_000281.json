  "content": "Dear all, \n\nMy name is Paolo Mura, I am a networker and strategy enthusiast looking for new opportunities in an international and stimulating environment. \n\nI always worked on projects that required community building and a constant focus on new trends, from underground to mainstream, which brought me to tour with one of the most successful artists in Italy and to develop my own music label. \n\nI'm also co-founder and creative director of Ecosistemi Festival since 2020, a post-internet oriented festival located on the Vesuvius Volcano in Naples.\n\nI grew up in Italy but I've developed the capacity to build relationships with people from all over Europe and with very different backgrounds as I had to constantly adapt to new environments. \n\nAttached you can find my resume, please consider it for the Project Manager position, hope to hear from you soon.\n\nP\n\nCan you review this email i'm writing for a job application as project manager for a festival named polifonic",
