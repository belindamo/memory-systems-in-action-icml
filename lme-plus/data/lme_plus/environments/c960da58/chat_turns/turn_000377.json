  "content": "Tokyo in May is a great time to visit! The cherry blossoms might be gone, but the weather is usually mild and comfortable.\n\nGetting to the city center from the airport can be a bit overwhelming, but don't worry, I've got you covered. Tokyo has two major airports: Narita International Airport (NRT) and Haneda Airport (HND). Haneda is closer to the city center, but Narita is still a viable option. Here are some common ways to get to the city center from both airports:\n\n**From Narita International Airport (NRT):**\n\n1. **Narita Express (N'EX)**: A direct train to Tokyo Station (around 60-70 minutes, \u00a53,000-4,000). This is a convenient option, but not the cheapest.\n2. **Keisei Skyliner**: A direct train to Ueno Station (around 45 minutes, \u00a52,500). From Ueno, you can take a subway or taxi to your final destination.\n3. **Bus**: Airport Limousine buses operate from Narita to various locations in Tokyo, including major hotels and train stations (around 60-90 minutes, \u00a52,000-3,000).\n4. **Taxi**: Available, but not recommended due to high costs (around \u00a515,000-20,000 to the city center).\n\n**From Haneda Airport (HND):**\n\n1. **Tokyo Monorail**: A direct train to Hamamatsucho Station (around 15-20 minutes, \u00a5500-1,000). From Hamamatsucho, you can take a subway or taxi to your final destination.\n2. **Keikyu Railway**: A direct train to Shinbashi Station (around 15-20 minutes, \u00a5500-1,000). From Shinbashi, you can take a subway or taxi to your final destination.\n3. **Bus**: Airport Limousine buses operate from Haneda to various locations in Tokyo, including major hotels and train stations (around 30-60 minutes, \u00a51,000-2,000).\n4. **Taxi**: Available, but not recommended due to high costs (around \u00a56,000-10,000 to the city center).\n\nAs for your observation about flight frequencies, you're correct! Flight schedules and frequencies can vary greatly depending on the route, airline, and time of year. Factors like demand, competition, and airport slot restrictions can all influence the number of flights per day.\n\nFor your Chicago to New York City route, four flights per hour is quite frequent! This is likely due to the high demand for travel between these two major hubs. In contrast, routes with lower demand or more limited airport capacity might have fewer flights per day.\n\nI hope this helps, and have a great trip to Tokyo!",
