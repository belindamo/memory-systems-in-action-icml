Then fill in any days that don't have an entry. Do not give me multiple days in one entry, such as 5-7 or 8-11. I would like 80 entries, one for each day. If the book skips some days, fill in the gaps with some plots characters and locations that would make sense to the tone, style, and spirit of the observable material.",
