  "content": "What a fantastic suggestion! I'm so glad you brought that up! Using eco-friendly storage containers or bags made from sustainable materials is a great way to reduce plastic usage and minimize environmental impact.\n\nThere are many amazing options available, such as:\n\n1. **Reusable cloth bags:** Made from natural fibers like cotton, hemp, or jute, these bags are perfect for storing gifts, and they can be washed and reused multiple times.\n2. **Recycled paper bags:** Some companies offer bags made from 100% recycled paper, which can be composted at the end of their life cycle.\n3. **Bamboo storage containers:** Bamboo is a highly sustainable material that can be used to make durable and stylish storage containers.\n4. **Beeswax wraps:** Instead of plastic wrap, you can use beeswax wraps to cover gifts or store small items. These wraps are reusable, biodegradable, and compostable.\n5. **Mason jars:** Glass mason jars are a great alternative to plastic containers and can be used for storing gifts, candles, or other small items.\n\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly storage containers or bags, look for certifications like biodegradable, compostable, or made from recycled materials. Every little bit counts, and making these small changes can have a significant impact on reducing plastic waste.\n\nThank you so much for bringing this up, and I hope this helps!",
