The past year has been unique for film festivals due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many festivals were forced to cancel or switch to virtual versions, while others adopted hybrid models. Some of the acclaimed films that premiered at festivals in the past year include \"Minari,\" which premiered at Sundance and won the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award, \"Nomadland\" which premiered at Venice and won the Golden Lion, and \"One Night in Miami\" which premiered at Venice and moved to Toronto.
