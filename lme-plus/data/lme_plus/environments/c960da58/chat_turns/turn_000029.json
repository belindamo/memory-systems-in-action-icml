  "content": "The Midwest has a lot of great birding spots.\n\nLet's try searching online for bird sanctuaries in the Midwest. Here are a few ways we can do that:\n\n1. **Google search**: We can try searching for \"bird sanctuaries in the Midwest\" or \"bird sanctuaries near [your state/city]\" to see what comes up. We can also try searching for \"Audubon societies\" or \"wildlife refuges\" in your area, as these often have bird sanctuaries or protected areas for birds.\n2. **eBird**: eBird is a great resource for birders, and they have a \"Hotspots\" feature that allows you to search for birding locations near you. You can enter your location or zip code, and it'll show you a list of nearby hotspots, including bird sanctuaries.\n3. **American Bird Conservancy**: The American Bird Conservancy has a \"Bird Conservation Region\" map that allows you to search for bird sanctuaries and conservation areas by state or region.\n\nLet's try searching online together! What state are you in, specifically? That will help me narrow down the search.\n\nBy the way, it's great that you're keeping a birding journal! That's a wonderful way to track your sightings and reflect on your experiences. Do you have a favorite species that you're hoping to spot at the sanctuary?",
