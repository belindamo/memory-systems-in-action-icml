  "content": "Ramen Nagi in Shinjuku is a great alternative! They're known for their rich, savory tonkotsu broth, but they also offer some vegetarian and vegan options.\n\nRamen Nagi has a few options that can be modified to suit vegetarian or vegan diets:\n\n1. **Vegetable Ramen:** They offer a Vegetable Ramen bowl with a light, clear vegetable broth, topped with a variety of vegetables like bok choy, green onions, and bean sprouts. This option is vegetarian, but not vegan, as it contains egg noodles.\n2. **Vegan Ramen ( seasonal):** Ramen Nagi occasionally offers a limited-time vegan ramen option, usually during certain seasons or promotions. This bowl features a vegan broth made with plant-based ingredients and is topped with vegan-friendly ingredients like tofu and vegetables. Be sure to check their website or social media for availability.\n3. **Customization:** You can also ask your server to customize your bowl by holding the pork slices (ch\u0101shu) and adding extra vegetables. They might be able to accommodate other requests, like using a different broth or noodle type.\n\nKeep in mind that Ramen Nagi's menu and options may change, so it's always a good idea to check their website or call ahead to confirm their current offerings.\n\nIf you're looking for more vegan or vegetarian ramen options in Tokyo, I can definitely provide some recommendations. There are some amazing shops that cater specifically to plant-based diets!",
