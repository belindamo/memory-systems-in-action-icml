Thank you for the example code! That's a great starting point for creating an interactive scatter plot.\n\nTo continue, some other customization options you might consider include:\n\n* Adding a trend line to the scatter plot to highlight the correlation between renewable energy production and carbon emissions\n* Using different marker shapes or sizes to represent different variables, such as country or year\n* Creating a dropdown menu or slider to allow users to filter the data by country, year, or other variables\n* Adding annotations or hover-over text to provide additional context and insights\n\nIf you're new to Plotly, the official Plotly documentation and tutorials are excellent resources to learn more about the library and its capabilities.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about customizing the Plotly visualization or working with the `plotly.express` module? I'm here to help!",
