The Ottoman Empire had a significant influence on the architecture of Craiova, especially during their rule from the late 15th century until the early 19th century. Ottoman architecture emphasized intricate geometric designs, colorful tiles, and the use of arches and domes. Many Ottoman-style buildings in Craiova can be found in the Old Town, including the Eski Mosque, built in the mid-16th century, and the Bani\u021ba and Bucov\u0103\u021b houses, built in the 18th century.\n\nIn contrast, Austro-Hungarian architecture emphasized symmetry, simplicity, and practicality. During the Austro-Hungarian era in Craiova, from the late 19th century until the early 20th century, buildings were designed with a mix of Baroque, Classicism, and Art Nouveau styles. The Austro-Hungarian styles can be seen in some civic buildings, such as the Prefecture building, built in 1907.\n\nThe socio-political climate of these two empires thus contributed to the distinct styles of buildings in Craiova, as they each imposed their own unique architectural standards and preferences.",
