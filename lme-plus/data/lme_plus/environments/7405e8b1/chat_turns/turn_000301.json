Here are some general observations:\n\n1. **Newly added restaurants**: Restaurants that are new to UberEats might offer promotions to attract more customers and build their reputation on the platform.\n2. **Chain restaurants**: Large chain restaurants, like McDonald's, Subway, or Pizza Hut, often have more resources to offer promotions and discounts to drive sales.\n3. **Fast food and quick service**: Fast food and quick-service restaurants, like burgers, sandwiches, or salads, might offer more promotions due to their high volume of orders and competitive market.\n4. **Asian cuisine**: Restaurants serving Asian food, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, often offer discounts or promotions, possibly due to the high demand for these cuisines on food delivery platforms.\n5. **Vegetarian or vegan options**: Restaurants with vegetarian or vegan options might offer promotions to attract customers with dietary restrictions or preferences.\n6. **Breakfast or brunch spots**: Restaurants serving breakfast or brunch might offer promotions during off-peak hours or weekdays to drive sales.\n7. **Local or independent eateries**: Smaller, independent restaurants might offer promotions to compete with larger chains and attract more customers to their business.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general trends and not hard and fast rules. Promotions can vary greatly depending on your location, the restaurant's target audience, and the time of year.\n\nTo increase your chances of finding promo codes or discounts, try the following:\n\n* Use the UberEats app or website to search for restaurants in these categories.\n* Filter your search by \"Deals\" or \"Promotions\" to find restaurants with active offers.\n* Check the restaurant's social media pages or website for exclusive promotions.\n* Sign up for the restaurant's loyalty program or email newsletter to receive exclusive offers.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of any promo code or discount to ensure it's valid for your order.",
