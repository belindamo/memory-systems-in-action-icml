The wider console tables I mentioned earlier from Walker Edison are designed to accommodate cable management systems, and they have some features that can help keep your cables organized.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Cable management cutouts**: Some of the wider console tables have cable management cutouts or holes on the back panel or shelves, which allow you to route cables and wires neatly behind the console table. This can help keep your cables organized and out of sight.\n2. **Cable ties or straps**: You can use cable ties or straps to secure cables to the console table's legs or frame, keeping them tidy and preventing clutter.\n3. **Shelf space**: The wider console tables often have more shelf space, which can be used to store devices, gaming consoles, or other media equipment. This can help reduce clutter and keep cables organized.\n4. **Adjustable shelves**: Some console tables have adjustable shelves, which can be customized to fit your devices and cables. This can help you create a more organized and tidy setup.\n\nWhen choosing a console table, consider the following factors to ensure it works well with your cable management system:\n\n* Look for console tables with cable management cutouts or holes on the back panel or shelves.\n* Check if the console table has adjustable shelves or compartments that can be customized to fit your devices and cables.\n* Consider the width and depth of the console table to ensure it can accommodate your devices and cables.\n* Think about the material and design of the console table. A console table with a more open design or a metal frame might be more conducive to cable management than one with a solid wood or closed design.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about a particular console table or brand, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!",
