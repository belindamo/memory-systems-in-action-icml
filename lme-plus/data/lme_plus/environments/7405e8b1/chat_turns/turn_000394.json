  "content": "The video titled \"(2) A.I. Tries 20 Jobs | WIRED - YouTube\" shows a group of people from different professions questioning whether or not AI can do their job. Each person presents a task for AI to perform, and then AI attempts to complete the task. The tasks range from generating code for a craft beer website, answering medical questions, designing logos, providing relationship advice, writing jokes, creating a legal memorandum, reading news, and creating a new cocktail. While AI was able to complete some tasks successfully, such as generating code and answering medical questions, it struggled with others, such as creating a new cocktail and reading news. In conclusion, the people in the video are skeptical about AI replacing them in their respective professions.",
