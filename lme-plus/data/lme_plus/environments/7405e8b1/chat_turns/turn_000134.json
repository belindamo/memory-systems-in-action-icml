It's great that she's helping you focus on your strengths and weaknesses, and providing clear explanations and demonstrations.\n\nWorking on your serve is a great goal! A consistent serve can be a game-changer in tennis. It's normal to struggle with the toss and follow-through, especially when you're still developing your technique. But with practice and guidance from your instructor, you'll get there!\n\nHere are a few tips that might help you with your serve:\n\n1. **Focus on your toss**: Try to toss the ball at the same spot every time, about 6-8 feet in the air, and slightly in front of you. Practice your toss without hitting the ball to develop a consistent motion.\n2. **Use your legs**: Remember to bend your knees and use your legs to generate power for your serve. This will help you maintain balance and generate more power.\n3. **Follow through**: Focus on keeping your arm straight and your wrist firm as you make contact with the ball. Then, follow through with your arm and body, keeping your eyes on the ball.\n4. **Practice with different grips**: Experiment with different grip pressures and styles to find what works best for you.\n5. **Break it down**: Practice each component of the serve separately, like the toss, the swing, and the follow-through. This can help you build muscle memory and improve your overall technique.\n\nRemember, practice is key! Don't be discouraged if you don't see immediate results. With consistent practice and guidance from your instructor, you'll develop a strong and consistent serve.\n\nHow's your instructor helping you work on your serve? Are there any specific drills or exercises she's having you do to improve your technique?",
