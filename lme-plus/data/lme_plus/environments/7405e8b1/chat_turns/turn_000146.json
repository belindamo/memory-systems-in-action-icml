The open design also makes it easier to manage cables and keep them tidy.\n3. **Adjustable shelves**: The shelves are adjustable, so you can customize the storage space to fit your devices and cables. This will help you create a more organized and clutter-free setup.\n4. **Wide surface area**: The 64\" width provides a generous surface area for your devices, allowing you to keep them spaced out and reducing clutter.\n5. **Rustic wood design**: The rustic wood design adds a touch of warmth and character to your living room, and the distressed finish can help hide any minor scratches or scuffs.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the console table's cable management features might not be as extensive as some other models on the market.
