Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Preschoolers (3-5 years):**\n\t* Look for kits with washable, non-toxic materials and simple tools like crayons, markers, and paint.\n\t* Kits with large, easy-to-handle pieces and minimal small parts are best.\n\t* Packages labeled \"preschool\" or \"early childhood\" are suitable.\n2. **Early elementary (6-7 years):**\n\t* Kits with a mix of basic art supplies like crayons, markers, and paints, along with some more advanced materials like colored pencils or watercolors.\n\t* Look for kits with more variety in terms of materials and tools, but still relatively easy to use.\n3. **Older elementary (8-10 years):**\n\t* Kits with a wider range of art supplies, including higher-quality materials like acrylic paints, pastels, or oil pastels.\n\t* More complex tools like scissors, glue, and tape may be included.\n\t* Kits with more focused themes, like drawing, painting, or mixed media, can be suitable.\n4. **Tweens (11+ years):**\n\t* Kits with advanced materials and techniques, like watercolor sets, sketchbooks, or more complex art tools.\n\t* Look for kits with high-quality materials and more specialized tools, like canvas panels or paints.\n\nWhen in doubt, you can:\n\n* Read reviews and product descriptions to get an idea of the kit's content and complexity.\n* Check the manufacturer's recommended age range or skill level.\n* Consider your niece's interests and preferences; if she loves to draw, a kit with more drawing tools might be suitable.\n\n**Building Sets and LEGO:**\n\nBuilding sets and LEGO are excellent choices for developing problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and creativity. Here are some options:\n\n1. **LEGO:**\n\t* LEGO DUPLO (ages 1 1/2 to 3 years): Large, soft bricks for young children.\n\t* LEGO Classic (ages 4-7 years): Basic bricks and elements for building simple structures.\n\t* LEGO Creator (ages 7-10 years): More complex builds with themes like vehicles, animals, or buildings.\n\t* LEGO Friends (ages 6-12 years): Themed sets with more feminine designs and characters.\n\t* LEGO Technic (ages 8-14 years): More advanced, mechanical builds with gears and motors.\n2. **Other Building Sets:**\n\t* Magna-Tiles (ages 3-10 years): Magnetic tiles for building 3D structures and shapes.\n\t* K'NEX (ages 7-14 years): Rods and connectors for building complex structures and machines.\n\t* Lincoln Logs (ages 3-10 years): Wooden logs for building log cabins and structures.\n\t* Tinkertoys (ages 3-10 years): Rods and spools for building geometric shapes and structures.\n\nWhen choosing a building set or LEGO, consider:\n\n* Your niece's age and skill level.\n* Her interests and preferences (e.g., animals, vehicles, or fantasy creatures).\n* The complexity and number of pieces in the set.\n* Reviews and ratings from other customers.\n\nRemember, building sets and LEGO are great for developing problem-solving skills, but they can also be a fun way to encourage creativity and imagination!\n\nDo you have any specific preferences or questions about building sets or LEGO?",
