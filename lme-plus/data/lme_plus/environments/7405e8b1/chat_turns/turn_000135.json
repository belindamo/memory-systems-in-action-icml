  "content": "She's been having me practice my toss with a basket of balls, just focusing on getting a consistent toss without hitting the ball. Then, we move on to practicing the swing and follow-through without the ball, just to get the motion down. Once I'm comfortable with that, we practice putting it all together with the ball. She's also been giving me some tips on how to generate more power and spin on my serve.\n\nIt's been helping, but like I said, I'm still struggling to get it consistent. I'm hoping with more practice, it'll start to click. Do you think it's a good idea to practice my serve with a wall or a backboard? I've heard that can help with consistency and power.",
