These buildings typically featured ornate fa\u00e7ades with intricate carvings, wooden balconies, and windows with decorative grilles. The Bucov\u0103\u021b and Bani\u021ba houses in the Old Town are examples of Ottoman-style residential buildings in Craiova. These houses were built in the 18th century and feature a combination of Ottoman and local architectural elements such as carved wooden doors and window frames.\n\nIn contrast, Austro-Hungarian architecture emphasized symmetry, simplicity, and practicality. This style influenced the construction of residential buildings in Craiova during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Austro-Hungarian-style residential buildings were typically constructed with brick or stone and featured clean lines and simple facades.
