Here is the complete code for finding the values of pA and pB:\n```perl\n# desired probabilities\nprob_A_win_match <- 0.5\nprob_less_than_23_games <- 0.5\n\n# solve for pA and pB using a grid search\npA_vals <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)\npB_vals <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)\n\nfor (pA in pA_vals) {\n  for (pB in pB_vals) {\n    prob_A_win_set <- prob_A_win_set(pA, pB)\n    prob_less_than_23_games_in_set <- prob_less_than_23_games_in_set(pA, pB)\n    prob_A_win_match_actual <- prob_A_win_match_actual(prob_A_win_set)\n    \n    if (abs(prob_A_win_match_actual - prob_A_win_match) < 0.01 & \n        abs(prob_less_than_23_games_in_set - prob_less_than_23_games) < 0.01) {\n      print(paste(\"pA:\", round(pA, 2), \"pB:\", round(pB, 2)))\n      break\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nAssuming the functions `prob_A_win_set()`, `prob_less_than_23_games_in_set()`, and `prob_A_win_match_actual()` are defined correctly, the resulting values of `pA` and `pB` would be printed once the desired probabilities are met within a tolerance of 0.01. However, since the code for these functions was not provided, I cannot provide the exact resulting values of `pA` and `pB`.",
