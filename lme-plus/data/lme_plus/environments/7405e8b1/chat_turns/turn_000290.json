I'll stick to general information and ask more questions to clarify my concerns.\n\nSo, to clarify, I should take my blood thinners exactly as prescribed, monitor my INR levels regularly, and report any side effects or changes to my healthcare provider. I should also avoid activities that may increase the risk of bleeding and seek urgent medical attention if I experience bleeding, difficulty breathing, or severe headaches.\n\nCan you provide more information on how to monitor my INR levels and what to expect during follow-up appointments?",
