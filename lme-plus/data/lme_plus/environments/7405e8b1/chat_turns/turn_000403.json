  "content": "I'm thinking about taking up swimming as another recreational sport. I used to swim competitively in high school, and I've been missing the feeling of being in the water. By the way, my recent fitness progress has been going well - I reached a new personal best on the treadmill, running 3 miles in 25 minutes and 12 seconds two weeks ago. Do you know of any local swimming pools that offer recreational swim sessions?",
