Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Remote Shutter Releases:**\n\n1. **Canon RC-6 Wireless Remote Control**: This is a popular and affordable option specifically designed for Canon cameras. It's a simple, compact remote that allows you to trigger the shutter from up to 16.4 feet away.\n2. **Vello RS-C3 Remote Shutter Release**: This is a third-party option that's compatible with Canon cameras. It's a bit more feature-rich than the Canon RC-6, offering a longer range (up to 30 feet) and a few additional features like a half-press function.\n\n**Camera Timers:**\n\n1. **Camera's built-in timer**: Most cameras, including the Canon EOS 80D, have a built-in timer function. You can set the timer to take a photo after a short delay (usually 2-10 seconds). This can help reduce camera shake and allow the camera to settle before taking the shot.\n2. **External intervalometer**: An intervalometer is a device that allows you to set a timer and interval for taking photos. This can be useful for time-lapse photography, but also for reducing camera shake. The CamRanger II is a popular option that's compatible with Canon cameras.\n\n**Tips for reducing camera shake:**\n\n1. **Use a tripod**: A sturdy tripod is the best way to eliminate camera shake. Invest in a good-quality tripod that can support your camera's weight.\n2. **Use a faster shutter speed**: If you're handholding your camera, try to use a faster shutter speed (at least 1/125s or faster) to freeze camera movement.\n3. **Hold your camera correctly**: Hold your camera with both hands, with one hand supporting the lens and the other holding the camera body. Keep your elbows close to your body to reduce movement.\n4. **Take multiple shots**: Take multiple shots in rapid succession to increase the chances of getting a sharp image.\n\nBy using a remote shutter release or camera timer, you can reduce camera shake and improve the overall sharpness of your photos. Combine these techniques with good camera handling and a sturdy tripod, and you'll be well on your way to taking stunning photos!",
