  "content": "Discounts on delivery fees are less common than discounts on food items, but they do exist.\n\nTypically, promotions and discounts on food delivery platforms like UberEats are applied to the food items themselves, rather than the delivery fee. This means that you're more likely to find discounts on specific menu items, combos, or bundles, rather than the delivery fee.\n\nHowever, there are some cases where you might be able to get a discount on the delivery fee:\n\n1. **First-time user discounts**: Some food delivery platforms offer discounts on the delivery fee for first-time users. These discounts are usually applied automatically during the checkout process.\n2. **Promo codes**: Occasionally, you might find promo codes that offer a discount on the delivery fee. These codes are usually limited to specific restaurants, areas, or time periods, so be sure to read the terms and conditions.\n3. **Free delivery**: Some restaurants or food delivery platforms offer free delivery on orders above a certain amount or on specific menu items. This can be a great way to save on the delivery fee.\n4. **Subscription services**: Some food delivery platforms offer subscription services that include discounts on delivery fees. For example, UberEats' Pass subscription service offers unlimited free delivery on eligible orders.\n5. **Limited-time offers**: During peak hours, special events, or holidays, food delivery platforms might offer discounts on delivery fees to incentivize orders.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a discount on the delivery fee, I recommend:\n\n* Checking the food delivery platform's website, social media, or app for promotions and offers.\n* Signing up for their email newsletter or loyalty program to receive exclusive offers.\n* Using cashback apps or browser extensions that offer rebates on food delivery fees.\n* Contacting the restaurant or food delivery platform directly to ask about any available discounts.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of any promo code or discount to ensure it's valid for your order and location.",
