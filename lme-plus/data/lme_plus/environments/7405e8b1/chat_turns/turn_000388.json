Here's how it works:\n\n**Using Points on Sale Items:**\n\n1. **Points can be redeemed on sale items:** You can use your Balance Rewards points to pay for sale items, including those with discounts, buy-one-get-one-free (BOGO) offers, or other promotional prices.\n2. **Points value remains the same:** The value of your points doesn't change, even if the item is on sale. 1,000 points are still worth $1 off your purchase.\n\n**Using Points with Digital Coupons:**\n\n1. **Stack points with digital coupons:** You can combine your Balance Rewards points with digital coupons to maximize your savings.\n2. **Apply digital coupon first:** When you apply a digital coupon, the discount will be deducted from the original price of the item. Then, you can use your Balance Rewards points to pay for the remaining amount.\n3. **Points are applied after coupon discount:** The points will be deducted from the price after the digital coupon has been applied.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* Item original price: $10\n* Digital coupon: $1 off\n* Price after coupon: $9\n* You use 1,000 Balance Rewards points (worth $1): $9 - $1 = $8\n\nIn this example, you'll pay $8 out of pocket and earn points on the remaining amount.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* Some digital coupons may have restrictions or exclusions, so always check the terms and conditions before applying them.\n* Balance Rewards points cannot be used to pay for sales tax or other fees.\n\nNow that you know how to use your points with sale items and digital coupons, go ahead and maximize your savings!",
