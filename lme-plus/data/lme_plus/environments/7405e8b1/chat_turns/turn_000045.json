Carpooling with Rachel on Fridays is a fantastic way to start, and I'm sure you'll both enjoy the benefits of reduced costs, less traffic stress, and some social time together.\n\nSince you've just started, it's a good idea to track your expenses and see how much you're saving each month. You can use a spreadsheet or a budgeting app to keep track of your costs and compare them to previous months.\n\nRemember, every little bit counts, and making small changes to your daily habits can add up to significant savings over time. Who knows, you might find that carpooling is not only good for your wallet but also for your mental and physical well-being.\n\nKeep me updated on how your carpooling experience goes, and if you need any more advice or suggestions, feel free to ask!",
