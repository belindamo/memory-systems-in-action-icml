It can make the memorial even more personal and heartfelt. However, it's essential to consider a few things before making a decision:\n\n1. **Space constraints**: Make sure the stone has enough space to accommodate the additional text. You don't want the inscription to look cluttered or cramped.\n2. **Message length**: Keep your message or quote brief and concise. A short sentence or a few words can be powerful and meaningful. Aim for something that can be read quickly and easily.\n3. **Tone and content**: Ensure the message or quote resonates with your grandmother's personality and your relationship with her. You might want to choose something that's uplifting, comforting, or inspiring.\n4. **Personal preference**: Consider your personal preference and the tone you want to convey. If you're unsure, you could ask family members or close relatives for their input.\n\nHere are some examples of quotes or messages that might work well:\n\n* \"Thank you for the love and memories\"\n* \"Forever in my heart\"\n* \"Your love will always bloom in my life\"\n* \"Gardening in heaven, guiding me still\"\n* \"Love grows on, Grandma\"\n\nIf you decide to add a quote or message, place it below or beside the main inscription, depending on the stone's design and layout. This will create a clear visual distinction between the two.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to come from the heart and express your genuine feelings and gratitude. Your grandmother will appreciate the thought and love behind your words.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have a specific quote or message in mind, or would you like more ideas?",
