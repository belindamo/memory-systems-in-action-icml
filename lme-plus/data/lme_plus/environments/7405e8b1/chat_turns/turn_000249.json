However, I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to real-time information or specific details about a particular church or its services. But I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. **Church Website**: You can check the website of St. Mary's Church to see if they post their sermon schedules, readings, or bulletins online. Many churches provide this information on their websites or social media pages.\n2. **Catholic Church Resources**: Since you mentioned that St. Mary's is a Catholic church, you can check the official website of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) or the Vatican's website for the Sunday readings and reflections. They often provide the readings and reflections for each Sunday.\n3. **Contact the Church Directly**: You can reach out to St. Mary's Church directly via phone or email to ask about the readings and sermon schedule for this Sunday. They may be able to provide you with the information you're looking for.\n\nRemember to also check the church's service schedule and plan to arrive a little early to get settled before the service begins.\n\nIt's great that you're considering attending a service and reflecting on your faith. I hope you have a meaningful experience, and I'm sure Father John's sermon will be thought-provoking as always!",
