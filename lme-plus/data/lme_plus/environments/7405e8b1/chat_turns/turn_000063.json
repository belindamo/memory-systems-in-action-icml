  "content": "To find the depth of a microwave that is 0.2 cubic feet smaller, you will need to first calculate the volume of the smaller microwave in inches. To do this, you can use the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = Length (l) x Width (w) x Height (h)\n\nThe width and height of the microwave are given as 20.5 inches and 10.25 inches, respectively. The volume of the smaller microwave is 0.2 cubic feet smaller than the larger microwave, so you can subtract 0.2 cubic feet from the volume of the larger microwave to find the volume of the smaller microwave.\n\nAssuming that the volume of the larger microwave is 1.9 cubic feet, the volume of the smaller microwave would be:\n\nV = 1.9 - 0.2 = 1.7 cubic feet\n\nTo convert this volume to inches, you can use the conversion factor of 1728 cubic inches per cubic foot:\n\nV = 1.7 cubic feet x 1728 cubic inches/cubic foot = 2916 cubic inches\n\nTo find the depth of the smaller microwave in inches, you can rearrange the formula for volume as follows:\n\nDepth (d) = V / (w x h)\n\nPlugging in the values for the volume and the width and height of the microwave, you get:\n\nd = 2916 / (20.5 x 10.25) = 1.47 inches\n\nThus, the depth of the smaller microwave would be approximately 1.47 inches.\n\nI hope this helps!
