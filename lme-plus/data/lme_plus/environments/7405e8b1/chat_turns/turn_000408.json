  "content": "Palm Springs is known for its warm, sunny weather year-round, but March is a great time to visit because the temperatures are typically mild and comfortable. During this time of year, the average high temperature is around 79\u00b0F (26\u00b0C), while the average low temperature is around 54\u00b0F (12\u00b0C).\n\nIt's also worth noting that Palm Springs is located in the desert, so the temperature can drop significantly at night, even during warmer months. It's a good idea to pack layers for your trip, especially if you plan to spend time outdoors in the evenings.\n\nOverall, March is a great time to visit Palm Springs if you enjoy warm weather without the extreme heat of the summer months.",
