  "content": "Discounts can vary, but I can give you some general insights.\n\nTypically, discounts on food delivery platforms like UberEats are applied to the entire order, rather than a specific dish. This means that if you have a promo code or discount, it will be deducted from the total cost of your order, including the veggie lasagna, any other items you've added, and any applicable fees.\n\nHowever, some restaurants might offer specific promotions or discounts on certain dishes, like \"Buy one get one free\" or \"10% off our veggie lasagna.\" These types of promotions are usually advertised on the restaurant's page on UberEats, their social media, or website.\n\nIn some cases, you might be able to find a promo code that's specific to a particular dish or menu category. For example, \"VEGGLASAGNA20\" might be a code that gives you 20% off the veggie lasagna. These codes are usually limited to specific restaurants or menu items, so be sure to read the terms and conditions before applying them.\n\nIf you're looking for a discount on the veggie lasagna specifically, I'd recommend checking the restaurant's page on UberEats, their social media, or website for any promotions or discounts. You can also try contacting the restaurant directly to ask if they have any special offers on that dish.\n\nRemember to always read the terms and conditions of any promo code or discount to ensure it's valid for your order and location.",
