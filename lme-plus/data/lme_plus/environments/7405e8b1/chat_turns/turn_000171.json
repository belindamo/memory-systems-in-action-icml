Fresh Earth Token (FET) - A digital token that is used as a unit of account within the FEE ecosystem and can be traded on the open market. FET is used to reward positive impact and incentivize participation in the ecosystem.\n2. Fresh Earth Rewards (FER) - A rewards system that redistributes tokens/wealth among stakeholders based on impact and participation in the ecosystem.\n3. Fresh Earth Impact Validation (FEIV) - A system that uses the Guardian Authentication platform to source and validate data related to impact, and uses this data to calculate the Fresh Earth Index (FESI).\n4. Fresh Earth Index (FESI) - A score that measures the impact of the FEE ecosystem against four key performance indicators (KPIs) - Health, Economy, Food Quality, and Environment.\n5. Fresh Earth Stakeholders - The community of individuals and organizations that participate in and benefit from the FEE ecosystem. This includes farmers, manufacturers, consumers, and experts.\n6. Fresh Earth Expert Community - An autonomous, decentralized, and transparent community-governed ecosystem with open-sourced and independently verifiable measures of impact. It enables, improves and facilitates local collaborations to optimize each stakeholder in the supply chain and hence the overall system.\n7. Fresh Earth Industry Network - Optimized to facilitate collaborative networking between users, and acts as a central hub for developing and managing projects, sharing knowledge, building user profiles, sharing data and receiving rewards.\n8. Fresh Earth B2B marketplace Sandbox - four-sided ecommerce platform connecting Consumers with Farmers (produce), and designers (programs ) and Manufacturers (products) with supply chain (Packers, Drivers, Physical Stores). The marketplace is centred around the four players, with the supply chain moving around the workflows.\n9. Fresh Earth Projects - Developed by agri-food professionals, scientists, researchers, creators, farmers, manufacturers and supply chain entities who self-organize in specified groups around a common goal.\n10. Fresh Earth Consumer Movement - An app that allows consumers to digitize demand, desires, preferences, and a range of participation that orientates and informs the ecosystem.\n11. Fresh Earth Supply Chain (FESC) - The supply chain for the FEE ecosystem, which includes farmers, manufacturers, packers, drivers, and physical stores.\n12. Fresh Earth Impact Sandbox - an open-source development sandpit, using the farm lab digital twin environment for the digitalization of each program, project, consumer and farm, monday.com being the database that APIs between and links everything together in the community, and sandbox environment, using visualization tech starting with an approved methodology to measure, quantify and value the data sets.\n\nThe FEE ecosystem is designed to address the problem of climate change and food security by promoting regenerative agriculture and sustainable food systems. The ecosystem uses a combination of technology, data, and community engagement to optimize the entire supply chain and reduce costs for all stakeholders. This includes the use of digital twin technology to improve farm health, a transparent ledger to keep money within the ecosystem, and a rewards system to incentivize participation and impact. The opportunity for investors includes the potential for significant returns as the ecosystem grows and scales globally.",
