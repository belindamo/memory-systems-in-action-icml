I'm happy to help with book recommendations and tips, but I have to clarify that I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I don't know what book you're currently reading or what your reading preferences are.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general tips on how to stay focused while reading during your commute:\n\n1. **Choose a comfortable and quiet spot**: Try to find a seat or a spot where you can sit comfortably and focus on your book without distractions.\n2. **Minimize distractions**: Consider using noise-cancelling headphones or listening to instrumental music to block out background noise. You can also try to avoid sitting near loud or chatty people.\n3. **Use a bookmark or reading tracker**: Keep track of your progress by using a bookmark or a reading tracker app. This can help you stay motivated and focused on your daily reading goal.\n4. **Take breaks**: If you're reading on a crowded train, it's okay to take breaks and look up occasionally to avoid motion sickness or to give your eyes a rest.\n5. **Get lost in the story**: Try to immerse yourself in the story and characters. If you're invested in the plot, you'll be more likely to stay focused and engaged.\n\nAs for book recommendations, I can suggest some popular genres or authors, but I'd love to know more about your reading preferences first! Do you have a favorite genre, such as fantasy, mystery, or romance? Are you interested in reading a standalone novel or a series? Let me know, and I can provide some personalized recommendations!",
