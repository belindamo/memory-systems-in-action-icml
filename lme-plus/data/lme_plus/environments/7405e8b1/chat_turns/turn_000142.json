  "content": "The 42-inch width might be a bit limiting for larger gaming consoles or multiple devices.\n\nWalker Edison does offer a wider version of the Modern Farmhouse Console Table, which might be a better fit for your needs. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Walker Edison Modern Farmhouse Console Table with 60\" Width**: This version has a wider surface area, measuring 60 inches (152 cm) in width, while maintaining the same depth and height as the original model. This should provide more space for your gaming console and other devices.\n2. **Walker Edison Rustic Wood Console Table with 64\" Width**: This console table has a similar design to the Modern Farmhouse model but with a more rustic wood finish. It measures 64 inches (163 cm) in width, 18 inches (46 cm) in depth, and 32 inches (81 cm) in height.\n3. **Walker Edison Modern Farmhouse Console Table with 72\" Width**: This is an even larger version of the console table, measuring 72 inches (183 cm) in width. It's ideal for those who need ample space for multiple devices, gaming consoles, and other media equipment.\n\nAll of these wider models have the same features as the original Modern Farmhouse Console Table, including adjustable shelves and cabinets with doors. However, keep in mind that the larger sizes may have slightly different interior dimensions and shelf configurations.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring other brands or models, I can certainly help with that as well. Just let me know what you're looking for (e.g., specific features, style, budget), and I can provide some recommendations!",
