The children are safe, and the village is forever in your debt. As promised, here is the Stormbringer, a weapon worthy of a warrior such as yourself. May it serve you well in your future endeavors.\"\n\nIf, unfortunately, you return unsuccessful in your quest, I would say:\n\n\"I am sorry, traveler. The loss of the village's children is a tragedy beyond words. You fought bravely, but it seems the mutants were too strong. I cannot reward you as promised, for the weapon was meant to be a token of gratitude for saving the children. However, perhaps there is another way you can make amends for your failure. The village still needs protection, and perhaps you can use your skills to aid them in some other way.\"",
