Cleaning the sensor on your Canon EOS 80D is a relatively straightforward process, but it does require some care and attention to detail to avoid damaging the camera or pushing the dust around. Here are some steps and tips to help you clean your sensor effectively:\n\n**Before you start:**\n\n1. **Turn off your camera**: Make sure your camera is turned off before attempting to clean the sensor.\n2. **Use a clean and dust-free environment**: Find a clean, dry, and dust-free area to clean your camera. Avoid cleaning your camera in a dusty or humid environment, as this can make the problem worse.\n\n**Method 1: Use the camera's built-in sensor cleaning mode**\n\n1. **Menu > Camera Settings > Sensor Cleaning**: Go to your camera's menu, navigate to the \"Camera Settings\" tab, and select \"Sensor Cleaning.\"\n2. **Select \"Clean Now\"**: Choose \"Clean Now\" to activate the camera's built-in sensor cleaning mode. The camera will vibrate the sensor to loosen any dust particles.\n3. **Wait for the process to complete**: The camera will take about 2-3 seconds to complete the cleaning process.\n\n**Method 2: Use a sensor cleaning kit**\n\nIf the built-in cleaning mode doesn't remove the dust spots, you can use a sensor cleaning kit specifically designed for your camera model. These kits usually include a soft brush, a cleaning solution, and a microfiber cloth.\n\n1. **Purchase a sensor cleaning kit**: Buy a cleaning kit specifically designed for your Canon EOS 80D.\n2. **Use the soft brush**: Gently sweep the soft brush across the sensor to remove any loose dust particles.\n3. **Apply the cleaning solution**: Place a few drops of the cleaning solution onto the microfiber cloth, and then gently wipe the sensor in a horizontal direction. **Do not touch the sensor with your bare hands or the cleaning solution.**\n4. **Use the microfiber cloth to wipe the sensor**: Wipe the sensor in a horizontal direction, starting from the top and working your way down. Repeat this process until the sensor is clean.\n5. **Inspect the sensor**: Use the camera's sensor cleaning mode or a magnifying loupe to inspect the sensor for any remaining dust spots.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* **Avoid touching the sensor**: The sensor is a delicate component, and touching it with your bare hands can cause oil from your skin to transfer to the sensor, making it harder to clean.\n* **Use a blower brush**: If you have a blower brush, use it to gently blow away any loose dust particles from the sensor before using a cleaning solution.\n* **Clean the camera's mirror and viewfinder**: Use a soft brush or a microfiber cloth to clean the camera's mirror and viewfinder to prevent dust from spreading to the sensor.\n* **Regularly clean your camera**: To prevent dust from accumulating on the sensor, regularly clean your camera and sensor every 1-2 months.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you should be able to clean your Canon EOS 80D's sensor effectively and remove those annoying dust spots from your photos. Happy shooting with your new 50mm f/1.8 prime lens!",
