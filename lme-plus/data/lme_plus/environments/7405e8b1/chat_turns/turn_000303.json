It's definitely worth checking out!\n\nHere are some tips to find potential promotions or discounts:\n\n1. **Check the UberEats app or website**: Look for the Italian restaurant's page on UberEats and see if they have any active promotions or deals listed.\n2. **Visit their social media pages**: Check the restaurant's social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) to see if they've posted any promotions, discounts, or special offers.\n3. **Sign up for their email newsletter**: If the restaurant has a website, sign up for their email newsletter to receive exclusive offers, promotions, or updates on new menu items.\n4. **Look for \"First Order\" discounts**: As a new restaurant on UberEats, they might offer a discount for first-time customers. Keep an eye out for these types of promotions.\n5. **Check for bundle deals or combos**: Italian restaurants often offer bundle deals or combos that include a pasta dish, salad, and bread. These can be a great way to save money and try more of their menu items.\n\nIf you don't find any promotions or discounts, you can always try contacting the restaurant directly to ask if they have any special offers available. They might be willing to provide a discount or promo code for your order.\n\nBuon appetito, and I hope you enjoy your Italian food!",
