Tries 20 Jobs | WIRED - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"I'm a lawyer copywriter Doctor music producer personal trainer software engineer DJ I want to know can AI do my job I'm a software engineer where I work we're always trying to know where can I find the best craft beer please generate the code for a website using HTML CSS and flask that tells me where there's craft beer near me this is just raw code you actually need to run the code somewhere I'm copying pasting the code into separate files and it generates a website how cool here's our website all three pieces the back end the front end and The Styling did actually make something that was human readable that that generates a website that we can look at and understand what it does does seem like a huge feat to me I'm a doctor this prompt is something that a patient might enter I have a fever rash and body aches the rash looks like small welds on my genitals do I have monkey pox the response is pretty solid in the sense that it's unlikely that you have monkey pox the specific thing I got right was that the monkey pox rash is actually not prominent on the genital area it goes on to say that a rash in the general area most likely is an STI the rest of the answer is just fluff talking to your healthcare provider which is pretty obvious can AI do my job I don't think it's there yet I think the AI right now is really good for a first year medical student I'm a graphic designer Rebrand the McDonald's logo as vegan I'm seeing four image variations it's struggling with text it's looking sort of like characters but in some sort of fictional language I wouldn't send any of these straight away to McDonald's they do each need a little bit of work the fourth one I think is maybe the strongest it's leaning towards more organic colors overall I don't think AI can do my job I kind of see this as a more evolved Pinterest I can use it as a base for inspiration but I don't think it will replace me all together or so I hope I'm a therapist people come to me when they want help in dating or relationships please answer the following question in a way a relationship therapist would why do I always fight with my partners conflicts are a natural part of any relationship fighting or arguing is not necessarily a sign of a bad relationship great some possible factors include communication issues stress and life events different conflict styles how do I know what my conflict style is reflect on your past conflicts observe your behavior during conflicts most people are incapable of reflecting on their conflict style during conflicts so while this is great information I'm not sure how actionable it is what AI has done is it's just dumped a bunch of information were I to be a client I would probably want my money back that's just me so can AI do my job I would say have self-help books done my job people don't lack knowledge they lack the ability to follow through I'm a stand-up comedian and I want to know if an AI can do my job write a 100 word minimum funny stand-up comedy joke let me go ahead and perform this and we'll see what we got online dating what a wild ride that is you know what they say swipe right for love and left for well probably just another cat person but hey at least it's better than meeting someone at a bar and realizing you have the same dad again like what side are you using ancestry.com that's a little creepy it has the Cadence right which is what's so fascinating to me and it's kind of creeping me out I did think it was cute when it was like oh swipe left on a cat person although let's be honest that's a little feline phobic I'm not concerned about the AI yet it could take a crappier comedian's job but it can't take mine I'm a lawyer my client is asking me whether or not they can sell someone's health information please write a legal memorandum about this in a true legal memorandum it would give you which sections of the regulation you're talking about which this is not doing it doesn't say what the penalties are is it criminal is it civil I don't really know where it's getting its information I don't know how much I can trust this if it were like a legal associate I would say go back and do a better job I'm a news anchor I want to know if AI can do my job I have given the AEI some text to read a forest fire has blazed through a large part of the Southern mountain region of the country she didn't sound natural he sounded like a machine speaking the lips look weird it looked like the lips did not belong to the face and provide Aid to those affected when I speak I'm moving my hands but I'm also moving some of my body she wasn't doing that I do a newscast in Spanish now let's see how it does with the Spanish newscast on incendio Forrestal ha effectado una Grand Park de la region it sucked in Spanish she actually threw in some Spanglish there miles to Hector is and the accent I have Casado she definitely struggled there the AI cannot take my job for now I'm a bartender surprise me with a Twist on a Negroni and give it a name fill a mixing glass with ice add the Gin Campari and sweet vermouth gently muddle two to three fresh Sage leaves in the glass stir the mixture until well chilled Express the orange peel over the drink release the oils and use it as a garnish there you go you have your Sage Negroni so it's a good classic Negroni I'm not really getting sage just adding the sage leaves was not very creative AI didn't ask me any follow-up questions I would say what do you like is there a style of gin that you like I think if you want to have a truly bespoke cocktail you gotta go see a bartender I'm a screenwriter I'm going to give this AI a prompt that describes a scene in my latest movie and to see how well it can match it in this scene set in 1949 three World War II widows toast their younger sister Ruby's wedding exterior Beach day Mildred Shirley and Charlotte Frolic at the shoreline of the beach and may you never have to experience the Heartbreak that we did the character literally says exactly what like you want the story to do what's going on Ruby seems tense I don't know but I'm going to find out just very on the nose dialogue there's a lot of parentheticals describing how the characters saying the Line This is a screenwriter no no you start to tip into the director's territory I think that AI can help with my my job in conceptual brainstorming playing out scene ideas if you get stuck on a scene but overall I don't think AI can do my job I'm a music producer I'm writing a song for a pop client please write this song and include chords for the guitar the client is heavily influenced by Lana Del Rey it looks like we've gotten a chord structure and some lyrics a typical progression so not too interesting but that's okay so let's make a beat when I work with an artist that's looking for a specific influence I'll think about the BPM that that artist usually goes for [Applause] okay this is pretty good it's a good start another great day in the city I'm feeling lost oh Such a Pity City Lights and heartbeats you walk in and make me complete I like that it's a starting point of course some of the lyrics are super corny I will admit a lot of the time that's how it starts for me right now these programs can't do my job I'm a journalist I'm the reviews editor at wired and I test products for a living so I asked chat gbt to write a review of a product that I've actually written about in the style of my own writing when it comes to electric skateboards there are plenty of options to choose from a little boring this is pulling in data specifically from my review and so it has a lot of similar characteristics and sentences that I might typically use unfortunately I think it's Stripped Away a lot of the personality in the original review it kind of just took a lot of the basic details and spit out this thing that is kind of generic as for things that did right it actually brought out a lot of these specs like the 3000 watt Motors the 26 miles per hour speeds when reading this review it almost sounds like I could have written it by just reading a press release the AI cannot physically handle this product it's not exactly testing the product itself at that point can you really trust where the source is coming from asking chat gbt to write a review based in my voice is definitely weird I'm a circus artist what would I ask the AI to do hmm I don't think there's anything that I can think of that I would have the AI do for me I'm a copywriter McDonald's just went 100 vegan write several taglines so we've got veganize your taste buds today feels like a used car salesman no animals harmed only flavor enhanced I don't ever go to a fast food restaurant and say I really want my flavor enhanced that's not something I'm ever looking for our last one here is wow very short we've got It's Time to Go Green did it run out of um words it typed up some general ideas which actually could help if you were brainstorming and you're like I have nothing at all AI could do my job at a very like a Monday morning no coffee kind of way if you wanted to pay no money and get a bad product sure hey I could do my job I'm a personal trainer please design a fat burning weekly at home workout plan this is definitely a typical plan that someone might want to burn calories with a full body workout you're also doing some type of pull workout that's going to work your back your posterior chain and you're also doing some kind of push so I will say that I like that that it's giving a full range of those types of exercises most people know what a push-up is but do they know how to correctly do a push-up it's saying three sets of eight to ten reps but how much time is in between each set ideally you would want to be able to see the client in person or on a virtual call so that you can see what their form looks like I don't think AI can do my job I'm a DJ I have my radio show coming up I play uplifting disco music for about two hours make a full playlist slash set list for my show it's hitting the Disco on the head for sure I've played a few of these artists on my show before so it's definitely getting pretty close to maybe what a tracklist would be one of these tracks Gotta Keep On by sweet cream I looked it up and there's no trace of it on the internet anywhere where did it get this song from does the song actually exist AI can make a playlist being able to look out into a room and look out into a dance floor and say okay people are tired let me match that energy I don't think that it can do that based on what I've seen I'm a voice actor shouldn't cost the Earth we've created a new line of compostable shoes that are made from sustainable materials I've asked the AI to read this copy let's hear this thing fashion shouldn't cost the Earth we've crew line of compostable hey but not great it's very computer-like it has a strange Cadence and so it ends every sentence like this sustainable which is not the way a human talks it can't change on the Fly is there a joke that I'm supposed to get in the next line it doesn't understand all those things the things that come from like life experiences it's never going to be like the thing that you're going to use for like McDonald's commercials it's going to be like the things that no one really likes to do anyway like 400 hours of instruction manuals or something like that can AI do my job kinda but not really well although it still freaks me out I'm an influencer and I want to know if AI can do my job I want chat gbt to help me with an IG caption that's a picture of me smiling standing at the top of my Matra in Paris Standing On Top of the World or at least on top of mamatra smiley face eyes the view from here is breathtaking the Sakura cord in my back reminding me of the city's Rich history and culture feeling grateful and inspired what a day it has been hashtag grateful this is like really strong but it doesn't necessarily capture how I would speak my audience would know that this is not me probably from the overwhelming amount of emojis I would probably say like hey y'all or like sis that was amazing this AI program cannot do my job but it's very close I'm a chef write a recipe for an Indian restaurant meal include a protein marination it's got definitely a lot of spices that you use in Indian cooking it's actually missing a key component it didn't include yogurt which kind of acts as a binding agent 400 Degrees 20 to 25 minutes for chicken it would probably dry it out overall I would say it's like a nice 8 out of 10 dish I do think a substantial part of being a chef is that creativity and coming up with dishes so in terms of that aspect of the job I think AI comes dangerously close to being able to do my job I'm a translator please translate the opening paragraph of The Sun Also Rises into Korean structural sentence pretty good but there are so many mistakes like if you see the second sentence this is wrong translation in Korean we have casual form and then also respectful form this AI translation use basic written form in first sentence but in the second sentence he used like respect for form it's not consistent AI cannot do my job maybe someday it can do it but so far it's like it made so many mistakes I'm a firefighter there's no way AI can do my job [Music]\""

      "content": "The video titled \"(2) A.I. Tries 20 Jobs | WIRED - YouTube\" shows a group of people from different professions questioning whether or not AI can do their job. Each person presents a task for AI to perform, and then AI attempts to complete the task. The tasks range from generating code for a craft beer website, answering medical questions, designing logos, providing relationship advice, writing jokes, creating a legal memorandum, reading news, and creating a new cocktail. While AI was able to complete some tasks successfully, such as generating code and answering medical questions, it struggled with others, such as creating a new cocktail and reading news. In conclusion, the people in the video are skeptical about AI replacing them in their respective professions."
