      "content": "It seems like the sales call started with some small talk about how the participants were feeling. Lizy Thomson mentioned that she and her family were still recovering from the flu and were dealing with the weather change. Stephen Donohoe asked if she was starting to improve or if the flu was hanging around. They also talked about how illnesses can keep going around in families and how Dubai has been experiencing a nasty viral that has evolved into a superbug. After the small talk, Stephen Donohoe mentioned that Curt Weaver, one of their solution engineers, was also on the call. Lizy Thomson expressed her excitement about what their company, Carry, has to offer, particularly the analytics and AI element, as well as the dashboards. Stephen Donohoe suggested diving into some of the details, specifically around the consumption piece, but also noted that they could keep the conversation pretty fluid."
