Banana: It is a rich source of magnesium and potassium, which can promote muscle relaxation and help with sleep. 4. Whole-grain toast: Eat a small slice of whole-grain toast with a tablespoon of almond butter to promote feelings of fullness, and the healthy fats in almond butter can aid sleep. 5. Low-fat cottage cheese with berries: Cottage cheese is a rich source of casein, a type of protein that can help prevent muscle breakdown during sleep. Adding berries can provide antioxidants that may also promote sleep. These snacks are light, nutritious, and won't leave you feeling too full or wired late at night. Remember that eating large, heavy meals or high-fat, sugary snacks before bedtime can interfere with sleep."
