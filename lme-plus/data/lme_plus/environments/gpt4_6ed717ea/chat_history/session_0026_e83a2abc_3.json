Additionally, I don't have the ability to know your location or the specific train route you take.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you plan your commute:\n\n1. Check the website or app of your local transit agency for train schedules and arrival times. You can usually find this information online or through a mobile app.\n2. Use a trip-planning tool or app like Google Maps or Transit to plan your route and get an estimate of the arrival time at your station.\n3. Consider setting up notifications or reminders on your phone to help you stay on track and avoid getting stuck in meetings that run late.\n\nRemember to also plan for any potential delays or disruptions that might affect your commute, and leave some buffer time in your schedule to account for any unexpected issues.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy commuting!"

I also don't know the specifics of your work environment or the tasks you need to complete.\n\nBut I can offer some general advice:\n\n* Take a quick assessment of your current tasks and prioritize them based on importance and urgency.\n* Make a rough estimate of how much time each task will take to complete.\n* Create a plan to tackle the most critical tasks first and allocate your time accordingly.\n* Consider delegating tasks or deferring non-essential work to free up time.\n* Stay focused and avoid distractions to maximize your productivity.\n\nIf you can wrap up your work efficiently and manage your time effectively, you might be able to leave the office by 5:15 pm. But remember to be realistic about what you can accomplish in the time you have left, and don't rush through critical tasks that require attention to detail.\n\nRemember, it's also important to take breaks and maintain a healthy work-life balance. If you're consistently finding it difficult to leave the office on time, it might be worth discussing your workload or workflow with your manager or team."
