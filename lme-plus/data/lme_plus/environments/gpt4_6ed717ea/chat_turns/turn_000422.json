Number of bedrooms (1-5)\n2. Square footage (500-5000 sqft)\n3. Distance to city center (0-10 miles)\n4. Age of the house (10-100 years)\n\nIn this case, the features have different units and scales:\n\n* Number of bedrooms is a small integer value\n* Square footage is a large numerical value\n* Distance to city center is a numerical value with a moderate range\n* Age of the house is a numerical value with a large range\n\n**Standardization (Z-scoring)**\n\nIf you standardize these features, you'll get:\n\n* Number of bedrooms: mean = 2.5, stddev = 1.2 -> standardized values will be around -1 to 2\n* Square footage: mean = 2000, stddev = 800 -> standardized values will be around -1 to 2\n* Distance to city center: mean = 3, stddev = 2 -> standardized values will be around -1 to 2\n* Age of the house: mean = 40, stddev = 20 -> standardized values will be around -1 to 2\n\nBy standardizing, you're reducing the effect of the large ranges in square footage and age of the house, which could dominate the model. This is particularly important in regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous value.\n\n**Normalization (Min-max scaling)**\n\nIf you normalize these features using min-max scaling, you'll get:\n\n* Number of bedrooms: 0 to 1 (e.g., 1 bedroom -> 0, 5 bedrooms -> 1)\n* Square footage: 0 to 1 (e.g., 500 sqft -> 0, 5000 sqft -> 1)\n* Distance to city center: 0 to 1 (e.g., 0 miles -> 0, 10 miles -> 1)\n* Age of the house: 0 to 1 (e.g., 10 years -> 0, 100 years -> 1)\n\nNormalization would rescale all features to the same range, which might not be desirable in this case. The large ranges in square footage and age of the house would still dominate the model, and the small range in number of bedrooms might get lost.\n\n**When to use standardization over normalization:**\n\nIn general, use standardization (Z-scoring) when:\n\n1. You have features with very different scales and units.\n2. You're working with regression problems or algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).\n3. You want to reduce the effect of features with large ranges on the model.\n\nUse normalization (min-max scaling) when:\n\n1. You have features with similar scales and units.\n2. You're working with classification problems or algorithms that are less sensitive to feature scales (e.g., decision trees, random forests).\n3. You want to rescale features to a specific range for interpretability or visualization purposes.\n\nRemember, the choice between standardization and normalization ultimately depends on the specific problem, dataset, and algorithm you're using.\n\nHope this example helps clarify things for you!",
