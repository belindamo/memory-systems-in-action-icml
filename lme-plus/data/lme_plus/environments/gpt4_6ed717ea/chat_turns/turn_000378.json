I was trained on a massive corpus of text data, which I use to generate responses to your questions and engage in conversation.\n\nMy training data includes a vast range of texts from the internet, books, articles, and other sources, which I can draw upon to provide information and answer questions. This training enables me to understand language, recognize patterns, and generate human-like responses.\n\nIn other words, I don't have personal opinions or experiences like humans do, and I don't have a \"reading list\" or favorite authors. My purpose is to assist and provide information to users like you, and I'm always happy to help with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss!",
