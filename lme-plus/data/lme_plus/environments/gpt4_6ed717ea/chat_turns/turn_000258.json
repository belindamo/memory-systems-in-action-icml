  "content": "While it is true that people have been looking at the Sun with their naked eyes since the dawn of humanity, it is important to note that this can cause permanent damage to the eyes. Many people who have looked at the sun without proper protection have experienced symptoms of vision loss, including blind spots and distorted vision. Solar glasses and filters are cheap and readily available during solar eclipses, making it easy to safely view the event. Moreover, trusting the knowledge of scientists is essential when it comes to understanding the physical world and the common dangers among it. The advice they provide is backed by research and scientific data, therefore disregarding them might put oneself at risk.",
