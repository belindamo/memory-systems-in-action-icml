Upgrading your brake fluid is a great idea, but let's break it down to ensure it's the right decision for your specific situation.\n\n**Brake fluid upgrade: To do or not to do?**\n\nUpgrading your brake fluid can provide benefits, but it's essential to understand the reasons behind it. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Boiling point**: If you're experiencing brake fade or spongy brake feel during extended heavy braking, a higher boiling point brake fluid might be beneficial. This can help maintain consistent brake performance, especially during intense driving.\n2. **Viscosity**: Thicker brake fluids can provide better lubrication and protection for your brake system, but they might also increase the pedal travel and make the brakes feel less responsive. Thinner fluids, on the other hand, can provide a more responsive pedal but might not offer the same level of protection.\n3. **Corrosion protection**: Some brake fluids offer better corrosion protection for your brake system, which can be important if you live in an area with high humidity or salty roads.\n4. **Compatibility**: Make sure the new brake fluid is compatible with your brake system, including the brake pads, rotors, and calipers.\n\n**When to upgrade your brake fluid**\n\nConsider upgrading your brake fluid if:\n\n* You're experiencing brake fade or inconsistent brake performance during heavy braking.\n* You've recently installed new brake pads or rotors and want to ensure optimal performance.\n* You're planning to track your car regularly and want to minimize the risk of brake failure.\n* You live in an area with extreme weather conditions (e.g., high temperatures, high humidity) that can affect brake fluid performance.\n\n**Before upgrading**\n\nBefore upgrading your brake fluid, ensure you've:\n\n* Bedded in your new brake pads properly to achieve optimal performance.\n* Adjusted your brake bias and pedal travel to your liking.\n* Checked your brake system for any leaks or issues that might be affecting performance.\n\nIf you've addressed these points and still feel that upgrading your brake fluid will improve your braking performance, then it might be a good idea to consider it. However, if you're not experiencing any issues with your current brake fluid, it might not be necessary.\n\nRemember, it's essential to follow proper brake fluid bleeding procedures and dispose of the old fluid responsibly when upgrading.\n\nHow do you feel about upgrading your brake fluid now?",
