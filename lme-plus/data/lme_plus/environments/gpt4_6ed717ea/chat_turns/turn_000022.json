For example, the city has implemented measures to limit tourist rental apartments, and some areas of the city have been declared car-free zones to reduce traffic and environmental impacts. The city has also launched campaigns to encourage tourists to respect local customs and be more mindful of their impact on the city and its residents.\n\nIn addition, initiatives like \"Greeters,\" a volunteer service that connects visitors with local residents who provide personalized tours of the city, aim to promote cultural exchange and give tourists a more authentic experience of Paris. The city also collaborates with tourism industry stakeholders to develop sustainable tourism practices and promote eco-friendly options such as cycling tours and public transportation.\n\nOverall, Paris is actively working to balance the benefits of tourism with the preservation of its cultural heritage and the well-being of its residents, while promoting sustainable tourism practices that benefit both visitors and locals.",
