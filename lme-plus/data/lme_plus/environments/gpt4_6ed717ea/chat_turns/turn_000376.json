Twenge\n\nJean M. Twenge is an American psychologist and author who has written extensively on the effects of technology and social media on mental health, particularly among young people. She's written several books on the topic, including \"iGen: Why Today's Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up More Slowly Than Ever\" and \"Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled\u2014and More Miserable Than Ever Before\".\n\nTwenge's article \"The Social Dilemma\" likely explores the darker aspects of social media, including its impact on mental health, relationships, and society as a whole. Given your interest in the topic, I'm not surprised it resonated with you!\n\nIf this is indeed the article you were thinking of, I'd be happy to help you find more of Twenge's work or provide information on similar authors and articles.
