  "content": "Yes, scientists are actively researching comets in other solar systems and their potential impact on planets and stars. As the technology for detecting exoplanets and their accompanying debris disks improves, it is becoming more feasible to study comets and other small bodies in other solar systems. \n\nFor example, in 2017, astronomers detected the first known interstellar object, called 'Oumuamua, passing through our solar system, which is believed to be a comet or an asteroid from another star system. The discoveries of other interstellar objects have been made since then, which has opened up new avenues of research and insights into the behavior of comets in other solar systems.\n\nScientists also use computer simulations and mathematical models to study the behavior of comets in other solar systems and predict their potential impact on planets and stars. These studies can help to inform future space missions and explore the potential role of comets in the formation and evolution of other planetary systems.",
