I've been reviewing my performance data from the last event, and I noticed I'm still losing time in the first sector of the track. After the event, I spent a few hours reviewing the data from my performance tracking device, and I'm thinking of getting a new rear spoiler to improve downforce. Do you have any thoughts on that?",
