  "content": "Hummingbirds are indeed more commonly seen in backyards, particularly those with nectar-rich flowers or feeders. While it's not impossible to spot hummingbirds at a wildlife refuge, they tend to prefer more urban or suburban areas with an abundance of flowers and feeders.\n\nIn a wildlife refuge, you're more likely to spot hummingbirds near areas with dense vegetation, such as shrubs or flowers, especially if there's a water source nearby. However, it's still a bit of a long shot, especially if the refuge doesn't have a specific hummingbird-friendly habitat.\n\nIf you're interested in spotting hummingbirds, you might want to focus on areas with native flowers, such as trumpet-shaped flowers like honeysuckle or fuchsia, or areas with hummingbird feeders (if the refuge has them). Ruby-throated Hummingbirds are the most common species in many parts of North America, so if you do spot one, it's likely to be that species.\n\nThat being said, don't get discouraged if you don't spot a hummingbird. The refuge has plenty of other fascinating birds to offer, and you might be surprised by the variety of species you can spot. Focus on enjoying the experience, and keep an eye out for those waterfowl and shorebirds you mentioned \u2013 they can be quite entertaining!\n\nRemember to bring your binoculars and field guide to help you identify any birds you spot, and don't hesitate to ask for help from refuge staff or more experienced birders if you need assistance. Have a great time at the refuge!",
