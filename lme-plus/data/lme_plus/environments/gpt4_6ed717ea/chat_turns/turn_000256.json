  "content": "It is possible that you may have looked at the Sun for a few seconds previously without any noticeable effects, but it is still not recommended as long-term damage can still occur. However, looking directly at the Sun during an eclipse is a lot more dangerous than looking at it on a regular day, as you may feel tempted to look for longer periods of time due to the unique and rare nature of the event. It only takes a very short period of time, even a few seconds, for the Sun's rays to permanently damage your eyesight. If you choose to view a solar eclipse without proper eye protection, you are putting yourself at serious risk of vision loss. It is recommended to use certified solar filters or glasses for safe viewing of a solar eclipse.",
