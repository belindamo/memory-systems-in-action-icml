As for the prize, I think I'll offer a feature on my account, where I'll share the winner's edited photo and give them a shoutout to my audience. This will not only incentivize people to participate but also help the winner gain more visibility. Additionally, I'll provide a gift card to a photography store as a secondary prize. \n\nNow, I want to ask, can you suggest some ways to promote my \"Edit This Photo\" Challenge to reach a wider audience?",
