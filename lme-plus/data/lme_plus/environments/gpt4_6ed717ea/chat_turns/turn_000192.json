Virtual reality social anxiety treatment: This program, developed by Virtually Better, provides exposure-based treatment for social anxiety disorder using virtual reality. In the program, patients are exposed to virtual environments designed to simulate common social situations, such as parties, job interviews, and public speaking engagements.\n\n2. Project Brave: This program, developed by Oxford University and funded by the National Institute for Health Research, uses virtual reality to provide cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder. In the program, patients work with a therapist to identify negative thinking patterns and learn new strategies for managing anxiety, while also using virtual reality exposure therapy to gradually confront feared social situations.\n\n3. VR-CALM: This program, developed by the University of Southern California, uses virtual reality technology to deliver an abbreviated form of cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder. The program provides patients with exposure to virtual environments designed to simulate social situations, while also using biofeedback techniques to help patients learn to manage their anxiety and stress.\n\n4. SPARX: This program, developed by the University of Auckland, is not specifically designed for social anxiety disorder but has been shown to be effective for a range of mental health conditions, including anxiety. SPARX uses a virtual reality game format to deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy. Players work through a series of challenges that help them learn new coping skills and manage their symptoms of anxiety.\n\nThese are just a few examples of virtual reality therapy programs that have been used to treat social anxiety disorder. There are many other programs out there, and the specific methods used may vary depending on the needs and preferences of the patient.",
