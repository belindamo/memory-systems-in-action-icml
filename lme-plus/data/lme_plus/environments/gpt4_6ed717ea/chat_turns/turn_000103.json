  "content": "That's really helpful! I've been experimenting with different ratios of matte and glossy glazes, but I haven't been paying attention to the viscosity of the glaze. I'll definitely try adjusting the viscosity to see if that makes a difference. I've also been thinking about layering glazes, but I'm not sure how to get a smooth transition between the two. Do you have any tips on how to achieve a seamless transition between a matte and glossy glaze?",
