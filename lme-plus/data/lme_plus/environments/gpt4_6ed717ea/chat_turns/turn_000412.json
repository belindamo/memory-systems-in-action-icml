But, as you've learned, it's often the case that we wear a select few items repeatedly, and the rest just take up valuable space in our luggage.\n\nPacking 7 tops for a 5-day trip is definitely on the high side, but it's a great learning experience! Now, you know that you can get by with fewer options and still have a great time.\n\nFor your upcoming trip to Colorado, try to aim for 3-4 tops that can be mixed and matched with your bottoms and dressed up or down. Remember, you can always do a quick wash or spot clean if needed, or even purchase a new top if you feel like you need a change of pace.\n\nIt's also helpful to think about the activities you have planned and the dress code for each occasion. For example, if you have a nicer dinner planned, you might want to pack one dressier top. But for casual days, a few comfortable, versatile tops should suffice.\n\nLastly, don't forget to consider the 80/20 rule: 80% of the time, you likely wear 20% of your clothes. So, pack the items that you know you love and wear frequently, and leave the rest behind.\n\nDo you have any other packing conundrums or questions? I'm here to help!",
