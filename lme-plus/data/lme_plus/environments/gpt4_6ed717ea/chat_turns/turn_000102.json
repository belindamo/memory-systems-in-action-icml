It's great that you're experimenting with different ratios of matte and glossy glazes. Here are some tips to help you achieve a harmonious balance between the two:\n\n1. **Understand the basics of matte and glossy glazes**: Matte glazes typically have a high silica content, which absorbs light and creates a flat, non-reflective surface. Glossy glazes, on the other hand, have a high alumina content, which creates a smooth, reflective surface. Understanding the chemical makeup of each type of glaze will help you make informed decisions when combining them.\n2. **Start with a solid understanding of your base glaze**: Before combining matte and glossy glazes, make sure you have a solid understanding of your base glaze's characteristics, including its color, opacity, and surface texture. This will help you predict how the addition of matte or glossy components will affect the final result.\n3. **Experiment with small batches**: When combining matte and glossy glazes, it's essential to test small batches to ensure the desired effect. Start with a small amount of each glaze and mix them in different ratios to observe the results.\n4. **Use a consistent mixing ratio**: To achieve consistency, use a consistent mixing ratio for your matte and glossy glazes. For example, you might start with a 50/50 ratio and adjust from there. This will help you develop a sense of how the glazes interact with each other.\n5. **Consider the application method**: The way you apply the glaze can affect the final result. Brushing or pouring the glaze can create different effects, so experiment with different application methods to achieve the desired balance of matte and glossy finishes.\n6. **Pay attention to the glaze's viscosity**: The viscosity of your glaze can affect how the matte and glossy components interact. If the glaze is too thick, the matte component may dominate, while a thinner glaze may allow the glossy component to shine through.\n7. **Test, test, test**: Glaze testing is crucial when combining matte and glossy glazes. Fire multiple test tiles with different ratios of matte and glossy glazes to observe the results and refine your approach.\n8. **Consider layering glazes**: Instead of mixing matte and glossy glazes, you can try layering them. Apply a matte glaze as a base coat and then add a glossy glaze on top. This can create a beautiful, nuanced effect.\n9. **Be patient and persistent**: Achieving a harmonious balance of matte and glossy finishes takes time and experimentation. Don't be discouraged if it takes several attempts to get the result you want.\n10. **Keep a glaze journal**: Keeping a journal of your glaze experiments can help you track your progress, note what works and what doesn't, and refine your approach over time.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to achieving a stunning combination of matte and glossy finishes in your glaze. Remember to stay patient, persistent, and open to experimentation, and you'll eventually find the perfect balance for your work.",
