  "content": "Yes, the Clock Tower has certainly stood the test of time! As I mentioned earlier, it has undergone several renovations and restorations over the centuries. Here are some of the notable changes that have been made to the tower:\n\n- In the 1400s, the tower was given a new roof, which replaced the original wooden roof that had been damaged by a fire.\n- In the late 1400s and early 1500s, various mechanical features were added to the tower's clock, including a second, more precise clock face and an astrolabe (an instrument for measuring the positions of stars and planets).\n- In the early 1900s, the entire tower underwent a major renovation that included the addition of a new bell, a new clock mechanism, and a new lighting system.\n\nToday, the Clock Tower remains one of the most iconic landmarks in Berne and a popular tourist attraction.",
