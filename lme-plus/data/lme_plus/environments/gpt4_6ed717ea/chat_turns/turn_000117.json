  "content": "I think providing a theme or specific editing style could be a good idea, as it would give participants a clear direction and focus. However, I also want to leave some room for creativity and experimentation. Perhaps I could provide a general theme or style, and then allow participants to interpret it in their own way.\n\nFor example, I could provide a theme like \"summer vibes\" or \"urban landscapes,\" and then ask participants to create an edit that captures the essence of that theme. This would give them a starting point, but still allow them to express their own creativity and style.\n\nAdditionally, I think I'll provide some general guidelines and tips on editing, such as using specific software or techniques, to help participants get started. But I'll also make it clear that they're free to experiment and try out new things.\n\nWhat do you think? Does that sound like a good approach?\n\nAlso, I want to ask, how can I make sure that the challenge is fair and that the winner is chosen",
