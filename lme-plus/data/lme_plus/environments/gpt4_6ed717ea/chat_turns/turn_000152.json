Orthopedic Memory Foam dog beds can make a big difference in providing comfort and support for dogs with joint issues.\n\nFor a new chew toy, I'd recommend considering a durable, long-lasting option that's designed for aggressive chewers like Max. Here are a few options that might interest you:\n\n1. **Kong Toy**: Kong Toys are a classic choice for dogs who love to chew. They're made from durable rubber and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. You can fill the Kong with treats, peanut butter, or even canned dog food to keep Max occupied and stimulated.\n2. **GoughNuts**: GoughNuts are a popular choice among dog owners because they're virtually indestructible. They're made from a tough, rubber-like material that can withstand even the most aggressive chewers. They come in a range of sizes and shapes, and some even have a treat-dispensing feature.\n3. **Nylabone DuraChew**: Nylabone DuraChew toys are designed for aggressive chewers like Max. They're made from a tough, rubber-like material that's resistant to chewing and durable enough to last for a while. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and some even have a flavor or scent to keep Max interested.\n4. **West Paw Design Toys**: West Paw Design Toys are made from a non-toxic material called Zogoflex, which is gentle on teeth and gums. They're durable, long-lasting, and come in a range of shapes and sizes. Some even have a treat-dispensing feature or a squeaker to keep Max engaged.\n\nWhen choosing a new chew toy for Max, make sure to consider the following factors:\n\n* Durability: Look for toys made from tough, rubber-like materials that can withstand aggressive chewing.\n* Size: Choose a toy that's appropriate for Max's size and jaw strength.\n* Texture: Consider toys with varying textures to keep Max interested and stimulated.\n* Treat-dispensing: If Max enjoys problem-solving, consider toys with treat-dispensing features to keep him engaged.\n* Safety: Always supervise Max when introducing new toys, and choose toys that are safe and non-toxic.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect chew toy for Max!",
