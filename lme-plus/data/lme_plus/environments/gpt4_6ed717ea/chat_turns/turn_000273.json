I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation and see if you had a chance to watch the demo video that I sent over. As a reminder, our AI-powered platform can help you find decision-makers and increase your pipeline by creating fully validated contact lists with less than a 1% bounce rate.\n\nI understand you might have some questions and doubts about how our tool can help your business, That's why I want to schedule a full demo so you can see Lasso in action and understand how it can help you increase your pipeline and find the decision-makers you're missing at companies like Walmart, Nike, Home Depot, and small to midsized transportation carriers.\n\nJust like a good bottle of wine, our demo gets better with age. So, let's not let it go to waste, shall we? Let me know what your schedule looks like, and I'll work with you to schedule a time that works for you.\n\nBest,\nMarie",
