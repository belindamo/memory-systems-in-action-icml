  "content": "I think I'll go with an asymmetrical layout to add more visual interest. I like the idea of creating a visual triangle and playing with scale to create contrast. I'll also make sure to leave some negative space to avoid clutter. Since it's a kids' art gallery wall, I'll keep it low and accessible, so my daughter can easily view and interact with her artwork. And, of course, I'll involve her in the arrangement process - it'll be a fun activity for us to do together! Now, I'm curious - how can I make the gallery wall more interactive? Any ideas?",
