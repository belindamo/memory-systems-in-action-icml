  "content": "I actually learned about standardization and normalization in a 2-day workshop I attended on the 17th and 18th of April, but I'm still a bit unclear on when to use each. The workshop covered a lot of topics, including supervised learning and deep learning, but I didn't get a chance to ask about this specific question. Can you give me an example of when you would use standardization over normalization?",
