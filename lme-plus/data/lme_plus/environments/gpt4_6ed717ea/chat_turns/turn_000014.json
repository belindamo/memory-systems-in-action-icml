That's a great start to your birding journey!\n\nThe wildlife refuge is an excellent place to spot new species, especially since it's a mix of wetlands and forests. With the variety of habitats, you'll have a good chance of adding some new birds to your life list.\n\nConsidering you're relatively new to birding, it's likely that you'll spot some species that you haven't seen before. Even if you've visited the refuge before, the bird populations can change with the seasons, so you might spot some migrants or wintering birds that you haven't seen before.\n\nTo increase your chances of spotting new species, make sure to:\n\n1. Keep an eye out for birds in different habitats: Wetlands, forests, and edges between habitats can attract different species.\n2. Look for birds at different times of day: Some birds are more active during early morning or late afternoon, while others are more active during the middle of the day.\n3. Listen for bird calls: Pay attention to unusual sounds or calls that you haven't heard before. This can help you identify species you might not have seen before.\n4. Take your time and be patient: Don't rush through the refuge. Take your time to observe and listen, and you might be rewarded with new sightings.\n\nGiven the time of year and the refuge's habitat, you might spot some species that are new to your list. Some possibilities could include:\n\n* Waterfowl like Wood Ducks, American Golden-Plovers, or Greater Yellowlegs\n* Songbirds like Yellow-rumped Warblers, American Goldfinches, or Common Yellowthroats\n* Sparrows like Chipping Sparrows, Clay-colored Sparrows, or American Tree Sparrows\n* Raptors like Bald Eagles, Osprey, or Cooper's Hawks\n\nRemember to update your birding journal with any new sightings, and don't hesitate to ask for help from more experienced birders or refuge staff if you need assistance with identification.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you have a fantastic time at the refuge!",
