That's a great idea!\n\nSince you know you need to leave the office by 5:15 pm to catch your train, it's a good idea to work backward from that time to ensure you have enough time to wrap up your work. Try to prioritize your tasks, focus on the most important ones, and make a conscious effort to stay on track.\n\nRemember to also factor in any potential distractions or interruptions that might come up, such as unexpected meetings or emails that require your attention. Building in a bit of buffer time can help you stay on schedule.\n\nBy being mindful of the time and managing your tasks effectively, you should be able to leave the office on time and catch your train. Good luck, and I hope you have a smooth commute home!",
