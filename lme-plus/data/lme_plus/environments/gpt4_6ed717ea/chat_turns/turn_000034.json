Here are some additional tips to help you tackle those days with ease:\n\n**Sunday Night Prep**\n\n1. **Prepare everything the night before**: Double-check that you have all the necessary materials, documents, and equipment for your meetings.

This can help increase oxygen flow to your brain and wake you up.\n\n**Mindset Shift**\n\n1. **Reframe your thinking**: Instead of dreading Mondays and Tuesdays, try to view them as opportunities to tackle important tasks and set yourself up for success.\n2. **Focus on the benefits**: Remind yourself of the benefits of having early morning meetings, such as getting a head start on your day or having more time for other activities later.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Get enough sleep**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep on Sunday and Monday nights to ensure you're well-rested for your early morning meetings.\n2. **Use technology to your advantage**: Set reminders, use apps like Alarmy or Habitica, and take advantage of other tools to help you stay on track and motivated.\n3. **Reward yourself**: Treat yourself to something you enjoy after your meeting, such as a favorite coffee drink or a short break from work.\n\nBy incorporating these tips into your routine, you'll be better equipped to tackle Mondays and Tuesdays with confidence and energy.
