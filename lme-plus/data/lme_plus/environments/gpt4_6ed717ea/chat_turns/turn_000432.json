  "content": "Comets passing through other solar systems may have a higher chance of colliding with a planet or a star than in our solar system, but the likelihood largely depends on various factors such as the size and mass of the star and any planets in its system, the distance between them and the trajectory of the comet. In some cases, comets could be captured by a planet's gravity and become a new moon or crash into the planet's surface. In other cases, comets could collide with the star, which can produce bright flares or even cause the star to go supernova. However, since we have a limited understanding of the properties of comets in other solar systems and the dynamics of their orbits, it is difficult to determine if comets passing through other solar systems have a higher chance of colliding with a planet or a star compared to comets in our solar system.",
