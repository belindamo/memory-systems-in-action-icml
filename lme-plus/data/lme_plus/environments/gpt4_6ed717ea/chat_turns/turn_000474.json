  "content": "I do not have information on specific restaurants on pulau kapas, but there are some dining options available on the island. some of the resorts on the island offer their own restaurants where you can enjoy delicious local and international cuisines. apart from that, there are also small local eateries that sell dishes such as seafood, barbecues, and snacks. since it's only a day trip, i recommend bringing some snacks and drinks with you to ensure that you have some food available if there are no restaurants or cafes that meet your requirements. additionally, it is always good to carry reusable water bottles and refill them from fresh water sources on the island to reduce plastic waste.",
