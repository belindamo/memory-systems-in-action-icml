  "content": "Virtual reality therapy has shown comparable effectiveness to traditional therapy for social anxiety disorder. A study published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2018 found that virtual reality therapy was just as effective as traditional exposure therapy in the reduction of symptoms of social anxiety disorder.\n\nVirtual reality therapy has also been found to be more effective than traditional therapy in certain cases. A study published in Behaviour Research and Therapy in 2020 found that virtual reality exposure therapy was more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing symptoms of social anxiety in a sample of university students.\n\nOverall, the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy for social anxiety disorder seems to be comparable to traditional therapy, with the added benefits of being customizable, accessible, and cost-effective. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of virtual reality therapy for social anxiety disorder compared to traditional therapy.",
