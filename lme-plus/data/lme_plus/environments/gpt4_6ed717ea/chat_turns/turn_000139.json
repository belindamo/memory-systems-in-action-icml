But yeah, at the end of the day, it's the thought that counts, and I'm just happy to have such a beautiful piece of jewelry from my boyfriend. Thanks for the tips! By the way, can you recommend some good fashion bloggers or influencers who focus on affordable fashion, like H&M and Zara? I'd love to get some inspiration for my everyday style.",
