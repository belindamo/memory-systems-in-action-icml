In case they did, allow me to remind you of the awesomeness that is Lasso, our AI-powered tool that can help you find those hard-to-reach decision-makers at smaller transportation companies like XYZ and ABC.\n\nSpeaking of which, have you had a chance to check out the demo video I sent over? If so, I'd love to schedule a call to chat more in-depth about how Lasso can help your team drive conversions and procures leads for your specific industry. Let me know if that works for you!\n\nBest,\nMarie\"",
