Having appraisals for all three items will help you:\n\n1. **Determine their individual values**: Each item has its own value, and an appraisal will help you understand how much each item is worth.\n2. **Get accurate insurance coverage**: With appraisals, you can insure each item for its actual value, ensuring you're not under- or over-insuring them.\n3. **Create a comprehensive insurance portfolio**: By insuring all three items, you can create a comprehensive insurance portfolio that protects your valuable possessions.\n\nHowever, if you need to prioritize, you could start with the necklace, as it's likely the most valuable item. Once you have the appraisal report for the necklace, you can:\n\n1. **Shop for insurance**: Use the appraisal report to shop for insurance companies that specialize in insuring high-value jewelry.\n2. **Get a policy in place**: Secure a policy for the necklace, and then focus on appraising and insuring the music box and glassware.\n\nFor the music box and glassware, you may want to consider the following:\n\n1. **Antique music box**: If the music box is a rare or unique piece, it may require a specialized appraiser who focuses on antique mechanical devices or musical instruments.\n2. **Depression-era glassware**: The glassware's value may depend on factors like its rarity, condition, and provenance. You may need an appraiser who specializes in antique glassware or ceramics.\n\nWhen selecting an appraiser for these items, look for professionals who have experience with similar objects and can provide detailed, well-researched reports.\n\nRemember to keep all appraisal reports and insurance policies organized and easily accessible, in case you need to file a claim or update your coverage in the future.",
