  "content": "Healthy chews can be a wonderful way to support Max's dental health and satisfy his natural urge to chew. Since Max is a golden retriever and an adult dog, I'll recommend some healthy chews that are suitable for his age and breed. Please keep in mind that it's always best to consult with your veterinarian before introducing new chews, especially if Max has any health issues or allergies.\n\nHere are some healthy chew options for Max:\n\n1. **Bully Sticks**: Made from high-quality protein sources like beef, chicken, or lamb, Bully Sticks are a great option for adult dogs like Max. They're durable, long-lasting, and can help reduce tartar and plaque.\n2. **Antlers**: Antlers are a natural, long-lasting chew option that can help support Max's dental health. They're rich in minerals like calcium and phosphorus, and can help reduce anxiety and boredom.\n3. **Nylabone DuraChew**: Nylabone DuraChew is a durable, long-lasting chew designed for adult dogs. They're made from tough, rubber-like material that can withstand Max's chewing, and they come in a variety of flavors and textures.\n4. **GoughNuts**: GoughNuts are a popular choice among dog owners, and for good reason. They're made from tough, rubber-like material that can withstand aggressive chewing, and they come in a range of sizes and flavors.\n5. **West Paw Design Chews**: West Paw Design Chews are made from a non-toxic material called Zogoflex, which is gentle on Max's teeth and gums. They're durable, long-lasting, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.\n\nWhen selecting chews for Max, make sure to choose ones that are:\n\n* Appropriate for his age and breed\n* Made from healthy, non-toxic ingredients\n* Durable and long-lasting to reduce the risk of choking hazards\n* Suitable for his dental health and chewing style\n\nRemember to always supervise Max when introducing new chews, and to choose chews that are the right size for his mouth and jaw. You can also rotate chews every few days to keep things interesting and prevent boredom.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure Max will appreciate the new chews!",
