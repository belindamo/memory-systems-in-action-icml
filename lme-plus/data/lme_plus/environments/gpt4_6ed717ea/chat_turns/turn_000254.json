  "content": "I cannot have opinions or beliefs, but i can provide you scientific facts. looking directly at the sun, even during an eclipse, can cause permanent eye damage. the sun's uv radiation, which is invisible to the naked eye, can make the retina burn and cause solar retinopathy. symptoms of solar retinopathy are blurred vision, blind spots or distorted vision - which can occur within hours, days or even weeks after exposure. the best way to safely view a solar eclipse is to use specially designed solar filters or glasses, or indirectly through a pinhole projector.",
