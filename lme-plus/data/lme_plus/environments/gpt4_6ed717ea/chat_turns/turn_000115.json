Additionally, I'll collaborate with a few photography influencers in my niche to help promote the challenge and participate in it themselves.\n\nI also want to reach out to some online photography communities and forums to share the challenge and encourage their members to participate. I'll make sure to provide clear instructions and rules for the challenge, as well as showcase the prizes and benefits of participating.\n\nI'll also consider running a paid ad on Instagram or Facebook to drive traffic to the challenge and reach a wider audience.\n\nOne more thing, I want to ask, how can I make the challenge more engaging and interactive? Should I provide a theme or specific editing style for the challenge, or leave it completely open to the participants' creativity?\n",
