  "content": "Sleep tracking is a fantastic feature to have in a fitness tracker. Among the options I mentioned earlier, here are the ones that track sleep stages, including light, deep, and REM sleep:\n\n1. **Fitbit Inspire**: Yes, the Fitbit Inspire tracks sleep stages, including light, deep, and REM sleep. It also provides a sleep score, sleep duration, and time spent in each stage.\n2. **Fitbit Flex 2**: Although it's an older model, the Fitbit Flex 2 also tracks sleep stages, including light, deep, and REM sleep.\n3. **Samsung Galaxy Fit**: The Samsung Galaxy Fit tracks sleep stages, including light, deep, and REM sleep, as well as provides a sleep score and sleep duration.\n\nThe other options I mentioned earlier, such as the Xiaomi Mi Band 4 and Amazfit Bip, do track sleep, but they don't provide detailed sleep stage tracking like light, deep, and REM sleep.\n\nIf sleep stage tracking is a top priority for you, I'd recommend the Fitbit Inspire or Samsung Galaxy Fit. Both of these devices are well-known for their accurate sleep tracking and provide valuable insights into your sleep patterns.\n\nKeep in mind that sleep tracking accuracy can vary depending on individual factors, such as sleep position, movement, and personal sleep patterns. However, these devices have received positive reviews for their sleep tracking capabilities.",
