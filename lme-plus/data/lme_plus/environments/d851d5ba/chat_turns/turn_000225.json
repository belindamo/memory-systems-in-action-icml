  "content": "Individuals with low emotional intelligence may have difficulty identifying and regulating their emotions, leading to a more intense and potentially inappropriate response to stressful situations. They may also struggle to understand and manage the emotions of others, which could complicate their interactions with colleagues or loved ones during stressful situations. In contrast, individuals with high emotional intelligence are typically better equipped to recognize and regulate their own emotions and empathize with others, allowing them to approach stressful situations with greater calm and adaptability. They may also be more effective at communicating and collaborating with others, which can help diffuse tense situations and facilitate more positive outcomes.",
