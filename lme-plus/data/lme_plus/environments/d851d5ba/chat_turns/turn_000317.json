  "content": "What a fantastic idea! Adding nuts to your shortbread crust is a great way to add texture, flavor, and depth to your lemon bars. Walnuts or pecans would be an excellent choice, as they pair beautifully with the brightness of the lemon and the butteriness of the shortbread.\n\nWhen adding nuts to your shortbread crust, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n1. **Choose the right nuts**: Walnuts or pecans are great choices, but you can also experiment with other nuts like hazelnuts, almonds, or even pistachios. Each nut will bring a unique flavor and texture to your shortbread.\n2. **Toast the nuts**: Toasting the nuts before adding them to the shortbread dough will bring out their flavor and texture. Simply spread the nuts on a baking sheet and toast them in a 350\u00b0F oven for 5-7 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned.\n3. **Chop the nuts finely**: Chop the nuts finely so they're evenly distributed throughout the shortbread dough. You can use a food processor or a knife to chop the nuts.\n4. **Don't overdo it**: Start with a small amount of nuts (about 1/4 cup) and adjust to taste. You can always add more nuts, but it's harder to remove them once they're incorporated into the dough.\n\nAdding nuts to your shortbread crust will also complement the walnuts you added to your banana bread nicely. It's great that you're experimenting with different ingredients and finding what works best for you!\n\nNow, go ahead and get creative with your lemon bars and shortbread crust. I'm excited to hear how they turn out!",
