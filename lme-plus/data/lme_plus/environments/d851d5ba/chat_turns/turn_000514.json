  "content": "Yes, Lokys is a great place to try traditional Lithuanian food. It's one of the oldest and most famous restaurants in Vilnius, with a history dating back to the 15th century. The restaurant specializes in game meat dishes, such as bear or wild boar, but also offers other traditional Lithuanian dishes, such as cepelinas (potato dumplings with meat filling) or kugelis (potato pudding). The restaurant has a medieval atmosphere and unique decor, with seating available in the vaulted cellar, main hall or courtyard. However, it's important to note that Lokys is a bit pricey, so it may not be the best option if you're on a tight budget.",
