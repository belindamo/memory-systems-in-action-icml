I think it's a good idea to share some general metrics, such as the number of likes and comments you've received on your posts, as well as any increases in engagement or followers you've seen over time. Just be sure to present the information in a clear and concise manner, and focus on the lessons you've learned from your analytics rather than just sharing the numbers themselves.",
