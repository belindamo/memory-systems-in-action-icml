Musicals that explore themes of human connection and empathy are truly powerful and can have a profound impact on audiences.\n\nHere are some musical recommendations that delve into the importance of human connection and the impact we can have on each other's lives:\n\n1. **The Band's Visit**: This Tony Award-winning musical, written by David Yazbek, tells the story of an Egyptian police band's visit to Israel and their interactions with the local residents. It's a poignant exploration of human connection, cultural differences, and the power of music to bring people together.\n2. **Come From Away**: Based on a true story, this musical, written by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, tells the story of a small town in Newfoundland that welcomes in stranded air passengers after 9/11. It's a heartwarming exploration of kindness, generosity, and the human spirit.\n3. **In the Heights**: Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical, set in Washington Heights, explores the lives of Latinx immigrants and their struggles to build a better life in America. It's a vibrant celebration of community, identity, and the power of human connection.\n4. **The Light in the Piazza**: This musical, written by Adam Guettel, tells the story of a mother-daughter relationship and their journey to find love, acceptance, and connection in 1950s Florence. It's a beautiful exploration of the complexities of human relationships and the power of empathy.\n5. **Next to Normal**: This Pulitzer Prize-winning musical, written by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, explores the struggles of a family dealing with mental health issues and the importance of human connection in the face of adversity.\n6. **If/Then**: This musical, written by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, follows the story of a woman who moves to New York City and explores the possibilities of her life through a series of choices and chance encounters. It's a thought-provoking exploration of human connection, identity, and the power of relationships.\n7. **The Humans**: This musical, written by Stephen Karam, tells the story of a family gathering on Thanksgiving and explores the complexities of human relationships, love, and connection. It's a poignant and thought-provoking exploration of the human experience.\n\nThese musicals all share a common thread of exploring the importance of human connection and empathy, and I think you'll find them resonating with the themes of Dear Evan Hansen.\n\nYou can find these musicals on various streaming platforms, such as BroadwayHD, Amazon Prime Video, or YouTube, or purchase them through digital stores like iTunes or Google Play.
