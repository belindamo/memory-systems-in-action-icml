I'm curious to see how their algorithms will suggest new podcasts based on my listening history and preferences. I'll also take a look at Anchor and Breaker to see what they have to offer.\n\nBy the way, do you think it's possible to discover new podcasts through social media or online communities? I've noticed that some podcasters often share their favorite podcasts on Twitter or Instagram, and I've stumbled upon some great shows that way.",
