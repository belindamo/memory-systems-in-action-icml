He is often depicted carrying a staff with two intertwined snakes, known as the caduceus, which is a symbol of his role as a messenger and guide. Another god associated with art and images is Apollo, who is the god of the sun, music, poetry, and prophecy. He is often depicted playing a lyre, which is a stringed musical instrument, and is considered to be the patron of the arts.",
