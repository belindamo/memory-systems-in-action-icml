Here are a few additional strategies you can use to reduce stress and manage your workload more effectively:\n\n1.

Being honest about your struggles can help you get the support you need.\n\n3. Practice time management: Managing your time effectively can help you stay organized and reduce stress. Start by setting clear goals, breaking down projects into smaller tasks, and using tools like calendars and to-do lists to stay on track.\n\n4. Take advantage of resources: Many workplaces offer resources like employee assistance programs, counseling services, and stress management workshops. Take advantage of these resources to help manage your stress.\n\n5. Identify and address the root cause of stress: Take a step back and identify the root cause of your stress.
