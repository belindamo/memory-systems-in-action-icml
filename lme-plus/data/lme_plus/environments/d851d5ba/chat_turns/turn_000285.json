Since you're planning ahead, you have a good chance of finding a good deal.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some general trends and tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Airline prices tend to increase as the flight approaches**, so booking in advance (like you're doing) can help you snag a better deal.\n2. **April is considered part of the shoulder season** for Miami travel, which means prices might be slightly lower compared to peak season (December to March).\n3. **Weekend flights (Friday to Sunday) tend to be more expensive** than weekday flights. If you have flexibility in your travel dates, consider flying on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.\n4. **Miami is a popular destination**, so it's essential to book your ticket as soon as possible to ensure availability, especially if you're using credit card points.\n\nTo find the best deal, I recommend:\n\n1. **Check your credit card points portal** or loyalty program to see the available redemption options and prices.\n2. **Compare prices across airlines** using online travel agencies like Expedia, Kayak, or Skyscanner to get an idea of the going rate for your travel dates.\n3. **Set up price alerts** on your preferred airline or travel booking website to notify you when prices drop.\n4. **Consider alternative airports**, if possible. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) is about 30 miles north of Miami and might offer better deals or more convenient flights.\n\nGiven your experience with American Airlines, you might want to check their prices and availability first. However, don't hesitate to explore other airlines, like Delta, JetBlue, or United, to find the best deal for your needs.\n\nKeep in mind that prices can fluctuate, so it's essential to monitor them regularly and be prepared to book quickly when you find a good deal.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy travels to Miami!",
