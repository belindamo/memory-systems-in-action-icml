Since we're currently in the offseason, there haven't been any recent Yankees vs. Red Sox games.\n\nBut I'd be happy to provide you with an update on the Yankees' current standing and notable player performances from the 2022 season!\n\nThe New York Yankees finished the 2022 season with a 99-63 record, winning the American League East division title. They eventually lost to the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series (ALCS).\n\nAs for notable player performances, the Yankees had several standout players in 2022. Aaron Judge had an incredible season, winning the American League MVP award after hitting 62 home runs and driving in 131 runs. Other key contributors included Giancarlo Stanton, Gleyber Torres, and DJ LeMahieu.\n\nOn the pitching side, the Yankees' ace Gerrit Cole had a strong season, earning an All-Star selection and finishing with a 13-8 record and a 3.50 ERA. The bullpen was also a strength, with closer Clay Holmes and setup man Jonathan Lo\u00e1isiga playing key roles.\n\nKeep in mind that the Yankees, like all MLB teams, will undergo roster changes during the offseason. They may sign free agents, make trades, or promote players from their minor league system. I can provide you with updates on any significant moves they make before the 2023 season begins.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the Yankees or MLB in general!",
