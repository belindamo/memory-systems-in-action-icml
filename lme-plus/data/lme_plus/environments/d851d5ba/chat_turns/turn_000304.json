  "content": "I'm interested in watching some of these experimental musicals. Speaking of musicals with a strong emotional resonance, I was really moved by the movie adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen, which I saw on November 25th, 2021. It made me think about the importance of human connection and the impact we can have on each other's lives. Do you have any recommendations for musicals that explore similar themes of human connection and empathy?",
