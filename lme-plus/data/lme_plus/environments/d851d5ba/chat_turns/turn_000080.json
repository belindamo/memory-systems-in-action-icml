  "content": "I think the most significant driver of contactless payment adoption in the next 2-3 years will be the increasing adoption of contactless payment technology by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). While larger retailers have already widely adopted contactless payments, SMBs have been slower to adopt due to concerns about costs, complexity, and integration with existing systems.\n\nHowever, as contactless payment technology becomes more affordable and easier to integrate, SMBs will be more likely to adopt it. This will provide more opportunities for consumers to use contactless payments in their daily lives, driving further adoption and familiarity.\n\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards contactless payments, and SMBs will need to adapt to meet the changing needs and preferences of their customers. As a result, I believe that SMB adoption will be a key driver of contactless payment growth in the next 2-3 years.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the role of fintech companies in driving contactless payment adoption?",
