  "content": "\"The Hustle\" and \"Entrepreneur's Journey\" are both excellent choices if you're looking for podcasts that focus on the human side of entrepreneurship. Here's what you can expect from each podcast in terms of inspiration and practical advice:\n\n**The Hustle**:\n\n* Inspiration: High. The Hustle podcast features stories of entrepreneurs who have overcome significant obstacles, and their stories are sure to inspire and motivate you.\n* Practical advice: Moderate. While the podcast doesn't shy away from offering practical tips and insights, its primary focus is on the human side of entrepreneurship. You'll get a lot of inspiration and motivation, but you might not get as many actionable tips and strategies as you would from a more tactical podcast.\n\n**Entrepreneur's Journey**:\n\n* Inspiration: High. Yaro Starak's podcast is all about sharing his own entrepreneurial journey, and he's very open about his struggles and successes. His guests also share their own stories, which are often inspiring and motivational.\n* Practical advice: Moderate to high. Yaro is a seasoned entrepreneur, and he shares a lot of practical advice and insights from his own experiences. He also asks his guests to share their own strategies and tips, so you'll get a good balance of inspiration and practical advice.\n\nBoth podcasts will provide a good balance of inspiration and practical advice, but if you're looking for more actionable tips and strategies, you might find \"Entrepreneur's Journey\" more suitable. However, if you're looking for a podcast that will inspire and motivate you to take action, \"The Hustle\" is an excellent choice.\n\nKeep in mind that both podcasts are focused on the human side of entrepreneurship, so you might not get as much technical or tactical advice as you would from other podcasts. Instead, you'll get a deeper understanding of what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur, including the mindset, habits, and strategies that lead to success.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll enjoy both podcasts!",
