  "content": "Combining all the factors into a single formula can help streamline the decision-making process for batching orders. However, it's essential to understand that doing so may make the formula more complex and less intuitive. Nevertheless, it is possible to create a composite score that accounts for the different factors.\n\nHere's a suggested formula to calculate a combined batchability score:\n\nBatchability Score = (Weight1 \\* Frustration Index) + (Weight2 \\* Additional Wait Time) + (Weight3 \\* Rider Status)\n\nRider Status can be represented as a binary value: 0 if the rider is en route to the restaurant, and 1 if the rider is already at the restaurant.\n\nWeight1, Weight2, and Weight3 are the relative importance factors for the Frustration Index, Additional Wait Time, and Rider Status, respectively. These weights help balance the contribution of each factor to the overall score.\n\nThe Batchability Score will be a single value that combines route efficiency (Frustration Index), wait times, and rider status. Lower scores indicate better batchability.\n\nKeep in mind that using a single formula to evaluate batchability may not be the best solution for all scenarios. It may not capture the nuances of specific situations and may require careful calibration of the weights to balance the different factors. Moreover, additional factors like rider capacity and package compatibility should also be considered when making decisions.\n\nIt's essential to monitor the performance of your batching system and adjust the weights and acceptable thresholds based on your business goals and customer needs. If you find that using a single formula is too restrictive or doesn't adequately address your unique requirements, you may consider using a more flexible approach that separately evaluates each factor before making a batching decision.",
