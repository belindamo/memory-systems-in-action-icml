However, on your morning flight from JFK to MIA, the meal options might be different.\n\nAmerican Airlines typically offers a limited menu on their morning flights, which often includes light breakfast items such as:\n\n1. Pastries (e.g., croissants, muffins)\n2. Fresh fruit\n3. Yogurt parfaits\n4. Energy bars\n5. Sandwiches or wraps (but these might not be the same as the turkey sandwich you had on your previous flight)\n\nSince you're flying in economy class, you'll likely have to purchase your meal from the buy-on-board menu. The menu options might vary depending on the flight, but you can expect to pay around $10-$15 for a sandwich or wrap.\n\nIf you're looking for a more substantial meal, you might consider purchasing a snack box or a breakfast bundle, which can include items like breakfast sandwiches, fruit, and yogurt.\n\nKeep in mind that American Airlines often changes their menu seasonally, so the options might be different on your flight. You can always check with the flight attendants or the American Airlines website for the most up-to-date information on in-flight meal options.\n\nNow, enjoy your morning flight to Miami, and I hope you find a meal option that suits your taste!",
