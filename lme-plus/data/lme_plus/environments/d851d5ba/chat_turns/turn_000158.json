Common Causes of Delays in Residential Building Construction in NSW\" part of the article in less than 200 words:\n\nThere are several common causes of delays in residential building construction in NSW. These include weather conditions, labor shortages, unforeseen site conditions, change orders from the owner, design changes, errors or omissions by the architect, waiting for the architect to respond to a Request for Information (RFI), material delays, project mobilization delays, and permitting issues. Weather conditions can be unpredictable and cause delays in construction activities, while labor shortages can cause delays in scheduling and completion of work. Unforeseen site conditions such as soil problems can cause delays, as can changes requested by the owner or changes in design. Errors or omissions by the architect, such as deficient drawings or specifications, can also cause delays, as can delays in obtaining necessary permits. Understanding these common causes of delays in residential building construction in NSW is essential for homeowners to take proactive measures to prevent or mitigate the impact of delays.",
