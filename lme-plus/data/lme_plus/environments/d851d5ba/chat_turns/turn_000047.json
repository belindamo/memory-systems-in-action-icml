Could you please provide the following information:\n\n1. Your current location (city and state or zip code)?\n2. Your destination in California (city or specific location)?\n3. What type of vehicle do you have (make, model, and year)? This will help me estimate your vehicle's fuel efficiency.\n4. Do you have any specific route preferences or restrictions (e.g., avoiding tolls, highways, or mountainous areas)?\n5. Are you interested in optimizing for fuel efficiency only, or would you like me to consider other factors like time, traffic, or scenic routes?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with a customized route recommendation that takes into account your vehicle's fuel efficiency and your preferences.\n\nLet me know, and I'll do my best to help you plan a fuel-efficient road trip to California!",
