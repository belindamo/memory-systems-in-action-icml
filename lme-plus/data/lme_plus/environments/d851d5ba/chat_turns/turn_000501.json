  "content": "I actually helped organize a music benefit concert at the Independent back in April, which was a huge success and raised over $5,000 for the local music education program. My friend Jake's band, The Whiskey Wanderers, headlined the event. I'm actually taking guitar lessons now and trying to learn some new songs and techniques, focusing on indie rock and folk music. Do you know of any good resources for learning guitar online or in the Bay Area?",
