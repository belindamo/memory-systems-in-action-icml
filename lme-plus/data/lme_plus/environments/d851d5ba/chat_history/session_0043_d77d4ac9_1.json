Sorry to hear you don't have the name of the beer, but don't worry, I'm here to help you find something similar.\n\nTo give you personalized recommendations, can you tell me more about the IPA you had? Try to recall the following details:\n\n1. **Flavor profile**: Was it hoppy, bitter, citrusy, fruity, malty, or a balance of these?\n2. **Hoppiness level**: Was it extremely hoppy, moderately hoppy, or more balanced?\n3. **ABV**: Do you remember the ABV (alcohol by volume)? Was it a session IPA (lower ABV) or a more robust, higher-ABV IPA?\n4. **Any notable flavors or aromas**: Did you detect any specific fruit, herbal, or spice notes?\n5. **How did it feel**: Was it crisp, refreshing, or did it have a heavier, more velvety texture?\n\nThe more information you can provide, the better I'll be able to suggest similar IPAs you might enjoy."
