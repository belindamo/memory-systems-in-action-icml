      "content": "Sure thing! Here's my review of the Mushroom & Oloroso pat\u00e9 at 161 in Sydenham, South East London:\n\nAs soon as I took a bite of the Mushroom & Oloroso pat\u00e9 at 161, I knew I was in for a treat. The pat\u00e9 had a rich, earthy flavor that was perfectly complemented by the tangy pickled cabbage and cucumber. The fried bread was crispy and golden, providing a satisfying crunch to each bite.\n\nBut what really made this dish stand out was the quality of the ingredients. The mushrooms were clearly fresh and expertly prepared, and the Oloroso added a depth of flavor that elevated the dish to a whole new level. It's clear that the chefs at 161 are passionate about using only the best ingredients and taking the time to prepare each dish with care.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Mushroom & Oloroso pat\u00e9 to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying dish at 161. It's a true testament to the quality of the food and the expertise of the chefs. Well done!"

      "content": "Ah, I see. Thank you for the update! It's unfortunate to hear that Benoit Landron was hit by frost and had to use a different grape variety for his 'Naturlich' pet-nat in 2021. It's great to hear that he was able to source organic Semillon from Bergerac to make the wine, though.\n\nSemillon is a versatile grape variety that is often used in both still and sparkling wines. It's known for its honeyed notes and can also exhibit flavors of citrus and stone fruits. I'm sure that Benoit Landron's 'Naturlich' made with organic Semillon from Bergerac will be just as delicious and unique as his previous vintages."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I can vouch for it, it's pretty delicious. The Semillon adds a little more fleshy stone-fruit to the mix. It was a fun variation on a theme. We're opening it by the glass this weekend. For spring, you know? Its a spring wine."

      "content": "That's great to hear! I'm sure that your customers will appreciate the delicious and unique flavors of Benoit Landron's 'Naturlich' made with Semillon. It's always exciting to try a new variation on a classic wine, and the addition of fleshy stone-fruit notes from the Semillon sounds like a perfect fit for springtime. I hope your customers enjoy it and have a lovely time at your natural wine bar!"

      "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to write a review of the 2021 Naturlich served by the glass at 161 in Sydenham, South East London! Here it is, in the style of Jancis Robinson:\n\nBenoit Landron's 2021 Naturlich is a pet-nat that defies expectations with its unique blend of Semillon and Folle Blanche. Despite being made with a different grape variety than previous vintages, this wine still showcases Landron's skill in crafting natural wines with precision and care.\n\nOn the nose, the Naturlich presents aromas of citrus, stone fruits, and a touch of honeyed sweetness, hinting at the complexity to come. On the palate, the wine bursts with lively bubbles and a zesty acidity, balancing the richness of the fruit flavors.\n\nThe Semillon grape adds a welcome dimension of fleshy stone-fruit notes to the mix, while the Folle Blanche grape lends its signature crispness and minerality to the finish. The result is a wine that is refreshing, fun, and perfect for sipping in the springtime.\n\nOverall, Benoit Landron's 2021 Naturlich served by the glass at 161 is a delightful and well-crafted natural wine that is sure to please even the most discerning palates. It's a testament to Landron's skill and dedication to producing wines that are true to their terroir and full of character. Cheers to a fantastic glass of wine!"

While I have a lot of knowledge about natural wines, I'm afraid I don't have specific information about every importer and distributor in the industry. However, it's great to hear that Under The Bonnet imports and distributes natural wines, including the Naturlich that I reviewed earlier. I'm sure they have a great selection of wines that are worth checking out."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. You are correct that Fernando Garcia's full name is Fernando Garcia Berry, and that he was not the head winemaker at Bodegas Maranones, but rather worked as a consultant winemaker there. Otros Vinos is still a Spanish natural wine producer that specializes in minimal intervention winemaking techniques and has gained a reputation for producing unique and expressive wines."

He is the owner and winemaker of Comando G, a highly regarded natural wine producer in the Sierra de Gredos region of Spain. Otros Vinos, on the other hand, is a natural wine distributor based in Madrid that works with a variety of Spanish and international natural wine producers."

Fernando Garcia Berry is indeed the co-founder and winemaker of Comando G, which is highly regarded for its minimal intervention winemaking techniques in the Sierra de Gredos region of Spain. Otros Vinos, on the other hand, is a natural wine distributor based in Madrid that works with a variety of Spanish and international natural wine producers."
