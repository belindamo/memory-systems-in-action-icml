  "content": "Approach: Creating a Reading Comprehension App for Children to Increase Literacy Skills\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the education sector, and many children have experienced disruptions in their learning. In particular, research has shown that the pandemic has had a negative impact on children's reading comprehension skills. According to a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, students in the United States have lost an average of one-third of a year's worth of reading skills due to school closures during the pandemic. This is a concerning issue that must be addressed to ensure that children have the necessary literacy skills to succeed in their academic and personal lives.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose developing a reading comprehension app that is tailored to children's needs and learning styles. This app will leverage AWS services to provide an engaging and interactive learning experience for children. By using advanced AI/ML algorithms, the app will personalize the content based on each child's interests, abilities, and progress. This will help to increase engagement and motivation, which are key factors in improving reading comprehension. Furthermore, the app will be designed to be accessible and user-friendly, making it easy for children to use and navigate.\n\nOverall, our goal is to create an innovative reading comprehension app that can help children improve their literacy skills, especially in the face of the challenges posed by the pandemic. By leveraging the power of AWS services and cutting-edge technology, we believe that we can make a significant impact on children's learning and development, and help them to achieve their full potential.",
