It's great that you're involving your friend in the planning process and making it a fun, collaborative effort.\n\nHaving a team of people helping with the bake sale will also make the workload more manageable and allow you to divide tasks more efficiently. Rachel can focus on baking, while you can handle the promotional aspects, and others can help with setup, sales, and cleanup.\n\nRemember to communicate clearly with Rachel and any other volunteers about the event details, including the date, time, location, and what's expected of them. Make sure to express your gratitude for their help and support throughout the process.\n\nWith Rachel's baking skills and your combined efforts, I'm sure your bake sale will be a huge success! You'll not only raise funds for a great cause but also have a fun and rewarding experience with your friend.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress, and if you need any more advice or guidance, feel free to ask!",
