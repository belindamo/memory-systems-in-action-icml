Regular tuning helps maintain the instrument's sound quality, pitch, and overall condition. I recommend finding a professional piano technician in your area to tune your piano every 6-12 months, depending on usage.\n\nBefore you buy your music stand and metronome combo, consider the following factors:\n\n* Space: How much room do you have available for the stand and metronome?\n* Portability: Do you need a lightweight, compact combo for traveling or storage?\n* Adjustability: Look for a stand with adjustable height and angle settings to fit your playing needs.\n* Metronome features: Do you need a metronome with advanced features like rhythm patterns, tap tempo, or a loud, clear sound?\n\nHope this helps you make an informed decision!",
