  "content": "Yes, it's likely that the collaboration between agencies like the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security will continue even after the pandemic is over. This is because many of the challenges facing the country today, such as cyber threats, terrorism, and transnational crime, require a coordinated and collaborative response across different agencies and levels of government.\n\nFurthermore, the importance of interagency cooperation was highlighted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a report from October 2020. The report recommended that the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security improve their collaboration efforts to address the evolving threats to national security.\n\nAdditionally, the two agencies have longstanding partnerships and have worked together to address national security issues for decades. It's likely that this collaboration will continue as both agencies strive to maintain the safety and security of the American people.\n\nIn short, interagency cooperation is essential for addressing national security issues, and this collaboration is likely to continue even after the pandemic is over.",
