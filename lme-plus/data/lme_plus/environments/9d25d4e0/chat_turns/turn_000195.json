  "content": "Let's come back to the overall narrative and the chatper outline and summaries you've provided. We need to dial back on the mirror itself having any real power or even it being \"cursed\" and more that because they are seeing a alternate future based on a tragic event or loss from their past not having happened, people are naturally draw in to want to stay with that non-existent future rather than face their present and deal with their pain and loss, and as a result, that impacts their relationships and has its own spiritual, mental, emotional, pyschological consequences - they cannot fully live in the present or don' fuly experience love and grace in real life. But it impact different people in different ways due to the nature of their loss/trauma, and because of their unique life experience (a teen boy doesn't resond the same way as an older, married mother might). Also, unlike the myth of narcissis, no one actually dies or stays in front of the mirror for weeks and years until they die, the rather, they keep being drawn back to until their family, friends or circumstances cause the mirror to be removed in their lives. The ending is simply that someone or a group of people close to the person finally break the mirror because they care about the person and want them to be set free - they realize the person cannot do it themselves.",
