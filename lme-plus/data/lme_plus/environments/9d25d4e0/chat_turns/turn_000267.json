However, if you plan to use your laptop for more demanding tasks like gaming or video editing, you might need to recharge it sooner.\n\nKeep in mind that actual battery life may vary depending on several factors, including:\n\n* Screen brightness and resolution\n* Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity\n* Resource-intensive applications\n* Power-saving features and settings\n\nIt's great that you have a portable power bank from Mophie, but it's always convenient to have a laptop that can last a full day without needing a charge.\n\n**Other Factors to Consider:**\n\nAs you're still deciding between the two laptops, here are some additional points to consider:\n\n* **Display:** Both laptops have 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreens, but the HP Envy x360's display is slightly brighter and has better color accuracy.\n* **Performance:** The HP Envy x360 tends to have faster performance and better cooling, making it a better option for demanding tasks.\n* **Design and Build:** The HP Envy x360 has a more premium design and build quality, with a sleeker and more compact chassis.\n* **Weight and Portability:** The Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 is slightly lighter and more portable, making it easier to carry around.\n\nWhich of these factors is most important to you?",
