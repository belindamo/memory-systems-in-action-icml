  "content": "I've been really inspired by Cartier-Bresson's concept of the \"decisive moment\" and how he emphasizes the importance of being present and aware of your surroundings to capture those fleeting moments. I've been trying to apply that to my own street photography, paying more attention to the interactions between people and their environment. As for Adams, I've been experimenting with black-and-white photography and trying to master the zone system, which has really helped me to better understand the technical aspects of photography.",
