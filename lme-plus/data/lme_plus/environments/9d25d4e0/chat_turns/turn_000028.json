  "content": "My favorite camera for street photography is actually my Canon QL17, which I mentioned earlier. I love its compact size, quiet shutter, and excellent 40mm f/1.7 lens. It's perfect for discreetly capturing moments on the street. For black-and-white photography, I've been experimenting with Ilford HP5 Plus 400 film, which I develop myself in my darkroom. There's something special about shooting with film and experiencing the entire process from start to finish. However, I've also been enjoying digital black-and-white photography using my mirrorless camera with a monochrome profile. It's amazing how close digital can get to the look and feel of film!\n\nWhat about you? Do you have a preferred camera or setup for street photography or black-and-white photography?",
