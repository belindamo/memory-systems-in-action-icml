Here's my review of the Mushroom & Oloroso pat\u00e9 at 161 in Sydenham, South East London:\n\nAs soon as I took a bite of the Mushroom & Oloroso pat\u00e9 at 161, I knew I was in for a treat. The pat\u00e9 had a rich, earthy flavor that was perfectly complemented by the tangy pickled cabbage and cucumber. The fried bread was crispy and golden, providing a satisfying crunch to each bite.\n\nBut what really made this dish stand out was the quality of the ingredients. The mushrooms were clearly fresh and expertly prepared, and the Oloroso added a depth of flavor that elevated the dish to a whole new level. It's clear that the chefs at 161 are passionate about using only the best ingredients and taking the time to prepare each dish with care.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Mushroom & Oloroso pat\u00e9 to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying dish at 161. It's a true testament to the quality of the food and the expertise of the chefs. Well done!",
