I remember when I started the project, I was really excited about it, and I think that's what I need to get back to - that initial enthusiasm and energy. I'll take your advice and break it down into smaller tasks, set some deadlines, and just get started again. Thanks for the motivation!\n\nBy the way, I started this F-15E project about three weeks ago, and it's been a fun build so far. I've been working on it in short sessions, and I'm really happy with how it's coming along.",
