The mirror has been moved from location to location until it ends up on the west coast. Each new owner is different, and the mirror's power takes a different toll on them. However, the mirror's allure of a brighter future ultimately leads to a diminished present and takes an emotional, spiritual, mental, and/or psychological toll on them. A group of individuals of different ages and genders must come together to break the curse and free themselves and future generations from the mirror's grasp.\n\nChapter 1 - The Auction\n\nThe mirror is sold at an auction in New York and ends up in the hands of a young couple.

We see how the mirror fights back, tempting each one with visions of an alternate future.\n\nChapter 7 - The Betrayal\n\nOne member of the group betrays the others, using the mirror's power for their own gain.
