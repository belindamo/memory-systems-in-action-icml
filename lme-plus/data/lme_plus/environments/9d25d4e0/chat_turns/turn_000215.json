  "content": "To store all of the educational content that will be made available on the Amazon Cockatoo application, we will use Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). S3 is highly scalable and durable, meaning it can handle large amounts of data and is reliable. To manage user authentication and authorization, we will use Amazon Cognito, which allows us to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to the application. Cognito integrates with other AWS services like API Gateway and Lambda. We will also use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and analyze the performance of the application. CloudWatch provides metrics and logs that can be used to monitor the health and performance of the application, and it can also be used to trigger alarms and notifications based on specific metrics. Finally, to simplify the deployment and management of the application, we will use AWS Amplify, a development platform that provides a set of tools and services to build scalable and secure cloud-powered mobile and web applications. Amplify supports popular frameworks and technologies like React, Angular, and Vue, and it makes it easy to add AWS services like authentication, storage, and APIs to applications. Overall, we chose these AWS services because they provide a comprehensive and scalable solution for building and managing a reading comprehension application for children, while also simplifying the deployment and management process.",
