  "content": "Ah, I see. Thank you for the update! It's unfortunate to hear that Benoit Landron was hit by frost and had to use a different grape variety for his 'Naturlich' pet-nat in 2021. It's great to hear that he was able to source organic Semillon from Bergerac to make the wine, though.\n\nSemillon is a versatile grape variety that is often used in both still and sparkling wines. It's known for its honeyed notes and can also exhibit flavors of citrus and stone fruits. I'm sure that Benoit Landron's 'Naturlich' made with organic Semillon from Bergerac will be just as delicious and unique as his previous vintages.",
