  "content": "I have a few projects going on, but the one that's been lingering in the back of my mind is a desert diorama featuring my F-15E Strike Eagle. I was inspired by some photos I saw online of a model show, where one of the winners had built an amazing desert diorama with a crashed aircraft. I started working on the base using foam board and plaster, and then added some static grass and small rocks to create a desert landscape. However, I haven't touched it in a while, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Do you think I should focus on completing this project before moving on to others?",
