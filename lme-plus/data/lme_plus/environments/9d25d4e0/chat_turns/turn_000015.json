Headspace and Insight Timer are both highly rated and popular meditation apps, so they are a great place to start. Headspace offers a free trial period and has a wide range of guided meditations, including short daily ones, while Insight Timer offers a large library of user-generated content, including guided meditations, music, and talks from mindfulness experts. Both apps offer a variety of features and can be downloaded and used for free, although some features may require a paid subscription. It's a good idea to try out a few different apps and see which one feels right for you and your meditation practice.",
