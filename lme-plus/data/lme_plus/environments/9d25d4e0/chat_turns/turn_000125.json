  "content": "The idea that a person's presence can have therapeutic benefits is not based on any scientific evidence. There is no scientific evidence to support the notion that a person's body generates inaudible sounds that others can sense or that being in close proximity to someone who is meditating has any specific therapeutic benefits.\n\nIt is possible that the perception of therapeutic benefits from being in someone's presence is due to psychological or social factors, such as feelings of comfort, relaxation, or safety that come from being near someone who is perceived as trustworthy and supportive. People may also attribute any feelings of calm or well-being to being near the meditator, even if these feelings are actually due to other factors, such as stress relief or relaxation.\n\nIn conclusion, while being in someone's presence can certainly have a positive impact on a person's mood and well-being, it is not because of any specific physical process related to the generation of inaudible sounds. The exact mechanisms behind the psychological and social benefits of being in someone's presence are still not well understood and require further scientific investigation.",
