To enhance the reading comprehension experience for each child, we propose incorporating AWS AI/ML services into the app. Specifically, Amazon Comprehend can be used to analyze and understand the meaning behind written text, allowing the app to provide personalized recommendations for each child based on their reading level, interests, and progress. Amazon Polly can be used to convert written text to spoken words, helping children to improve their pronunciation and fluency. Amazon Rekognition can be used to analyze images and provide feedback on visual literacy, while Amazon Translate can be used to translate content into multiple languages, making it accessible to a wider audience. With these AI/ML services integrated into the app, we aim to provide a more personalized and engaging reading experience for children of all backgrounds and abilities.",
