Specify the duration of the delay allowed due to adverse weather conditions and provide a mechanism for adjusting the completion date of the project.\n4. Define the process for resolving any disputes arising from weather-related delays.\n5. Include provisions for how additional costs resulting from weather-related delays will be handled.\n6. Specify the consequences for failure to comply with the weather-related delay provisions.\n7. Consider adding a clause requiring the contractor to have a contingency plan for weather-related delays.\n\nA solid construction contract that addresses weather-related delays is crucial for both the homeowner and the contractor.
