Here are some tips to help you achieve a beautiful and easy-to-care-for outdoor space:\n\n1. **Native plants**: Choose plants native to your region, which are naturally adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. They'll require less watering, fertilizing, and pest control.\n2. **Drought-tolerant plants**: Select plants that can thrive with minimal watering, such as succulents, sedums, and yucca. This will reduce your water bill and save you time.\n3. **Perennials**: Perennial plants come back year after year, reducing the need for frequent planting and maintenance. Consider low-maintenance perennials like coneflowers, black-eyed susans, and ornamental grasses.\n4. **Mulch and groundcovers**: Mulch and groundcovers can help suppress weeds, reduce erosion, and retain moisture in the soil. Use organic mulch like wood chips or bark, and consider low-growing groundcovers like thyme or creeping juniper.\n5. **Simplify your lawn**: Consider reducing the size of your lawn or replacing it with a low-maintenance alternative like clover or creeping thyme. This will reduce mowing, watering, and fertilizing needs.\n6. **Hardscaping**: Incorporate hardscaping elements like gravel, stone, or brick patios, walkways, and retaining walls to reduce lawn area and create visual interest.\n7. **Efficient irrigation**: Install a smart irrigation system or use soaker hoses to deliver water directly to the roots of plants, reducing evaporation and runoff.\n8. **Group plants by water needs**: Segment your garden into zones based on watering needs, making it easier to water efficiently and avoid overwatering.\n9. **Add decorative elements**: Incorporate decorative elements like bird baths, statues, or ornamental containers to add visual interest and distract from any imperfections in the garden.\n10. **Consider a layered landscape**: Design your garden with a layered landscape, featuring taller plants in the back, mid-level plants in the middle, and low-growing plants in the front. This creates a visually appealing and easy-to-maintain landscape.\n11. **Consult a local expert**: Consult with a local nursery, landscaper, or gardening expert to get advice on the best low-maintenance plants and design strategies for your specific climate and region.\n\nFor a garden that complements the surrounding hills, consider the following:\n\n* **Choose plants with a natural, rustic look**: Select plants with a more natural, rustic appearance that blend in with the surrounding hills.\n* **Incorporate natural materials**: Use natural materials like stone, wood, and earthy-toned mulch to create a cohesive look that blends with the surrounding landscape.\n* **Create a gentle slope**: Design your garden with a gentle slope to mirror the natural slope of the surrounding hills, creating a sense of harmony between your garden and the surrounding landscape.\n\nBy incorporating these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a beautiful, low-maintenance garden that complements the surrounding hills and provides a peaceful retreat for years to come.",
