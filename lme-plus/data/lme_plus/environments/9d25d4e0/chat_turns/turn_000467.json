Asking friends and family for recommendations can give you a good starting point, and then you can verify their credentials and reputation through online research.\n\nThe Piano Technicians Guild (PTG) is a great resource to find certified technicians in your area. They have a \"Find a Technician\" tool on their website that allows you to search for technicians by location, name, or certification.\n\nYelp is also a great platform to check for reviews and ratings from previous customers. You can filter your search by rating, distance, and categories like \"piano tuning\" or \"piano repair.\"\n\nRemember to also ask questions when you contact a technician, such as their experience with your type of piano, their pricing, and their approach to maintenance and repairs. This will give you a better sense of their expertise and whether they're the right fit for your needs.\n\nGood luck in your search, and I hope you find a great piano technician to help you get your piano in top condition for sale!",
