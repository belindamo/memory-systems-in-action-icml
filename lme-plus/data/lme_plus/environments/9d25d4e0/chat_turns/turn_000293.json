Here it is, in the style of Jancis Robinson:\n\nBenoit Landron's 2021 Naturlich is a pet-nat that defies expectations with its unique blend of Semillon and Folle Blanche. Despite being made with a different grape variety than previous vintages, this wine still showcases Landron's skill in crafting natural wines with precision and care.\n\nOn the nose, the Naturlich presents aromas of citrus, stone fruits, and a touch of honeyed sweetness, hinting at the complexity to come. On the palate, the wine bursts with lively bubbles and a zesty acidity, balancing the richness of the fruit flavors.\n\nThe Semillon grape adds a welcome dimension of fleshy stone-fruit notes to the mix, while the Folle Blanche grape lends its signature crispness and minerality to the finish. The result is a wine that is refreshing, fun, and perfect for sipping in the springtime.\n\nOverall, Benoit Landron's 2021 Naturlich served by the glass at 161 is a delightful and well-crafted natural wine that is sure to please even the most discerning palates. It's a testament to Landron's skill and dedication to producing wines that are true to their terroir and full of character. Cheers to a fantastic glass of wine!",
