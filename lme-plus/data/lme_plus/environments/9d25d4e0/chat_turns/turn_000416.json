Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Vegan Almond Flour Naan Bread Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 1/2 cups almond flour\n* 1/4 cup tapioca flour\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast (make sure it's vegan)\n* 1/2 cup non-dairy yogurt (such as almond, soy, or coconut-based)\n* 1/4 cup lukewarm water\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* Optional: garlic powder, cilantro, or other herbs for flavor\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Activate the yeast:** In a small bowl, mix the yeast with the lukewarm water. Let it sit for 5-7 minutes until it becomes frothy and bubbly.\n2. **Combine dry ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, tapioca flour, salt, sugar, and yeast mixture.\n3. **Add non-dairy yogurt and mix:** Add the non-dairy yogurt and mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n4. **Knead the dough:** Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and pliable. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or knead by hand.\n5. **Rest the dough:** Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n6. **Divide and shape:** Divide the dough into 6-8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and flatten it slightly into a disk shape.\n7. **Cook the naan:** Heat a non-stick skillet or tava over medium heat. Place a naan disk in the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes, until it starts to bubble and the edges start to curl. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder or cilantro if desired.\n8. **Serve:** Serve the naan bread hot with your favorite Indian dishes, such as chana masala, saag paneer, or dal makhani.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to use a high-quality almond flour that is finely ground and blanched.\n* If using a stand mixer, be gentle when kneading the dough to avoid overworking it.\n* If you find the dough too sticky, add a little more tapioca flour. If it's too dry, add a little more non-dairy yogurt.\n* You can also bake the naan bread in a preheated oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.\n\nEnjoy your delicious vegan almond flour naan bread!",
