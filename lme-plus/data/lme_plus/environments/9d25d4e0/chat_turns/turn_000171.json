Reduce water usage: Fix leaky faucets, take shorter showers, and install a low-flow showerhead. 3. Choose eco-friendly products: Look for products that are made from sustainable materials and choose products with environmentally-friendly certifications. 4. Reduce food waste: Plan meals ahead of time, buy only what you need, and use leftovers creatively. 5. Drive less: Walk, bike or take public transportation whenever possible. 6. Plant trees: Trees absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants, so planting trees is a great way to help the environment. 7. Support eco-friendly policies: Write to your elected officials about environmental issues and support policies that promote sustainability.
