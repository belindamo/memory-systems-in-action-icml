  "content": "That sounds like a great idea! The invitation design and wording you suggested are both beautiful and meaningful. I especially like the idea of incorporating a picture of Ava and a special message about her adoption journey. It will make the invitation even more personal and special.\n\nI think I'll go with a traditional Chinese-inspired design, with a red and gold color scheme and Chinese characters. And I'll definitely include a picture of Ava, either a sonogram or a recent photo. For the wording, I'll use something like \"Join us as we celebrate the arrival of Ava, our little bundle of joy from China!\" and add a special message about her adoption journey.\n\nThanks for your help with the invitation ideas! Do you have any suggestions for games or activities that we can play during the baby shower?",
