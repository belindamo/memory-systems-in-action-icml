  "content": "That's a great idea! For the \"Passport to Ava\" game, I think it would be nice to have a mix of fun and meaningful stamps. I like the idea of having a \"Journey Begins\" stamp with a picture of a plane, and a \"Forever Family\" stamp with a picture of a puzzle piece. \n\nAs for traditional Chinese gifts, I think a silk or brocade outfit would be a lovely idea. Or maybe a set of Chinese coins tied with red string, which would make a thoughtful and unique gift.",
