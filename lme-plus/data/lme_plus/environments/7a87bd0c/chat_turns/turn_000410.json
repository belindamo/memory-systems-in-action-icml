  "content": "Terraform Cloud provides a centralized location for managing Terraform infrastructure deployments. GitHub integration allows Terraform Cloud to access your GitHub repositories and automatically initiate Terraform runs when changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.\n\nTo integrate Terraform Cloud with Azure, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an Azure service principal with the appropriate permissions to manage your Azure resources. You can follow the instructions provided by Microsoft to create a service principal: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal>.\n2. Create a Terraform configuration file that defines the infrastructure resources you want to manage in Azure. You can store this file in a GitHub repository.\n3. Create a new workspace in Terraform Cloud and configure it to use the GitHub repository that contains your Terraform configuration file.\n4. In your Terraform Cloud workspace, configure your Azure credentials by creating an environment variable that includes the Azure subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. You can find these values in the Azure portal and in the Azure CLI.\n5. Create a Terraform Cloud plan and apply it to your Azure infrastructure. You can use the Terraform Cloud web interface to initiate a plan and apply it to your Azure resources.\n\nBy integrating Terraform Cloud with GitHub and Azure, you can automate the deployment and management of your infrastructure resources in Azure, while also providing visibility and collaboration through version control in GitHub.",
