  "content": "I think it's a rare Spiderman figure from the 90s, still in its original packaging, which is a little worn out. I'm not sure about the condition of the figure itself, but I remember it was part of a limited release for some movie promotion back then. I don't have any certificates of authenticity, but I'm pretty sure it's the real deal. Oh, and I was wondering, do you think my vintage cameras could be worth something too? I just got a 1950s-era Rolleiflex at a thrift store, and I'm still figuring out how to use it.",
