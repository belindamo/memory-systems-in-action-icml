  "content": "I totally understand your frustration with your mountain bike, but let's focus on getting your road bike's gears sorted out first.\n\n**Allen wrenches:**\n\nYes, Allen wrenches come in different sizes, and it's essential to have the correct size for your bike's components. Allen wrenches are measured in millimeters, and the most common sizes for bike maintenance are:\n\n* 3 mm\n* 4 mm\n* 5 mm\n* 6 mm\n* 8 mm (less common, but sometimes used for certain bolts)\n\nYou might have a multi-tool or a set of Allen wrenches that includes multiple sizes. Check your toolbox or the packaging to see what sizes are included. If you're still unsure, you can purchase a set of Allen wrenches or a multi-tool that covers the common sizes.\n\n**Mountain bike woes:**\n\nSorry to hear that your mountain bike's rear shock is still being repaired. Borrowing a friend's hardtail can be a good temporary solution, but I'm sure you're eager to get back on your own bike.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to consider using this opportunity to give your mountain bike a thorough cleaning and maintenance check. You could also use this time to upgrade or replace any components that might need attention.\n\nRemember to stay patient and communicate with the repair shop to get an update on the status of your rear shock repair. It'll be back on the trails in no time!\n\nNow, let's get back to your road bike's gears. Once you have the correct Allen wrenches, you can start adjusting those gears. If you're still unsure or uncomfortable with the process, consider taking your bike to a local bike shop for a professional tune-up.",
