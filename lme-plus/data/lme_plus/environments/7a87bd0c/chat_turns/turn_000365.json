  "content": "I currently use acrylics, and I'm pretty happy with them. My typical painting surface is usually a small to medium-sized canvas. I'd say my brush style is a mix of both bold and delicate strokes, depending on the effect I'm going for. I've used a few different brands in the past, but I'm open to trying new ones. Budget-wise, I'd say I'm willing to invest in good-quality supplies, but I don't want to break the bank. As for challenges, I did have some trouble getting the skin tones right in my niece's portrait, so any tips on that would be great.",
