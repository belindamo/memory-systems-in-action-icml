Here are some common tools used for gear adjustment:\n\n1. **Allen wrenches**: You'll need a set of Allen wrenches (3, 4, 5, and 6 mm) to adjust the derailleurs and limit screws.\n2. **Torx wrench**: Some bikes use Torx bolts, so it's a good idea to have a Torx wrench (e.g., T25) on hand.\n3. **Cable tension gauge**: A cable tension gauge helps you adjust the cable tension to the correct specification.\n4. **Chain wear indicator**: A chain wear indicator helps you check the condition of your chain and determine when it needs to be replaced.\n5. **Gear adjustment tool**: Some gear systems, like Shimano's Ultegra or Dura-Ace, require a specific tool for adjusting the derailleurs. Check your bike's manual or the manufacturer's website to see if you need a specific tool.\n\n**Bike helmet fitting:**\n\nCongratulations on your new Specialized Vice helmet! Proper helmet fitting is crucial for safety and comfort. Here are some tips to help you fit your helmet correctly:\n\n1. **Measure your head**: Before you start adjusting the helmet, measure the circumference of your head using a flexible tape measure or a string. This will give you a baseline to work from.\n2. **Adjust the fit system**: The Specialized Vice helmet has a dial-fit system. Turn the dial clockwise to tighten and counterclockwise to loosen. Adjust the fit system to fit snugly around your head, with about 1-2 fingers' width between the helmet and your eyebrows.\n3. **Position the helmet**: Place the helmet level on your head, with the front edge about 1-2 cm above your eyebrows. The helmet should sit squarely on your head, not tilted back or forward.\n4. **Check the straps**: Adjust the straps so they form a \"V\" shape under your ears. The straps should be snug but not too tight.\n5. **Shake test**: Once you've adjusted the fit system and straps, shake your head gently from side to side and forward and backward. The helmet should stay in place without slipping or wobbling.\n6. **Wear it for a while**: Wear the helmet for a short ride or walk to ensure it's comfortable and doesn't cause any pressure points.\n\nRemember, a properly fitted helmet is essential for safety. If you're still unsure, visit a local bike shop for a professional fitting.\n\nI hope that helps!",
