  "content": "The term \"mobile\" is actually derived from the French word \"mobile\", which means \"movable\" or \"kinetic\". The term was originally used in the early 20th century to describe a type of sculpture that incorporated moving parts or elements, and was used to refer specifically to the works of Alexander Calder, an American artist who is credited with inventing the modern mobile.\n\nCalder's mobiles were characterized by their delicate balance and the interplay of weight and movement. The individual elements of the mobile were suspended from a central point by wires or other connectors, allowing them to move and shift in response to air currents or other forces.\n\nOver time, the term \"mobile\" became more broadly associated with any type of hanging or suspended sculpture that incorporates movement or kinetic elements. Today, mobiles can be found in a variety of settings, from homes and nurseries to art museums and public spaces, and are often appreciated for their beauty, complexity, and the sense of movement and dynamism that they bring to a space.",
