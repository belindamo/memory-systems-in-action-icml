Garlic: Garlic has natural antibiotic properties and has been used for centuries to fight infections. You can consume it raw or cooked, or take it in supplement form.\n\n3. Honey: Raw honey has natural antibacterial properties and can be used topically on wounds or applied to the throat to soothe soreness.\n\n4.
