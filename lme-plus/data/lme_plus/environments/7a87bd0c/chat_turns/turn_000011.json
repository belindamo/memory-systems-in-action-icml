Here are some tips to help you make the most of your storage space:\n\n**Choosing the Right Bins:**\n\n1. **Measure your space**: Before buying bins, measure the shelves, corners, and areas where you plan to store them. This will ensure you get bins that fit comfortably and maximize your space.\n2. **Consider the contents**: Think about what you'll be storing in each bin.

You can also use pre-made labels or stickers if you prefer.\n3. **Color-code**: Consider color-coding your labels to categorize similar items or to indicate the contents of each bin.\n4. **Label the bin and the shelf**: Label not only the bin but also the shelf or area where it's stored, so you can easily find what you need.\n5. **Keep it consistent**: Use a consistent labeling system throughout your garage to make it easy to navigate and find what you need.\n\nSome popular bin and label options include:\n\n* Sterilite or Rubbermaid bins for general storage\n* Label makers like Brother or DYMO for easy labeling\n* Adhesive labels or stickers from brands like Avery or Scotch\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a well-organized and functional storage system in your garage that makes it easy to find what you need when you need it.\n\nHow do you plan to organize your bins and labels?
