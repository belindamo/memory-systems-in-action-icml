Log in to your Terraform Cloud account and navigate to your workspace.\n2. Click on the \"Settings\" tab and select \"Variables\" from the dropdown menu.\n3. Click the \"Add Variable\" button to create a new variable.\n4. In the \"Key\" field, enter the name of the environment variable that you want to use for your Azure credentials. For example, you could use \"ARM\\_SUBSCRIPTION\\_ID\" for the Azure subscription ID.\n5. In the \"Value\" field, enter the corresponding value for the environment variable. This value can be found in the Azure portal or Azure CLI.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the following environment variables: \"ARM\\_TENANT\\_ID\" for the Azure tenant ID, \"ARM\\_CLIENT\\_ID\" for the Azure client ID, and \"ARM\\_CLIENT\\_SECRET\" for the Azure client secret.\n7. Click the \"Save variable\" button to save the environment variable.\n8. In your Terraform configuration file, you can reference these environment variables using the \"${var.ENV\\_VAR\\_NAME}\" syntax. For example, you can reference the Azure subscription ID using \"${var.ARM\\_SUBSCRIPTION\\_ID}\" in your Terraform code.\n9. Finally, initiate a Terraform plan or apply using Terraform Cloud to deploy your infrastructure resources to Azure, with access to the necessary Azure credentials via the environment variables you just created.",
