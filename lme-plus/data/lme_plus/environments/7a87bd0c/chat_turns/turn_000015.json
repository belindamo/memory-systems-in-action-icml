  "content": "The \"Journey to Ava\" theme is a beautiful way to celebrate the adoption journey. Here are some game and activity ideas that fit well with this theme:\n\n**Games and Activities:**\n\n1. **Passport to Ava**: Create a mock passport for each guest, where they can collect \"stamps\" as they complete activities or games throughout the shower. The final stamp can be a picture of Ava, symbolizing the completion of the journey.\n2. **The Journey Timeline**: Create a large timeline of Michael and Sophia's adoption journey, from the decision to adopt to the arrival of Ava. Have guests guess the dates of significant events or milestones.\n3. **Ava's Story**: Divide guests into small groups and have them create a collaborative story about Ava's journey from China to her new home. Encourage creativity and imagination!\n4. **Map Scavenger Hunt**: Hide maps of China or significant locations from the adoption journey around the party area. Give each guest a list of clues to find the maps, which ultimately lead to a special surprise or treat.\n5. **Wishing Tree**: Set up a beautiful tree or branch where guests can write notes, wishes, and advice for Ava's future on small paper leaves or cards. This creates a heartfelt and personalized keepsake for Michael and Sophia.\n6. **Adoption Trivia**: Prepare a quiz about adoption, China, or the adoption process. This can be a fun way to educate guests and create a sense of community.\n7. **Ava's First Year**: Have guests fill out a card or booklet with predictions, advice, or wishes for Ava's first year. This creates a precious keepsake for Michael and Sophia to treasure.\n\n**Gift Ideas:**\n\n1. **Personalized Adoption Book**: Create a beautifully designed book that tells the story of Ava's adoption journey, including pictures and milestones. You can use a service like Shutterfly or Blurb to create the book.\n2. **Customized Baby Blanket or Quilt**: A soft, cozy blanket or quilt with Ava's name, birthdate, or a special message is a thoughtful gift for any baby.\n3. **Adoption-Themed Artwork**: A beautiful piece of artwork or painting that celebrates adoption, love, or family can be a stunning addition to Ava's nursery.\n4. ** Cultural Keepsakes**: A traditional Chinese outfit, a handmade Chinese doll, or a beautiful piece of Chinese-inspired artwork can help Ava connect with her heritage.\n5. **Practical Items**: Diapers, onesies, and baby gear are always appreciated, but consider gifting experiences like a post-adoption counseling session, a meal delivery service, or a baby massage class to support Michael and Sophia in their new role as parents.\n6. **Memory Box**: Create a beautifully crafted memory box or shadow box where Michael and Sophia can store mementos from Ava's adoption journey, such as her adoption certificate, photos, and other keepsakes.\n7. **Subscription Services**: A subscription to a children's book club, a baby clothing service, or a parenting resource platform can provide ongoing support and entertainment for Ava and her parents.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a gift that comes from the heart and shows your love and support for Michael, Sophia, and baby Ava.",
