  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Adding the trip name to the file name will make it even easier to identify and organize your photos. Your suggested format:\n\n`YYYYMMDD_Location_TripName_Description.jpg`\n\nis a great way to include all the relevant information in a concise and readable format.\n\nBy including the trip name, you'll be able to quickly identify which trip the photo belongs to, and you can easily sort and filter your photos by trip. This will be especially useful if you have multiple trips to the same location, or if you want to create albums or galleries for each trip.\n\nYour examples are perfect:\n\n* 20220215_Napa Valley_Getaway_Wine Tasting at Castello di Amorosa.jpg\n* 20220520_Yosemite_Road Trip_Half Dome from Glacier Point.jpg\n\nThis naming convention will also make it easy to search for photos from a specific trip or location. You can use your operating system's search function to find all photos from a particular trip or location, and the file names will give you a clear idea of what each photo is about.\n\nRemember to be consistent with your naming convention throughout your photo collection, and you'll be able to easily manage and enjoy your travel memories for years to come!",
