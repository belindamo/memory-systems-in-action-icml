Some steps to take include:\n\n1. Review user account permissions: Check the user's account permissions to determine if they have elevated privileges, such as administrative access or access to sensitive data.\n2. Review access logs: Check access logs to determine if the user has accessed any sensitive data or resources recently.\n3. Check for indicators of compromise: Look for signs that the user's account may have been compromised, such as multiple failed login attempts, unusual login times or locations, or unauthorized changes to the user's account settings.\n4. Verify access rights with management: Confirm the user's access rights and permissions with their manager or supervisor to ensure that their level of access is appropriate for their role and responsibilities.\n5. Check for any changes to the user's access: Determine if there have been any recent changes to the user's account or access rights that could indicate a security breach or insider threat.\n\nBy reviewing these factors, the incident response team can determine if the user account associated with the authentication attempt has any elevated privileges or access to sensitive data, and if so, take appropriate steps to mitigate the risk of a potential security breach.",
