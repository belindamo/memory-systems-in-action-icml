  "content": "I think the packaging is a window box with a Spiderman logo on it. I'm pretty sure it was a promotion for one of the Spiderman movies back in the 90s. As for my Rolleiflex, it's a Twin Lens Reflex model, and it seems to be in good condition, but like I said, I'm still figuring out how to use it properly. It didn't come with any accessories, unfortunately. I also have a 1960s-era Canon rangefinder that I inherited from my grandfather, which is still in mint condition and takes amazing photos. Do you think that could be worth something too?",
