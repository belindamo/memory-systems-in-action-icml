Creating albums or folders for each trip is a great way to categorize your photos, but you may also want to consider additional levels of organization to make it easy to find specific photos. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Top-level folders:** Create a top-level folder for each type of trip or category, such as:\n\t* Vacations\n\t* Weekend Getaways\n\t* National Parks\n\t* International Trips\n\t* Cruises\n2. **Trip folders:** Within each top-level folder, create a subfolder for each trip, using the trip name as the folder name. For example:\n\t* Vacations\n\t\t+ Napa Valley Getaway (2022)\n\t\t+ Yosemite Road Trip (2022)\n\t\t+ Disney World Family Trip (2020)\n3. **Albums or subfolders:** Within each trip folder, create albums or subfolders to further categorize your photos. This could be by day, location, activity, or theme. For example:\n\t* Vacations\n\t\t+ Napa Valley Getaway (2022)\n\t\t\t- Day 1: Arrival and Wine Tasting\n\t\t\t- Day 2: Castello di Amorosa and Hot Air Balloon Ride\n\t\t\t- Wineries\n\t\t\t- Scenic Views\n4. **Keywords and tags:** Consider adding keywords or tags to your photos to make them easily searchable. This could include things like:\n\t* Location (e.g., Napa Valley, Yosemite, Disney World)\n\t* Activity (e.g., wine tasting, hiking, character meet-and-greets)\n\t* Event (e.g., birthday, anniversary, holiday)\n\t* People (e.g., family, friends, solo)\n\nBy organizing your photos in this way, you'll be able to easily find specific photos and relive your travel memories.\n\nRemember, the key is to create a system that makes sense to you and is easy to maintain. You can always adjust your organization structure as you add more photos and trips.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this approach resonating with you, or do you have any other ideas for organizing your travel photos?",
