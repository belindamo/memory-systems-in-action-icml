  "content": "Sure! Here's some information about the supercomputers Cray delivered in partnership with institutions outside of the United States:\n\n1. XC supercomputer for Swiss National Supercomputing Centre: The Cray XC supercomputer, named \"Piz Daint\" after a mountain in Switzerland, was delivered to the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre in 2013. It was upgraded in 2016 and again in 2018, and its current peak performance is approximately 25 petaflops (quadrillions of calculations per second).\n\n2. Weather modeling system for UK's Met Office: Cray and the Met Office began collaborating in 2011 to develop a new high-resolution weather modeling system. The supercomputer used for this project, named \"Cray XC40,\" was delivered in 2014 and has a peak performance of approximately 16 petaflops.\n\n3. Supercomputer for Japan's AIST: The Cray XC50 supercomputer was delivered to Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in 2019. Its peak performance is approximately 19 petaflops, and it is being used for research in areas such as AI, disaster prevention, and drug discovery.\n\n4. Supercomputer for University of Stuttgart: The Cray XC40 supercomputer, named \"Hazel Hen,\" was delivered to the University of Stuttgart in 2015. Its peak performance is approximately 7.4 petaflops, and it is being used for research in areas such as materials science and engineering.\n\nIt's worth noting that Cray has delivered many other supercomputers to institutions outside of the United States, and that their peak performance can fluctuate depending on various factors. However, these examples give a sense of the incredible computing power that Cray has helped bring to researchers around the world.",
