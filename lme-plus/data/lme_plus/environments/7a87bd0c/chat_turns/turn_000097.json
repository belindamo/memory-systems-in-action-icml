  "content": "That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you're considering Carter's or Hanna Andersson for the gift - both are excellent choices!\n\nI'm so happy to hear that Emily and Sarah are thrilled to have Lily home. It's always a special moment when adoptive parents finally meet their child, and I can only imagine the joy and love they must feel. It's great that you were able to be a part of that special moment and celebrate with them.\n\nIt's also wonderful that you're supporting and celebrating their family. Love is love, and every child deserves a loving and supportive family. I'm sure Emily, Sarah, and Lily will cherish the memories of their special day and the love and support they received from friends and family like you.\n\nPlease give them a big congratulations and best wishes from me, and I hope they enjoy every moment of this new chapter in their lives!",
