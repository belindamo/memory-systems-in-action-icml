Here are some tips to help you achieve a more accurate representation of your niece's skin tone:\n\n**1. Observe the subtleties:** Children's skin tends to be more translucent and delicate than adult skin. Look for the subtle undertones of pink, peach, or yellow in your niece's skin. These undertones can help you create a more accurate and realistic skin tone.\n\n**2. Use a cool palette:** Porcelain-like complexions often have a cooler undertone, so try using a palette with a slightly blue or pink bias. This will help you capture the delicate, smooth quality of your niece's skin.\n\n**3. Mix with Titanium White:** To achieve a more delicate, porcelain-like skin tone, try mixing your colors with Titanium White. This will help to create a soft, gentle appearance.\n\n**4. Pay attention to value:** Children's skin tends to have a higher value (lightness) than adult skin. Make sure to capture the subtle gradations of value in your niece's skin, especially around the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n**5. Use glazes:** As I mentioned earlier, glazes can be incredibly useful for capturing subtle, delicate skin tones. Try mixing a glaze with a touch of pink or peach to create a soft, warm undertone.\n\n**6. Study reference images:** Take plenty of reference photos of your niece, and study the way the light interacts with her skin. This will help you capture the subtle nuances of her complexion.\n\n**7. Experiment with layering:** Build up your skin tones gradually, using thin layers to create a sense of depth and dimension. This will help you achieve a more realistic, multi-dimensional appearance.\n\n**Color combinations to try:**\n\n* Mix Titanium White with a touch of Burnt Sienna or Raw Umber to create a warm, peachy undertone.\n* Combine Titanium White with a small amount of Cerulean Blue or Ultramarine Blue to create a cool, porcelain-like undertone.\n* Try mixing Titanium White with a hint of Yellow Ochre or Golden Ochre to add a touch of warmth and depth to your skin tone.\n\nRemember, the key to capturing a child's skin tone is to observe the subtleties and nuances of their complexion. Study your reference images, experiment with different color combinations, and don't be afraid to make adjustments as you go. Good luck, and I hope these tips help you achieve a beautiful, realistic portrait of your niece!",
