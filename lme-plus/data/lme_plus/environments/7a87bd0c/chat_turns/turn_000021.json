The design and wording of the invitation can set the tone for the entire celebration. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n**Invitation Design:**\n\n* Use a traditional Chinese-inspired design, such as a red and gold color scheme, Chinese characters, or a stylized dragon or phoenix motif.\n* Incorporate a picture of Ava, either a sonogram or a recent photo, to make the invitation more personal and special.\n* Consider using a custom illustration or a watercolor design to give the invitation a unique and whimsical feel.\n\n**Invitation Wording:**\n\n* \"Join us as we celebrate the arrival of Ava, our little bundle of joy from China!\"\n* \"Michael and Sophia are thrilled to introduce their new addition, Ava! Join us for a baby shower to celebrate her adoption journey.\"\n* \"Ava's journey from China to our hearts is a story to be celebrated! Join us for a special baby shower to welcome her home.\"\n\n**Special Touches:**\n\n* Consider adding a special message or quote about adoption, love, or family to the invitation.\n* You could also include a brief story about Ava's adoption journey, such as \"Ava's journey began in China, but her heart belongs to us.\"\n* If you want to make the invitation even more personal, you could include a handwritten note or a photo of Michael, Sophia, and Ava together.\n\nHere's an example of an invitation that incorporates some of these ideas:\n\n[Front of the invitation: A beautiful watercolor design of a cherry blossom tree with Ava's name in Chinese characters]\n\n\"Join us as we celebrate the arrival of Ava, our little bundle of joy from China!\n\nMichael and Sophia are overjoyed to introduce their new addition, Ava, and would love for you to join them for a baby shower to celebrate her adoption journey.\n\nSaturday, [Date] at [Time]\n[Location]\n\nPlease RSVP by [RSVP Deadline] to let us know you're coming!\n\n[Back of the invitation: A picture of Ava and a special message]\n\n\"Ava's journey from China to our hearts is a story to be celebrated.
