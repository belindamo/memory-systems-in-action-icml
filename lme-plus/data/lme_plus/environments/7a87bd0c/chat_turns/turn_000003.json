Deciding what to keep and what to get rid of can be challenging, but here are some tips to help you make those decisions:\n\n**The 4-Box Method**:\n\n1. **Keep**: Items you use regularly, are in good condition, and bring value to your life.\n2. **Donate/Sell**: Items that are still in good condition but no longer serve a purpose for you. Consider donating or selling them to benefit others.\n3. **Recycle**: Items that can be recycled, such as paper, cardboard, or glass.\n4. **Toss**: Items that are broken, damaged, or no longer useful.\n\n**Additional Questions to Ask Yourself**:\n\n1. **When was the last time I used this item?** If it's been over a year, it's likely you can let it go.\n2. **Do I still have a purpose or need for this item?** Be honest with yourself. If you've outgrown or replaced the item, it's probably safe to let it go.\n3. **Is the item in good condition?** If it's broken or damaged beyond repair, it's likely time to say goodbye.\n4. **Can I replace this item if I need it again?** If the answer is yes, and you don't use it frequently, consider letting it go.\n5. **Does it bring me joy or serve a purpose?** This is a popular question from Marie Kondo's KonMari method. If the item doesn't bring you joy or serve a purpose, it might be time to let it go.\n\n**Common Items to Consider Getting Rid Of**:\n\n1. Broken or damaged items that can't be repaired\n2. Duplicate items (e.g., multiple hammers, tools, or gadgets)\n3. Items that no longer fit or are outdated (e.g., old sports equipment, children's toys)\n4. Items that are no longer relevant to your hobbies or interests\n5. Items that are taking up valuable space and not providing any benefit\n\n**Tips for Letting Go**:\n\n1. **Be ruthless**: It's easy to get attached to items, but remember that keeping cluttered spaces can lead to stress and disorganization.\n2. **Keep the memories, not the item**: If you're holding onto an item due to sentimental value, consider taking a photo of it and letting it go.\n3. **Enlist the help of a friend or family member**: Sometimes having someone else's perspective can help you make decisions about what to keep and what to get rid of.\n\nBy asking yourself these questions and considering these tips, you'll be able to make informed decisions about what to keep and what to get rid of. Remember, the goal is to create a more organized, functional, and peaceful space that reflects your needs and priorities.\n\nHow do you feel about getting started with purging and categorizing your garage items?
