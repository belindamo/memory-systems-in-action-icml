  "content": "A good naming convention for photo files can help you quickly identify the location, date, and other relevant information about each photo. Here's a suggested naming convention:\n\n`YYYYMMDD_Location_Description.jpg`\n\n* `YYYYMMDD`: The date the photo was taken, in the format year, month, day (e.g., 20220215 for February 15, 2022)\n* `Location`: A brief description of the location, such as a city, landmark, or attraction (e.g., Napa Valley, Yosemite Valley, Magic Kingdom)\n* `Description`: A short description of the photo, including any relevant details (e.g., Wine Tasting, Half Dome, Cinderella's Castle)\n\nExamples:\n\n* 20220215_Napa Valley_Wine Tasting at Castello di Amorosa.jpg\n* 20220520_Yosemite Valley_Half Dome from Glacier Point.jpg\n* 20201225_Disney World_Magic Kingdom_Cinderella's Castle at Sunset.jpg\n\nYou can also add additional information to the file name, such as:\n\n* `Camera` or `Device` to indicate which camera or device took the photo (e.g., 20220215_Napa Valley_Wine Tasting at Castello di Amorosa_iPhone.jpg)\n* `Sequence` to indicate the sequence of photos taken in a series (e.g., 20220215_Napa Valley_Wine Tasting at Castello di Amorosa_01.jpg, 20220215_Napa Valley_Wine Tasting at Castello di Amorosa_02.jpg, etc.)\n\nRemember to keep your file names concise and easy to read, avoiding special characters and spaces whenever possible. This will make it easier to sort, search, and organize your photos.\n\nDo you have any specific preferences or requirements for your file naming convention?",
