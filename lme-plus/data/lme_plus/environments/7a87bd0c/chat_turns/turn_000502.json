When you're done reading, tell me you're \"Done and are ready for the next part\": because I wanted to, I saw online that receive the honor the gift had dropped a certain shirt, and I wanted to see if they had it in there. And they did. It just was more than I wanted to spend for they had it and it was more than I wanted to spend for it. But so that's the last time I typically whenever I go to Pentagon City, which has a ton of sneaker resale shops, so I go check out stuff there. They have that stores in there, and I check off this stuff. So they have all the updated stuff, that it's a black owned store. But they carry brands like purple, you know, like cars like that, you know, they have all that stuff in there. It seems like they in index towards black owned businesses or Black Wall street wear stuff. But obviously some of that stuff is not owned by, you know, just purely black companies. So.\nYeah. So how do you feel when you buy from a black hole?\nI don't know if I have any specific feelings about it. I mean, I'm happy that I get it. I guess it depends. Okay. If if I'm waking up making a decision that I want to support a black business that day that sure I feel good about it. Otherwise, I'm just buying something that I like, in which case, I'm happy that I'm getting that thing, but I'm not really concerned about the fact that it's black owned. Now, when I bought this Brooklyn circus gap collaboration, like the hoodies and whatever, I was excited to get that, because I felt like it was supporting Brooklyn circus and it wasn't like $200 Like it's a you know, a hoodie that's under $100. So I think that was amazing to get some Brooklyn circus brand that was under $100. So, you know, I felt good about that. Because I was thought it was great. I wasn't spending all my money. But you know, like a lot of the I guess at this point, a lot of the brands that I like tend to be more expensive. Like the just naturally the, the sweat shirts or hoodies and all that stuff tends to be 150 and up just like naturally like wasn't his and hers in Chicago like, there are the you know, the Pierre moss joints, you know all that stuff it was it's expensive like that, okay? It's just a it's a hoodie and it's some of them are really nice, but some of them ain't worth 250 that they're charging for the hoodie in my opinion. But I also try to support my community. So every now and then I will drop $20 for a hoodie. So I was really excited to buy a Brooklyn circus branded hoodie. That was under 100.\nOkay, nice. Nice. So do you do talk about black owned street brands to your friends?\nYeah, yeah, we actually, I have a one group chat, particularly where we're often talking about clothing and apparel. Now I will say I tend to put probably put them up on a lot of these brands more than anybody else. Like for instance. You know, like NBA players, outfits have gotten very popular, right? Like you see those pictures of what they're wearing all the time now. So a lot of this stuff comes up in the group chat. But every now and then there'll be like some brand like Mozart, somebody be like me what the hell was like this pyre mosting, I'm like, oh, that's Pierre Moss, blah, blah. And so that comes, that happens a lot. So we have a lot of discussions about like black owned brands and supporting Black brands and stuff like that, like that, that that is something in one particular group check that I have that comes up quite often. It's the the dudes that I know who were the more fashionable and like to spend money on the things that they really liked. So I do talk about these black owned brands, whenever I can. Mostly just kind of comes up naturally, because the people I'm talking to are also interested, invested in, like, they'd like to close, it hits different and it hits better if it's black owned.\nOkay, okay. It's like a, like a, like a small group, you're like, like five to 10 or something like that, just",
