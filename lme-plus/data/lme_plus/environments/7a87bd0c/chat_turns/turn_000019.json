The \"Journey Begins\" stamp with a plane and the \"Forever Family\" stamp with a puzzle piece are both great choices to include in the passport.\n\nAnd I completely agree with your traditional Chinese gift ideas! A silk or brocade outfit would be a beautiful and elegant gift for Ava, and the Chinese coins tied with red string would make a thoughtful and unique gift for Michael and Sophia. The coins are also a symbol of good luck and prosperity, which would be a lovely wish for Ava's future.\n\nHere are a few more ideas to consider:\n\n* For the \"Passport to Ava\" game, you could also include a \"First Glimpse\" stamp with a picture of Ava's sonogram or a \"Welcome Home\" stamp with a picture of Ava's nursery or a special quote about home.\n* For the traditional Chinese gifts, you could consider a beautifully crafted Chinese music box or a set of intricately designed Chinese fans. These gifts would be both functional and decorative, and would add a touch of cultural elegance to Ava's nursery or playroom.\n* If you want to make the gift even more special, you could consider personalizing it with Ava's name or a special message in Chinese characters. This would make the gift even more meaningful and unique to Ava and her family.\n\nI hope these ideas help inspire you as you plan the baby shower and choose gifts for Michael, Sophia, and baby Ava!",
