You could use a simple font or a more decorative one, depending on your style.\n2. **Welcome to the family**: A heartfelt message like \"Welcome to the family, Lily\" or \"Lily, you are loved\" is a great way to commemorate her arrival and make her feel special.\n3. **Family quote**: A short quote about family or love can be a lovely addition to the blanket. Some ideas include:\n\t* \"Love is in the little things\"\n\t* \"Family is not an important thing, it's everything\"\n\t* \"You are loved beyond measure\"\n\t* \"Little one, you are loved more than words can say\"\n4. **Special message from Emily and Sarah**: If you're close to Emily and Sarah, you could ask them if they have a special message they'd like to include on the blanket.
