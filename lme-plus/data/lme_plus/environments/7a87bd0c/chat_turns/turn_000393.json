  "content": "I'd like to explore the concept of personal agency and how it relates to mindfulness and free will. I've been thinking about how my recent experiences, especially the car accident, have made me realize how fragile life is and how quickly things can change. It's made me want to focus more on the present moment and take control of my life. Can you recommend some resources on personal agency and how it connects to mindfulness and free will?",
