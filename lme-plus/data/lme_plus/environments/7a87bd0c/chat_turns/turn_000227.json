Please welcome Celestin, Julie, and Benjamin, the talented team behind an innovative animated series that aims to explain cancer to children. Welcome to the show!\n\nCelestin: Thank you, Jimmy! We're thrilled to be here.\n\nJulie: Yes, it's great to be here, and we're excited to share our project with your audience.\n\nBenjamin: Thanks for having us, Jimmy. We're looking forward to discussing our animation with you.\n\n[QUESTIONS]\n\nJimmy Kimmel: So let's jump right in. What inspired you guys to take on such a heavy topic and create a show for kids?\n\nBenjamin: Well, Jimmy, we realized that there's a lack of engaging and age-appropriate content to help kids understand complex health issues, especially cancer. So, we wanted to create something that could not only educate them but also provide comfort and support during difficult times.\n\nCelestin: Our goal is to make a positive impact on children's lives and empower them with knowledge. We believe that understanding cancer can help reduce fear and anxiety around the topic.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: Now, let's talk about the characters in your series. Who are they, and how do they help explain the message about cancer to children?\n\nJulie: The main character in our series is a young girl named Lily. She's curious, brave, and determined to learn about cancer after her grandmother is diagnosed with the disease. Along her journey, she meets various characters that represent different aspects of cancer, such as cells, treatments, and support systems.\n\nBenjamin: Each character is carefully designed to be both visually appealing and educational. We use storytelling and engaging narratives to help kids grasp the concepts better.\n\nCelestin: We also made sure to consult with medical professionals to ensure that the information we present is accurate and appropriate for our target audience.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: Money talk time! How are you planning to use the funds from your Kickstarter campaign to finance this project? Our viewers would love to know.\n\nCelestin: The funds we raise will primarily go towards covering the costs of production, such as equipment, software, and hiring additional animators and voice actors. Additionally, we will use some of the funds for marketing and distribution to ensure our animation reaches as many children as possible.\n\nJulie: We also plan to allocate a portion of the funds to collaborate with medical professionals and organizations to ensure the quality and accuracy of our content.\n\nBenjamin: Our Kickstarter campaign offers various rewards for backers, including exclusive behind-the-scenes content, personalized artwork, and even opportunities to be involved in the creative process.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: That sounds amazing! Now, what about distribution? How do you plan to reach your target audience with this show?\n\nJulie: We are exploring various distribution channels, including online platforms, schools, hospitals, and healthcare organizations. We want to make our animated series easily accessible to children and families dealing with cancer.\n\nBenjamin: We're also considering partnerships with established media organizations to help reach a broader audience.\n\nCelestin: And, of course, we're open to suggestions from our backers and supporters on how best to share our project with the world.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: Alright, that's all the time we have for now. When we come back, we'll dive deeper into the challenges the team has faced and their plans for the future. Stay tuned!\n\n\"Suite\"",
