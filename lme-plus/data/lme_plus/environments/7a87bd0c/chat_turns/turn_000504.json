  "content": "Here's the next part. When you're done reading, tell me you're \"Done and are ready for the next part\": yeah, in particular, this group chat is like 10 people. But I have like these separate groups, like I have, like specific people that I talked to for different things. So there's, I mean, anytime there's, you know, 20 or 30 random groups of people that are being talked to about these things, whenever you have these conversations between all the group chat, some are the groups that people know about these things, other ones that people that are telling you put them up on stuff. Some are the people that are putting me up on stuff, you know, but there's, you know, what I also do every now and then I'll write about this stuff, too, right? When I have a when there's something that I really like, okay, you know, I will take an opportunity to spotlight or highlight. Like, for instance, it's not a streetwear brand, necessarily a black owned T Shirt Company, but I met the owner of the company is called Stupid stank. And actually, yes, so Brianna, so the, you know, I picked up one of the shirts from Nubian human, and I took a picture of it. And then she saw it, somebody pointed out to her that I had it on, she used she started using those pictures for her like, promo stuff. Anyway, so once I got I got a line on her, you know, I did a podcast episode with her is like to talk to her about her company, and how she does things, you know, so, so if I get an opportunity to amplify these things, typically, I will. You know, when when I like you like, um, you know, especially, especially the black owned brands, right, like, you know, I wrote an article about all of the black owned brand coach shoe collaborations that I own, you know, because I feel like that highlights the brand. And the black owned brands more so than it does the shoes like I'm a big fan of like Joe Fresh goods. And all of his new balance collaborations, like I have, not all of them but I have a substantial number of those but I've written about Joe Fresh goods and the campaign's that he's done, that are very black in nature, like the stuff that he did, or, you know, the conversations among us are the inside voices outside quote, all this stuff, like I've written about all of those things, because I like to amplify that stuff. It's not like he needs it, he has a huge following, but, you know, I feel like it's me doing my little part where I can to amplify, you know, black culture where where I can.\nOkay, cool, cool. And then I see that when when you're searching for brands, is it using your phone or computer? Is that a mixed or?\nThat's probably 90% My phone 10% My Computer,\nokay. Okay. So to shift a little bit on the technology front and a little more on the technology front. If you're creating playlists, right music playlists, what aspects of creating music playlists Do you enjoy? Oh,\nwas a couple of things. I like like most people who if you make playlists, you're always trying to create the perfect playlist. So I like putting in songs together and feeling like I literally put the perfect sequence of songs together, obviously feel and vibe like you know, like, I have a playlist for instance that I've been putting together that I call like PJ's keep up. Because it's all the songs my younger artists that my nieces and nephews just keep putting me up. All right, so I'm putting this together. But as I listen to these things, it introduces me to new artists and like, let me add this to it. Let me see if I can find it artists that work. So I like the discovery piece of it. Because, you know, there's I like how the algorithms that they have will send you in the direction on its own to find new new artists. So, you know, I enjoy trying to put together a perfect playlist, which, you know, I have not done yet.",
