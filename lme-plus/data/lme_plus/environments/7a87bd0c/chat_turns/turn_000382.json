  "content": "Yes, there should definitely be more pressure on governments and leaders to prioritize peace and stability for the sake of economic development. Conflict and instability can have far-reaching effects on economic growth, international trade, and investment, and can hinder efforts to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.\n\nGovernments and leaders have a responsibility to ensure that their policies and actions do not contribute to conflict and instability and that they work towards promoting peace and stability in their regions. International organizations and the international community can help to set standards and norms that promote conflict prevention, peacemaking, and post-conflict reconstruction. Governments and leaders can be held accountable for their actions and policies towards conflict prevention and resolution, and there can be incentives for positive actions that promote peace.\n\nMoreover, business leaders, civil society, and the general public can also play a role in promoting peace and stability. Companies can adopt responsible business practices that support peace and stability, civil society can advocate for peace and build bridges across communities and cultures, and the general public can engage in peacebuilding activities and support initiatives that promote peace.\n\nIn conclusion, there needs to be more pressure on governments and leaders to prioritize peace and stability for the sake of economic development, and a concerted effort by all stakeholders to promote peace and prevent conflict. By working together towards this common goal, we can create a more peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.",
