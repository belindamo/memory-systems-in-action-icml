  "content": "To collect information on the authentication attempt, the incident response team should review logs from various sources, such as:\n\n1. Authentication logs: Review logs from the affected system or application to determine the origin of the authentication attempt, including the source IP address and username used to authenticate.\n2. VPN logs: Check the VPN logs to identify the source of the VPN connection, the IP address of the user and any other relevant information.\n3. Network logs: Analyze network traffic logs to identify any unusual patterns or behaviors, such as suspicious traffic from the source IP address or unauthorized access attempts.\n4. Firewall logs: Review firewall logs to identify any attempts to bypass security measures or to access restricted resources.\n5. Endpoint logs: Examine endpoint logs to determine if any malware or malicious activity was detected on the system, and if so, what actions were taken.\n6. Other security logs: Review other security logs, such as intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), web application firewalls (WAF), and anti-virus/malware systems to determine if any alerts were triggered and what actions were taken.\n\nBy collecting information from these various sources, the incident response team can gain a better understanding of the authentication attempt and determine the appropriate course of action to respond to the incident.",
