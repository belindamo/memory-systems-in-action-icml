  "content": "Categorizing cleaning supplies can be a bit tricky, but I'm happy to help you out.\n\nBoth methods you mentioned, categorizing by room or by type of cleaning product, have their advantages. Here's a breakdown of each approach to help you decide:\n\n**Categorizing by Room:**\n\n* Advantages:\n\t+ Easy to find what you need for a specific room or area.\n\t+ Helps you remember which products are needed for each room.\n* Disadvantages:\n\t+ May lead to duplication of products (e.g., having multiple all-purpose cleaners for different rooms).\n\t+ Can be less efficient if you have similar products used in multiple rooms.\n\n**Categorizing by Type of Cleaning Product:**\n\n* Advantages:\n\t+ Reduces duplication of products.\n\t+ Makes it easier to find similar products and compare labels.\n\t+ Can help you identify areas where you have too many similar products.\n* Disadvantages:\n\t+ May require more time to find what you need for a specific room or task.\n\t+ Can be overwhelming if you have a large collection of cleaning products.\n\nHere's a hybrid approach you might consider:\n\n**Categorize by Category, then by Room:**\n\n* Divide your cleaning supplies into categories (e.g., all-purpose cleaners, glass cleaners, disinfectants, etc.).\n* Within each category, group products by room or area (e.g., all the bathroom cleaning products together, all the kitchen cleaning products together, etc.).\n\nThis approach combines the benefits of both methods. You'll have similar products together, reducing duplication and making it easier to compare labels, while still having a sense of which products are needed for each room.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Store cleaning products in a well-ventilated area, away from children and pets.\n* Consider using a caddy or bucket with separate compartments to keep products organized and portable.\n* Label each category or room section clearly, so you can easily find what you need.\n* Keep frequently used products in easy-to-reach locations, and less frequently used products on higher or harder-to-reach shelves.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and your cleaning needs. Experiment with different approaches until you find one that feels comfortable and efficient.",
