Encourage creativity and imagination!\n4. **Map Scavenger Hunt**: Hide maps of China or significant locations from the adoption journey around the party area. Give each guest a list of clues to find the maps, which ultimately lead to a special surprise or treat.\n5. **Wishing Tree**: Set up a beautiful tree or branch where guests can write notes, wishes, and advice for Ava's future on small paper leaves or cards. This creates a heartfelt and personalized keepsake for Michael and Sophia.\n6. **Adoption Trivia**: Prepare a quiz about adoption, China, or the adoption process.
