He also starts to take more photographs on his own, using the UV technique.\n\nThomas becomes more and more interested in this new art form, and he starts to dedicate more time to it, even outside of his work with Mia. He starts to attend workshops, read books, and watch online tutorials to improve his skills.\n\nAs he becomes more proficient in UV photography, he starts to gain recognition in the photography community. His photographs start to get featured in galleries and exhibitions, and he starts to get offers for projects and collaborations.\n\nHowever, this new passion starts to cause some tension between Thomas and Mia. Thomas starts to spend more time working on his UV photographs and less time with her, which leads to her feeling neglected.\n\nThomas, torn between his love for Mia and his passion for UV photography, starts to feel guilty and confused. He starts to struggle with choosing between the two, and this causes further conflict within their relationship.\n\nThe scene ends with Thomas sitting in his studio, surrounded by his beautiful UV photographs, with a look of confusion on his face, knowing that he has to make a difficult decision between his new passion and the woman he loves.\n\nThe end."
