Talk, sing, or wear bear bells to alert them to your presence.\n* Avoid hiking at dawn, dusk, or night when bears are most active.\n* Stay on designated trails and avoid taking shortcuts or wandering off-trail.\n* Be aware of your surroundings and watch for signs of bears, such as tracks, scat, or digging.\n\n**Bear-Resistant Food Containers:**\n\n* If you don't have a bear canister, you can rent or purchase bear-resistant food containers at local outfitters or visitor centers.\n* Make sure the container is specifically designed for bear resistance and meets the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee (IGBC) standards.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* Check with the Inyo National Forest website or visitor centers for up-to-date bear safety information and regulations.\n* Consult the John Muir Wilderness website for more information on bear safety and camping regulations.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to bear safety.
