When you're done reading, tell me you're \"Done and are ready for the next part\": because I wanted to, I saw online that receive the honor the gift had dropped a certain shirt, and I wanted to see if they had it in there. And they did. It just was more than I wanted to spend for they had it and it was more than I wanted to spend for it. But so that's the last time I typically whenever I go to Pentagon City, which has a ton of sneaker resale shops, so I go check out stuff there. They have that stores in there, and I check off this stuff. So they have all the updated stuff, that it's a black owned store. But they carry brands like purple, you know, like cars like that, you know, they have all that stuff in there. It seems like they in index towards black owned businesses or Black Wall street wear stuff. But obviously some of that stuff is not owned by, you know, just purely black companies. So.\nYeah. So how do you feel when you buy from a black hole?\nI don't know if I have any specific feelings about it. I mean, I'm happy that I get it. I guess it depends. Okay. If if I'm waking up making a decision that I want to support a black business that day that sure I feel good about it. Otherwise, I'm just buying something that I like, in which case, I'm happy that I'm getting that thing, but I'm not really concerned about the fact that it's black owned. Now, when I bought this Brooklyn circus gap collaboration, like the hoodies and whatever, I was excited to get that, because I felt like it was supporting Brooklyn circus and it wasn't like $200 Like it's a you know, a hoodie that's under $100. So I think that was amazing to get some Brooklyn circus brand that was under $100. So, you know, I felt good about that. Because I was thought it was great. I wasn't spending all my money. But you know, like a lot of the I guess at this point, a lot of the brands that I like tend to be more expensive. Like the just naturally the, the sweat shirts or hoodies and all that stuff tends to be 150 and up just like naturally like wasn't his and hers in Chicago like, there are the you know, the Pierre moss joints, you know all that stuff it was it's expensive like that, okay? It's just a it's a hoodie and it's some of them are really nice, but some of them ain't worth 250 that they're charging for the hoodie in my opinion. But I also try to support my community. So every now and then I will drop $20 for a hoodie. So I was really excited to buy a Brooklyn circus branded hoodie. That was under 100.\nOkay, nice. Nice. So do you do talk about black owned street brands to your friends?\nYeah, yeah, we actually, I have a one group chat, particularly where we're often talking about clothing and apparel. Now I will say I tend to put probably put them up on a lot of these brands more than anybody else. Like for instance. You know, like NBA players, outfits have gotten very popular, right? Like you see those pictures of what they're wearing all the time now. So a lot of this stuff comes up in the group chat. But every now and then there'll be like some brand like Mozart, somebody be like me what the hell was like this pyre mosting, I'm like, oh, that's Pierre Moss, blah, blah. And so that comes, that happens a lot. So we have a lot of discussions about like black owned brands and supporting Black brands and stuff like that, like that, that that is something in one particular group check that I have that comes up quite often. It's the the dudes that I know who were the more fashionable and like to spend money on the things that they really liked. So I do talk about these black owned brands, whenever I can. Mostly just kind of comes up naturally, because the people I'm talking to are also interested, invested in, like, they'd like to close, it hits different and it hits better if it's black owned.\nOkay, okay. It's like a, like a, like a small group, you're like, like five to 10 or something like that, just"

      "content": "Here's the next part. When you're done reading, tell me you're \"Done and are ready for the next part\": yeah, in particular, this group chat is like 10 people. But I have like these separate groups, like I have, like specific people that I talked to for different things. So there's, I mean, anytime there's, you know, 20 or 30 random groups of people that are being talked to about these things, whenever you have these conversations between all the group chat, some are the groups that people know about these things, other ones that people that are telling you put them up on stuff. Some are the people that are putting me up on stuff, you know, but there's, you know, what I also do every now and then I'll write about this stuff, too, right? When I have a when there's something that I really like, okay, you know, I will take an opportunity to spotlight or highlight. Like, for instance, it's not a streetwear brand, necessarily a black owned T Shirt Company, but I met the owner of the company is called Stupid stank. And actually, yes, so Brianna, so the, you know, I picked up one of the shirts from Nubian human, and I took a picture of it. And then she saw it, somebody pointed out to her that I had it on, she used she started using those pictures for her like, promo stuff. Anyway, so once I got I got a line on her, you know, I did a podcast episode with her is like to talk to her about her company, and how she does things, you know, so, so if I get an opportunity to amplify these things, typically, I will. You know, when when I like you like, um, you know, especially, especially the black owned brands, right, like, you know, I wrote an article about all of the black owned brand coach shoe collaborations that I own, you know, because I feel like that highlights the brand. And the black owned brands more so than it does the shoes like I'm a big fan of like Joe Fresh goods. And all of his new balance collaborations, like I have, not all of them but I have a substantial number of those but I've written about Joe Fresh goods and the campaign's that he's done, that are very black in nature, like the stuff that he did, or, you know, the conversations among us are the inside voices outside quote, all this stuff, like I've written about all of those things, because I like to amplify that stuff. It's not like he needs it, he has a huge following, but, you know, I feel like it's me doing my little part where I can to amplify, you know, black culture where where I can.\nOkay, cool, cool. And then I see that when when you're searching for brands, is it using your phone or computer? Is that a mixed or?\nThat's probably 90% My phone 10% My Computer,\nokay. Okay. So to shift a little bit on the technology front and a little more on the technology front. If you're creating playlists, right music playlists, what aspects of creating music playlists Do you enjoy? Oh,\nwas a couple of things. I like like most people who if you make playlists, you're always trying to create the perfect playlist. So I like putting in songs together and feeling like I literally put the perfect sequence of songs together, obviously feel and vibe like you know, like, I have a playlist for instance that I've been putting together that I call like PJ's keep up. Because it's all the songs my younger artists that my nieces and nephews just keep putting me up. All right, so I'm putting this together. But as I listen to these things, it introduces me to new artists and like, let me add this to it. Let me see if I can find it artists that work. So I like the discovery piece of it. Because, you know, there's I like how the algorithms that they have will send you in the direction on its own to find new new artists. So, you know, I enjoy trying to put together a perfect playlist, which, you know, I have not done yet."
