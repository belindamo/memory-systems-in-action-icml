      "content": "Yes, Cray has collaborated with several companies and research institutions outside the United States. Below are some examples:\n\n1. Partnership with Swiss National Supercomputing Centre: In 2014, Cray partnered with Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) to deliver a new XC supercomputer. This collaboration aimed to provide researchers with increased computing power and speed.\n\n2. Collaboration with Met Office in the UK: Cray collaborated with the UK\u2019s Met Office to develop new models of weather prediction. This partnership aimed to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting in the UK.\n\n3. Collaboration with Japan\u2019s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology: In 2019, Cray partnered with Japan\u2019s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) to deliver a new supercomputer. This collaboration aimed to support research in areas such as artificial intelligence, disaster prevention, and drug discovery.\n\n4. Collaboration with University of Stuttgart in Germany: Cray collaborated with the University of Stuttgart in Germany to deliver a new supercomputer in 2017. This collaboration aimed to advance research in fields such as materials science and engineering.\n\nThese are just a few examples of Cray\u2019s collaborations outside of the United States. The company has worked with many other organizations in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere to develop innovative supercomputing solutions."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure! Here's some information about the supercomputers Cray delivered in partnership with institutions outside of the United States:\n\n1. XC supercomputer for Swiss National Supercomputing Centre: The Cray XC supercomputer, named \"Piz Daint\" after a mountain in Switzerland, was delivered to the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre in 2013. It was upgraded in 2016 and again in 2018, and its current peak performance is approximately 25 petaflops (quadrillions of calculations per second).\n\n2. Weather modeling system for UK's Met Office: Cray and the Met Office began collaborating in 2011 to develop a new high-resolution weather modeling system. The supercomputer used for this project, named \"Cray XC40,\" was delivered in 2014 and has a peak performance of approximately 16 petaflops.\n\n3. Supercomputer for Japan's AIST: The Cray XC50 supercomputer was delivered to Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in 2019. Its peak performance is approximately 19 petaflops, and it is being used for research in areas such as AI, disaster prevention, and drug discovery.\n\n4. Supercomputer for University of Stuttgart: The Cray XC40 supercomputer, named \"Hazel Hen,\" was delivered to the University of Stuttgart in 2015. Its peak performance is approximately 7.4 petaflops, and it is being used for research in areas such as materials science and engineering.\n\nIt's worth noting that Cray has delivered many other supercomputers to institutions outside of the United States, and that their peak performance can fluctuate depending on various factors. However, these examples give a sense of the incredible computing power that Cray has helped bring to researchers around the world."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, the Piz Daint supercomputer installed at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre has been used on a variety of scientific research projects. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Climate modeling: Piz Daint has been used to simulate the Earth's climate, including the impact of human activities on the environment. Researchers have run complex simulations to study topics such as cloud formation, ocean circulation, and atmospheric chemistry.\n\n2. Materials science: The supercomputer has also been used to simulate the behavior of materials at the atomic and molecular level. Researchers have studied the properties of materials used in everything from solar cells to computer chips, with the goal of developing new materials with specific properties.\n\n3. Astrophysics: Piz Daint has been used to simulate the universe on a large scale, with the goal of understanding topics such as dark matter and the formation of galaxies.\n\n4. Life sciences: The supercomputer has been used to study the human brain, including simulations of neural networks and the effects of Alzheimer's disease. It has also been used to study proteins and enzymes, with the goal of developing new drugs.\n\nOverall, Piz Daint has been used on a wide range of scientific research projects, demonstrating the diversity of applications for high-performance computing."
