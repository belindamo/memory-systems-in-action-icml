Since I took a 10-day break from social media from February 15th to 25th, I'm curious to see how my habits have changed since then. Can I set up RescueTime to track my social media usage from that date onwards?"

      "content": "RescueTime does allow you to set a start date for tracking, but it's not exactly possible to set it to track from a specific date in the past, like February 15th. Here's why:\n\n**RescueTime's tracking limitations:**\n\nRescueTime can only track data from the moment you install the app and start tracking. It doesn't have the ability to retroactively track your data from a previous date. This means that if you install RescueTime today, it will only start tracking your data from today onwards.\n\nHowever, you can still use RescueTime to track your social media usage from now on, and compare your current habits to your previous ones. Here's a workaround:\n\n**Workaround:**\n\n1. **Install RescueTime**: Download and install the RescueTime app on your phone and/or computer.\n2. **Set up tracking**: Follow the setup process to configure RescueTime to track your app usage, including social media apps.\n3. **Wait for a few weeks**: Let RescueTime collect data on your social media usage for a few weeks. This will give you a baseline understanding of your current habits.\n4. **Compare to your previous habits**: Reflect on your experiences during your 10-day social media break and compare them to your current habits. You can use your own observations and notes to compare your pre-break habits to your current ones.\n5. **Analyze your RescueTime reports**: Once you have a few weeks of data, analyze your RescueTime reports to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement in your social media usage.\n\nWhile you won't be able to track your social media usage from February 15th onwards, you can still use RescueTime to monitor your current habits and make informed decisions to optimize your social media usage.\n\nRemember, the goal is to understand your habits and make positive changes. By tracking your social media usage with RescueTime, you'll be able to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to reduce your social media usage or optimize your online time."
