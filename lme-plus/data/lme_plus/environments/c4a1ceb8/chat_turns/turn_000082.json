I'm sure you've got some stories to share and insights to glean from your recent stays.\n\nSo, tell me, how did your recent hotel experiences shape your preferences? Were there any standout amenities, services, or features that impressed you? Were there any disappointments or surprises?\n\nWhich of the three hotels did you like the most, and what made it stand out? Was it the location, the staff, the room itself, or something else entirely?\n\nAnd, on the flip side, were there any hotels that didn't quite meet your expectations? What did they lack, and how did that impact your stay?\n\nSharing your experiences can help you process your thoughts and solidify your preferences. Plus, I'm all ears (or rather, all text) and would love to hear about your adventures!",
