  "content": "Cricket's popularity has expanded well beyond South Asia to become a global sport. Nowadays, cricket is played internationally and has a growing fan base globally. Countries like England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the West Indies are among the most prominent cricket-playing nations outside of South Asia.\n\nFurthermore, cricket's inclusion in the Olympics is currently under consideration, which could introduce the sport to new audiences and a more extensive fan base.\n\nIn recent years, there has also been an increase in the number of foreign players participating in South Asian leagues like IPL, PSL, BPL, and SLPL, which has helped to promote the sport internationally.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to assume that cricket will continue its growth in popularity, not only in South Asia but also in other parts of the world where it is gaining popularity.",
