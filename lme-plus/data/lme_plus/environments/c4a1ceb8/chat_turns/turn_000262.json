I just assembled a new bookshelf from IKEA and it's now proudly standing in my living room holding all my favorite novels and decorative items. I rearranged the room last weekend to create more space and a better flow, and I'm loving the new layout. Can you suggest some ideas for adding a statement piece to the room?",
