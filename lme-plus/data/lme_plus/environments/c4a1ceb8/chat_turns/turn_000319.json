Rioja wine and citrus slices provide a fantastic base, and adding complementary fruits and herbs can create a unique and refreshing drink. Here are some suggestions to get you started:\n\n1. **Peaches**: Sliced or diced peaches will add a sweet, juicy flavor to your Sangria. They pair beautifully with the citrus and will complement the Rioja wine nicely.\n2. **Berries**: Mix in some fresh or frozen berries like strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries to add a pop of color and sweetness. Berries will also enhance the fruity flavors in the Rioja wine.\n3. **Apples**: Thinly sliced apples, such as Granny Smith or Gala, will add a crisp, refreshing flavor to your Sangria. Apples pair well with citrus and will complement the wine's acidity.\n4. **Pineapple**: Fresh pineapple chunks or slices will add a tropical twist to your Sangria. The sweetness of the pineapple will balance out the acidity of the citrus and wine.\n5. **Mint**: Fresh mint leaves or sprigs will add a bright, refreshing flavor to your Sangria. You can muddle the mint leaves with the citrus slices and berries for added flavor.\n6. **Orange blossoms**: If you want to emphasize the citrus flavors, consider adding a few orange blossoms to your Sangria. The delicate, floral flavor will complement the orange slices and add a subtle complexity to the drink.\n7. **Cinnamon sticks**: For a warm, spicy flavor, add a few cinnamon sticks to your Sangria. The cinnamon will complement the fruit flavors and add depth to the drink.\n8. **Ginger**: Thinly sliced or grated ginger will add a spicy, warming flavor to your Sangria. The ginger will also help to balance out the sweetness of the fruit.\n\nRemember to adjust the amount of fruits and herbs according to your personal taste preferences. You can also experiment with different combinations to create a unique flavor profile. Don't forget to let the flavors meld together in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse properly.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you create a delicious and refreshing Sangria to serve alongside your Paella and tapas!",
