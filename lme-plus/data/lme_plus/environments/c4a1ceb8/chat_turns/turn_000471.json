Here's why:\n\n1. **Richness and flavor:** Heavy cream will provide a richer, more luxurious flavor to your sauce, which is perfect for an Italian pasta dish. Half-and-half, with its lower fat content, might make the sauce slightly lighter and less indulgent.\n2. **Parmesan cheese:** Since your recipe includes Parmesan cheese, which has a strong, salty flavor, you'll want a cream that can balance it out. Heavy cream's higher fat content will help to counterbalance the saltiness of the Parmesan, while half-and-half might make the cheese overpower the sauce.\n3. **Texture:** Heavy cream will give your sauce a thicker, more velvety texture that coats the pasta nicely. Half-and-half might produce a slightly thinner sauce, which could result in a less satisfying mouthfeel.\n\nThat being said, if you only have half-and-half on hand or prefer a lighter sauce, you can still use it. Just keep in mind that the flavor and texture might be slightly different. You can also try a combination of half-and-half and a small amount of butter or oil to enhance the richness and flavor.\n\nIf you do decide to use half-and-half, here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:\n\n* Use a higher ratio of half-and-half to butter and Parmesan cheese to compensate for the lower fat content.\n* Add a pinch of salt to balance out the flavor.\n* Whisk the sauce constantly over low heat to prevent it from breaking or becoming too thick.\n* Consider adding a roux or a slurry to thicken the sauce, if needed.\n\nRemember, the key to a great creamy sauce is to cook it slowly, whisk constantly, and taste as you go to adjust the seasoning. Good luck, and I hope your dinner turns out delicious!",
