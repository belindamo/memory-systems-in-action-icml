One of the programs they offer is the Partnership Grants scheme, which aims to support schools in the UK to engage their students in STEM-based projects related to climate change and sustainability. The grants are open to schools working with students aged 5-18, and cover various expenses, including equipment, materials, and transport costs.\n\nThe Royal Society also supports various citizen science initiatives, such as Climate Tracker, where individuals can use their smartphones to collect data on weather patterns, biodiversity, and other aspects of the natural environment. This data is then used by scientists to better understand climate change and the impact of humans on ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, the Royal Society offers a range of educational resources and materials, including teaching guides and lesson plans, that individuals can use to learn more about climate change and how to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. \n\nOverall, individuals can participate in these programs and initiatives to make a positive contribution to the effort to address climate change. These initiatives encourage active citizenship and support individuals in taking action to reduce their environmental impact.",
