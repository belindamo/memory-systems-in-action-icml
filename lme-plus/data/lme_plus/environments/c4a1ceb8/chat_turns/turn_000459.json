  "content": "I think there's been a mix-up! Joshua Tree Music Festival is not a real festival, and it didn't take place on June 8th with The Black Keys, The 1975, and Tame Impala as headliners. It's possible that you might be thinking of a different festival or event.\n\nHowever, I'm happy to help you with your question about finding similar vibes at Outside Lands! While every festival has its unique atmosphere, Outside Lands is known for its eclectic lineup, beautiful setting in Golden Gate Park, and San Francisco's laid-back vibe. If you enjoyed the indie/alternative sounds and camping experience at your previous festival, you might find similar vibes at Outside Lands.\n\nOutside Lands features a diverse lineup with a focus on indie, alternative, and psychedelic rock, which might appeal to fans of The Black Keys, The 1975, and Tame Impala. The festival also offers a range of activities, food, and art installations that can enhance your overall experience.\n\nThat being said, keep in mind that Outside Lands is a larger festival compared to some other events, and the atmosphere might be different from a smaller, more intimate festival like Joshua Tree (if it existed). However, with its beautiful setting and diverse lineup, Outside Lands can still offer a unique and unforgettable experience.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for you to explore Outside Lands and discover new music and vibes!",
