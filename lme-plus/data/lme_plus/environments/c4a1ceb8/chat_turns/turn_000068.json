  "content": "Certainly! Based on your preferences, I would recommend trying a coffee blend that contains beans from Ethiopia or Yemen. These regions are known for producing coffee with a fruity and floral flavor profile. Here are a few specific blends to consider:\n\n1. Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - This coffee has a light body and a flavor that's floral and citrusy.\n\n2. Ethiopian Sidamo - A coffee with a subtle berry flavor and a smooth finish.\n\n3. Yemen Mocha Matari - A coffee that delivers notes of chocolate, fruit, and spice.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are plenty of other options available depending on your taste preferences. I'd suggest trying out different blends from specialty coffee shops or roasters that carry single-origin coffees to find one that's perfect for you.",
