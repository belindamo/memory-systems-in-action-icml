It's good that you're taking proactive steps to maintain your bike and ensure it's running smoothly.\n\nA good bike shop should be able to diagnose and fix the issues with the gears and chain, and also give your bike a thorough inspection to identify any other potential problems. They might also recommend any additional maintenance or upgrades to keep your Giant TCR Advanced in top condition.\n\nIn the meantime, have you thought about doing any additional maintenance or cleaning on your bike while it's in the shop? This could be a good opportunity to give your bike a thorough cleaning, inspect the tires, and check the brake pads, for example.\n\nAlso, do you have a regular maintenance routine for your bike, or is this the first time you've taken it in for repairs?",
