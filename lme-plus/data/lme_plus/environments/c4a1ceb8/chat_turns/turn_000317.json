Here are some refreshing summer drinks that would pair beautifully with your Paella and tapas:\n\n1. **Sangria Spritz**: A twist on the classic Sangria, made with Rioja wine, lemon-lime soda, and a splash of citrus juice (orange, lemon, or grapefruit). Serve over ice with a sprig of mint.\n2. **Gin & Tonic with a Spanish Twist**: Infuse your G&T with Spanish flavors by using a citrus-forward gin, adding a splash of olive brine, and garnishing with a slice of orange or lemon and a sprig of rosemary.\n3. **Cava Cocktail**: Mix Cava (Spanish sparkling wine) with a splash of peach liqueur, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a dash of cinnamon. Serve in a champagne flute with a slice of peach.\n4. **Spanish Mule**: A variation of the Moscow Mule, made with ginger beer, lime juice, and Spanish gin or vodka.
