Since you've seen success with a short training block before, let's focus on a condensed plan to help you boost your running endurance. Here are some tips to help you achieve your goal:\n\n1. **Increase frequency, not just volume**: Instead of trying to cram in more miles, focus on increasing your running frequency. Aim for 3-4 runs per week, with one or two being shorter, high-intensity sessions (20-30 minutes) and the others being longer, endurance-based runs (30-45 minutes).\n2. **Incorporate interval training**: Intervals are an excellent way to improve running efficiency and endurance. Try incorporating interval workouts like:\n\t* 4-6 x 400m at a fast pace, with 200m active recovery\n\t* 3-5 x 800m at a moderate pace, with 400m active recovery\n\t* Hill sprints: 3-5 x 100-200m uphill at maximum effort, with 200-400m active recovery\n3. **Strength training for runners**: Focus on exercises that target your core, glutes, and legs. This will help improve your running efficiency and endurance. Incorporate exercises like:\n\t* Squats, lunges, and deadlifts\n\t* Calf raises and step-ups\n\t* Leg press and leg extensions\n\t* Planks and side planks\n4. **Incorporate strength-based runs**: Incorporate strength-based runs, such as:\n\t* Hill repeats: Run up a hill at a high intensity, then recover by walking or jogging back down\n\t* Progression runs: Start at a moderate pace and gradually increase your speed throughout the run\n5. **Plyometrics and explosive training**: Incorporate plyometric exercises like jump squats, box jumps, and bounding to improve your running power and efficiency.\n6. **Proper nutrition and recovery**: Make sure you're fueling your body with a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting adequate rest and recovery. This will help your body adapt to the demands of increased training.\n7. **Taper and rest**: With three weeks to go, it's essential to balance your training with rest and recovery. Make sure to include one or two rest days per week and reduce your overall training volume by 20-30% in the last week leading up to your triathlon.\n8. **Brick workouts**: Incorporate brick workouts that simulate the transition from the bike to the run. This will help your body adapt to the demands of the triathlon.\n9. **Mental preparation**: Visualize yourself performing well during the run portion of the triathlon. Focus on positive self-talk, and remind yourself of your recent 5K success.\n10. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help your body recover and adapt to the demands of training.\n\nRemember to stay flexible and adjust your training plan as needed. With focused training and attention to recovery, you can make significant improvements to your running endurance in just three weeks. Good luck with your sprint triathlon!",
