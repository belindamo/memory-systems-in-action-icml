  "content": "While hurricanes and typhoons are specific to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, respectively, other regions of the world do experience similar types of storms. For example, in the Indian Ocean, similar storms are called cyclones, while in the southeastern Pacific and southwestern Atlantic, they are called tropical or subtropical cyclones.\n\nThese types of storms form in similar ways to hurricanes and typhoons, with warm water providing the fuel and other favorable conditions allowing for their development. However, they may have slightly different characteristics and may be referred to by different names depending on the region.\n\nRegardless of their name, these storms can be extremely dangerous and damaging to coastal areas, and it is important for residents in affected areas to pay close attention to weather warnings and be prepared for potential impacts.",
