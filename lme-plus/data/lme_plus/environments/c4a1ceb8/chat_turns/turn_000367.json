With three weeks to go until your sprint triathlon, it's a good idea to focus on a combination of both increasing your mileage and intensity. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n**Mileage:**\n\n* Gradually increase your weekly mileage by 10-15% each week. This will help your body adapt to the demands of running longer distances.\n* Aim to do one longer run per week, around 30-40 minutes, at a moderate pace. This will help your body build endurance and get comfortable with longer distances.\n\n**Intensity:**\n\n* Incorporate one high-intensity interval (HIIT) workout per week. This could be a interval workout like 4-6 x 400m at a fast pace, with 200m active recovery.\n* Add one hill repeat workout per week. Find a route with a gradual incline and run up the hill at a high intensity. Walk or jog back down to recover, and repeat for 20-30 minutes.\n* Increase the intensity of your shorter runs by adding strides or surges. For example, do 5-10 minutes of easy running, followed by 5-10 minutes of faster running with 1-2 minutes of active recovery.\n\n**Combination:**\n\n* One day per week, do a combination workout that includes both mileage and intensity. For example, do a 20-minute easy run, followed by 10-15 minutes of hill repeats, and finish with 10-15 minutes of easy running.\n* Another day, do a HIIT workout, followed by 10-15 minutes of easy running to cool down.\n\n**Example Weekly Schedule:**\n\n* Monday: Easy 30-minute run\n* Tuesday: Strength training (glute bridges, step-downs, Russian twists)\n* Wednesday: HIIT workout (4-6 x 400m)\n* Thursday: Rest day or easy 20-minute run\n* Friday: Hill repeat workout (20-30 minutes)\n* Saturday: Longer run (30-40 minutes) at a moderate pace\n* Sunday: Rest day or easy 20-minute run\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust the schedule as needed. If you feel like you're doing too much, take an extra rest day or reduce the intensity of your workouts. With a combination of increased mileage and intensity, you'll be well-prepared for your sprint triathlon.",
