Here are some tips to help you preserve and display it beautifully:\n\n**Preservation:**\n\n1. **Handle with care**: Concert ticket stubs can be fragile, so handle them gently to avoid creasing, bending, or tearing.\n2. **Keep it dry**: Avoid exposing the ticket stub to moisture, as it can cause discoloration or damage.\n3. **Avoid direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause fading or discoloration, so it's best to keep the ticket stub away from direct sunlight or use UV-filtering glass or acrylic in your frame.\n\n**Framing:**\n\n1. **Choose the right frame**: Select a frame that's specifically designed for ticket stubs or small memorabilia. You can opt for a standard frame or a deep frame to create a shadow box effect.\n2. **Use acid-free materials**: Ensure the frame's matting, backing, and adhesives are acid-free to prevent damage to the ticket stub over time.\n3. **Matting**: Consider using a mat with a subtle color that complements the ticket stub's design. This will help draw attention to the ticket and add a professional touch.\n4. **Secure the ticket stub**: Use a gentle adhesive, like a spray adhesive or a conservation-grade tape, to secure the ticket stub to the mat or backing. Avoid using glue or tape that can damage the ticket.\n5. **Glass or acrylic**: Use glass or acrylic that's specifically designed for framing to protect the ticket stub from dust and UV light.\n\n**Display:**\n\n1. **Keep it simple**: Avoid cluttering the frame with too many items. A simple, elegant design will let the ticket stub take center stage.\n2. **Consider a caption**: Add a small caption or plaque with the concert details, like the date, venue, and artist, to provide context and make the display more interesting.\n3. **Hang it proudly**: Display your framed ticket stub in a place of pride, like a music room, office, or living room.\n\nSome popular framing options for concert ticket stubs include:\n\n* Shadow box frames with a deep recess to create a 3D effect\n* Floating frames that make the ticket stub appear to be floating within the frame\n* DIY frames with a collage of multiple ticket stubs or memorabilia\n\nRemember to handle your ticket stub with care, and with these tips, you'll be able to create a beautiful display that will preserve the memory of your amazing Billie Eilish concert experience!",
