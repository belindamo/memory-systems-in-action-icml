  "content": "The amount of time it takes to travel between destinations using the subway can vary depending on the distance between the subway stations and the train lines' frequency. However, the good news is that the New York City subway system is reasonably reliable and fast compared to other modes of transportation. You can expect a travel time that ranges from 15 to 45 minutes on average for most popular tourist spots within Manhattan. However, travel times can be longer during peak commuting hours or if there are any scheduled delays or interruptions. It's always advisable to add extra time to your travel plans or check the MTA website or app for any service changes or delays.",
