Watching sports with loved ones is always a great way to create memories, and it's even better when you have some delicious snacks to enjoy together. Popcorn and sodas are a classic combo for game day, and I'm sure it added to the excitement of watching the College Football National Championship game.\n\nIt's great that you and your family had such a great time together, and I'm sure you'll have just as much fun with your coworkers at Tom's Urban before the Lakers game. Enjoy the game, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more recommendations or tips!",
