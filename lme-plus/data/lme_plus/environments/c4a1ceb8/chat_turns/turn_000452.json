  "content": "I'm looking for some new music recommendations. I've been to a few festivals and concerts recently, and I'm loving the indie/alternative vibe. Speaking of which, the week before last, on June 8th, I went to the Joshua Tree Music Festival in Indio, California, and it was amazing! I saw some great acts like The Black Keys and Tame Impala. Any suggestions for similar artists or bands I might like?",
