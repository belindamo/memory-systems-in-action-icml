You spent $500 in total, which is a significant amount. Breaking it down, you spent $350 on the 4K TV from Best Buy, which seems like a great deal considering the original price. And you also got the sneakers from Foot Locker for 30% off, which is a nice discount.\n\nHere's a quick tip: When you're tracking your expenses, it's essential to categorize them correctly. You might want to create a category for \"Electronics\" for the TV and \"Clothing\" or \"Footwear\" for the sneakers. This will help you see where your money is going and make it easier to set budgets for specific categories in the future.\n\nSince you've spent $500, you might want to review your budget and see if you need to make any adjustments. Ask yourself:\n\n* Was this expense planned, or was it an impulse purchase?\n* Do you have enough money left over for other essential expenses, like rent/mortgage, utilities, and groceries?\n* Are there any areas where you can cut back to make up for this expense?\n\nRemember, it's essential to be honest with yourself and assess your financial situation regularly. By doing so, you'll be able to make informed decisions about your money and achieve your long-term financial goals.\n\nHow do you feel about your Black Friday purchases now? Are you happy with your deals, or do you think you might need to make some adjustments to your budget?",
