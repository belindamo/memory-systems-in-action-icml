For the refreshing cocktails I listed earlier, here are some appetizer recommendations that would pair nicely:\n\n1. **Grilled Shrimp Skewers with Mango Salsa**: The sweetness of the mango salsa will complement the citrusy flavors in the Cucumber Lime Refresher and Lime-Ginger Fizz.\n2. **Cucumber and Feta Bruschetta**: A classic combination that will enhance the cucumber flavor in the Cucumber Lime Refresher. The tangy feta will also pair nicely with the Lime-Mint Collins.\n3. **Spicy Mango and Avocado Spring Rolls**: The spicy kick will cut through the sweetness of the Pomegranate Lime Sparkler, while the mango and avocado will complement the fruit flavors.\n4. **Fresh Fruit and Brie Crostini**: A light and refreshing combination that will pair nicely with the Watermelon Lime Cooler and Summer Sangria. The creamy brie will also complement the citrusy flavors in the Lime-Ginger Fizz.\n5. **Mini Crab Cakes with Remoulade**: The rich flavor of the crab cakes will be balanced by the bright, citrusy flavors in the Lime-Basil Martini.\n6. **Prosciutto-Wrapped Melon**: A simple, yet elegant combination that will pair nicely with the Cucumber Lime Refresher and Summer Sangria. The sweetness of the melon will complement the citrus flavors.\n7. **Grilled Peach and Arugula Salad Bites**: The sweetness of the peaches will complement the fruit flavors in the Pomegranate Lime Sparkler, while the peppery arugula will cut through the richness.\n\nThese small bites are designed to be light, refreshing, and easy to eat while mingling. You can also consider serving a variety of nuts, olives, or crackers with hummus or guacamole for a more casual snacking option.\n\nRemember to keep your appetizers bite-sized and easy to grab, so your guests can mingle and enjoy their drinks without feeling overwhelmed. Have fun planning your summer party!",
