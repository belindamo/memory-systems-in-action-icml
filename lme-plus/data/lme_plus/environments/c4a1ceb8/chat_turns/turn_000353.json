  "content": "Osprey are fish-eating specialists, and during spring migration, they prey on a variety of fish species in the coastal areas they visit. While their diet can vary depending on the location and time of year, here are some common types of fish that Osprey typically prey on during spring migration:\n\n1. **Mullet (Mugil spp.):** Mullet are a common prey species for Osprey, particularly in coastal areas with shallow waters and muddy or sandy bottoms.\n2. **Menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus):** Menhaden are a schooling fish that Osprey often target in estuaries and bays, where they congregate in large numbers.\n3. **Herring (Clupea spp.):** Herring are another schooling fish that Osprey prey on, particularly in areas with rocky shores or reefs.\n4. **Trout (Salmo spp.):** Trout, including species like brown trout and rainbow trout, are sometimes taken by Osprey in coastal areas with freshwater influence.\n5. **Bass (Morone spp.):** Bass, including striped bass and white bass, are occasional prey for Osprey, especially in areas with rocky structures or weed beds.\n6. **Sole (Solea spp.) and Flounder (Platichthys spp.):** These flatfish are often targeted by Osprey in shallow, coastal waters with sandy or muddy bottoms.\n7. **Shad (Alosa spp.):** Shad, an anadromous fish species, are sometimes preyed upon by Osprey as they migrate upstream to spawn.\n\nOsprey have adapted to hunt in a variety of aquatic environments, from shallow waters to depths of up to 6 feet (1.8 meters). They're skilled at catching fish in different situations, including:\n\n* **Shallow water:** Osprey wade in shallow waters, searching for fish hiding in vegetation or buried in the substrate.\n* **Open water:** They fly over open water, scanning for schools of fish or individual fish swimming near the surface.\n* **Structure:** Osprey use underwater structures like reefs, rocks, or weed beds to ambush fish.\n\nKeep in mind that the specific fish species Osprey prey on can vary depending on the location, time of year, and availability of fish. During your visit to the coastal area, you might observe Osprey catching fish from this list or other species not mentioned here.",
