Speaking of which, the week before last, on June 8th, I went to the Joshua Tree Music Festival in Indio, California, and we camped out for the whole weekend. We saw some amazing acts, including The Black Keys, The 1975, and Tame Impala. Do you think I might find some similar vibes at Outside Lands?",
