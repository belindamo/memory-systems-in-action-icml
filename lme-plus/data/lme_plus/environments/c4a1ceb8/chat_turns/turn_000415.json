Offering a special discount to customers who show your social media post at your stall is a great way to:\n\n1. **Encourage engagement**: By offering a discount, you're incentivizing people to engage with your social media content, share it with their friends, and visit your stall.\n2. **Increase foot traffic**: This promotion can drive more people to your stall, potentially leading to more sales and exposure for your brand.\n3. **Track engagement**: By asking customers to show the post, you can track how many people are engaging with your content and see the effectiveness of your social media campaign.\n4. **Create a sense of exclusivity**: Offering a limited-time discount can create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) and make customers feel special for being part of your social media community.\n\nTo make the most of this promotion, consider the following:\n\n1. **Clearly state the offer**: Make sure to clearly state the discount and the requirements to redeem it in your social media post.\n2. **Set a specific deadline**: Limit the offer to a specific time frame, such as \"this weekend only\" or \"during the Summer Vibes Market,\" to create a sense of urgency.\n3. **Choose a compelling discount**: Offer a discount that's attractive enough to encourage people to visit your stall, but not so deep that it eats into your profit margins.\n4. **Promote it widely**: Share the offer across all your social media platforms, and consider creating a Facebook event or Instagram story to promote it.\n5. **Have a plan for redemption**: Make sure you have a system in place to track and verify the social media post at your stall, such as a unique code or a visual verification process.\n\nExample social media post:\n\n\"Exclusive offer for our social media friends! Show this post at our stall at the Summer Vibes Market and receive 15% off any candle purchase! Don't miss out on this limited-time offer! #SummerVibesMarket #CandleLove #SocialMediaExclusive\"\n\nBy offering a special discount to customers who show your social media post, you'll be able to drive engagement, increase foot traffic, and create a buzz around your brand. Good luck, and I hope you have a fantastic time at the Summer Vibes Market!",
