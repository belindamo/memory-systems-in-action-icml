  "content": "I'm planning a dinner party next weekend and I want to serve a Spanish-inspired menu. Can you give me some ideas for tapas that would pair well with Paella, which I'm planning to make with chorizo, shrimp, and chicken, using a combination of saffron and smoked paprika to give it that authentic Spanish flavor, and serving it with a pitcher of Sangria made with Rioja wine and slices of orange and lemon?",
