  "content": "Asking for referrals from friends and family can be a great way to get personalized recommendations. Here are some suggestions on how to word your request:\n\n**Option 1: Open-ended question**\n\n\"Hey [Name], I'm starting to think about hiring a wedding planner and I was wondering if you have any recommendations or advice? Did you work with a planner for your wedding, or know anyone who has?\"\n\nThis approach allows your friend or family member to share their personal experience, offer advice, or provide a referral.\n\n**Option 2: Specific question**\n\n\"Hi [Name], I'm looking for a wedding planner and I thought of you. Did you work with a planner for your wedding? If so, would you recommend them? What was your experience like?\"\n\nThis approach is more direct and asks specific questions about their experience with a wedding planner.\n\n**Option 3: Ask about their network**\n\n\"Hey [Name], I'm looking for a wedding planner and I was wondering if you know anyone in your network who might be a good fit? Maybe someone who's worked with a friend or colleague?\"\n\nThis approach casts a wider net and asks if they know anyone who might be able to provide a referral or recommendation.\n\n**What to ask when they respond**\n\nIf your friend or family member responds with a referral or recommendation, be sure to ask follow-up questions, such as:\n\n* What was their experience like working with the planner?\n* Did the planner stay within budget?\n* How did they handle any unexpected issues on the wedding day?\n* Would they recommend the planner to others?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better understanding of the planner's work style, strengths, and weaknesses, which will help you make an informed decision.\n\nRemember to take notes and ask permission to reach out to the referred planner, so you can get in touch with them directly. Good luck with your search!",
