  "content": "Tom's Urban is a popular spot, especially before a Lakers game, and they do have a lot of TVs to catch all the pre-game action.\n\nThey have over 20 HD TVs, including a massive 20-foot LED screen, so you'll have no problem finding a good spot to catch the pre-game coverage. Plus, they have a great sound system, so you'll feel like you're right there at the Staples Center!\n\nAs for the crowd, Tom's Urban can get pretty busy before a Lakers game, especially since it's located in the LA Live complex, which is just a short walk from the Staples Center. I'd recommend getting there at least an hour or two before the game to grab a good spot, especially if you want to sit near the big screen or at the bar.\n\nBut don't worry, the staff at Tom's Urban are pros at handling big crowds, and they'll make sure you're taken care of. They'll have plenty of servers and bartenders on hand to keep the drinks and food flowing, so you can focus on cheering on the Lakers!\n\nGet there early, grab a good spot, and enjoy the pre-game atmosphere!",
