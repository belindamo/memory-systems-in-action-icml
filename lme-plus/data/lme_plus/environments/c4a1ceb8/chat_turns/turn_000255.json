  "content": "The pea protein isolation technology used by NOW Foods is a proprietary process, but I can provide some general information about the common methods used in the industry.\n\n**Pea Protein Isolation Technology**\n\nPea protein isolation involves several steps to extract the protein from peas, resulting in a high-quality protein powder. Here's an overview of the common methods used:\n\n1. **Dehulling**: The peas are first dehulled to remove the outer skin, leaving the inner protein-rich portion.\n2. **Milling**: The dehulled peas are then milled into a fine flour to increase the surface area.\n3. **Extraction**: The pea flour is mixed with water and an extraction agent (such as a solvent or enzyme) to release the protein from the starch and fiber.\n4. **Centrifugation**: The mixture is then centrifuged to separate the protein-rich liquid from the starch and fiber.\n5. **Filtration**: The protein-rich liquid is filtered to remove any remaining impurities.\n6. **Concentration**: The protein is then concentrated through evaporation or ultrafiltration to create a powder.\n7. **Drying**: The final step involves drying the protein powder to remove any remaining moisture.\n\n**NOW Foods' Proprietary Process**\n\nWhile I couldn't find specific information on NOW Foods' proprietary process, it's likely that they use a combination of these steps with some modifications to optimize the protein yield and quality. Some manufacturers may use additional steps or different techniques, such as:\n\n* Enzymatic hydrolysis: Using enzymes to break down the protein into smaller peptides for better absorption.\n* Microfiltration: Using membranes with tiny pores to separate the protein from impurities.\n* Spray drying: Drying the protein powder using a spray drying process to preserve the protein structure.\n\n**Benefits of Pea Protein Isolation**\n\nThe pea protein isolation process offers several benefits, including:\n\n* High protein yield: Pea protein isolation can result in a high protein yield, making it an efficient process.\n* Improved texture: The isolation process can improve the texture of the final protein powder, making it easier to mix and digest.\n* Increased bioavailability: The protein is broken down into smaller peptides, making it easier for the body to absorb.\n* Reduced allergenicity: The isolation process can reduce the risk of allergenicity, making pea protein a suitable option for those with sensitive stomachs.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand the pea protein isolation process better!",
