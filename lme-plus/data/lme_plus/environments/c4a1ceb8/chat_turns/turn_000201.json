I'm happy for you.\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to keep track of your personal schedule or meetings. I'm a text-based AI, and our conversation just started, so I didn't know about your meeting on Tuesday at 2 PM until you mentioned it just now.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts or updates with me, but I don't have personal knowledge of your schedule or activities outside of our conversation. I'm here to provide information, answer questions, and offer suggestions to help you with your queries!",
