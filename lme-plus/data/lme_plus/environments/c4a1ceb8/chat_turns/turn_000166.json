  "content": "Peanut butter is considered an invention rather than a recipe because it is a processed food product that has been developed through a series of steps that transform raw peanuts into a spreadable, creamy paste. The process of making peanut butter involves roasting peanuts to enhance their flavor and then grinding them into a smooth consistency. Peanut butter can be made with a variety of ingredients, such as salt, sugar, and oil, to give it a specific flavor and texture. Inventors and food manufacturers have developed various methods for making peanut butter, and these methods are often protected by patents and trademarks. As a result, peanut butter is considered an invention rather than a recipe, which is simply a set of instructions for preparing a dish or meal.",
