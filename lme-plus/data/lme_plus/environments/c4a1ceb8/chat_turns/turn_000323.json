A guided tour at the City Museum (which occurred a week before the photography exhibition)\n2. The photography exhibition (exact date unknown, but we know it happened a week after the museum tour)\n\nTo help me create a more accurate timeline, could you please provide me with the following information:\n\n* The exact dates of both events (or at least the month and year)\n* Any other art-related activities you've participated in recently (e.g., art classes, workshops, exhibitions, etc.)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a timeline or calendar to keep track of your art-related activities.",
