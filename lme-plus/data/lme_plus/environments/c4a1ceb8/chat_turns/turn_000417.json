  "content": "Offering a free gift or a free sample is an excellent way to incentivize customers to make a purchase and increase the average order value. It's a win-win strategy that can benefit both you and your customers!\n\n**Free Gift:**\n\n1. **Boost sales**: Offering a free gift with a minimum purchase can encourage customers to add more items to their cart to reach the threshold.\n2. **Increase customer satisfaction**: Who doesn't love getting something for free? A free gift can leave a positive impression and make customers more likely to return to your stall.\n3. **Clear inventory**: If you have excess stock or discontinued items, offering them as a free gift can help clear inventory and make room for new products.\n\n**Free Sample:**\n\n1. **Introduce new products**: Offer a free sample of a new or upcoming product to generate buzz and gather feedback.\n2. **Encourage repeat business**: If customers enjoy the sample, they may be more likely to return to your stall to purchase the full product.\n3. **Build brand loyalty**: Providing a free sample can create a sense of appreciation and loyalty towards your brand.\n\nWhen deciding on a free gift or sample, consider the following:\n\n1. **Choose something relevant**: Select an item that complements your candles or is related to your brand.\n2. **Set a reasonable threshold**: Determine a minimum purchase amount that makes sense for your business and ensures you're not losing money on the free gift or sample.\n3. **Limit the offer**: Consider limiting the free gift or sample to a specific time frame or a certain number of customers to create a sense of urgency.\n4. **Promote it well**: Clearly advertise the free gift or sample offer on your social media post, website, and in-store promotions.\n\nExample social media post:\n\n\"Spend $50 or more at our stall at the Summer Vibes Market and receive a FREE travel-sized candle (limited to the first 20 customers)! Plus, show this post and get 10% off your entire purchase! #SummerVibesMarket #CandleLove #FreeGift\"\n\nBy offering a free gift or sample, you can create a more enticing offer that encourages customers to make a purchase and increases the chances of them returning to your stall. Just remember to set clear terms and conditions to avoid any confusion. Good luck, and I hope you have a fantastic time at the Summer Vibes Market!",
