The metro system has over 200 stations, each unique in their design and architecture. \n\nThe stations were designed in the Stalinist era, and many feature marble columns, intricate mosaics, and chandeliers. Some of the most famous stations include Ploshchad Revolyutsii, Mayakovskaya, and Komsomolskaya. Each station tells a story and reflects the Soviet Union's ideology and the powerful image the regime wanted to portray. \n\nThe metro is not only a convenient way to get around the city but also a cultural experience. Many tourists and locals take tours of the metro stations to appreciate their unique beauty and historical significance.",
