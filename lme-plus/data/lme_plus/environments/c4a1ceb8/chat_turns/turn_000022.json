The first 1.5 miles from the General Sherman Tree to the Congress Trail junction are paved, making it accessible to wheelchairs and strollers. Beyond the junction, the trail transitions to a dirt path with some gravel and rocks. The trail is generally well-graded and easy to follow, but you'll still want to wear comfortable hiking shoes or boots with good traction.\n\n**Restrooms and Water Stations:** There are restrooms and water stations at the following locations along the Congress Trail:\n\n1. **General Sherman Tree parking area:** Restrooms and potable water are available near the parking area.\n2. **Congress Trail junction (1.5 miles from the General Sherman Tree):** There are restrooms, but no potable water.\n3. **Alta Peak Trail junction (2.5 miles from the General Sherman Tree):** There are restrooms, but no potable water.\n\nPlease note that water availability may be limited or unavailable during periods of drought or maintenance, so it's always a good idea to bring enough water for your entire hike.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Bring snacks and energy-rich food to keep you fueled throughout your hike.\n* Be prepared for changing weather conditions, and bring layers, a hat, and sunscreen.\n* Respect the giant sequoias and do not touch or climb on them, as the oils from your skin can harm the trees.\n* If you're planning to hike further than the Congress Trail, be sure to bring a map, compass, and/or GPS device, as the trails can be complex and signage may be limited.\n\nEnjoy your hike on the Congress Trail, and take in the breathtaking beauty of Sequoia National Park!",
