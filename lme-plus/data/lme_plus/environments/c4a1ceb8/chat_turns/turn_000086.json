It quickly became popular among the local population and continued to grow in popularity after the country gained independence.\n\nThe sport is seen as a symbol of national pride and identity, with millions of people across the subcontinent playing and watching the game. The rise of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a domestic T20 tournament, has also brought a new level of excitement to the sport in South Asia.\n\nSome of the notable players from South Asia include Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Rohit Sharma from India, Shahid Afridi and Wasim Akram from Pakistan, and Muttiah Muralitharan from Sri Lanka. These players have become national heroes and have inspired countless young people to pursue the sport.",
