Here's why:\n\n**Crowd and Wait:**\n\nWhile Be Our Guest Restaurant is a popular spot, breakfast is generally less busy than lunch or dinner. You can expect a more relaxed atmosphere, and the wait times are usually shorter. If you make a reservation for an early breakfast time (around 8:30 am), you'll likely have an even more peaceful experience.\n\n**Character Interaction:**\n\nThe Beast makes appearances in the grand ballroom during breakfast, but it's not a traditional character dining experience with long lines or crowds. The Beast will visit your table or nearby tables, allowing for a more intimate and relaxed interaction. This might be beneficial for your younger brother, as he can still enjoy the character experience without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Menu and Service:**\n\nThe breakfast menu at Be Our Guest Restaurant offers a variety of options, including some more kid-friendly choices like pancakes, waffles, and scrambled eggs. The service is also generally attentive and accommodating, so if your brother has any special requests or needs, the staff will do their best to assist.\n\n**Tips for a Smooth Experience:**\n\nTo ensure a smooth experience for your brother, consider the following:\n\n* Make a reservation for an early breakfast time to avoid crowds.\n* Inform the restaurant about any special needs or requirements when you make your reservation.\n* If your brother needs a break or some downtime, you can step outside the restaurant for some fresh air or explore the nearby shops and attractions in the Magic Kingdom.\n* Don't hesitate to ask the restaurant staff for assistance or accommodations if needed.\n\nOverall, I think breakfast at Be Our Guest Restaurant could be a great fit for your family. The atmosphere is enchanting, the menu is diverse, and the character interaction is more relaxed. With some planning and preparation, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time!",
