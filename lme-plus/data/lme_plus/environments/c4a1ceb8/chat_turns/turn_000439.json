However, I would suggest checking with local artistic institutions, universities, and cultural centers in your area. They often organize events and performances related to Indian classical dance forms, including Kathakali. You can also search online for upcoming shows or festivals that feature Indian classical dance forms. Many of these events are announced on social media platforms, so you might want to follow the pages of local artists, dance groups or cultural organizations that are dedicated to promoting these dance forms. You can also consider subscribing to cultural event guides or newsletters in your local area that keep you updated on upcoming performances. I hope you get the chance to see a live performance of Kathakali soon!",
