I'm a text-based AI, I don't have the capability to browse the internet or access external information.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you find yoga classes in your area:\n\n1. **Google Search**: Simply type \"yoga classes near me\" or \"yoga studios in [your city/zip code]\" in Google, and it will show you a list of nearby yoga studios along with their schedules and contact information.\n2. **Yoga Studio Websites**: Look up the website of your favorite yoga studio or search for yoga studios in your area. Most studios have online schedules and class listings.\n3. **Yoga Apps**: Download yoga apps like YogaGlo, Yoga International, or Down Dog, which often have class schedules and studio listings.\n4. **Facebook or Social Media**: Check the Facebook page or social media profiles of local yoga studios for their class schedules and updates.\n5. **Local Gyms or Community Centers**: Many gyms and community centers offer yoga classes. Check their websites or visit in person to ask about their yoga class schedules.\n\nRemember to double-check the class schedules and timings to ensure you don't miss your class again this week!",
