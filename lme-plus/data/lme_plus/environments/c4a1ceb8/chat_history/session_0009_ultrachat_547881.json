The sport has served as a unifying factor and a source of national pride for people across the region.\n\nThere are many instances where cricket has been used to bridge social and political divides. For example, during the 1990s, when India and Pakistan faced diplomatic tensions, cricket matches between the two countries helped to ease the tensions by providing an opportunity for the people of both countries to come together and share their love for the sport.\n\nSimilarly, in Sri Lanka, cricket has been used as a tool to bring people together, especially after the country's civil war. The Sri Lankan cricket team has players from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, and their success on the field has been seen as a symbol of national unity and reconciliation.\n\nIn Bangladesh, cricket has played a crucial role in unifying the people and promoting national pride. The country's cricket team's performance in international cricket tournaments has helped to boost the nation's morale and promote a sense of belonging among its citizens.\n\nTherefore, cricket has been a crucial factor in promoting unity and social harmony in South Asia, and it is likely to continue playing this role in the future."
