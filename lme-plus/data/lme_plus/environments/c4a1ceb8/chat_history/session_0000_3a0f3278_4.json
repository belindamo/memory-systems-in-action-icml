      "content": "Congratulations to Michael and Emily on their engagement!\n\nCreating a rough guest list and estimating your budget are crucial steps in the wedding planning process. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n**Rough Guest List:**\n\n1. **Start with a rough estimate:** Begin by estimating the number of guests you think you'll invite. Consider your closest friends, family members, and acquaintances.\n2. **Categorize guests:** Divide your guests into categories, such as:\n\t* Immediate family (parents, siblings, grandparents)\n\t* Close friends\n\t* Extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins)\n\t* Colleagues and acquaintances\n3. **Assign a rough number:** Estimate the number of guests in each category. For example:\n\t* Immediate family: 20\n\t* Close friends: 30\n\t* Extended family: 20\n\t* Colleagues and acquaintances: 10\n4. **Add a buffer:** Consider adding 10-20% to your total estimate to account for plus-ones, unexpected guests, and RSVPs.\n\n**Estimating Your Budget:**\n\n1. **Determine your overall budget:** Decide how much you're comfortable spending on your wedding.\n2. **Allocate funds:** Divide your budget into categories, such as:\n\t* Venue and catering\n\t* Photography and videography\n\t* Music and entertainment\n\t* Flowers and decorations\n\t* Attire and accessories\n\t* Transportation and accommodations\n\t* Miscellaneous (gifts, favors, etc.)\n3. **Research costs:** Research the average costs for each category in your area to get a rough estimate.\n4. **Prioritize:** Identify your top priorities and allocate your budget accordingly. For example, if photography is important to you, you may want to allocate a larger portion of your budget to that category.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be realistic: Don't invite everyone you've ever met, and don't overspend on things that aren't important to you.\n* Communicate with your partner: Make sure you're both on the same page when it comes to your guest list and budget.\n* Be flexible: Your guest list and budget may change as you continue planning, so be prepared to make adjustments.\n\nRemember, this is just a rough estimate, and your actual guest list and budget may vary. But by following these steps, you'll get a better sense of what you're working with and can start making informed decisions about your wedding planning."
