    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Bananas would be a fantastic substitute for apples in the fruit and nut butter bites! In fact, bananas and peanut butter are a classic combination that many people love. The sweetness of the bananas will pair perfectly with the richness of the peanut butter.\n\nSince bananas are softer and more fragile than apples, you might need to adjust the recipe slightly:\n\n1. Mash the ripe bananas in a bowl until they're smooth.\n2. Mix the mashed bananas with the peanut butter, oats, and any other desired spices or ingredients (like honey or cinnamon) until you get a dough-like consistency.\n3. Use a spoon or your hands to shape the mixture into small balls, about 1-inch in diameter. You might need to press the mixture together gently to help it hold its shape.\n4. Place the bites on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set.\n5. Store the fruit and nut butter bites in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n\nTips:\n\n* If the banana mixture is too sticky, you can add a bit more oats or even some chopped nuts to help bind it together.\n* If you find the bites are too soft, you can try adding a bit more peanut butter or refrigerating them for a longer time to firm them up.\n* You can also customize the recipe by adding other ingredients, like chopped nuts, seeds, or even a sprinkle of cinnamon or cocoa powder on top.\n\nEnjoy your delicious banana and peanut butter bites!"
