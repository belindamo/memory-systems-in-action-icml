      "content": "I'm an AI language model and I'm afraid I don't have information about whether the Lord Justice building has a cafeteria or not. However, it's common for large government and court buildings to have a cafeteria or a canteen where visitors and staff can purchase food and drinks. You can check with the building's reception or security desk to see if there is any such facility available."

      "content": "I apologize for my previous response. As an AI language model, I'm capable of searching for nearby food options on your phone. However, please note that I do not have access to your device's location details, so you would first need to enable location services for your web browser or map application. Once done, you can search for local restaurants or cafes using your browser or app, and check if there is anything nearby the Lord Justice building. Additionally, you can ask the receptionist or security personnel for recommendations on nearby food options."

However, you can use a food delivery app on your phone such as Uber Eats, Deliveroo, or Just Eat, to order food and have it delivered to the Lord Justice building. Many restaurants and cafes offer delivery services nowadays and it's a convenient option, especially if you don't feel like leaving the building."
