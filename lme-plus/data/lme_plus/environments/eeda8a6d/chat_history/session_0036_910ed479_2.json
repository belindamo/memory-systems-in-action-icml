At this age, kids love exploring and being active, so I've got some fantastic kid-friendly activity recommendations that'll keep her engaged and excited:\n\n1. **Nature Scavenger Hunt**: Create a list of items for your niece to find in nature, such as leaves, rocks, feathers, or specific types of flowers. This activity encourages exploration and observation skills.\n2. **Outdoor Games**: Pack a few outdoor games like a frisbee, a ball, or a bubble machine. You can also play classic games like Tag, Hide-and-Seek, or Red Light, Green Light.\n3. **Nature Art**: Collect items like sticks, rocks, and leaves to create art on the ground or on a large piece of paper. This activity fosters creativity and imagination.\n4. **Picnic Adventure**: Pack a fun picnic lunch and head to a nearby park or a scenic spot. Let your niece help with food preparation and setting up the picnic area.\n5. **Hiking or Nature Walks**: Choose a short, easy trail that's suitable for young children. Encourage your niece to observe her surroundings, collect interesting rocks, and spot birds or other wildlife.\n6. **Kite Flying**: Bring a kite to the park or an open area with wind. This activity promotes physical activity and excitement.\n7. **Water Play**: If the weather permits, consider a trip to a nearby lake, river, or beach.

This activity encourages problem-solving and teamwork.\n9. **Outdoor Obstacle Course**: Set up a simple obstacle course using natural objects like logs, rocks, and hills. This activity promotes physical activity and gross motor skills.\n10. **Star Gazing**: If your trip is during a clear evening, set up a telescope or binoculars for a fun stargazing session.
