The `defaultdict` from the `collections` module is used to store the frequency of values in each feature set. The frequency is calculated by iterating over the rows in the file and incrementing the count for each value in each feature set. The result is a dictionary with the frequency of distinct values in each feature set, which is printed."

The medical center has a huge head force of 25,000 employees, and as a result of the combined effort of those employees, the medical center has been able to handle approximately 3 million visits so far. In recent times, the hospital was incurring losses despite having the finest doctors available and not lacking scheduled appointments. To investigate the reason for the anomaly, a sample data dump of appointments \nmedicalcentre.csv is hereby presented.

Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering (45 marks): \n1. Prepare the data for downstream processes, e.g., deal with missing values, duplicates 2. Determine the frequency of distinct values in each feature set \n3. Initialize a function to plot relevant features within the dataset to visualize for outliers 4.

The method returns a Series object that displays the frequency of each unique value in the specified column, sorted in descending order by default."
