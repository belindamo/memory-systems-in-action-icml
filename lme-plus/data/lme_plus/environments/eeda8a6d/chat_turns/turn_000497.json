  "content": "I usually go to bed around 10:30 pm, and I try to wind down by reading a book or listening to calming music. However, I often find myself scrolling through my phone before bed, which I know isn't ideal. I also have a tendency to hit the snooze button multiple times in the morning, which makes it hard for me to get out of bed on time. Do you think I should try to establish a more consistent bedtime routine, like going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends?",
