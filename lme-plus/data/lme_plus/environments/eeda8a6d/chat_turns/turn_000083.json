Here's a revised version of the poem:\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue,\nI truly admire my data science crew.\nThey work with water sensors and flood risk maps,\nAnalyzing the data with their technical claps.\n\nFrom river levels to rainfall and more,\nThey analyze it all to give us a score.\nTheir work keeps us informed, always on track,\nMy data science team, their skills are hard to match.\n\nTheir insights help us prepare and take action,\nTo mitigate the risks of water's reaction.\nTheir work is so crucial, and we owe them a lot,\nMy data science team, you're simply top-notch.\n\nSo here's to my team, with gratitude and pride,\nFor all the knowledge and insights they provide.\nTheir passion and expertise are simply the key,\nMy data science team, you're simply the best to me!",
