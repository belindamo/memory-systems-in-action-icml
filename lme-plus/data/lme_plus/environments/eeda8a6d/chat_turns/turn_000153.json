  "content": "An alternative way to handle CSV files in Python is to use the `csv` module. Here is an example of how to determine the frequency of distinct values in each feature set using the `csv` module:\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Open the CSV file\nwith open('data.csv', 'r') as f:\n    reader = csv.reader(f)\n    header = next(reader)\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of values in each feature set\n    frequency = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n    \n    # Iterate over the rows in the file\n    for row in reader:\n        for i, value in enumerate(row):\n            frequency[header[i]][value] += 1\n            \n    print(frequency)\n```\nThe code opens the CSV file using a `with` statement and creates a `csv.reader` object to read the data. The `defaultdict` from the `collections` module is used to store the frequency of values in each feature set. The frequency is calculated by iterating over the rows in the file and incrementing the count for each value in each feature set. The result is a dictionary with the frequency of distinct values in each feature set, which is printed.",
