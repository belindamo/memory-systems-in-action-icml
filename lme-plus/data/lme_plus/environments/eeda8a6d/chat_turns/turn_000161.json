  "content": "\"Determine the frequency of distinct values in each feature set\" refers to calculating the number of occurrences of each unique value within a specific feature or column of a dataset. This can help to get a better understanding of the distribution of values within a particular feature set and identify any patterns or anomalies in the data.\n\nIn the case of the medical center dataset, determining the frequency of distinct values in each feature set can provide insights into the data distribution, help identify missing or duplicate values, and assist in selecting the relevant features for further analysis.\n\nIn Pandas, this can be done using the `value_counts` method on a specific column or feature set. The method returns a Series object that displays the frequency of each unique value in the specified column, sorted in descending order by default.",
