  "content": "Adding a treasure chest or a sunken ship decoration can be a great idea to create more hiding places for your neon tetras and other fish. Both decorations can provide a fun and interesting addition to your tank. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Treasure Chest:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Provides a cozy, enclosed space for fish to hide and feel secure\n* Can be placed on the substrate or on a rock, offering multiple hiding options\n* Often has small crevices and details that fish can explore\n\nCons:\n\n* Might be too small for larger fish like the Pleco catfish\n* Could be a bit too \"busy\" or ornate for a natural, planted tank\n\n**Sunken Ship:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Offers multiple hiding places and levels for fish to explore\n* Can be a great centerpiece for the tank, creating a focal point\n* Often has a more natural, weathered look that can blend with the tank's decor\n\nCons:\n\n* Might be too large for a 20-gallon tank, depending on the size\n* Could obstruct swimming space or create dead zones if not placed carefully\n\nConsidering your tank's size and the fish you have, I think a treasure chest might be a better fit. It's generally smaller and more compact, making it easier to place in a 20-gallon tank. Additionally, it provides a cozy, enclosed space that neon tetras and other small fish will appreciate.\n\nIf you do decide to go with a sunken ship, make sure to choose a smaller one that won't overwhelm the tank. You can also try placing it in a corner or against a wall to create a sense of depth and visual interest.\n\nRemember to introduce the new decoration slowly and carefully to avoid stressing your fish. You can start by placing it in a quiet area of the tank and then move it to its final location once the fish are comfortable with its presence.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you leaning towards a treasure chest or a sunken ship?",
