  "content": "Yes, that's correct! While the traditional version of the \"Twenty Questions\" game uses yes-or-no questions, you can certainly design a game based on decision trees with multiple branches at each node. Instead of yes-or-no questions, you could ask questions with multiple options, such as \"Which color is your object?\" with options like \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" or \"Green.\"\n\nAt each node, the player would choose one of the available options, and the game would follow the corresponding branch until it reached a leaf node with the final answer. In this case, the decision tree would have L branches at each node, where L is the number of options available for each question.\n\nThe general idea of a decision tree game is to ask questions that help to eliminate as many options as possible at each step, so that the game can arrive at the final answer as quickly as possible. The specific questions and options that are used can vary depending on the topic or theme of the game, as well as the level of difficulty and the age range of the players.",
