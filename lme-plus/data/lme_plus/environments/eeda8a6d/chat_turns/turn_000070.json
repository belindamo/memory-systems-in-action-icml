  "content": "Introduction to Psychodynamic Theory in Social Work\nSocial workers balance many clients suffering from a wide range of problems, including trauma, medical conditions, mental health issues, unemployment, lack of education, discrimination, criminal records and more. Pursuing a degree in social work prepares a student to become a practitioner and to help their clients through counseling and social support systems.\n\nSocial workers base their practices on several theories and practice models, including psychodynamic theory. What once was a theory derived from Sigmund Freud is now a network of theories developed and expanded by many theorists since the early 1900s. Psychodynamic theory, also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, helps clients understand their emotions and unconscious patterns of behavior. By talking through these emotions and behaviors with a social worker, clients come to know themselves better and make better decisions for themselves.\n\nWhat is Psychodynamic Theory?\nPsychodynamic theory was originally a theory of personality created by FreudExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. It has evolved significantly over the years, and many theorists have contributed to it. Freud believed human behavior could be explained by intrapsychic processes and interpersonal patterns outside of a person\u2019s conscious awareness and based on their childhood experiences. A general definition of psychodynamic theory is that forces outside of a person\u2019s awareness explain why they behave a certain way.\n\nToday psychodynamic theory is not a unified theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. Instead, there are many related theories regarding human development and personality. These different theories have various treatment processes, some of which are used by social workers and other clinicians, like talk therapy, dream analysis, free association and transference.\n\nHow psychodynamic theory differs from other types of therapy\nMany modern types of therapyExternal link:open\\_in\\_new emphasize mitigating or getting rid of the symptoms of a problem. For example, if a person struggles with anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy helps a person address the symptoms of their anxiety. Psychodynamic theory, however, explores a person\u2019s deeply rooted drives, needs and desires. It\u2019s considered a more global approach to therapy than a modern, problem-based therapy. You also can look at it as a difference between focusing on a person\u2019s emotions versus their behavior.\n\nThe Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual\nModern psychology and psychiatry use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)External link:open\\_in\\_new. The Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM) was published in 2006 as an alternative or additional guide for clinicians to diagnose and treat clients. It was sponsored by:\n\nThe American Psychoanalytic AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe International Psychoanalytical AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe Division of Psychoanalysis of the American Psychological AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry\nThe National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social WorkExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe second edition was published in 2016, and also was sponsored by the International Association for Relational Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy.\n\nA Brief History of Psychodynamic Theory\nMany professionals have contributed to psychodynamic theory and its relationship to social work over the years. The theory has evolved significantly, and it is still part of modern social work. The National Association of Social Workers\u2019 Standards for Clinical Social Work in Social Work Practice (PDF, XX)External link:open\\_in\\_new lists it as one of several theories social workers can use as a basis for their practices.\n\nThe evolution of psychodynamic theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new can be understood through four schools of thought:\n\n1. Drive theory\nFreud believed a person\u2019s behavior was the result of several drives including the sex (eros), self-preservation and destruction/aggression (death) drives. The id is the primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains the foundation of these drives. It is the instinctive portion of a personality.\n\nAs a child develops, external forces from the world make it difficult to satisfy these drives. Eventually, the superego and ego impose internal hurdles and restraints. The superego is responsible for the morals of society as taught by a person\u2019s parents, operating as a moral conscience. The ego mediates between the id and the external world\u2014it is responsible for decision-making.\n\nWhen a person\u2019s drive-based desires might become conscious, it triggers a conflict between the drives and the superego or the ego. When a person fails to repress their desires, it creates anxiety and activates defense mechanisms.\n\n2. Ego psychology\nTheories on how a person\u2019s ego functions have evolved since Freud. He believed the ego developed from the id alone. But theorists later believed the ego did more than regulate a person\u2019s drives. Some theorists believed the ego developed autonomously\u2014free of intrapsychic conflict. They believed people had another drive to explore and control the world around them. According to ego psychology, a person\u2019s environment and reality were also important to their development.\n\n3. Object relations theory\nPsychodynamic theory originally saw behavior as a function of drives. Later, theorists explained people\u2019s behavior based on object seeking. People were shaped by their relationships with significant others around them, like their parents and siblings. Under this theory, a person\u2019s struggles have to do with their focus on maintaining relationships with others while also differentiating themselves. As adults, people repeat object relationships they formed in childhood.\n\n4. Self psychology\nUnder this theory, a person\u2019s perception of themself is in relation to their boundaries or differences (or lack thereof) from others. Theorists believe narcissism has a healthy place in development and adulthood, though narcissism isn\u2019t to be confused with narcissistic personality disorder. A person with a lack of self-esteem or an undeveloped sense of self might experience mental health issues. A person with a healthy sense of self can self-regulate and soothe and is resilient. Some theorists believe a lack of a sense of self came from a lack of parental empathy during childhood.\n\nAssumptions of Psychodynamic Theory\nThere are several key assumptions in psychodynamic theory:\n\nAll behavior has an underlying cause.\nThe causes of a person\u2019s behavior originate in their unconscious.\nDifferent aspects of a person\u2019s unconscious struggle against each other.\nAn adult\u2019s behavior and feelings, including mental health issues, are rooted in childhood experiences.\nBoth innate, internal processes and the external environment contribute to adult personality.\nGoals of psychodynamic theory\nPsychodynamic therapy pushes for clients to:\n\nAcknowledge their emotions. Over time, clients can start to recognize patterns in their emotions and address them, which can lead to making better choices.\nIdentify patterns. Clients can begin to see patterns in more than just their emotions, but also their behaviors and relationships. Or, if clients are aware of negative patterns in their life, therapy can help them understand why they make certain choices and give them the power to change.\nImprove interpersonal relationships. Modern psychodynamic theory helps clients understand their relationships, as well as patterns they exhibit with relationships.\nRecognize and address avoidance. Everyone has automatic ways of avoiding bad thoughts and feelings. Therapy can help clients recognize when they\u2019re acting in a way to avoid distress and how to move forward addressing their emotions with healthy coping mechanisms.\nStrengths and weaknesses of psychodynamic theory\nThere are several strengths to psychodynamic theory. It recognizes that a person\u2019s childhood impacts their mental health as an adult. This idea is readily accepted in modern psychology and social work.\n\nIt recognizes that an adult is the product of both nature and nurture. People have internal drives that influence their behavior. Childhood experiences affect them, too.\n\nFreud\u2019s psychodynamic theory also led to psychoanalysis, which used talking as a way to identify and treat mental health conditions. Conversation is a fundamental aspect of therapy today. When you think of a clinician asking a client, \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d that\u2019s psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis.\n\nThere are recognized weaknesses of psychodynamic theory. It doesn\u2019t account for a person\u2019s ability to think and control their behavior. Many theorists believe it doesn\u2019t consider free will enough.\n\nIt\u2019s considered unscientific because it\u2019s difficult to prove. The theories are largely unsubstantiated. But modern medical advances have provided supporting evidence for the benefits of psychodynamic therapy.\n\nHow Does Psychodynamic Theory Apply to Social Work?\nSocial workers can benefit from applying the fundamental assumptions of psychodynamic theory to their clients. Every client\u2019s behavior has a reason. It isn\u2019t random or happening in a vacuum. Their behavior also is likely partly or mostly in response to unconscious processes. The client might not realize why they behave a certain way.\n\nObject relations theory and self-psychology moved psychodynamic theory from a one-person issue, focused on the unconscious issues of an individual, to two-person psychology, focused on relationships. This fits well with social work. Social workers often focus on a client\u2019s interpersonal relationships, including the client-worker relationship, to learn about the client\u2019s behavior and promote change.\n\nSocial workers often work with clients with multiple difficulties. Psychodynamic theory in social work provides a conceptual framework for understanding seemingly unrelated symptoms or patterns of behavior. The framework of theories offers social workers a way to address all of the client\u2019s issues.\n\nSocial workers hope to promote change and improvement in a client\u2019s life. By using psychodynamic therapy, they can help clients get to the root of their thoughts, emotions and behaviors. This provides a chance for self-discovery. A client has the opportunity to learn more about themselves, recognize harmful patterns of emotions or in relationships and alter their behavior.\n\nTypes of psychodynamic treatments\nThere are many different treatments social workers can use as part of a psychodynamic approach to modern types of therapyExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. The psychotherapy will focus mostly on talking. Clinicians let the client\u2019s direct the conversation, but other techniques can be complementary to talk therapy including:\n\nTransference: A person redirects their feelings and expectations of one person onto another\u2014usually unconsciously. Transference is common in therapy. The client applies emotions toward their clinician and acts toward them as if they were the other person. Transference can happen in a variety of relationships, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily demonstrate a mental health issue. When a social worker identifies and understands the client\u2019s transference, they can gain a better understanding of a part of the client\u2019s life and their condition.\n\nFree association: A clinician might encourage a client to write down or speak all the thoughts that come to their mind. It might be an incoherent stream of words. It might be a random assortment of memories and emotions. The purpose of free association is to make connections between topics that might go unnoticed. This was originally developed by Freud, though it\u2019s not a common therapy technique today.\n\nDream analysis: Freud also developed the technique of analyzing dreams as a way of learning more about a person\u2019s unconscious. Modern psychodynamic clinicians use dream analysis as part of person-centered therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and Gestalt therapy (in Gestalt therapy, there\u2019s the belief that dreams are messages a person sends themselves.)\n\nCriticism of Psychodynamic Theory\nPsychodynamic theory has been criticized as being too deterministic or victim-blaming to be used in modern psychology and social workExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. The original theories believed people had no control over their own behavior. There was a lack of personal agency.\n\nAnother criticism of psychodynamic theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new, as defined by Freud, is that it is sexist. Freud believed women were inferior to men. He also believed men had stronger superegos. Women\u2019s weaker superegos made them more prone to anxiety. It\u2019s important to remember that Freud predominantly treated and studied middle-aged women in Vienna.\n\nIn more recent decades, psychodynamic theory has been criticized as not only sexist but also not a sufficient theory or treatment for people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nPsychodynamic theory originally didn\u2019t account for social issues like sexism, racism, poverty and homophobia. Some practitioners felt psychodynamic theory focused too much on psychotherapy treatment rather than addressing broader social concerns. In other words, practitioners focused on finding the underlying, personal cause of a client\u2019s problems instead of addressing larger social systems that impact the client.\n\nThis is a particular concern for social workers who identify social justice as a core value of their profession. Modern social workers and practitioners consider the broader social structures that affect the client.\n\nTo summarize the key points of this article, please show their deeply nested relationships (parent-child) in indented form",
