I'd be happy to help you with wine pairing suggestions for your wine and cheese night.\n\nBefore we dive into the pairings, can you please tell me a bit more about the type of cheese and wine selection you're planning to feature? Are you looking to focus on a specific region, such as France or Italy, or do you want to offer a variety of options?\n\nAlso, what's the general style of your wine and cheese night? Is it a casual gathering or a more formal affair? Knowing this will help me provide more tailored suggestions.\n\nLastly, I'm curious - what's in your \"Summer Sunset\" cocktail? I'd love to hear more about it!",
