  "content": "I'm thinking of getting a travel jewelry case, since I tend to travel a lot and I've had some close calls with my jewelry in the past. Like that one time I lost my favorite silver necklace with a small pendant during my cousin's wedding about three weeks ago. I've been meaning to get it fixed, but I haven't had the time yet. Anyway, do you have any recommendations for travel jewelry cases that can hold a lot of pieces?",
