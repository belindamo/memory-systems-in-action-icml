Check power management settings: Sometimes, power management settings can interfere with network connectivity. Go to Device Manager, right-click your network adapter, select Properties, click the Power Management tab, and uncheck the \"Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\" option.\n2. Check the network adapter hardware: If you have a desktop computer, make sure that the network adapter is securely seated in its slot. If you have a laptop, you may need to check that the network adapter is not loose or damaged.\n3. Check for firmware updates: Some network adapters may require firmware updates. Go to the manufacturer's website and see if there are any firmware updates available for your network adapter.\n4. Disable IPv6: In some cases, IPv6 can cause network connectivity issues. Try disabling IPv6 to see if that solves the problem. To do this, go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings > Right-click your network adapter > Properties > Uncheck the \"Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)\" option.\n5. Use a network adapter diagnostic tool: Some network adapter manufacturers provide diagnostic tools that can help identify and fix issues with their devices. Check the manufacturer's website for any available diagnostic tools.\n\nI hope these additional steps are helpful in resolving your network adapter issue. If you continue to experience problems, it may be helpful to seek assistance from a professional IT support technician.",
