I'm happy to help you with that.\n\nFirst, kudos to you for recognizing the importance of reapplying sunscreen frequently, especially during peak sun hours. Here are some top-rated sun protection products and tips to help you stay protected and enjoy your outdoor adventures:\n\n**Sunscreen:**\n\n1. **Broad-spectrum protection:** Look for sunscreens with broad-spectrum protection (UVA and UVB) and an SPF of at least 30.\n2. **Water-resistant:** Choose water-resistant sunscreens to ensure they stay on your skin even when you sweat or get wet.\n3. **Reef-safe:** Opt for sunscreens that are reef-safe, as some chemicals in traditional sunscreens can harm coral reefs.\n\nRecommended sunscreens:\n\n* Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry-Touch Sunscreen, SPF 50\n* EltaMD UV Sport Broad-Spectrum SPF 50\n* La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Sunscreen Milk, SPF 60\n\n**Other Sun Protection Products:**\n\n1. **Lip balm with SPF:** Protect your lips from the sun with a lip balm containing SPF 30 or higher.\n\t* Burt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm with SPF 30\n2. **Sun hats and clothing:** Wear clothing with built-in UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) protection, and hats with a wide brim to protect your face, neck, and ears.\n3. **Sunglasses:** Choose sunglasses with UV protection to safeguard your eyes.\n\t* Oakley Flak 2.0 XL Sunglasses with UV protection\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. **Apply sunscreen correctly:** Apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes before going outside, and reapply every 2 hours or immediately after swimming or sweating.\n2. **Don't forget hard-to-reach areas:** Apply sunscreen to areas like the back of your neck, ears, and the tops of your feet.\n3. **Seek shade:** Whenever possible, seek shade, especially during peak sun hours (10am-4pm).\n4. **Be mindful of reflection:** Be aware of reflective surfaces like water, sand, and snow, which can increase your exposure to the sun's rays.\n\n**Additional Recommendations:**\n\n1. **After-sun care:** Apply a moisturizer or after-sun lotion to soothe and hydrate your skin after spending time outdoors.\n2. **Sunscreen sticks:** Consider carrying a sunscreen stick for quick reapplications on-the-go.\n3. **Check the expiration date:** Make sure your sunscreen is not past its expiration date, as its effectiveness may decrease over time.\n\nNow, go ahead and enjoy your outdoor adventures with confidence!",
