Since you answered \"No\" to both questions 1 and 2, the element you're thinking of is not a metal, and it does not have a chemical symbol that starts with \"C\".\n\nThere are still many possibilities, but I'll try to narrow it down further with the next question:\n\n4. Does the element you're thinking of have an atomic number greater than 30? Please respond with (1) for Yes, (2) for No, or (3) for I don't know.",
