However, please note that I do not have access to your device's location details, so you would first need to enable location services for your web browser or map application. Once done, you can search for local restaurants or cafes using your browser or app, and check if there is anything nearby the Lord Justice building. Additionally, you can ask the receptionist or security personnel for recommendations on nearby food options.",
