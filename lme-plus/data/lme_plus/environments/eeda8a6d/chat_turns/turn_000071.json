  "content": "Psychodynamic theory is a network of theories that were developed based on the work of Sigmund Freud. It focuses on understanding a person's emotions and unconscious patterns of behavior, which are believed to be shaped by childhood experiences and forces outside of a person's awareness. The goal of psychodynamic therapy is to help clients come to know themselves better and make better decisions for themselves. It differs from other types of therapy in that it explores a person's deeply rooted drives, needs and desires, rather than just addressing symptoms. The Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM) is an alternative or additional guide for clinicians to diagnose and treat clients. Psychodynamic theory has evolved over the years through several schools of thought including drive theory, ego psychology, object relations theory and self psychology.",
