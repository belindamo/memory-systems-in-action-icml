  "content": "Sure thing! Another book that I would recommend is \"Octopus's Garden\" by Ringo Starr and Ben Cort. This is a colorful and fun children's book, which tells the story of a young boy who goes on an underwater adventure with a friendly octopus. \n\nThe story is based on the lyrics of the Beatles' song \"Octopus's Garden,\" which was written by Ringo. The illustrations by Ben Cort are vibrant and playful, and the book encourages children to use their imagination and explore the wonders of the ocean. \n\n\"Octopus's Garden\" is a great starting point for readers who may not be familiar with Ringo's music or life story. It allows them to appreciate him as a creative and imaginative artist who has influenced generations of fans. And who knows, this book may even inspire readers to check out more of his music and dive deeper into his work.",
