  "content": "Puck lights are a popular choice for under-cabinet lighting because they're easy to install, energy-efficient, and provide focused task lighting. Here's more information on how they're installed and what they look like:\n\n**Installation:**\n\n1. **Mounting:** Puck lights usually come with a mounting clip or adhesive strip that attaches to the underside of the cabinet or shelf. This allows for easy installation and adjustment.\n2. **Wiring:** Puck lights typically require a low-voltage power source (12V or 24V), which is connected to a transformer or driver. The wiring is usually hidden from view, making the installation look clean and discreet.\n3. **Spacing:** Puck lights are usually spaced 12-18 inches apart, depending on the size of the lighting area and the desired level of brightness.\n\n**Appearance:**\n\n1. **Compact design:** Puck lights are small, round, and compact, making them unobtrusive and easy to hide from view.\n2. **Low profile:** They're designed to be recessed into the cabinet or shelf, creating a sleek, streamlined look.\n3. **Adjustable direction:** Many puck lights can be adjusted to direct the light beam, allowing you to focus the light exactly where you need it.\n4. **Color temperature:** Puck lights are available in various color temperatures, such as warm white (2700K-3000K), cool white (3500K-4100K), and daylight (5000K-6500K), to suit your personal preference.\n5. **Lens options:** Some puck lights have a frosted or diffused lens to soften the light, while others have a clear lens for a more focused beam.\n\n**Types of Puck Lights:**\n\n1. **Fixed puck lights:** These are the most common type, with a fixed position and direction.\n2. **Adjustable puck lights:** These allow you to adjust the direction and angle of the light beam.\n3. **Dimmable puck lights:** These can be dimmed to adjust the brightness to your preference.\n4. **Wireless puck lights:** These are battery-powered and can be placed anywhere, without the need for wiring.\n\n**Things to Consider:**\n\n1. **Power source:** Make sure you have a suitable power source available, such as a nearby outlet or a dedicated transformer.\n2. **Heat dissipation:** Puck lights can generate heat, so ensure good airflow around the installation to prevent overheating.\n3. **Moisture protection:** If you're installing puck lights near a sink or cooking area, look for models with moisture-resistant or waterproof ratings.\n\nOverall, puck lights are a great option for under-cabinet lighting, offering flexibility, adjustability, and energy efficiency. They're easy to install and can be adapted to various cabinet styles and d\u00e9cors.",
