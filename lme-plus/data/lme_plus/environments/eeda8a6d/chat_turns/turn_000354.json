Here are some tips to help you recognize and challenge these biases:\n\n**Recognizing Gendered Expectations**\n\n1. **Reflect on your upbringing**: Think about the messages you received from family, friends, media, and society about what it means to be a man or woman. How did these messages shape your understanding of gender roles and expectations?\n2. **Identify stereotypes**: Be aware of the stereotypes and gendered expectations that are perpetuated in media, advertising, and everyday conversations. Recognize how these stereotypes can be limiting and harmful.\n3. **Examine your language**: Pay attention to the language you use and the words you choose to describe people.
