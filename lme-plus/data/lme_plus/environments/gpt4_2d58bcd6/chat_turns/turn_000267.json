  "content": "Your text is well-written and provides a clear answer to the question, but here are a few suggestions that could improve it:\n\n1. Provide more specific evidence: While you mention that Tod broke Ricardo's glasses and that he bullies him on a daily basis, you could be more specific about the details that support this. For example, you could mention the dialogue between Tod and Ricardo that shows Tod's bullying behavior.\n2. Use quotes from the text: To make your argument stronger, consider including direct quotes from the text to support your analysis. This will demonstrate that you have closely read and understood the text.\n3. Clarify your argument: While you state that Ricardo is conflicted about how to feel about Tod, it is not entirely clear why he feels this way. To make your argument stronger, consider explaining why Ricardo might feel grateful to Tod for helping him despite the bullying behavior.\n\nHere's an example of how you could revise your text to address these suggestions:\n\nRicardo's attitude towards the narrator is clear in the text. He is a victim of Tod's daily bullying and is understandably upset when Tod breaks his glasses. The text indicates that Ricardo is conflicted about how to feel about Tod. For example, after Tod bullies him, he helps him up and picks up his books. Ricardo may feel grateful for this assistance, but also angry at Tod for the bullying behavior. This complexity is evident in the text when it states, \"Ricardo blinked uncontrollably, unsure of how to feel about Tod. He was fed up with the bullying but grateful for the help.\" (quote from the text).",
