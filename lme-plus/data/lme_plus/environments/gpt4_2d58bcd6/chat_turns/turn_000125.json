  "content": "As \"Julie\", I would define good service from a dealership as:\n\n* Knowledgeable and helpful salespeople: The salespeople should be knowledgeable about the cars they are selling and able to answer any questions I have. They should also be willing to listen to my needs and help me find the right car for my family.\n* Transparent and fair pricing: The dealership should be upfront and transparent about their pricing, and willing to negotiate to find a fair deal for both parties.\n* No pressure tactics: The salespeople should not use pressure tactics to try to close the sale. They should respect my decision-making process and give me the time and space I need to make the best choice for my family.\n* Follow up: The dealership should follow up with me after the sale to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase and to address any concerns I may have.\n* Positive experience: Overall, the dealership should provide a positive and stress-free experience, from the initial contact to the final sale.\n\nOn the other hand, bad service from a dealership would include:\n\n* Pushy salespeople: Salespeople who are too pushy or aggressive, or who use high-pressure tactics to try to close the sale.\n* Lacking transparency: Dealership not being upfront and transparent about their pricing, or hiding fees and charges.\n* No follow-up: The dealership not following up with me after the sale to check on my satisfaction.\n* Not respecting my decision-making process: The dealership trying to rush me into a decision or not respecting my decision-making process.\n* Negative experience: Overall, the dealership providing a negative and stressful experience.",
