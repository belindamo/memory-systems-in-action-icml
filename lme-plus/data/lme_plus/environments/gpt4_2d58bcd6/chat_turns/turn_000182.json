Here's a simple recipe for a single-crust pastry dough that's perfect for a summer fruit tart:\n\n**Simple Pastry Crust Recipe (Single Crust)**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes\n* 1/4 cup ice-cold water\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Combine dry ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.\n2. **Add butter**: Add the cubed butter to the flour mixture and use a pastry blender or your fingertips to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some larger pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.\n3. **Add water**: Sprinkle the ice-cold water over the mixture, then use a fork to gently mix until the dough starts to come together in a shaggy mass. Be careful not to overmix.\n4. **Form a disk**: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it becomes smooth and pliable. Form the dough into a flat disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.\n5. **Roll out the dough**: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm). Transfer the dough to a 9-inch (23 cm) tart pan with a removable bottom. Trim the edges and press the dough into the corners of the pan.\n6. **Chill the crust**: Refrigerate the crust for 15-30 minutes to allow it to firm up before baking.\n\n**Baking the Crust**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.\n3. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.\n4. Remove the parchment paper and pie weights or beans, and let the crust cool completely on a wire rack.\n\n**Assembling the Summer Fruit Tart**\n\n1. Arrange your chosen summer fruits (such as strawberries, blueberries, peaches, or nectarines) on top of the cooled tart crust.\n2. Drizzle with a glaze made from powdered sugar and milk or heavy cream, if desired.\n3. Serve and enjoy!\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to keep your butter cold, as this will help the pastry dough come together better.\n* Don't overwork the dough, or it will become tough and dense.\n* If you're new to making pastry dough, consider making a half-batch to start, just in case.\n* You can also use a food processor to mix the dough, but be careful not to overprocess.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to see how your summer fruit tart turns out!",
