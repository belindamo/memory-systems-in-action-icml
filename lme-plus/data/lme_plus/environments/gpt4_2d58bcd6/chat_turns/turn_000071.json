You can track your routes, distance, speed, and time, as well as compete with friends and join challenges to stay motivated.\n\nAnd, oh, what a fantastic idea to recruit your colleagues from \"The Spikers\" to join you on your outdoor adventures! Having a workout buddy can make a huge difference in your motivation and accountability. It's also a great way to bond with your teammates outside of volleyball and create new memories together.\n\nYou can invite your colleagues to join you on a bike ride or hike and make it a regular thing. You can even create a Strava club for \"The Spikers\" and track your collective progress together!\n\nRemember to start with a route or trail that's comfortable for everyone, and then gradually increase the difficulty level as you all get more comfortable. It's essential to prioritize safety and make sure everyone is having fun.\n\nHow do you plan to convince your colleagues to join you on your outdoor adventures? Are you going to send out a group message or invite them in person?",
