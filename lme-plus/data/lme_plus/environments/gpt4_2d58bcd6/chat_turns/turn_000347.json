For example, you can filter the \"Vehicle\" column to show only the 2018 Toyota Corolla's maintenance history.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Be consistent with your vehicle names (e.g., always use \"2018 Toyota Corolla\" instead of \"Toyota Corolla\" or \"Corolla\").\n* Use a standard format for the \"Description\" column (e.g., \"Oil change and tire rotation\" instead of \"oil change, tire rotation\").\n* Consider using a separate column for the type of maintenance or repair (e.g., \"Scheduled\", \"Unscheduled\", \"Repair\", \"Inspection\").\n* You can use formulas to calculate total costs per vehicle, average cost per mile, or other metrics that are important to you.\n\nRemember to update your spreadsheet regularly, and review it periodically to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement. This will help you stay on top of your vehicle maintenance costs and make informed decisions about your vehicles' care.",
