  "content": "\"PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Yunascension!\" is indeed a highly anticipated release from King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard! While the band has been tight-lipped about the album's details, here's what we know so far:\n\n**Title and artwork**\n\nThe title, \"PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Yunascension!\", is a mouthful, and it's characteristic of KG&LW's love for elaborate, fantastical, and humorous titles. The artwork, revealed on their social media channels, features a stunning illustration of a dragon-like creature emerging from a volcano, surrounded by flames, clouds, and mystical symbols. The artwork is reminiscent of classic fantasy literature and hints at the album's themes of transformation and upheaval.\n\n**Themes and inspiration**\n\nStu Mackenzie has mentioned that the album is inspired by the current state of the world, including environmental disasters, social unrest, and the feeling of impending doom. However, he's also stated that the album is not a straightforward protest record, but rather an exploration of the human experience in the face of uncertainty and chaos.\n\n**Musical direction**\n\nWhile the band has kept the album's sonic details under wraps, we can expect \"PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Yunascension!\" to be a dynamic and eclectic record, given KG&LW's track record of experimentation and genre-hopping. Fans are speculating about the possible inclusion of new sounds, instruments, and techniques, building upon their previous work in psychedelic rock, heavy metal, and electronic music.\n\n**Tracklist and length**\n\nThe tracklist has not been officially announced, but rumors suggest that the album will feature around 10-12 tracks, with some songs reportedly clocking in at over 10 minutes. This could indicate a more sprawling, epic approach, similar to their 2019 album \"Infest the Rats' Nest\".\n\n**Release date and formats**\n\nThe album is expected to drop in the spring of 2023, although no exact date has been confirmed. Fans can anticipate a variety of formats, including vinyl, CD, digital, and possibly even cassette tapes. The band has a history of offering limited-edition releases, so keep an eye out for special edition vinyl colors, artwork, and bundles.\n\n**Tour and live performances**\n\nKG&LW are known for their intense live shows, and they'll likely embark on a tour to support the album. Expect them to perform new material, as well as fan favorites from their extensive discography. The live shows will likely feature an enhanced visual experience, with elaborate lighting, video projections, and possibly even pyrotechnics.\n\nKeep in mind that the details are still scarce, and the band might surprise us with unexpected twists and turns. As more information becomes available, I'll be happy to provide updates on \"PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Yunascension!\"",
