I'll mention that it'll be a fun way to stay active together outside of volleyball and catch up with each other. I might also share some pictures from our volleyball tournament win to get them excited and nostalgic about our team bonding experience.\n\nHere's a sample message: \"Hey Spikers! Now that our volleyball tournament is over, I was thinking it would be great to stay active together and explore some outdoor trails. Who's up for a bike ride or hike on the weekends? It'll be a fantastic way to catch up and get some exercise together. Let me know if you're interested, and we can plan a route and time that works for everyone!\"",
