  "content": "One tip to make the chicken extra tender in this Coq au Vin recipe is to let it marinate in the red wine for a few hours or overnight before cooking. This will help to break down the fibers in the meat and infuse it with the flavors of the marinade. Another tip is to cook the dish on low heat for a longer period of time, which will allow the chicken to slowly cook and become tender. Make sure to keep the dish covered to prevent it from drying out. Finally, be sure not to overcook the chicken. Check it regularly while it's cooking to prevent it from becoming dry and tough. When the chicken is fully cooked and tender, it should easily come apart with a fork.",
