  "content": "Yoga is an excellent way to improve flexibility, balance, and strength. For ankle flexibility and strength, I recommend the following yoga poses:\n\n1. **Ankle Circles**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one foot off the ground and draw circles with your ankle, starting from small circles and increasing in size. Repeat for 5-10 repetitions in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Switch legs and repeat.\n2. **Toe Spreads**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one foot off the ground and spread your toes as far apart as possible. Then, bring them back together. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions. Switch legs and repeat.\n3. **Ankle Alphabet**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one foot off the ground and draw the alphabet with your toes, starting from A and moving up to Z. Repeat on the other leg.\n4. **Calf Raises**: Stand on the edge of a stair or step with your heels hanging off the edge. Slowly raise up onto your tiptoes and then lower back down. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n5. **Downward-Facing Dog**: Start on all fours. Walk your hands forward and lift your hips up and back, straightening your arms and legs. Keep your ankles in line with your shoulders and engage your core. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n6. **Tree Pose**: Stand on one leg, with the other foot resting on the inner thigh. Engage your core, lift your chest, and gaze forward. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Switch legs and repeat.\n7. **Eagle Pose**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Bend your knees slightly and cross one leg over the other, wrapping your ankle around your calf. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Switch legs and repeat.\n8. **Seated Forward Fold**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Inhale and lengthen your spine. Exhale and fold forward, reaching for your toes or shins. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and modify or come out of the pose if you experience any discomfort or pain. It's also essential to warm up before starting any yoga practice, especially if you're new to yoga or have any underlying injuries.\n\nIn addition to these poses, you can also try incorporating ankle mobility exercises into your daily routine, such as:\n\n* Ankle rotations: Rotate your ankle in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions for 5-10 repetitions.\n* Toe curls: Curl your toes under and then release for 10-15 repetitions.\n* Heel raises: Stand on a flat surface and raise up onto your heels, then lower back down for 10-15 repetitions.\n\nRemember to be consistent and patient with your stretching routine. It may take some time to notice improvements in your ankle flexibility and strength, but with regular practice, you'll be on your way to stronger, more flexible ankles.",
