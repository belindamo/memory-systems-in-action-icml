  "content": "Apple TV+ is a relatively new player in the streaming market, and while they've made a strong start with their original content, they still have some catching up to do in terms of diversity and quantity.\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" and \"The Morning Show\" are both great examples of Apple TV+'s ability to attract top talent and produce high-quality content. However, as you mentioned, their library is still relatively small compared to other streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIf you're considering whether to continue your subscription after the free trial ends, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Exclusive content**: Apple TV+ has some fantastic original shows and movies that can't be found on other platforms. If you're invested in their exclusive content, it might be worth continuing your subscription.\n2. **Quality over quantity**: While Apple TV+ might not have as many titles as other services, they're focusing on producing high-quality, well-crafted content. If you value quality over quantity, Apple TV+ might be a good fit for you.\n3. **Growing library**: Apple TV+ is still a relatively new service, and they're constantly adding new content. They've announced several exciting projects in development, including shows from big names like Oprah Winfrey, Martin Scorsese, and M. Night Shyamalan.\n4. **Bundle deals**: Apple offers a bundle deal that includes Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, and iCloud storage. If you're already using or planning to use these services, the bundle might be a cost-effective option.\n5. **Free trial extensions**: Apple occasionally offers free trial extensions or promotional pricing for new subscribers. Keep an eye on their website or social media for potential deals.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether Apple TV+ is worth the subscription cost. If you're not finding enough content that resonates with you, you might consider canceling or pausing your subscription. However, if you're enjoying their exclusive shows and appreciate the focus on quality over quantity, it might be worth continuing your subscription.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any specific genres or types of content you're looking for that Apple TV+ is missing?",
