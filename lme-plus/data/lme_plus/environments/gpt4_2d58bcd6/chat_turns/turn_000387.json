  "content": "While Ozark's 45-60 minute episodes are great for in-depth storytelling, I understand the desire for shorter episodes that still pack a punch. Here are some shows with complex characters and shorter episode lengths (around 20-30 minutes per episode):\n\n1. **Fleabag** (20-25 minutes per episode): A critically acclaimed comedy-drama that explores the life of a dry-witted, sexually liberated woman navigating modern life in London.\n2. **Russian Doll** (25-30 minutes per episode): A dark comedy-drama that follows a woman who keeps reliving the same night, as she tries to figure out what's happening to her and how to escape the time loop.\n3. **Killing Eve** (22-25 minutes per episode): A spy thriller that follows a cat-and-mouse game between an MI6 agent and a psychopathic assassin. (Note: While not all episodes are exactly 20-30 minutes, most are around this length.)\n4. **Schitt's Creek** (22-25 minutes per episode): A heartwarming comedy that follows a wealthy family who loses everything and is forced to move to a small town they purchased as a joke.\n5. **Better Things** (20-25 minutes per episode): A comedy-drama that follows a single mother and actress as she navigates her career, relationships, and raising three daughters in Los Angeles.\n6. **Shameless** (20-25 minutes per episode): A gritty comedy-drama that follows a dysfunctional family living in poverty on the South Side of Chicago.\n7. **Trailer Park Boys** (22-25 minutes per episode): A Canadian sitcom that follows a group of trailer park residents in Nova Scotia, exploring themes of crime, addiction, and friendship.\n8. **It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia** (20-25 minutes per episode): A dark comedy that follows a group of friends who run a dive bar in Philadelphia, often getting into absurd and morally questionable situations.\n9. **Arrested Development** (20-25 minutes per episode): A witty comedy that follows the dysfunctional Bluth family, a formerly wealthy family trying to make a comeback.\n10. **What We Do in the Shadows** (20-25 minutes per episode): A mockumentary-style sitcom that follows a group of vampires living in New York City, exploring the mundane aspects of immortal life.\n\nThese shows offer complex characters, engaging storylines, and a shorter episode length to fit your commute or preferred viewing schedule. Enjoy!",
