  "content": "Succulents are a fantastic choice for indoor plants, and Shimokitazawa has some great options for you.\n\nAmong the shops I mentioned earlier, **Green Space** () is likely to have the widest variety of succulents. They specialize in indoor plants, and succulents are one of their main focuses. They usually carry a diverse range of species, including popular ones like Aloe, Echeveria, Crassula, and Sedum, as well as some more rare and unusual varieties.\n\nThey also have a knowledgeable staff who can help you choose the right succulent for your apartment's lighting conditions and provide care tips. Additionally, they often have a variety of planters and pots that can complement your new succulent friends.\n\n**Jardini\u00e8re** () might also carry some succulents, but their selection might be more curated and focused on higher-end or more unique species. They tend to have a more boutique-like atmosphere, so you might find some rare or hard-to-find succulents, but the selection might be smaller than Green Space.\n\nThe other flower shops I mentioned might carry some succulents, but their selection might be more limited. If you're looking for a specific type of succulent, I'd recommend calling ahead to Green Space or Jardini\u00e8re to inquire about their current stock.\n\nIf you're willing to venture a bit further, there's also a popular succulent specialty store called **Succulent Studio** () located in nearby Setagaya Ward (about 20-30 minutes from Shimokitazawa by train). They have an incredible selection of succulents from around the world, and the owners are very knowledgeable about succulent care.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy succulent hunting!",
