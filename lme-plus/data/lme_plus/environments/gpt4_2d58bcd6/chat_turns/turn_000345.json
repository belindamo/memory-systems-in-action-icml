  "content": "You can definitely track multiple vehicles in one spreadsheet. Here are a few ways to do it:\n\n**Method 1: Separate Sheets**\n\n1. Create a single spreadsheet with multiple sheets, one for each vehicle.\n2. Name each sheet with the vehicle's make, model, and year (e.g., \"2015 Honda Civic\", \"2018 Toyota Camry\", etc.).\n3. Each sheet will have the same columns (Date, Description, Cost, Mileage, Category, etc.) as before.\n4. This method is useful if you want to view each vehicle's maintenance history separately, but still have them all in one spreadsheet.\n\n**Method 2: Single Sheet with Vehicle Column**\n\n1. Create a single sheet with an additional column for \"Vehicle\" (or \"Vehicle ID\" if you have multiple vehicles with the same make and model).\n2. Enter the vehicle's make, model, and year in the \"Vehicle\" column for each maintenance or repair event.\n3. You can then use filters or sorting to view the maintenance history for a specific vehicle.\n4. This method is useful if you want to see all your vehicles' maintenance history in one place, with the ability to quickly filter by vehicle.\n\n**Method 3: Single Sheet with Vehicle Tabs**\n\n1. Create a single sheet with a table for each vehicle, separated by tabs or sections.\n2. Use a different tab or section for each vehicle, with the same columns (Date, Description, Cost, Mileage, Category, etc.) as before.\n3. This method is useful if you want to view each vehicle's maintenance history separately, but still have them all in one sheet.\n\nTo make it easier to manage multiple vehicles in one spreadsheet, you can also consider:\n\n* Using a unique identifier for each vehicle (e.g., \"HONDA_CIVIC_2015\" or \"TOYOTA_CAMRY_2018\") to quickly identify the vehicle in the spreadsheet.\n* Creating a \"Vehicle Info\" sheet that lists all your vehicles, with columns for make, model, year, VIN, and other relevant information.\n* Using conditional formatting or formulas to highlight or calculate specific information, such as total costs per vehicle or average cost per mile.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and feel free to modify it as needed as you start tracking your vehicle maintenance costs!",
