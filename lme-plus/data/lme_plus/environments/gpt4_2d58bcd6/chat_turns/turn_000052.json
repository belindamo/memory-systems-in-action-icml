I actually finished reading three fiction novels last weekend - \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\", \"The Silent Patient\", and \"The Nightingale\". They were all so different, and I loved them. Do you think any of the authors or books you recommended would appeal to someone who enjoys a mix of genres and styles?",
