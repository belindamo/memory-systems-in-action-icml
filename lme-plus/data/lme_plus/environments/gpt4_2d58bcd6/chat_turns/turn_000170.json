I'm here to provide information and assistance to help you with your lighting needs.\n\nHowever, I'm happy to summarize the tasks you've discussed with me:\n\n1. Replacing the light bulbs in your kitchen with brighter, whiter options.\n2. Cleaning the skylight in your bathroom to improve natural light.\n3. Exploring new lighting setups in your home office, possibly incorporating layered lighting, task lighting, and ambient lighting.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance on these tasks. Have a great weekend, and I hope you enjoy the improved ambiance in your home!",
