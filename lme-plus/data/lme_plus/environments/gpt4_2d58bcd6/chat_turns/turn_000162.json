  "content": "A modern and energy-efficient option sounds like a great direction to take.\n\nPendant lights can be a fantastic choice for a small dining room, but you're right to consider the table's shape. Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Linear pendant lights**: If you have a rectangular table, a linear pendant light that runs parallel to the table's length can create a beautiful, harmonious look. This type of pendant light can be especially effective if you have a longer, narrower table.\n2. **Multi-pendant lights**: Another option is to use multiple pendant lights, arranged in a row or a staggered pattern, to create a visually appealing focal point above the table. This can add depth and interest to the space.\n3. **Pendant light size**: Make sure to choose pendant lights that are proportionate to the size of your table and the room. A larger pendant light might overwhelm a small table, while a smaller one might get lost.\n4. **Adjustable pendant lights**: Consider pendant lights with adjustable arms or heads, which can be directed to provide task lighting where you need it most.\n5. **LED pendant lights**: Since you mentioned energy efficiency, LED pendant lights are an excellent choice. They're not only eco-friendly but also provide bright, crisp light with a long lifespan.\n\nSome popular modern pendant light styles that might work well for your dining room include:\n\n1. **Minimalist cylinder pendant lights**: Sleek, cylindrical pendant lights in a polished metal finish, such as chrome or brass, can add a touch of modern sophistication.\n2. **Glass pendant lights**: Pendant lights with glass shades can add warmth and visual interest to the space. Look for energy-efficient options with LED lights inside.\n3. **Industrial-chic pendant lights**: Exposed bulbs or metal shades can create a stylish, industrial look that's perfect for a modern dining room.\n\nBefore making a final decision, you might want to:\n\n1. **Measure your space**: Take precise measurements of your dining room, including the table's dimensions and the distance between the table and the ceiling.\n2. **Create a mockup**: Use online visualization tools or apps to create a mockup of your dining room with different pendant light options. This can help you get a better sense of how the lighting will look in the space.\n3. **Read reviews and check certifications**: Research different pendant light options, read reviews, and look for certifications like Energy Star or UL (Underwriters Laboratories) to ensure you're getting a high-quality, energy-efficient product.\n\nI hope this helps you get started on your search for the perfect pendant lights!",
