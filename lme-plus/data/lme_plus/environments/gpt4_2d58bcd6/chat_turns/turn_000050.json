I've been trying to read more diversely and I just finished \"The Hate U Give\" by Angie Thomas, which I had to rush to finish for my book club meeting two weeks ago - I was the only one who hadn't finished it, but I managed to finish it a few days before. Do you have any suggestions for similar books or authors I might like?",
