This will not only improve your overall fitness but also enhance your performance in cardio activities like volleyball.\n\nHere are some essential exercises you can do at the gym to get started:\n\n**Upper Body:**\n\n1. Push-ups: A classic exercise that targets your chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n2. Dumbbell Chest Press: Lie on a flat bench and press dumbbells upwards, squeezing your chest muscles.\n3. Bent Over Dumbbell Rows: Targets your back and biceps.\n4. Tricep Dips (using a bench or assisted dip machine): Works your triceps.\n5. Bicep Curls: Use dumbbells or a barbell to target your biceps.\n\n**Lower Body:**\n\n1. Squats: Works your legs, glutes, and core.\n2. Leg Press: Targets your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.\n3. Lunges: Alternate legs to work your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.\n4. Leg Extensions: Isolates your quadriceps.\n5. Leg Curls: Targets your hamstrings.\n\n**Core:**\n\n1. Plank: Strengthens your core, shoulders, and back.\n2. Russian Twists (using a medicine ball): Targets your obliques.\n3. Leg Raises (hanging or on a bench): Works your lower abs.\n\n**Full Body:**\n\n1. Burpees: A compound exercise that works your entire body.\n2. Mountain Climbers: Targets your legs, core, and arms.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Start with lighter weights and gradually increase the load as you build strength.\n* Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 reps for each exercise.\n* Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets.\n* Incorporate exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once (compound exercises) to save time and boost efficiency.\n\nAs you're new to strength training, it's essential to focus on proper form and technique over the number of weights or reps. You can always ask a personal trainer or gym staff for guidance if needed.\n\nLastly, be sure to warm up before your workout with 5-10 minutes of cardio (e.g., treadmill, stationary bike, or jumping jacks) and stretch afterwards to prevent injuries.\n\nHave fun exploring these exercises and adjusting your routine as you progress!",
