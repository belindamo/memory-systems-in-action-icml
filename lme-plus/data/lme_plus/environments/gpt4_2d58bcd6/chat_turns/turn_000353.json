  "content": "Adding a column to track the type of maintenance or repair is a great way to categorize and analyze your data. Here's how you can modify your spreadsheet to add this column:\n\n**Step 1: Insert a new column**\n\n* Open your spreadsheet and select the entire column to the right of the \"Description\" column (i.e., the column next to the \"Description\" column).\n* Right-click on the selected column and choose \"Insert\" (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+=> on Windows or Command+Shift+=> on Mac).\n* This will insert a new column to the right of the \"Description\" column.\n\n**Step 2: Name the new column**\n\n* Enter a header title for the new column, such as \"Type\" or \"Maintenance Type\".\n* You can also use a more descriptive title, like \"Maintenance Category\" or \"Repair Type\", depending on your preference.\n\n**Step 3: Populate the new column**\n\n* Start entering the type of maintenance or repair for each entry in the \"Type\" column.\n* Use a consistent set of categories, such as:\n\t+ Scheduled: for routine maintenance, like oil changes or tire rotations\n\t+ Unscheduled: for unexpected repairs or maintenance\n\t+ Repair: for repairs or replacements of specific parts\n\t+ Inspection: for vehicle inspections or diagnostic checks\n\t+ Other: for any other type of maintenance or repair that doesn't fit into the above categories\n* You can also use numbers or codes instead of text, if you prefer. For example, 1 for Scheduled, 2 for Unscheduled, and so on.\n\nHere's an updated example of your spreadsheet with the new \"Type\" column:\n\n| Date | Vehicle | Description | Cost | Mileage | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022-02-15 | 2018 Toyota Corolla | Oil change and tire rotation | 35.00 | 25,000 | Scheduled |\n| 2022-03-01 | 2015 Honda Civic | Faulty oxygen sensor replacement and brake pad replacement | 250.00 | 60,500 | Unscheduled |\n| 2022-04-10 | 2020 Honda Odyssey | Scheduled maintenance (30,000 miles) | 120.00 | 30,500 | Scheduled |\n| 2022-05-15 | 2007 Yamaha FZ6 | Chain cleaning and lubrication | 20.00 | 35,000 | Scheduled |\n\nNow you can use the \"Type\" column to filter, sort, or analyze your data by maintenance type. This will help you identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in your vehicle maintenance routine.",
