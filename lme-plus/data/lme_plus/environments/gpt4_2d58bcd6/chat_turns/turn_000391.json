  "content": "\"Schitt's Creek\" is a fantastic show, but it's not actually an Apple TV+ original. It's a Canadian television sitcom that originally aired on CBC Television in Canada and was later picked up by Netflix in the US.\n\nHowever, I think you might be confusing it with another show. Apple TV+ does have a comedy series called \"Schmigadoon!\", which is a parody of classic musicals and stars Cecily Strong and Keegan-Michael Key. It's a hilarious and heartwarming show that explores the world of musical theater.\n\nIf you're looking for comedy content on Apple TV+, I'd definitely recommend checking out \"Schmigadoon!\". They also have other comedies like \"Ted Lasso\", which I mentioned earlier, as well as \"The Afterparty\", a murder-mystery comedy series starring Tiffany Haddish and Sam Richardson.\n\nBut if you're really interested in watching \"Schitt's Creek\", you can find it on Netflix in the US. It's a wonderful show that explores themes of family, love, and acceptance, and it's definitely worth watching if you enjoy heartwarming comedies.",
