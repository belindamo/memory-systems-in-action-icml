Here's one I just came up with:\n\nTitle: Color Clash\n\nNumber of players: 2-6\n\nDeck: Standard 52-card deck\n\nObjective: The objective of the game is to score the most points by creating sets of cards with matching colors.\n\nGameplay:\n\n1. Shuffle the deck of cards and deal 7 cards to each player. Place the remaining cards in the center of the table, forming a draw pile.\n2. On each turn, a player draws one card from the draw pile and then plays one card from their hand face up on the table. The player must then declare a color.\n3. All players then check to see if they have any cards in their hand that match the declared color. If they do, they must play all cards of that color from their hand face up on the table in front of them.\n4. The player who played the card that triggered the color match then draws another card from the draw pile and plays another card from their hand, repeating the process.\n5. If a player is unable to play a card or has no cards left in their hand, they draw one card from the draw pile and their turn ends.\n6. Play continues until the draw pile runs out. At that point, players tally up the number of cards they played of each color, with each card being worth one point. Players may also score bonus points for having the most cards of a certain color or for having a \"rainbow\" set of all 4 colors.\n7. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.\n\nNote: This is just a basic framework, and additional rules or tweaks could be added to make the game more interesting or challenging.",
