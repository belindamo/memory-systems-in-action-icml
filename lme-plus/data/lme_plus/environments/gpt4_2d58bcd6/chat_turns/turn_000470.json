  "content": "Community associations may or may not charge local businesses for their services or support during tough economic times. It will depend on the specific community association and the services they offer. Some community associations operate on a membership basis where businesses need to pay a fee for membership which may include certain services or benefits. In this case, businesses may need to pay for the support and services provided to them. However, some community associations may offer certain services and support for free as a way of supporting local businesses during tough economic times. It is important for businesses to inquire about the costs associated with the services and support offered by the community associations and decide accordingly.",
