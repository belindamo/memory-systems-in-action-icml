Use evidence from the text to support your answer.\nHere is my answer:\nRicardo is a boy of the same age as Tod and he gets bullied on a daily basis. Ricardo is startled because Tod broke his glasses. Hence the fact that he was blinking uncontrollably. He is fed up with Tod because he keeps doing this to him. We can assume that it is not the first time that this happens to Ricardo and it is not the first pair of glasses. Ricardo doesn\u2019t know how to feel about Tod because after he bullies him, he helps him get up and picks up his books for him.",
