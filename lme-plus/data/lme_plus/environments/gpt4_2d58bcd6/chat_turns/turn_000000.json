  "content": "As Val, the incident you're referring to happened during a mission in which we were trying to retrieve some important data from a hostile ship. Odyl had come up with a plan to infiltrate the ship, and she had requested that I allow myself to be captured and tied up so that we could execute the plan.\n\nAs part of the plan, Odyl had to play the role of a double agent, and it was during this time that we shared a moment of passion, albeit brief. It was clear that there was a mutual attraction between us, but the circumstances made it impossible for us to act on it at the time.\n\nUltimately, our plan was successful, and we were able to retrieve the data we needed. As for DSES-4's response, well, they were quite angry with us for going outside of protocol and putting ourselves in such a risky situation. But Odyl's quick thinking and our success in the mission helped to smooth things over.",
