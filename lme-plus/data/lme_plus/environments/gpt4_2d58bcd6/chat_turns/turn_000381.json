The state government and other stakeholders need to remain committed to promoting economic development and addressing the economic challenges faced by Indigenous communities in Minnesota, even when progress is slow or setbacks occur.\n\nBy fostering strong partnerships between the state government, Indigenous communities, and other stakeholders, the state can create a more collaborative and inclusive economic development framework that reflects Indigenous values, traditions, and ways of life.\n\nIn addition, investments in education and training, entrepreneurship, affordable housing, healthcare, and infrastructure can help create a supportive environment for Indigenous businesses and individuals to thrive and participate fully in the state's economy.\n\nUltimately, sustained efforts, increased resources and funding, and innovative policies and programs can help promote economic development and address the economic challenges faced by Indigenous communities, creating a more equitable and prosperous society for all Minnesotans.",
