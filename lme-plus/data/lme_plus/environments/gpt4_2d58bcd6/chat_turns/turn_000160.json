However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to see or recall your living room or the table lamps you've set up. But I can still provide you with general guidance on dining room lighting options.\n\nIt's great that you're looking to replace the harsh overhead fixture with something more inviting. Here are a few questions to consider when selecting new lighting for your dining room:\n\n1. **Ambiance**: What kind of ambiance are you aiming for in your dining room? Do you want it to be bright and energizing or soft and intimate?\n2. **Lighting layers**: Consider using a combination of light sources to create a layered lighting effect. This can include overhead lighting, table lamps, floor lamps, or even candles.\n3. **Task lighting**: Think about the tasks you'll be performing in the dining room, such as eating, reading, or working. You may want to position task lighting, like under-cabinet lighting or pendant lights, to focus on specific areas.\n4. **Style and design**: Choose lighting fixtures that complement your dining room's style and decor. You can opt for modern, traditional, rustic, or any other style that fits your taste.\n5. **Dimmer switches**: Installing dimmer switches can help you adjust the lighting level to suit different occasions and moods.\n\nSome popular dining room lighting options include:\n\n1. **Chandeliers**: A stylish and elegant choice, chandeliers can add a touch of sophistication to your dining room.\n2. **Pendant lights**: Suspended from the ceiling, pendant lights can provide focused lighting and create a modern, sleek look.\n3. **Recessed lighting**: Recessed lights can be installed in the ceiling to provide soft, ambient lighting.\n4. **Table lamps**: Adding table lamps can create a warm and inviting atmosphere, especially if you choose soft shades like the ones you mentioned.\n5. **Sconces**: Wall-mounted sconces can add a touch of elegance and provide soft, indirect lighting.\n\nRemember to consider factors like the size of your dining room, the color scheme, and the type of furniture you have when selecting your new lighting fixtures.\n\nFeel free to share more about your dining room, and I can provide more tailored advice!",
