  "content": "Canasta is a rummy-type card game for two to six players. The game is played with two standard decks of cards, plus four jokers (a total of 108 cards).\n\nThe objective of the game is to score points by forming melds, which are sets of three or more cards of the same rank, or by forming canastas, which are melds of seven cards of the same rank.\n\nHere are the basic rules of Canasta:\n\n1. Each player is dealt a hand of 11 cards.\n2. The remaining cards are placed in a draw pile, with the top card turned face up.\n3. Players take turns either drawing the top card from the draw pile, or picking up the entire discard pile (if they can use the top card to form a meld).\n4. Players form melds by placing sets of three or more cards of the same rank on the table in front of them.\n5. Players can also add cards to existing melds.\n6. A player can only form a meld after they have laid down a certain number of points in previous melds. The number of points required varies based on the number of melds the player has already formed.\n7. Jokers are wild and can be used as any rank.\n8. When a player goes out, the hand ends and the other players score points for cards still in their hands.\n9. The game continues until one player or team reaches a certain number of points.\n\nCanasta can be a bit more complicated than this, but these are the basic rules. If you're interested in playing, there are many resources online that provide more detailed instructions and strategies.",
