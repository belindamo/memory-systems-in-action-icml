  "content": "Sure, we could introduce melds into the game. Here's one possible way to do it:\n\n1. Melds are sets of three or more cards of the same rank. For example, a meld could consist of three Jacks or four Aces.\n2. A player may only lay down a meld if they have already put down at least one set of three cards of the same rank as a \"base meld\".\n3. Once a player has put down a base meld, they can add additional melds to it on subsequent turns. For example, if a player has a meld consisting of three Jacks and a base meld of three Aces, they could lay down a new meld of three Kings and add it to the base meld to form a meld of three Aces, three Jacks, and three Kings.\n4. A player can add to their opponent's melds if they can legally play a card of the same rank. For example, if your opponent has a meld of four Queens, you could add a Queen from your hand to that meld on your turn.\n5. The game continues until one player runs out of cards or until the draw pile is depleted and no more melds can be made. At that point, the player with the most points from melds wins the game.\n\nOf course, the rules for melding can be modified in many different ways, so feel free to adjust them to your liking.",
