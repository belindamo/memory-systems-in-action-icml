Open the \"Google Play Store\" app on your Android smartphone. 2. Tap on the three horizontal lines (also known as the \"hamburger\" menu) in the top left corner of the screen. 3. From the menu that appears, select \"My apps & games.\" 4. You'll see two tabs - \"Updates\" and \"Installed.\" The \"Updates\" tab displays all the apps that have been updated or have pending updates. 5. The apps that have been updated automatically will have a tag that says \"Updated\" next to them. 6. If you want to see the update history of a particular app, tap on the app and scroll down to the \"Version history\" section. And that's it! You can now check which apps have been updated automatically on your Android smartphone.",
