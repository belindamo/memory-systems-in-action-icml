  "content": "What a wonderful occasion! Congratulations to your grandparents on their 50th anniversary!\n\nI'd be delighted to help you with some summer BBQ recipe ideas, both old and new! It's great that you have a solid foundation from your experience cooking with your mom. You can definitely incorporate some of those tried-and-true dishes into your BBQ menu.\n\nTo get started, what type of BBQ are you envisioning? Are you thinking classic American-style with burgers, hot dogs, and sides, or do you want to explore other cuisines, like Mexican, Korean, or Mediterranean-inspired flavors?\n\nAlso, how many guests are you expecting, and what's your budget for ingredients? Knowing these details will help me provide more tailored suggestions.\n\nLastly, are there any specific courses or dishes you're looking to add or replace from your previous menu? For example, do you want more appetizers, main courses, sides, or desserts?\n\nLet's get the BBQ planning started!",
