However, some convenience stores in Shimokitazawa might carry them. Here's what I found:\n\n1. **Lawson**: There are a few Lawson convenience stores in Shimokitazawa, but only one of them carries Takis:\n\t* Lawson Shimokitazawa Ekimae (): 2-14-3 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo (about 5-minute walk from Shimokitazawa Station)\n\tPhone: 03-3411-5131\n\t* They usually carry a limited selection of Takis flavors, but it's best to call ahead to confirm availability.\n2. **FamilyMart**: There's one FamilyMart location in Shimokitazawa that might carry Takis:\n\t* FamilyMart Shimokitazawa (): 2-16-10 Kitazawa, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo (about 7-minute walk from Shimokitazawa Station)\n\tPhone: 03-3411-1188\n\t* They might not always have Takis in stock, so it's a good idea to call ahead to check.\n\nPlease note that availability and selection might vary depending on the store and the time of day. If you're unable to find Takis at these locations, you might consider visiting a larger international grocery store or a specialty import shop in Tokyo.\n\nIf you'd like to explore other options, you can try using online maps or store finders to locate other convenience stores or international markets in the area. Some popular alternatives include:\n\n* 7-Eleven\n* Ministop\n* Seicomart\n* Kaldi Coffee Farm (imported snacks and food)\n\nI hope this helps you satisfy your Takis craving!",
