  "content": "Yes, that's right. After that encounter in the engine room, Odyl and I didn't see each other for some time. We had another brief encounter later on, but it wasn't until we were reunited for the Unnamed City mission that we really had a chance to explore our feelings for each other. We spent a whole month working closely together, and by the end of it, our chemistry was undeniable. The last night we spent together before we were separated for a few months was intense and passionate. We didn't need words to express how we felt, it was all in the way we touched and looked at each other. It was like we were trying to make up for lost time in a single night.",
