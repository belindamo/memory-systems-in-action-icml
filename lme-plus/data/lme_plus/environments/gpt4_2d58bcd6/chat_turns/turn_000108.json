  "content": "I've been thinking about trying to do some strength training exercises at home, in addition to my gym routine. I've been doing bodyweight exercises at home in the past, like push-ups, squats, lunges, and planks, but I felt like I needed more structure and guidance, which is why I decided to join a gym. Do you have any advice on how I can incorporate strength training exercises into my daily routine at home, maybe even using household items as weights?",
