  "content": "It's generally recommended to enter the mileage at the time of the maintenance or repair. This is because the mileage at the time of the service is more relevant to the specific maintenance or repair event.\n\nEntering the mileage at the time of the service allows you to:\n\n1. Track the maintenance history of each vehicle accurately, including the mileage at which specific services were performed.\n2. Easily identify when maintenance is due based on mileage intervals (e.g., oil changes every 5,000 miles).\n3. Analyze the relationship between mileage and maintenance costs, which can help you plan for future expenses.\n\nIf you enter the current mileage of the vehicle, it may not accurately reflect the mileage at the time of the service, especially if there's a significant gap between services. For example, if you enter the current mileage of 30,000 miles for a service that was performed at 25,000 miles, it may distort your analysis of maintenance costs and mileage intervals.\n\nHowever, it's still a good idea to keep track of the current mileage of each vehicle, especially if you want to plan for upcoming maintenance or estimate when certain services will be due. You could add a separate column to your spreadsheet to track the current mileage of each vehicle, or use a separate sheet or document to keep track of this information.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
