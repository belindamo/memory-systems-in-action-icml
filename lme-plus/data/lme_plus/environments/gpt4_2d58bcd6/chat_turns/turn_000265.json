  "content": "Your answer provides a reasonable analysis of Ricardo's attitude towards the narrator. You use evidence from the text to support your answer, which is important in making a convincing argument.\n\nYou correctly point out that Ricardo is a victim of bullying and is constantly subjected to it by Tod. You also mention that Ricardo is startled and upset when Tod breaks his glasses, indicating that he has had enough of Tod's behavior. These observations suggest that Ricardo does not think highly of the narrator.\n\nFurthermore, you correctly point out that Ricardo is conflicted about how to feel about Tod because despite his bullying behavior, Tod also helps him up and picks up his books for him. This complexity in their relationship suggests that Ricardo has mixed feelings towards the narrator.\n\nOverall, your answer provides a good analysis of Ricardo's thoughts and feelings towards the narrator based on the evidence provided in the text.",
