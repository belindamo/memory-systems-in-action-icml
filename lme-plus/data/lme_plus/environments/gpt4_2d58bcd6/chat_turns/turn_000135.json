This would give you enough juice to complete your round trip with some reserve power.\n\nWhen shopping for an e-bike, look for the following:\n\n* Battery type and capacity\n* Estimated range (check the manufacturer's specifications)\n* Real-world reviews and user feedback\n* Battery management system (BMS) features, such as:\n\t+ Low-battery warnings\n\t+ Regenerative braking\n\t+ Smart charging\n\nKeep in mind that you can always upgrade your battery or add a range extender in the future if needed.\n\nDo you have any other questions about e-bike batteries or range, or would you like some recommendations for models that fit your commute?",
