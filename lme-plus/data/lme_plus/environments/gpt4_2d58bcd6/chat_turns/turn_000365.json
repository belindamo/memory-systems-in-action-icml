A small herb garden is a wonderful addition to any apartment, and it's perfect for adding some fresh flavors to your cooking.\n\nGreen Space () is an excellent choice for herbs, and they usually carry a variety of herbs that thrive in indoor conditions.

Basil: A classic choice for indoor gardens, basil is easy to grow and can thrive in low-light conditions.\n2. Mint: Mint is another hardy herb that can tolerate partial shade and infrequent watering.\n3. Parsley: A slow-growing herb that prefers partial shade and consistent moisture.\n4. Chives: Chives are a great choice for indoor gardens, as they're low-maintenance and can tolerate a range of light conditions.\n5. Thyme: Thyme is a low-growing, drought-tolerant herb that's perfect for indoor gardens.\n6. Cilantro: Also known as coriander, cilantro is an fast-growing herb that prefers well-draining soil and partial shade.\n\nIn addition to Green Space, you might also find herbs at:\n\n1. **Jardini\u00e8re** (): They often carry a selection of herbs, including more exotic varieties like lemongrass and rosemary.\n2. **Flower Market Shimokitazawa** (): This flower shop sometimes carries a limited selection of herbs, usually basil, mint, and parsley.\n\nBefore visiting, it's a good idea to call ahead and confirm the availability of the herbs you're interested in.
