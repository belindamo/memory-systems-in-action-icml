Open the \"Google Play Store\" app on your Android smartphone.\n\n2. Tap on the three horizontal lines (also known as the \"hamburger\" menu) in the top left corner of the screen.\n\n3. From the menu that appears, select \"Settings.\"\n\n4. Scroll down to the \"General\" section and tap on \"Auto-update apps.\"\n\n5. You'll now see three options - \"Do not auto-update apps,\" \"Auto-update apps over any network,\" and \"Auto-update apps over Wi-Fi only.\" Select the option that works best for you.\n\n6. If you choose \"Auto-update apps over Wi-Fi only,\" make sure your smartphone is connected to a Wi-Fi network.\n\n7. If you want to disable automatic updates altogether, select \"Do not auto-update apps.\"\n\nAnd that's it!
