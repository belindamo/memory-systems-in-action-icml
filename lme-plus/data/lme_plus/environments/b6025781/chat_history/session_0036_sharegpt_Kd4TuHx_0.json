      "content": "Sure! Here are three steps to help you ask better questions:\n\n1. Clearly define the topic or problem you want to know more about. Having a clear understanding of what you are trying to learn will help you frame your question in a way that is more specific and focused.\n2. Make sure your question is open-ended and not too broad. A good question should not have a simple or obvious answer, and should require some thought or investigation to answer.\n3. Avoid asking leading questions or ones that contain assumptions. A leading question is one that is phrased in a way that suggests a particular answer, and an assumption is a statement that takes something for granted without providing evidence. Asking neutral, unbiased questions will help you get the most accurate and informative answers."
