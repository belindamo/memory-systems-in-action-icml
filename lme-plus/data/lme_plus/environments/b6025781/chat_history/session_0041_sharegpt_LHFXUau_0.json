      "content": "I will now give you the summaries of many abstracts. You can then separate all the abstracts into different groups with each group is based on related or similar findings. Then please rewrite this text for me by giving me many paragraphs, with each paragraph is for one group and give me a heading of this group, that paragraph is made up of similar abstracts and sorted according to time in ascending order.\nLi et al. (2020) analyzed the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and identified factors that affect pollution emission efficiency in Chinese provinces using data from 2005 to 2016. They found that provinces with low pollution emissions were mainly located in the north of the Yangtze River and that environmental regulation, industrial transfer, proportion of output value of heavy pollution industry, energy consumption structure, and energy using efficiency are important determinants of pollution emission efficiency. Liu et al. (2022) explored spatial variations and graded countermeasures to control blood lead levels (BLLs) of children in China using reported data. They found that urgent prevention and control strategies must be put in place for undeveloped areas to control BLLs of children. Dai et al. (2022) tested the EKC hypothesis for the Weihe River basin using the land footprint as a proxy for environmental degradation and found that ecological measures can influence the shape of the EKC and make the decoupling point occur sooner. Guo et al. (2022) explored the impact of GDP on transport sector's carbon emission and studied the non-linear relationship between them in 30 provinces of China. They found that there is an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between GDP and transport sector's carbon emission. Chen et al. (2022) investigate the different emission scales of carbon emission changes of residential and commercial building operations across 30 provinces in China through the carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) model. The authors find that more than three-quarters of the samples can be fitted by the CKC model, and that most CKCs are the inverted U-shaped, residential and commercial buildings occupying 93% and 90% at the total emission scale, respectively. On the other hand, Yilanci, Cutcu, and Cayir (2022) test the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis by using the fishing grounds footprint (FGF) as the environmental degradation indicator in China from 1961 to 2017. The authors find evidence for the validity of the EKC in the long-run and recommend implementing a common fishing policy at the regional and global levels to stabilize the FGF and using new technologies that are harmless to the environment at every stage of fishery production processes. Meanwhile, He et al. (2021) investigate the heterogeneity of EKC among different pollutants and different regions in China. The authors find that different curve shapes and turning points are associated with EKC heterogeneity, and three regulations are considered effective to strike a balance between urban emission reduction and long-term economic growth. Lastly, Wang et al. (2021) construct a differentiated energy Kuznets curve (EKC) and a Cobb-Douglas production function based on provincial time series data to analyse the evolution of the influential mechanism on mainland China's economic development. The authors find that there are significant differences in various provinces' EKCs, and the starting points, inflection points and evolution trajectories of these EKCs are different among mainland China's provinces. Xu et al. (2020) investigated whether the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) exists on China\u2019s noise pollution problem. The study examined the relationship between noise pollution and economic development based on the noise monitoring data from 111 cities in China from 1991 to 2017. The authors found that the relationship between noise pollution and economic development in China is inverted N-shaped at the national scale, with regional variations across the country, and the development of the tertiary industry will increase noise pollution. Lu et al. (2021) adopted the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis to investigate statistical relationships between the carbon intensity of human well-being and economic development in eight economic zones of China during 1997\u20132015. The results provide new evidence that seven of eight Chinese economic zones began advances to sustainability between 2012 and 2015. Chen et al. (2020) accurately measured CO2 emissions at the city scale in China using corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data, and examined the environmental Kuznets curve. The results show that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists and emissions vary across regions. Finally, He and Lin (2019) employed panel smooth transition auto regression (PSTR) model to investigate the regional differential characteristics of EKC hypothesis in China. The authors found that China's pollution emissions and energy intensities show a stepwise decreasing pattern from the western region to the eastern region, and the impact of income levels on pollution emissions is non-linear, with an inverted U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve for energy intensity. Liu, Qu, and Zhao (2019) investigate whether China's development aligns with the Environmental Kuznets Curve and Pollution Haven hypotheses. They found a reverse U-shape relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions, and an inverted N-shaped relationship between foreign direct investment and carbon dioxide emissions. Ahmad, Jabeen, and Wu (2021) examined the heterogeneous influence of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and income on CO2 emissions across the development levels of Chinese provinces and found that FDI inflows and income promoted environmental sustainability, with FDI inflows imparting Pollution Halo influence in fifteen provinces at various development levels, and PHV influence in seven provinces at different development levels. Yin, Zheng, and Chen (2015) developed a panel data model to analyze the institutional and technical factors that affect the path of low-carbon economic development, and the results indicated that there was a CO2 emission Kuznets curve seen in China, with environmental regulation having a significant moderating effect on the curve. Shahbaz, Shafiullah, Khalid, and Song (2020) analyzed the energy consumption\u2013economic growth nexus in Chinese provinces and found a nonlinear unit root problem in energy consumption and economic growth, and nonlinear cointegration between the variables, with the Granger causality analysis revealing the presence of a mixed causal relationship between economic growth and energy consumption. Zhou, Wang, and Wang (2019) conducted a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of various mechanisms in different urbanization subsystems on carbon dioxide emissions in the Yangtze River Delta. The study found that economic urbanization had a positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions, population urbanization had two opposing effects, spatial urbanization was positively associated with carbon dioxide emissions, and social urbanization demonstrated negative correlations in relation to emissions. Li, Luo, and Wang (2019) evaluated the interdependent relationship between economic development, environmental sustainability, and human well-being in China. Their findings indicated an inverted-N shape relationship between the carbon intensity of human well-being and economic growth, with GDP per capita at the two turning points being 850 yuan and 110,000 yuan, respectively. They suggested that environmental policies are needed to offset unintended environmental harm and that overall planning and cooperative development between adjacent provinces could help handle regional environmental problems."

      "content": "Group 1: Environmental Kuznets Curve in China\nThe Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis has been tested in several studies in China. The EKC hypothesis is based on the notion that environmental degradation increases as the economy grows, but eventually declines when the economic development reaches a certain point. The first study in this group by Yin, Zheng, and Chen (2015) aimed to analyze the institutional and technical factors that affect the path of low-carbon. Later, Li et al. (2020) analyzed the EKC and identified factors affecting pollution emission efficiency in Chinese provinces using data from 2005 to 2016. They found that environmental regulation, industrial transfer, proportion of output value of heavy pollution industry, energy consumption structure, and energy using efficiency are important determinants of pollution emission efficiency.

They found that different curve shapes and turning points are associated with EKC heterogeneity, and three regulations are considered effective in striking a balance between urban emission reduction and long-term economic growth. Xu et al. (2020) examined whether the EKC exists for China's noise pollution problem, and found that the relationship between noise pollution and economic development in China is inverted N-shaped at the national scale, with regional variations across the country, and the development of the tertiary industry will increase noise pollution. Finally, Wang et al. (2021) constructed a differentiated EKC and a Cobb-Douglas production function based on provincial time series data to analyze the evolution of the influential mechanism on mainland China's economic development. The authors found that there are significant differences in various provinces' EKCs, and the starting points, inflection points, and evolution trajectories of these EKCs are different among mainland China's provinces.\n\nGroup 2: Carbon Emission in Different Sectors in China\nThis group consists of two studies that investigate carbon emissions in different sectors in China. Guo et al. (2022) explored the impact of GDP on the transport sector's carbon emissions and studied the non-linear relationship between them in 30 provinces of China. They found that there is an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between GDP and transport sector's carbon emission. Chen et al. (2022) investigated the different emission scales of carbon emission changes of residential and commercial building operations across 30 provinces in China through the carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) model. The authors find that more than three-quarters of the samples can be fitted by the CKC model, and that most CKCs are the inverted U-shaped, residential and commercial buildings occupying 93% and 90% at the total emission scale, respectively.\n\nGroup 3: Blood Lead Levels in Children in China\nThis group includes only one study by Liu et al. (2022) that explored spatial variations and graded countermeasures to control blood lead levels (BLLs) of children in China using reported data. They found that urgent prevention and control strategies must be put in place for undeveloped areas to control BLLs of children.\n\nGroup 4: Fishing Ground Footprint and Environmental Degradation in China\nYilanci, Cutcu, and Cayir (2022) tested the validity of the EKC hypothesis by using the fishing grounds footprint (FGF) as the environmental degradation indicator in China from 1961 to 2017. The authors found evidence for the validity of the EKC in the long-run and recommend implementing a common fishing policy at the regional and global levels to stabilize the FGF and using new technologies that are harmless to the environment at every stage of fishery production processes.\n\nGroup 5: CO2 Emissions in China\nThis group includes three studies"
