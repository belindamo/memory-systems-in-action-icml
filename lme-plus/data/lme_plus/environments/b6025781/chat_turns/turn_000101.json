  "content": "\"Sharp Objects\" is a great thriller, but it's excellent that you're looking to switch to something more educational and informative.\n\nI'm happy to recommend some historical fiction novels set during World War I that might interest you. Here are a few that might be similar to \"The Alice Network\" in terms of their focus on the human experience during wartime:\n\n1. **\"The Soldier's Wife\" by Pam Jenoff**: This novel tells the story of a young German woman living in France during World War I and her struggles to survive and resist the occupation.\n2. **\"Those Who Save Us\" by Jenna Blum**: This novel explores the complex relationship between a mother and daughter in Nazi-occupied Germany during World War II, but it also delves into the events leading up to the war, including the Treaty of Versailles and the rise of fascism.\n3. **\"The War Bride\" by Pam Jenoff**: Another novel by Jenoff, this one follows a young American woman who travels to Europe to marry a British officer during World War I, only to find herself caught up in the war effort and the intrigue of the British aristocracy.\n4. **\"The Winter Guest\" by Pam Jenoff**: Yes, another Jenoff novel! This one is set in Poland during World War I and follows a young woman who becomes embroiled in the Polish resistance movement.\n5. **\"The Poppy War\" by R.F. Kuang**: This novel is set in a fantasy world inspired by Chinese history and mythology, but it's heavily influenced by the events of World War I. It follows a young orphan who enrolls in a prestigious military academy and becomes embroiled in a war between rival nations.\n\nThese novels all share some similarities with \"The Alice Network\" in terms of their focus on the human experience during wartime, the role of women in the war effort, and the moral complexities of living in a time of conflict.\n\nI hope you find something that interests you!",
