  "content": "The high temperature could definitely be a contributing factor to the yellowing leaves. Tomatoes can be sensitive to extreme temperatures, and high heat can cause stress to the plant.\n\nWhen temperatures rise above 85\u00b0F (29\u00b0C), tomato plants can experience heat stress, which can lead to yellowing leaves. Here are a few ways high temperatures can affect your tomatoes:\n\n1. **Water loss**: High temperatures can cause the plant to lose water quickly, leading to dehydration. This can cause the leaves to turn yellow and wilt.\n2. **Root damage**: High temperatures can damage the roots, making it harder for the plant to absorb water and nutrients. This can cause the leaves to turn yellow and drop off.\n3. **Chlorophyll breakdown**: High temperatures can break down chlorophyll, the green pigment that helps plants absorb sunlight. This can cause the leaves to turn yellow or pale.\n4. **Hormonal imbalance**: High temperatures can disrupt the balance of hormones in the plant, leading to yellowing leaves and other growth abnormalities.\n\nTo help your tomato plants cope with the heat, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Provide shade**: If possible, provide some shade for your tomato plants during the hottest part of the day (usually between 11 am and 3 pm). You can use a shade cloth or a umbrella to filter the direct sunlight.\n2. **Increase watering**: Make sure to water your tomato plants regularly, but avoid overwatering. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Water when the soil feels dry to the touch.\n3. **Mulch around the plants**: Mulching can help retain moisture in the soil and reduce soil temperature. Use a thin layer of organic mulch like straw, grass clippings, or wood chips around the base of the plants.\n4. **Monitor for pests**: High temperatures can attract pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Keep an eye out for these pests and take action if you notice any infestations.\n\nBy taking these precautions, you can help your tomato plants stay healthy and reduce the risk of heat-related stress.\n\nKeep me updated on how your plants are doing, and if you have any further questions or concerns!",
