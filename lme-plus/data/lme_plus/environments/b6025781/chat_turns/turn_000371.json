  "content": "To display and graph the RPM, horsepower, and torque data from the Arduino on a computer, you'll need to write a program that communicates with the Arduino and processes the data it receives. There are many programming languages and libraries that you could use for this, but one popular option is to write a program in Python and use the `pyserial` library to communicate with the Arduino. Here's an example of how you could write such a program in Python:\n```scss\nimport serial\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nser = serial.Serial(\"COM3\", 9600)\n\ndef parse_data(data_string):\n    data = data_string.split(\",\")\n    voltage = float(data[0].split(\":\")[1])\n    current = float(data[1].split(\":\")[1])\n    power = float(data[2].split(\":\")[1])\n    rpm = float(data[3].split(\":\")[1])\n    torque = float(data[4].split(\":\")[1])\n    horsepower = float(data[5].split(\"\\n\")[0])\n    return voltage, current, power, rpm, torque, horsepower\n\ndef main():\n    voltage_data = []\n    current_data = []\n    power_data = []\n    rpm_data = []\n    torque_data = []\n    horsepower_data = []\n    while True:\n        line = ser.readline().decode(\"utf-8\")\n        voltage, current, power, rpm, torque, horsepower = parse_data(line)\n        voltage_data.append(voltage)\n        current_data.append(current)\n        power_data.append(power)\n        rpm_data.append(rpm)\n        torque_data.append(torque)\n        horsepower_data.append(horsepower)\n        if len(voltage_data) >= 100:\n            break\n    plt.plot(rpm_data, horsepower_data, label=\"Horsepower\")\n    plt.plot(rpm_data, torque_data, label=\"Torque\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"RPM\")\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.show()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nIn this code, the `parse_data` function takes a string of data from the Arduino and parses it into separate variables for the voltage, current, power, RPM, torque, and horsepower. The `main` function uses the `pyserial` library to open a serial connection to the Arduino and repeatedly reads a line of data from it. The parsed data is appended to lists of data, and when 100 readings have been collected, the code uses the `matplotlib` library to plot the horsepower and torque data against the RPM data.\n\nNote that you'll need to install the `pyserial` and `matplotlib` libraries if you don't already have them installed. You may also need to change the serial port in the code (currently set to \"COM3\") to match the port that the Arduino is connected to on your computer.",
