  "content": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It's possible that there is a technical issue preventing the images from being displayed. However, I can provide you with a written description of the graphs to help you better understand the concepts.\n\nFor the SRAS shift example, an increase in energy prices will raise the cost of production for firms and result in a leftward shift of the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. This shift will lead to a new equilibrium point at a higher price level and a lower level of output. The new equilibrium represents cost-push inflation.\n\nFor the AD shift example, demand-pull inflation occurs when there is an increase in aggregate demand that outstrips the economy's ability to produce goods and services. This shift will lead to a new equilibrium point at a higher price level and a higher level of output. The new equilibrium represents demand-pull inflation.\n\nI hope this written explanation helps clarify the concepts for you.",
