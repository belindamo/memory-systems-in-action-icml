  "content": "I love your idea of grouping the movies by universe and style! Having a block of MCU movies, followed by DC movies, and then indie superhero movies is a great way to showcase the diversity of the superhero genre. It'll be interesting to compare and contrast the different approaches to storytelling, tone, and character development.\n\nIncluding animated superhero movies like **The Incredibles** is an excellent choice. It's a beloved film that appeals to both kids and adults, and its themes of family, identity, and heroism are timeless.\n\nRegarding TV shows, it's up to you and your friends' preferences. If you have a specific show in mind that fits the theme, like ** Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.** or **Arrow**, you could include a few episodes or a season to break up the movie marathon. However, if you want to focus solely on movies, that's perfectly fine too.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear about the new streaming platform you discovered! Classic movies and TV shows are a treasure trove of cinematic history, and it's wonderful that you're exploring them. **Casablanca** and **Rear Window** are indeed timeless classics that continue to influence filmmakers and audiences alike. **I Love Lucy** and **The Twilight Zone** are also iconic shows that have stood the test of time.\n\nIf you're interested, you could also explore other classic superhero shows like **Batman** (1966) or **The Adventures of Superman** (1952) to add some nostalgic charm to your marathon.\n\nRemember to pace yourselves, take breaks, and have fun! A movie marathon is all about enjoying the experience with friends, so don't hesitate to adjust the schedule or take time to discuss the movies and shows you're watching.",
