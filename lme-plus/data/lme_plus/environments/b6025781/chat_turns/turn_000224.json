As the water evaporates, it creates a humid environment that keeps the meat moist and promotes even cooking.\n\n**Flavor enhancement:** The liquid in the water pan can also add flavor to your brisket through a process called \"steam infusion.\" As the liquid evaporates, it rises as steam and infuses the meat with its flavors and aromas.\n\n**Liquid options:** You can use various liquids in the water pan to add flavor to your brisket. Here are some popular options:\n\n1. **Water:** Plain water is a great option, especially if you're looking for a neutral flavor profile. It's also a good choice if you're using a strong wood like mesquite or hickory.\n2. **Beer:** Beer adds a rich, malty flavor to the brisket. Choose a dark beer like a stout or porter for a deeper flavor.\n3. **Stock or broth:** Using a beef or chicken stock can add a savory, meaty flavor to the brisket. You can also use a combination of stock and wine for added depth.\n4. **Wine:** Red wine, especially Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot, can add a fruity, slightly sweet flavor to the brisket.\n5. **Fruit juice:** Apple or pineapple juice can add a sweet, fruity flavor to the brisket. This is a great option if you're looking for a sweeter BBQ flavor.\n6. **BBQ sauce:** You can use a watered-down BBQ sauce in the water pan to add a sweet, tangy flavor to the brisket.\n\n**Tips and considerations:**\n\n* Use a large enough water pan to hold at least 2-3 quarts of liquid. This will ensure that the liquid doesn't evaporate too quickly.\n* Avoid using too much liquid, as this can create a steamy environment that can lead to a mushy or overcooked brisket.\n* You can also add aromatics like onions, garlic, or herbs to the water pan for added flavor.\n* If you're using a strong wood, you may want to use a neutral liquid like water or stock to avoid overpowering the meat.\n\nIn summary, a water pan is an essential component of a smoker, and the liquid you choose can significantly impact the flavor and texture of your brisket. Experiment with different liquids to find the combination that works best for you!",
