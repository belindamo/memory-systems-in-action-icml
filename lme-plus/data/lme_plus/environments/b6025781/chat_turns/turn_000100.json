  "content": "I'll definitely check out those audiobook recommendations. I've been listening to \"Sharp Objects\" by Gillian Flynn during my runs, and it's been really engaging. But I think it's time to switch to something more educational and informative, especially since I'm interested in learning more about World War I.\n\nSpeaking of which, I was wondering if you could recommend any historical fiction novels set during World War I that might be similar to \"The Alice Network\"? I'd love to read more about this time period and get a better understanding of the events and experiences during that time.",
