Here are some tips to help you integrate your canopy and tablecloths with your mini pumpkin pyramid:\n\n**Canopy:**\n\n1. **Use a autumnal-colored canopy**: If you have a canopy with a seasonal color like orange, yellow, or red, it will immediately evoke the feeling of fall. If not, you can use a neutral-colored canopy and add autumnal decorations to it.\n2. **Add a fall-themed topper**: Create a DIY topper using artificial leaves, twigs, and small pumpkins to add a festive touch to your canopy.\n3. **Hang fall-themed decorations**: Suspend fall-themed decorations like paper lanterns, garlands, or artificial flowers from the canopy to create a cohesive look.\n\n**Tablecloths:**\n\n1. **Choose a complementary color**: Select a tablecloth color that complements your pumpkin pyramid and canopy. Earthy tones like brown, beige, or olive green work well with autumnal colors.\n2. **Add a fall-themed table runner**: Use a table runner with a fall theme, like a burlap or lace runner with autumnal designs, to add texture and visual interest to your display.\n3. **Use a tablecloth with a seasonal pattern**: If you have a tablecloth with a seasonal pattern like pumpkins, leaves, or acorns, it will help tie in with your mini pumpkin pyramid and autumnal theme.\n\n**Integrating the mini pumpkin pyramid:**\n\n1. **Place the pyramid at an angle**: Position the mini pumpkin pyramid at an angle on your table to create a visually appealing display. This will also help draw customers' attention to your candle.\n2. **Surround the pyramid with fall-themed items**: Arrange fall-themed items like artificial leaves, acorns, or small pumpkins around the pyramid to create a cohesive look.\n3. **Use the pyramid as a centerpiece**: Make the mini pumpkin pyramid the centerpiece of your display, and arrange your candle, tablecloths, and other fall-themed items around it.\n\nBy incorporating your canopy and tablecloths into your display, you'll create a cohesive and professional look that showcases your products and ties in with the Harvest Market theme.",
