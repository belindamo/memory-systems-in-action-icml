They might have access to the information you're looking for, and they might be willing to share it with you.\n\nBefore you reach out, make sure you have a clear and concise message prepared. You might say something like:\n\n\"Hi, I attended The Killers' concert at Golden Gate Park on June 15th and I'm trying to find out who the opening act was. I really enjoyed their music and I'm interested in learning more about them. Could you please let me know the name of the opening act or provide any information you have about them? I'd really appreciate it!\"\n\nYou can try searching for The Killers' management team or publicist's contact information online. You might find it on their official website, social media profiles, or through a music industry directory.\n\nKeep in mind that they might not respond to your inquiry, or they might not have the information you're looking for. But it's worth a try!\n\nAdditionally, you could also try reaching out to the Golden Gate Park event staff or the concert promoter's office to see if they have any information about the opening act. They might have a list of the performers from the event or be able to provide you with contact information for the opening act.\n\nRemember to be polite, friendly, and respectful in your messages, and good luck!",
