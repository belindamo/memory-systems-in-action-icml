  "content": "West Elm's throw pillow collection is definitely worth exploring.\n\n**Color Considerations:**\n\nWhen choosing a throw pillow design, it's a good idea to consider the color palette of your entire space, including your walls, coffee table, and couch. Here's a balanced approach to consider:\n\n1. **Start with the coffee table and couch**: Since you want to tie in with your coffee table's aesthetic, start by considering its color and material. Think about how the throw pillow design will complement or contrast with these elements.\n2. **Consider the wall color**: While you don't want to match the throw pillow exactly to the wall color, you should consider how the pillow will interact with the surrounding environment. If your walls are a bold or bright color, you may want to choose a throw pillow that provides a nice contrast. If your walls are neutral, you can opt for a bolder or more colorful pillow.\n3. **Think about the overall color scheme**: Consider the dominant colors in your living room, including any rugs, curtains, or other decorative elements. You want the throw pillow to fit in with the overall aesthetic, rather than clashing with it.\n\n**Tips for Choosing a Throw Pillow Color:**\n\n* If your walls are light, you can opt for a darker or bolder throw pillow color to create contrast.\n* If your walls are dark, a lighter or more neutral throw pillow color can help balance the space.\n* If you have a bold or colorful coffee table, you may want to choose a more neutral throw pillow color to avoid overwhelming the space.\n* Consider the 60-30-10 rule: 60% of the room's color comes from the dominant color, 30% from the secondary color, and 10% from the accent color. You can use this rule to balance the colors in your space.\n\nBy considering the color palette of your entire space, you can choose a throw pillow design that ties in nicely with your coffee table, couch, and walls. Happy shopping!",
