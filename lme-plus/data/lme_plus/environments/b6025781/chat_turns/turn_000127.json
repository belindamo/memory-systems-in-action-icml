  "content": "going back to your initial answer: \"False. An exogenous increase in energy prices can lead to a cost-push inflation rather than a demand-pull inflation. A cost-push inflation occurs when firms experience an increase in their cost of production, leading to an upward shift of the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. The increase in energy prices would increase the cost of production for firms, which would lead to a leftward shift of the SRAS curve, causing a rise in prices and a decrease in output in the short run.\n\nThe NK Phillips curve represents the relationship between inflation and the degree of economic slack in the economy. While an increase in energy prices could lead to an increase in inflation, it does not necessarily shift the NK Phillips curve upward, as that would require an increase in aggregate demand. Thus, an exogenous increase in energy prices is more likely to lead to a cost-push inflation than a demand-pull inflation.\"\n\nWhat is the SRAS curve? Is it in the NK Fhillips curve?",
