Here are some tips to help you achieve perfectly cooked chicken breast for your fajitas:\n\n1. **Marinate, marinate, marinate**: Marinating the chicken breast in a mixture of lime juice, olive oil, garlic, and spices can help tenderize the meat and add flavor. You can marinate it for at least 30 minutes to an hour, or even overnight for more intense flavor.\n2. **Pound the chicken**: Pounding the chicken breast to an even thickness can help it cook more evenly and prevent it from becoming too thick and tough. You can use a meat mallet or a rolling pin to pound the chicken to about 1/4 inch thickness.\n3. **Don't overcook it**: Cook the chicken breast to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Overcooking can make the chicken dry and tough. Use a meat thermometer to ensure you reach the safe internal temperature.\n4. **Use high heat**: Cooking the chicken at high heat can help sear the outside quickly, locking in the juices and tenderizing the meat. Use a hot skillet or grill to cook the chicken breast.\n5. **Don't overcrowd**: Cook the chicken breast in batches if necessary, to ensure each piece has enough room to cook evenly. Overcrowding can lead to steam building up and making the chicken tough.\n6. **Use a tenderizing technique**: Try using a technique like \"velveting\" to tenderize the chicken breast. This involves coating the chicken in a mixture of cornstarch, egg whites, and spices before cooking to help break down the proteins and make the meat more tender.\n7. **Add a little acidity**: Adding a splash of citrus juice, such as lime or lemon, to the pan while cooking the chicken can help break down the proteins and make the meat more tender.\n8. **Let it rest**: Once the chicken is cooked, let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken even more tender and juicy.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve tender and juicy chicken breast for your fajitas. Remember to slice the chicken thinly and cook it quickly over high heat to get that nice sear and caramelization. Buen provecho!",
