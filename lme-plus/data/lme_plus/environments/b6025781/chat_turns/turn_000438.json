  "content": "That sounds like a great plan! I think grouping the movies by theme or tone is a great idea. I was thinking of having a block of MCU movies, followed by a block of DC movies, and then a block of indie superhero movies. That way, we can compare and contrast the different universes and styles.\n\nI also like the idea of including some animated superhero movies. **The Incredibles** is one of my favorite movies, and I think it would be a great addition to the marathon. Do you think we should include any TV shows in the marathon, or stick to just movies?\n\nAnd, by the way, have you heard about the new streaming platform I recently discovered? It has a huge collection of classic movies and TV shows, including some old episodes of **I Love Lucy** and **The Twilight Zone**. I've been watching some classic movies like **Casablanca** and **Rear Window**, and it's amazing how well they still hold up today.",
