  "content": "I completely understand! You're a great example of someone who appreciates the flexibility of different formats for different situations.\n\nAudiobooks are perfect for multitasking, like during your morning jogs or while doing chores. It's amazing how much you can accomplish while still enjoying a good story. And, of course, it's great exercise for your mind and body!\n\nOn the other hand, physical books have a certain tactile appeal that many readers love. There's something special about holding a physical book, feeling the weight of the pages, and turning them to reveal the next part of the story. It's a very intimate and immersive experience.\n\nIt's great that you've found a balance that works for you, and you're able to enjoy your favorite stories in different ways depending on your situation. Do you find that you retain information or remember details differently between audiobooks and physical books, or is that not something you've noticed?",
