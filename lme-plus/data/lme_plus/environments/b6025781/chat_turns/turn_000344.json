  "content": "I'm happy to help you try to figure out who the opening act might have been. Unfortunately, without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact band. However, I can give you some recommendations for local indie bands from San Francisco that you might enjoy:\n\n1. Cold War Kids - Although they're not strictly a San Francisco band, they've been known to play in the Bay Area and have a similar indie rock sound to The Killers.\n2. The Dodos - A San Francisco-based indie rock duo known for their catchy hooks and folk-infused sound.\n3. Geographer - A San Francisco-based indie rock band that blends synth-heavy soundscapes with catchy hooks and introspective lyrics.\n4. The Fresh & Onlys - A San Francisco-based indie rock band with a jangly, guitar-driven sound and catchy hooks.\n5. Melted Toys - A San Francisco-based indie rock band with a dreamy, psychedelic sound and catchy melodies.\n6. Thee Oh Sees - A San Francisco-based garage rock band with a high-energy sound and catchy hooks.\n7. WATERS - A San Francisco-based indie rock band with a synth-heavy sound and catchy hooks.\n8. The Bilinda Butchers - A San Francisco-based indie rock band with a dreamy, shoegaze-inspired sound and catchy melodies.\n\nIf none of these bands sound familiar, you might try checking out local music blogs or websites that cover the San Francisco music scene, such as The Bay Bridged, SF Weekly, or SF Gate. They might have reviews or articles about local indie bands that played at Golden Gate Park around the time of your concert.\n\nAdditionally, you could try searching online for \"opening acts for The Killers at Golden Gate Park on June 15th\" or something similar to see if anyone has posted about the concert or mentioned the opening act.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm happy to try to help you further if you have any more information or details!",
