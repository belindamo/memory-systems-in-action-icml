  "content": "That's a great idea! A mixed superhero movie marathon with MCU, DC, and indie superhero movies can offer a unique and exciting experience. It's a great way to showcase the diversity of the superhero genre and introduce your friends to some hidden gems.\n\nIndie superhero movies can bring a fresh perspective to the genre, often with lower budgets and more creative freedom. Here are some more indie superhero movie recommendations:\n\n1. **Super (2010)**: A dark comedy-drama starring Rainn Wilson as a mentally unstable man who becomes a superhero to save his wife from a drug dealer.\n2. **Kick-Ass (2010)**: A British-American superhero black comedy that follows a teenager who decides to become a real-life superhero, despite having no powers.\n3. **Defendor (2009)**: A Canadian superhero comedy-drama starring Woody Harrelson as a man who becomes a vigilante to avenge his mother's death.\n4. **The FP (2011)**: A sci-fi action comedy that takes place in a dystopian future where gangs fight with dance battles.\n5. **Superhero Movie (2008)**: A parody film that spoofs popular superhero movies, starring Drake Bell as a teenager who gains superpowers after being bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly.\n6. **Zoom: Academy for Superheroes (2006)**: A family-friendly superhero comedy about a former superhero who must train a new generation of heroes.\n\nThese movies offer a mix of action, comedy, and drama, and can add some variety to your marathon. You can also consider including some animated superhero movies, like **The Incredibles** (2004) or **Big Hero 6** (2014), to round out your lineup.\n\nWhen planning your marathon, you might want to consider grouping the movies by theme, tone, or era to create a cohesive experience. For example, you could have a block of light-hearted, comedic superhero movies, followed by a block of darker, more serious ones.\n\nRemember to have fun and be flexible! You can always adjust the schedule or take breaks as needed to keep everyone engaged and entertained.",
