It's indeed a must-visit attraction in Seoul, and it's great that you're planning your itinerary carefully to make the most of your short layover.\n\nHowever, I want to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have any information about your trip to Tokyo or the deposit you paid. I'm here to provide general information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge based on my training data. I don't have access to personal information or specific details about your trip.\n\nThat being said, I'm happy to help you plan your layover in Seoul and provide recommendations for your trip. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
