Double-frying is a game-changer for achieving that perfect crispiness.\n\nAs for your Grubhub order, I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed the sweet potato fries from the gastropub near your office! It's always great to find inspiration from restaurant dishes and try to recreate them at home.\n\nSince you mentioned the sweet potato fries were amazing, you might want to pay attention to the seasonings and toppings they used. Did they have any unique flavors or toppings that stood out to you? Maybe there's a particular seasoning blend or technique they used that you can try to replicate at home.\n\nRemember, the key to replicating restaurant-quality dishes is to pay attention to the details, from the ingredients to the cooking techniques. Don't be afraid to experiment and adjust seasonings to your taste. And if you're feeling adventurous, you could even try reaching out to the gastropub to ask about their recipe or cooking methods!\n\nGood luck with your sweet potato fry-making endeavors, and I hope you're able to recreate that deliciousness at home!",
