  "content": "I found this: \"Essentially, the SRAS assumes that the level of capital is fixed. (i.e. in the short run you can\u2019t build a new factory)\nHowever, in the short run you can increase the utilisation of existing factors of production, e.g. workers doing overtime.\nIn the short run, an increase in the price of goods encourages firms to take on more workers, pay slightly higher wages and produce more.\nThus the SRAS suggests an increase in prices leads to a temporary increase in output as firms employ more workers.\nThe short run aggregate supply is affected by costs of production. If there is an increase in raw material prices (e.g. higher oil prices), the SRAS will shift to the left. If there is an increase in wages, the SRAS will also shift to the left.\"\n\nDoes this not contradict your explanation?",
