Since you've already watched some Marvel classics, I'll suggest a mix of other Marvel movies, DC movies, and some indie superhero films. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n**Marvel Movies:**\n\n1. **Big Hero 6 (2014)**: An animated superhero film set in a fictional city in Japan, with a lovable robot named Baymax as the hero.\n2. **Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)**: A fun, lighthearted sequel to Ant-Man, with Evangeline Lilly's Wasp taking center stage.\n3. **The New Mutants (2020)**: A horror-tinged superhero film based on the X-Men comics, with a unique twist on the traditional superhero origin story.\n\n**DC Movies:**\n\n1. **Shazam! (2019)**: A heartwarming, humorous take on the Captain Marvel (not the Marvel one) origin story, with a focus on family and friendship.\n2. **Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) (2020)**: A female-led, action-packed adventure featuring Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn.\n3. **Wonder Woman (2017)**: If you haven't seen it before, this iconic film is a must-watch, with Gal Gadot shining as the Amazonian warrior princess.\n\n**Indie Superhero Movies:**\n\n1. **The Specials (2000)**: A quirky, low-budget comedy about a team of superheroes trying to make it big.\n2. **Mystery Men (1999)**: A cult classic about a group of wannabe superheroes trying to fill the void left by a retired hero.\n3. **Hancock (2008)**: A unique, darker take on the superhero genre, starring Will Smith as a flawed, drunken hero.\n\nThese movies offer a mix of action, humor, and heart, and are a great way to explore the superhero genre beyond the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Enjoy your movie night!",
