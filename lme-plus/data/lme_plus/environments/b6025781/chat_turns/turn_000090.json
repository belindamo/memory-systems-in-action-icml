I've been really into historical fiction lately, and I'm currently reading \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah - I started it three weeks ago and I'm on page 270 out of 440. It's been a great read so far, and I'm loving the emotional depth of the story. Do you have any other historical fiction books you'd recommend?",
