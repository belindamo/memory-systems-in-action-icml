  "content": "The Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens is a fantastic piece of glass, and you'll be happy to know that it's compatible with the Nikon Z6, but with some limitations.\n\nThe Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens is a DSLR lens, designed for Nikon F-mount cameras like your D850. The Nikon Z6, being a mirrorless camera, has a different mount called the Z-mount. To use your Sigma lens on the Z6, you'll need an adapter.\n\nNikon offers an official adapter, the FTZ Adapter, which allows you to mount F-mount lenses on Z-mount cameras. This adapter is compatible with a wide range of F-mount lenses, including the Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens.\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind when using the FTZ Adapter with your Sigma lens on the Z6:\n\n1. **Autofocus:** Autofocus performance might be slightly slower and less accurate compared to using a native Z-mount lens. However, the FTZ Adapter does support phase-detection autofocus, which is still quite reliable.\n2. **Image Stabilization:** The Sigma lens has Optical Stabilization (OS), which will work on the Z6 when using the FTZ Adapter. However, the camera's in-body image stabilization (IBIS) will not be available when using the adapter.\n3. **Aperture Control:** The FTZ Adapter allows for electronic aperture control, so you can adjust the aperture from the camera body.\n4. **Lens Corrections:** The Z6 can apply lens corrections for distortion, chromatic aberration, and vignette correction, but these might not be as accurate as they would be with a native Z-mount lens.\n\nIn terms of compatibility, Sigma has confirmed that their Art-series lenses, including the 24-70mm f/2.8, are compatible with the Nikon FTZ Adapter. However, it's always a good idea to check for any firmware updates for both the lens and the adapter to ensure optimal performance.\n\nIn summary, you can use your Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens on the Nikon Z6 with the FTZ Adapter, but be prepared for some minor limitations. The adapter will allow you to take advantage of the Z6's features, and you'll still be able to capture fantastic images with your lens.",
