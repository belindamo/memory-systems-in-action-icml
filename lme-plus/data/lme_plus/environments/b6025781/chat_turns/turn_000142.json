Here are some tips on how to incorporate them into your display without overwhelming it:\n\n**Artificial Leaves:**\n\n1. **Use them sparingly**: Scatter a few artificial leaves around your display to add a pop of color and create a seasonal feel. Avoid overdoing it, as too many leaves can make your display look cluttered.\n2. **Choose the right color**: Select leaves in autumnal colors like orange, yellow, red, or burgundy to tie in with the seasonal theme.\n3. **Add them to your canopy**: Use artificial leaves to create a garland or swag for your canopy, adding a festive touch to your display.\n\n**Small Pumpkins:**\n\n1. **Use them as accents**: Place small pumpkins around your display to add a seasonal touch. You can arrange them in a small pyramid or scatter them around your candle display.\n2. **Choose the right size**: Select small pumpkins that fit your display and don't overwhelm it. You want them to be noticeable but not dominant.\n3. **Add some greenery**: Surround your small pumpkins with some greenery like artificial leaves or ferns to create a cohesive look.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Balance is key**: Make sure your decorations are balanced and don't overpower your candle display.

If you have a modern brand, you may want to opt for more minimalist decorations, while a rustic brand might benefit from more traditional fall decorations.\n5. **Don't forget about texture**: Mix different textures like glass, ceramic, and fabric to add depth and visual interest to your display.\n\nBy incorporating fall-themed decorations in a thoughtful and balanced way, you'll create a beautiful and inviting display that showcases your products and ties in with the seasonal theme.",
