  "content": "That's a great idea! Asking about their process for selecting opening acts could give you some valuable insight into how they choose their openers, and it might even give you a lead on who the opener might have been.\n\nYou could ask something like:\n\n\"I'm also curious about how you guys select your opening acts for tours. Do you have a specific process for finding new talent, or do you typically work with established acts? Are there any particular qualities or characteristics you look for in an opening act?\"\n\nBy asking about their process, you might get some insight into what kind of acts they tend to choose, which could help you narrow down your search. For example, they might say something like:\n\n\"We typically look for local acts that have a similar sound or style to ours, and we try to choose acts that will appeal to our fanbase.\"\n\nOr:\n\n\"We like to mix it up and choose openers from different genres or styles to keep the show interesting.\"\n\nThis kind of information could give you a better idea of what kind of act might have been opening for them, and you could use that to inform your search.\n\nAdditionally, you could also ask if they have any recommendations for up-and-coming bands or artists that they think are worth checking out. They might have some suggestions that could lead you to the act you're looking for, or they might introduce you to some new music that you'll enjoy.\n\nJust remember to keep your questions polite and respectful, and don't be too pushy or demanding. You're just trying to gather information and have a conversation, not interrogate them!",
