I've heard great things about them and I'm curious to see if they have any scents that are similar to my Tom Ford perfume. Do you think I should also consider looking at niche brands or smaller, independent perfume houses? I've heard that they can offer really unique and high-quality fragrances at a lower price point than some of the more established luxury brands.",
