Considering your current projects and planning your workflow is essential to making the most of your time.\n\nRegarding your ceramic bowl, it's generally recommended to wait until after the workshop to glaze it. Here's why:\n\n1. **Focus on the workshop:** You'll want to dedicate your attention to the workshop and absorb as much information as possible. Glazing your bowl might distract you from the learning process, and you might not be able to give it the attention it deserves.\n2. **New techniques and inspiration:** You might learn new techniques or gain inspiration during the workshop that you can apply to your bowl. By waiting, you can incorporate these new skills and ideas into your glazing process.\n3. **Avoid rushing:** Glazing can be a complex process, and rushing it might lead to subpar results. By waiting, you can take your time, and ensure that your glaze job is of high quality.\n4. **Workshop feedback:** If you bring your bowl to the workshop, you might get valuable feedback from the instructor or peers. This can help you refine your design and glazing approach.\n\nThat being said, if you feel that glazing your bowl is a priority, and you have the time to do it justice before the workshop, go for it! Just be sure to set aside dedicated time for the workshop and prioritize your learning experience.\n\nRemember to take notes, ask questions, and enjoy the process during the workshop. You'll likely return to your bowl with fresh eyes and a newfound enthusiasm, which can lead to an even better final result.",
