  "content": "Certainly. Here are a few examples of how Arab countries have balanced engagements with regional partners while focusing on their own national interests:\n\n1. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): The GCC is a regional organization comprising six Arab countries located in the Persian Gulf region. The organization aims to promote economic and security cooperation among its members while respecting each member country's national interests. Member countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have maintained military and economic alliances with the United States, while also engaging in negotiations to resolve regional conflicts, such as the Yemeni civil war.\n\n2. Egypt's relations with Israel: Egypt is one of two Arab countries that have peace treaties with Israel. Despite criticism from some other Arab countries, Egypt has maintained its peace agreement with Israel, which has allowed both countries to benefit economically and strategically. At the same time, Egypt has supported Palestinian rights and has taken a leadership role in pressing Israel to reach a lasting peace agreement with the Palestinian Authority.\n\n3. Qatar's relations with Iran: Qatar has maintained diplomatic ties with Iran, despite being part of a regional alliance of Arab countries opposed to Iran. Qatar's decision to engage with Iran reflects its desire to pursue an independent foreign policy and to promote its national interests. However, this relationship has created tensions with other Arab countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\n4. Morocco's relations with sub-Saharan Africa: Morocco has strengthened its ties with sub-Saharan African countries under the leadership of King Mohammed VI. Morocco sees this as an opportunity to promote trade and investment between the two regions and to expand its political influence beyond the Arab world. This engagement has allowed Morocco to pursue its national interests while also establishing itself as a regional player in Africa.",
