  "content": "The Nikon Z6 is an excellent choice as a backup camera body, and its video capabilities are one of its strong suits. Here's a rundown of its video features and how they compare to the D850:\n\n**Video Resolution and Frame Rates:**\n\n* The Nikon Z6 can record 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) video at 30p, 25p, and 24p, with a maximum bitrate of 100 Mbps.\n* It can also record 1080p at up to 120p for slow-motion footage.\n* The D850, on the other hand, can record 4K UHD at 30p, but only in a cropped mode (DX mode), which reduces the sensor size. In full-frame mode, it's limited to 1080p at 60p.\n\n**Image Stabilization:**\n\n* The Z6 has in-body image stabilization (IBIS), which provides up to 5 stops of stabilization. This is a significant advantage over the D850, which relies on lens-based stabilization.\n* IBIS allows for smoother handheld footage and more effective stabilization when using lenses without VR (vibration reduction).\n\n**Autofocus and Subject Tracking:**\n\n* The Z6 features advanced autofocus with 273 phase-detection points, covering 90% of the frame. This leads to faster and more accurate subject tracking, especially in video mode.\n* The D850, on the other hand, uses a 153-point phase-detection system, which is still excellent but not as advanced as the Z6's system.\n\n**Rolling Shutter and Moir\u00e9:**\n\n* The Z6 has a faster readout speed, which reduces rolling shutter artifacts, making it better suited for capturing fast-moving subjects.\n* The Z6 also has a more effective moir\u00e9 reduction system, which helps minimize the occurrence of moir\u00e9 patterns in video footage.\n\n**Other Video Features:**\n\n* Both cameras offer zebra stripes, focus peaking, and timecode support.\n* The Z6 has a built-in interval timer and can create 4K time-lapses in-camera.\n* The Z6 also has a more advanced audio system, with a built-in stereo microphone and the option to attach an external microphone via the 3.5mm jack.\n\n**Comparison Summary:**\n\n* The Nikon Z6 is a more capable video camera than the D850, with advanced autofocus, better image stabilization, and reduced rolling shutter artifacts.\n* The Z6's 4K video capabilities are more robust, with a higher maximum bitrate and the ability to record 4K in full-frame mode.\n* However, the D850 still excels in still photography, with its high-resolution 45.7MP sensor and excellent low-light performance.\n\nAs a backup camera body, the Z6 is an excellent choice to complement your D850. You can use the Z6 for video-centric shoots or when you need the advantages of mirrorless technology, while still relying on your D850 for high-resolution still photography.",
