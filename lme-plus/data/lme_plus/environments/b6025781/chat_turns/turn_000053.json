Since you're currently living in an apartment provided by Catholic Charities, you may want to start by discussing your options with them.

You can create a profile, search for apartments, and apply for lotteries online.\n2. **NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)**: HPD offers various programs to help individuals find affordable housing, including rental assistance and homeownership programs. You can visit their website to learn more about their programs and eligibility criteria.\n3. **Queens Community House (QCH)**: QCH is a non-profit organization that provides affordable housing options, including rental apartments and homeownership programs. They also offer supportive services, such as case management and job training.\n4. **Local non-profit organizations**: There are several non-profit organizations in Queens that provide affordable housing options, such as the Queens Housing Authority, the Jamaica Housing Authority, and the Flushing Willets Point Corona Local Development Corporation.

You can search online or visit the websites of local housing authorities to learn more about these opportunities.\n\nRemember to always research the landlord, property, and neighborhood before applying or signing a lease.
