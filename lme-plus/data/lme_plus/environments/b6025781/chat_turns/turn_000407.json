  "content": "Group 1: Environmental Kuznets Curve in China\nThe Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis has been tested in several studies in China. The EKC hypothesis is based on the notion that environmental degradation increases as the economy grows, but eventually declines when the economic development reaches a certain point. The first study in this group by Yin, Zheng, and Chen (2015) aimed to analyze the institutional and technical factors that affect the path of low-carbon. Later, Li et al. (2020) analyzed the EKC and identified factors affecting pollution emission efficiency in Chinese provinces using data from 2005 to 2016. They found that environmental regulation, industrial transfer, proportion of output value of heavy pollution industry, energy consumption structure, and energy using efficiency are important determinants of pollution emission efficiency. Meanwhile, He et al. (2021) investigated the heterogeneity of the EKC among different pollutants and regions in China. They found that different curve shapes and turning points are associated with EKC heterogeneity, and three regulations are considered effective in striking a balance between urban emission reduction and long-term economic growth. Xu et al. (2020) examined whether the EKC exists for China's noise pollution problem, and found that the relationship between noise pollution and economic development in China is inverted N-shaped at the national scale, with regional variations across the country, and the development of the tertiary industry will increase noise pollution. Finally, Wang et al. (2021) constructed a differentiated EKC and a Cobb-Douglas production function based on provincial time series data to analyze the evolution of the influential mechanism on mainland China's economic development. The authors found that there are significant differences in various provinces' EKCs, and the starting points, inflection points, and evolution trajectories of these EKCs are different among mainland China's provinces.\n\nGroup 2: Carbon Emission in Different Sectors in China\nThis group consists of two studies that investigate carbon emissions in different sectors in China. Guo et al. (2022) explored the impact of GDP on the transport sector's carbon emissions and studied the non-linear relationship between them in 30 provinces of China. They found that there is an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between GDP and transport sector's carbon emission. Chen et al. (2022) investigated the different emission scales of carbon emission changes of residential and commercial building operations across 30 provinces in China through the carbon Kuznets curve (CKC) model. The authors find that more than three-quarters of the samples can be fitted by the CKC model, and that most CKCs are the inverted U-shaped, residential and commercial buildings occupying 93% and 90% at the total emission scale, respectively.\n\nGroup 3: Blood Lead Levels in Children in China\nThis group includes only one study by Liu et al. (2022) that explored spatial variations and graded countermeasures to control blood lead levels (BLLs) of children in China using reported data. They found that urgent prevention and control strategies must be put in place for undeveloped areas to control BLLs of children.\n\nGroup 4: Fishing Ground Footprint and Environmental Degradation in China\nYilanci, Cutcu, and Cayir (2022) tested the validity of the EKC hypothesis by using the fishing grounds footprint (FGF) as the environmental degradation indicator in China from 1961 to 2017. The authors found evidence for the validity of the EKC in the long-run and recommend implementing a common fishing policy at the regional and global levels to stabilize the FGF and using new technologies that are harmless to the environment at every stage of fishery production processes.\n\nGroup 5: CO2 Emissions in China\nThis group includes three studies",
