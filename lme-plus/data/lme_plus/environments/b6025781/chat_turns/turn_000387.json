  "content": "Yes, other Anabaptist groups also prioritize community and rejection of modern technology to varying degrees. For example, the Mennonite tradition emphasizes community and service to others, and many Mennonite churches have close-knit congregations that prioritize helping one another. Additionally, many Mennonites are involved in sustainable agricultural practices that emphasize simplicity and living in harmony with the environment.\n\nSimilarly, some Anabaptist groups like the Hutterites live communally and reject modern technology altogether. The Bruderhof community also prioritizes communal living and simplicity, while still allowing for some modern technology like computers and smartphones.\n\nOverall, while the specifics may vary, Anabaptist groups tend to place a strong emphasis on community, simplicity, and rejecting modern technology in favor of a more agrarian or sustainable way of life.",
