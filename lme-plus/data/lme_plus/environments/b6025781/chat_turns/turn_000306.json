  "content": "Thank you for the information! Based on your description, here are a few potential causes for the yellowing leaves on your tomato plants:\n\n1. **Overwatering**: Since the yellowing leaves are mostly on the lower parts of the plant, it's possible that the soil is too wet. Tomato plants don't like wet feet, and excess moisture can cause the roots to rot, leading to yellowing leaves. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it feels waterlogged, wait a few days before watering again.\n2. **Root bound**: If the seedlings were in small pots before being transplanted, the roots might have become root-bound. This can cause the lower leaves to turn yellow and drop off as the plant focuses its energy on developing new roots. Gently inspect the roots when you transplant the seedlings, and trim any circling or tangled roots to encourage healthy growth.\n3. **Nutrient deficiency**: Tomatoes need a balanced diet of nutrients to stay healthy. A lack of nitrogen, iron, or magnesium can cause yellowing leaves. Consider getting a soil test to determine the nutrient levels in your soil. You can also start fertilizing your tomatoes with a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) once a month.\n4. **Temperature fluctuations**: Tomatoes prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). If your plants are exposed to sudden or extreme temperature changes, it can cause stress, leading to yellowing leaves. Check your plants' location and ensure they're not near heating vents, air conditioning units, or drafty windows.\n5. **Pests or diseases**: Although you mentioned you haven't noticed any pests, it's still possible that tiny pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites are present. Inspect your plants carefully, and check for any signs of disease like powdery mildew, septoria leaf spot, or early blight.\n\nTo address the issue, you can try the following:\n\n* Reduce watering frequency to ensure the soil isn't too wet.\n* Fertilize your tomatoes with a balanced fertilizer to provide essential nutrients.\n* Prune the yellow leaves to prevent the spread of any potential disease and encourage the plant to focus energy on healthy growth.\n* Monitor your plants closely for any signs of pests or diseases, and take action if you notice any issues.\n\nKeep in mind that it's not uncommon for tomato seedlings to drop a few lower leaves as they grow. However, if the yellowing persists or spreads, it's essential to investigate and address the underlying cause.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like more guidance!",
