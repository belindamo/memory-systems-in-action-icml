The staff is attentive and knowledgeable, but the menu can be complex, and some dishes may require explanation.\n\nBoth restaurants offer a unique and authentic traditional Japanese dining experience. Be sure to dress appropriately, as both restaurants have a more formal atmosphere. Enjoy your meals!",
