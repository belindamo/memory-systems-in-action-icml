  "content": "The 20\" x 20\" size will look great on your 3-seater couch, and starting with two pillows is a good way to test the waters.\n\n**Patterns and Designs:**\n\nTo complement your wooden coffee table with metal legs, you may want to consider patterns and designs that incorporate natural elements, industrial touches, or a mix of both. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Nature-inspired patterns**: Consider pillows with botanical prints, leaf patterns, or abstract designs that evoke a natural, organic feel. These can help bring warmth and coziness to your space while tying in with the wooden coffee table.\n2. **Geometric patterns**: Geometric patterns with metal-inspired accents, like copper or bronze, can complement the metal legs of your coffee table. Look for designs that incorporate hexagons, triangles, or chevrons in earthy tones.\n3. **Industrial-chic designs**: If you want to emphasize the industrial aspect of your coffee table, consider pillows with distressed or vintage-inspired designs, like factory-style prints, vintage maps, or distressed wood patterns.\n4. **Neutral backgrounds with pops of color**: A neutral-colored pillow with a subtle pattern or a pop of color can help tie in with the wood and metal tones of your coffee table. Look for designs with a natural background (e.g., beige, gray, or taupe) and a bold, contrasting color.\n\nSome popular patterns and designs that might work well include:\n\n* Woven or cable-knit patterns\n* Natural linen or jute-inspired designs\n* Abstract geometric patterns with earthy tones\n* Botanical prints with metallic accents\n\n**West Elm Inspiration:**\n\nSince you got your coffee table from West Elm, you might want to explore their throw pillow collection for inspiration. They often feature designs that complement their furniture pieces, and you can filter by style, material, and color to find the perfect match.\n\n**Home Office Organization:**\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that your new bookshelf is helping you stay organized and focused! A well-organized workspace can make a huge difference in productivity and overall well-being. Keep up the great work, and enjoy your newly organized space!",
