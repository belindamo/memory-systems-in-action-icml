  "content": "No, the explanation you found is consistent with the concept of the SRAS curve that I described. The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve represents the relationship between the price level and the quantity of output that firms are willing to supply in the short run, given that some input prices, such as wages, are fixed in the short run, while other input prices, such as raw materials, can vary.\n\nIn the short run, if the price level increases, firms may produce more goods and services by increasing their utilization of existing factors of production, such as workers, as you noted. This could cause a temporary increase in output, even though the level of capital is fixed. However, if the cost of production increases, such as from an increase in raw material prices, the SRAS curve would shift to the left, reducing the quantity of output that firms are willing to supply at each price level. Similarly, an increase in wages would increase the cost of production, leading to a leftward shift of the SRAS curve.\n\nSo, the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward-sloping, meaning that an increase in the price level leads to an increase in output in the short run, but it can shift leftward if there are increases in input prices, such as raw materials or wages.",
