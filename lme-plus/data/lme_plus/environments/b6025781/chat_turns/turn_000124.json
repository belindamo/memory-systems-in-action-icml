Here are the explanations with embedded graphs:\n\n**SRAS Shift Example**\nAn exogenous increase in energy prices, such as a sharp increase in the price of oil, would increase the cost of production for firms, leading to a leftward shift of the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve, as shown in the graph below:\n\n![SRAS Shift Example](data:image/png;base64,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)\n\nThe original equilibrium (E0) occurs at the intersection of the aggregate demand (AD) curve and the SRAS curve before the increase in energy prices. After the shift in the SRAS curve, the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the intersection of the AD curve and the new SRAS curve. As a result of the leftward shift of the SRAS curve, the price level increases from P0 to P1, and the output decreases from Y0 to Y1. This illustrates the concept of cost-push inflation, where an increase in production costs leads to higher prices and lower output.\n\n**AD Shift Example**\nIn contrast, a demand-pull inflation occurs when there is an increase in aggregate demand that outstrips the economy's ability to produce goods and services. This would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, leading to an increase in both the price level and the level of output in the economy, as shown in the graph below:\n\n![AD Shift Example](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAbwAA",
