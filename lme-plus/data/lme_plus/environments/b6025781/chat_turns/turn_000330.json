To get a clear picture of where your money is going, I recommend keeping a record of every single transaction you make for a month. You can use a budgeting app like Mint, Personal Capital, or Excel to make it easier. Write down the date, category (e.g., food, entertainment, transportation), and amount spent.\n\nAs for the luxury candle set, it's great that you're questioning whether it was worth the splurge. Ask yourself:\n\n1. Was it a one-time indulgence or a regular expense?\n2. Did it bring you or your friend significant joy or value?\n3. Could you have achieved the same outcome (e.g., a nice gift) for a lower cost?\n\nReflecting on your spending habits and the value you receive from your purchases can help you make more intentional financial decisions in the future.\n\nHere are some general tips to help you stay within your budget:\n\n1. **Set clear financial goals**: Identify what you want to achieve, whether it's saving for a specific purpose, paying off debt, or building an emergency fund.\n2. **Create a budget**: Allocate your income into categories (e.g., necessities, savings, discretionary spending) based on your goals and priorities.\n3. **Prioritize needs over wants**: Be honest about what you need versus what you want. Make sure to cover essential expenses before indulging in discretionary spending.\n4. **Use the 50/30/20 rule**: Allocate 50% of your income towards necessities (housing, food, utilities), 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards saving and debt repayment.\n5. **Avoid impulse purchases**: Take time to think about purchases, especially big-ticket items, to ensure they align with your goals and values.\n6. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your budget and spending habits to identify areas for improvement and make adjustments as needed.\n\nRemember, budgeting is a process, and it might take some time to figure out what works best for you. Be patient, stay consistent, and don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up.\n\nHow do you feel about sharing more details about your income, expenses, and financial goals? This will help me provide more tailored advice and guidance.",
