The purpose of the article is to provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of what PC is, its importance, and how it impacts their projects. The article will begin by defining practical completion and how it represents the stage at which construction works are complete, except for minor defects or omissions, and the building is reasonably capable of being used for its intended purpose. It will also cover how PC is different from final completion and why developers need to be aware of its implications for their projects. The introduction will set the tone for the article and provide readers with a brief overview of what to expect in the following sections."
