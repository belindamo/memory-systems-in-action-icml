      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You can definitely substitute the English muffins with something else to make the Manchester Muffins easier to prepare. Biscuits or crostini would be excellent alternatives! Here's how they'd work:\n\n* **Biscuits**: Using biscuits would add a more buttery and flaky texture to your Manchester Muffins. They might be a bit more fragile than English muffins, so be gentle when assembling the sliders. You could even use store-bought biscuits to save time.\n* **Crostini**: Crostini would add a nice crunch to your sliders. Look for a sturdy bread or baguette slice that can hold the toppings without getting too crumbly. You could also toast the crostini lightly to give them a bit more texture.\n\nBoth options will work beautifully, and your guests will love the flavor combination. Just keep in mind that the cooking time might vary depending on the substitute you choose.\n\nTo make things even simpler, you could also consider using:\n\n* **Mini buns**: These are widely available in most supermarkets and are specifically designed for sliders.\n* **Toasted bread rounds**: Similar to crostini, but you can use a round bread slice instead of a baguette.\n\nUltimately, the key is to choose a base that complements the flavors of your Manchester Muffins and holds the toppings well. Your guests will appreciate the effort you put into creating a delicious and easy-to-eat snack for the viewing party!\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and be creative with your snack choices. Your guests will appreciate the variety and thoughtfulness you put into the menu. Good luck, and I hope your party is a huge success!"
