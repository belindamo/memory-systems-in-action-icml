  "content": "I'm particularly interested in films that tackle social justice issues, so I'd love to know more about \"Clemency\" and \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post\". Can you tell me more about the directors' approaches to storytelling and how they handle these sensitive topics? By the way, I was impressed by how quickly we had to come up with a script, shoot, and edit our short film at the Austin Film Festival - it was definitely a challenge, but it was amazing to see how our team came together to create something cohesive in just 48 hours.",
