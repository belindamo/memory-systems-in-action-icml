Visualization: Imagining yourself doing exercise or engaging in physical activity, enables the brain to prepare for the workout, and increase motivation.\n\n2. Mindful Breathing: Start with practicing deep breathing, and take relaxing breaths focusing on and being totally present with breaths moving in and out.\n\n3. Body Scan Meditation - Starting from the toes moving to the top of the head, pay attention to every sensation, and feeling in the body while gently stretching.\n\n4. Setting Intentions - Before every workout session, set an intention of accomplishing a specific workout goal or aim associated with your workout.\n\n5. Mantra Meditation - Set positive affirmations that you can remind yourself to stay active.\n\nBy practicing mindfulness exercises routinely, people can build mental resilience and achieve even their toughest workout goals.",
