  "content": "It\u2019s common for people with diabetes to feel self-conscious or embarrassed about checking their blood sugar or taking medications in public. Here are some ways your family and friends can help you feel more comfortable:\n\n1. Offer to check blood sugar together: If it\u2019s a new social gathering or you\u2019re in a new environment, you could ask a trusted friend or family member to check their blood sugar with you. This can help you feel more comfortable with the process.\n\n2. Help find a private space: When in a public space, ask your loved ones to help you find a private space to check your blood glucose levels or administer your insulin injections.\n\n3. Speak up to support you: If you feel uncomfortable during a social gathering, your friends or family members can speak up to support you or ensure others understand what is happening. This can ease your anxiety and help you feel less embarrassed.\n\n4. Encourage mindfulness: If you feel self-conscious or embarrassed about checking your blood sugar or taking medications in public, try practicing mindfulness techniques, such as breathing exercises, meditation, or reframing negative thoughts into positive ones.\n\nRemember that managing your diabetes is essential to your health and wellbeing. Don\u2019t let feelings of embarrassment or self-consciousness prevent you from taking the steps necessary to manage your diabetes effectively. Your friends and family can help you along the way by being your support team.",
