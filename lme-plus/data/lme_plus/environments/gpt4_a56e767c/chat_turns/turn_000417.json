Onboard Computer System:\nModern cars are equipped with onboard computer systems that monitor various sensors and systems within the car, such as the engine, fuel level, and GPS location. The onboard computer system is the key component that enables communication between the car and the app.\n2. Data Exchange Protocol:\nTo enable communication between the app and the onboard computer system, we would need to use a data exchange protocol such as the OBD-II protocol or a proprietary protocol provided by the car manufacturer. This protocol would allow the app to send commands and receive data from the onboard computer system.\n3. Hardware Interface:\nTo physically connect the app to the car's onboard computer system, we would need to use a hardware interface such as a Bluetooth OBD-II adapter or a Wi-Fi dongle. The hardware interface would act as a bridge between the app and the onboard computer system, allowing data to be exchanged between the two.\n4. App Integration:\nOnce the app is connected to the car's onboard computer system, we would need to integrate the data into the app's user interface. This would involve displaying relevant data such as the car's fuel level, location, and other details in real-time, and allowing users to remotely lock and unlock the car using the app.\n5. Security and Authentication:\nTo ensure that only authorized users can access the car's onboard computer system, we would need to implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms in the app. This would include features such as two-factor authentication, identity verification, and encrypted communication.\n\nBy following these steps, we can enable communication between the app and the car, allowing users to remotely control and monitor the car's systems and providing a seamless user experience.",
