Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix are indeed masters of their craft, and their film \"Joker\" is a testament to their bold and thought-provoking storytelling.\n\nNow, let's dive into the cinematography of \"Moonlight\" and \"The Florida Project\"!\n\n**Moonlight (2016)**\n\nCinematographer: James Laxton\n\n* **Visual style:** Laxton's cinematography in \"Moonlight\" is characterized by a lyrical, poetic, and introspective approach. He uses a mix of static shots, slow dolly movements, and subtle camera tilts to create a sense of intimacy and vulnerability.\n* **Color palette:** The film features a muted color scheme with a predominance of blues, greens, and yellows, evoking the melancholy and uncertainty of Chiron's journey. The color palette is also influenced by the film's Miami setting, with warm tones reflecting the city's vibrant cultural heritage.\n* **Camera techniques:**\n\t+ Laxton frequently employs a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, which creates a sense of claustrophobia and emphasizes the characters' emotional struggles.\n\t+ He uses close-ups to capture the subtleties of the actors' performances, often framing their faces in a way that conveys their emotional state.\n\t+ The film's use of available light adds to its naturalistic feel, with Laxton often shooting near windows or using practical lighting sources to create a sense of realism.\n\t+ The camerawork is often slow and deliberate, mirroring the protagonist's introspective nature and allowing the audience to absorb the emotional weight of each scene.\n\n**The Florida Project (2017)**\n\nCinematographer: Alexis Zabe\n\n* **Visual style:** Zabe's cinematography in \"The Florida Project\" is characterized by a vibrant, energetic, and playful approach. He uses a mix of handheld camera work, Steadicam shots, and static frames to capture the chaos and unpredictability of the characters' lives.\n* **Color palette:** The film features a bold, vibrant color scheme with a focus on bright pastels, neons, and warm tones, reflecting the film's themes of childhood wonder and the Magic Kingdom's influence.\n* **Camera techniques:**\n\t+ Zabe frequently employs a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, which adds to the film's sense of scope and grandeur, emphasizing the characters' adventures and the decaying grandeur of the motel.\n\t+ He uses a lot of natural light, often shooting during the golden hour or using available light sources to create a sense of warmth and spontaneity.\n\t+ The camerawork is often fast-paced and dynamic, mirroring the energy and unpredictability of the characters, with a focus on capturing the raw, unbridled emotions of childhood.\n\t+ Zabe also employs a lot of point-of-view shots, putting the audience in the shoes of the characters and immersing them in their world.\n\nBoth films feature cinematography that serves the story and characters, using camera techniques and visual styles that enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. As you continue your cinematography workshop, I hope these insights inspire you to experiment with different techniques and approaches to tell your own stories!",
