Both species are popular for their vibrant colors and interesting behaviors.\n\nSorry to hear that you lost a few neon tetras in the first week. Acclimation is a critical process when introducing new fish to a tank, and it's great that you're acknowledging the potential mistake. Neon tetras are a sensitive species and can be prone to stress, so it's essential to acclimate them slowly and carefully.\n\nHowever, it's excellent to hear that the rest of the tetras are thriving now! With proper care and attention, they should continue to do well. Make sure to monitor their school behavior, as neon tetras are a schooling fish and prefer to be in groups of 10-15 or more.\n\nAngelfish, on the other hand, are a relatively hardy species and can be quite tolerant of minor water quality fluctuations. However, they do require a well-established tank with plenty of hiding places and open swimming space. Since you've upgraded to a 55-gallon tank, your angelfish should have plenty of room to roam and explore.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind for your angelfish and neon tetras:\n\n* **Angelfish:**\n\t+ Provide plenty of hiding places, such as plants, rocks, and driftwood, to help them feel secure.\n\t+ Maintain a temperature range of 78-82\u00b0F (25-28\u00b0C), as angelfish prefer warmer waters.\n\t+ Feed them a varied diet that includes high-quality flakes, pellets, and frozen foods.\n* **Neon Tetras:**\n\t+ Maintain a school of 10-15 or more individuals to reduce stress and promote natural behavior.\n\t+ Keep the water temperature between 72-82\u00b0F (22-28\u00b0C), as neon tetras prefer slightly cooler waters.\n\t+ Feed them small, frequent meals throughout the day, as they have high metabolisms and need to eat often.\n\nBy following these guidelines and providing proper care, your angelfish and neon tetras should thrive in their new 55-gallon home.\n\nDo you have any plans to add more fish or decorations to the tank in the future?",
