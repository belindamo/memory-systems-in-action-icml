  "content": "Adding more plants and fish can definitely enhance the overall appearance and health of your tank. It's great that you're doing your research to ensure you're not overstocking the tank.\n\n**Adding more plants:**\n\n* Java moss and Anacharis are both excellent choices for a community tank. They're easy to care for and can help maintain good water quality.\n* Consider adding some mid-water or background plants like Cabomba, Hygrophila, or Bacopa to create a more layered and visually appealing aquascape.\n* Make sure to research the specific lighting and care requirements for any new plants you introduce to ensure they thrive in your tank.\n\n**Adding more fish:**\n\n* Dwarf gouramis and harlequin rasboras are both good choices for a community tank. They're generally peaceful and can coexist with your angelfish and neon tetras.\n* When choosing new fish, consider their adult size, temperament, and swimming level to ensure they're compatible with your existing fish.\n* Research the bioload requirements for each species to ensure you're not overstocking the tank. A general rule of thumb is to add 1-2 inches of fish per gallon, but this can vary depending on the species and tank conditions.\n\n**Tips for stocking a community tank:**\n\n* Start with a few species and gradually add more over time to allow the tank to establish a balance.\n* Mix up the swimming levels and sizes of fish to create visual interest and reduce competition for food and resources.\n* Avoid overstocking the tank, as this can lead to water quality issues and stress on the fish.\n* Make sure to quarantine new fish before introducing them to the main tank to prevent the spread of disease.\n\nBy doing your research and taking a thoughtful approach to stocking your tank, you can create a thriving and beautiful community of fish and plants. Good luck!",
