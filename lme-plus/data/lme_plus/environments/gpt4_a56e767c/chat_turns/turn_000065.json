  "content": "I'd like to know more about the cinematography in \"Clemency\" and \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post\". How did the directors use camera techniques and lighting to convey the tone and atmosphere of the films? By the way, I got to discuss the unique narrative structure of \"The Weight of Water\" with the director himself at a Q&A session after the screening at the Seattle International Film Festival, which was really enlightening.",
