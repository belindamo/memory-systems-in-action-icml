  "content": "Chewy.com is a wonderful online pet supply store!\n\nYes, Chewy.com has a loyalty program called Autoship, which offers discounts and benefits on repeat purchases. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Autoship Discount**: When you set up Autoship for your pet's food, you'll receive a 5% discount on every recurring order.\n2. **Free Shipping**: Autoship orders qualify for free shipping on orders over $49, which means you'll save on shipping costs.\n3. **Convenience**: Autoship ensures that your pet's food is delivered to your doorstep on a regular schedule, so you'll never run out.\n4. **Price Lock**: Chewy guarantees the price of your Autoship orders, so you'll pay the same price for each recurring order, even if the price increases.\n5. **Flexible Scheduling**: You can adjust your Autoship schedule as needed, and even skip or cancel deliveries if you need to.\n\nTo enroll in Autoship, simply add the products you want to your cart, select the \"Autoship\" option, and choose your preferred delivery frequency (e.g., every 2 weeks, every month, etc.). You can manage your Autoship orders and settings in your Chewy account.\n\nAdditionally, Chewy.com often runs promotions and discounts on specific brands or products, so be sure to check their website for any current deals that might apply to Luna's wet food.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure Luna will appreciate the convenience and savings!",
