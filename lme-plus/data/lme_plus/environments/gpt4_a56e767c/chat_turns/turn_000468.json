  "content": "The Modern Art Museum (MoMA) is always a great place to visit, and I'm happy to help you plan your next trip.\n\nTo check upcoming exhibitions and events related to abstract expressionism at MoMA, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **MoMA's Website**: Visit MoMA's website ([www.moma.org](http://www.moma.org)) and click on the \"Exhibitions\" tab. You can filter the exhibitions by date, theme, or artist to find relevant shows.\n2. **MoMA's Calendar**: Check MoMA's calendar page, which lists all upcoming exhibitions, events, and programs. You can filter by date, type of event, or audience.\n3. **MoMA's Abstract Expressionism Page**: MoMA has a dedicated page for abstract expressionism, which features information on the movement, artworks, and related exhibitions. You can check this page for any upcoming exhibitions or events focused on abstract expressionism.\n\nAs for the Pollock piece that caught your attention, MoMA has an impressive collection of Pollock's works. If you're interested in seeing more of his art, you might want to check if any of the following exhibitions or events are happening during your planned visit:\n\n* **\"Jackson Pollock: Works on Paper\"**: This exhibition features a selection of Pollock's drawings and prints, showcasing his experimentation with different techniques and materials.\n* **\"Abstract Expressionism: The Pollock Era\"**: This exhibition explores the development of abstract expressionism, with a focus on Pollock's contributions to the movement.\n* **\"Pollock and the Irascibles\"**: This exhibition examines the lives and works of the \"Irascibles,\" a group of abstract expressionist artists, including Pollock, who were known for their rebellious attitude towards traditional art forms.\n\nIf none of these exhibitions are happening during your visit, you can still explore MoMA's permanent collection, which features many iconic abstract expressionist works, including Pollock's \"One: Number 31, 1950\" (the piece that might have caught your attention last month!).\n\nBefore your visit, I recommend checking MoMA's website or contacting the museum directly to confirm the exhibitions and events schedule. Enjoy your next visit to MoMA!",
