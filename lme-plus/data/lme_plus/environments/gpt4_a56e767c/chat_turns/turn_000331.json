  "content": "That's a great point about the cinematography in \"Joker\"! I completely agree that the mix of camera formats added to the film's tension and unease. By the way, speaking of unease, I've been thinking about the themes of mental health and societal decay in \"Joker\" and how they relate to my own experiences attending film festivals and events. I've been fortunate enough to attend some amazing festivals, like AFI Fest, where I got to see \"Joker\" and attend a Q&A session with Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix. What do you think is the role of film festivals in promoting social change and raising awareness about important issues?",
