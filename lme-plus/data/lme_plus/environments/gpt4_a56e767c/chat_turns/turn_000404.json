Based on your interest in temples and scenic views, I'm going to take a guess that the city that caught your attention is Nikko?\n\nNikko is indeed a fantastic choice for a day trip from Tokyo. The city is home to numerous UNESCO World Heritage-listed temples and shrines, including the famous Toshogu Shrine, which is dedicated to the deified spirit of Tokugawa Ieyasu. The ornate decorations, intricate carvings, and stunning architecture of these temples are truly breathtaking.\n\nIn addition to the temples, Nikko is surrounded by beautiful natural scenery, with nearby waterfalls, lakes, and mountains. You can take a hike in the nearby national park, visit the Kegon Falls, or take a boat ride on Lake Chuzenji.\n\nTo make the most of your day trip, I recommend taking an early train from Tokyo to Nikko, and then using the local bus system to get around the city. You can also consider purchasing a Nikko All-Area Pass, which grants you access to many of the temples and attractions, as well as unlimited bus rides.\n\nWhat's your plan for your day trip to Nikko? Are there any specific temples or attractions that you're looking forward to visiting?",
