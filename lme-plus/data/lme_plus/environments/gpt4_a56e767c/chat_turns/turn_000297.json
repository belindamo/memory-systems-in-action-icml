  "content": "I've been experimenting with different camera angles and lighting techniques, and I've noticed a big difference in the overall look and feel of my footage. I've also been playing around with editing software, trying to develop my own style and visual aesthetic.\n\nBy the way, speaking of cinematography, I had the opportunity to assist with a masterclass workshop led by Rachel Morrison at the Portland Film Festival, where I volunteered. She shared some incredible insights about her approach to cinematography and working on films like \"Mudbound\" and \"Black Panther\". It was really inspiring to hear about her experiences and learn from her expertise.",
