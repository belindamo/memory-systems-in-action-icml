  "content": "That's really cool! I was thinking of including some songs from musicals that aren't necessarily hip-hop or R&B, but still have a strong narrative focus. Like, have you heard the soundtrack from Spring Awakening? That's a rock musical that deals with some really heavy themes like teenage angst, sexuality, and mortality. The music is really catchy and the story is super relatable. Would you recommend any songs from that soundtrack?",
