  "content": "Lifeguards are trained and responsible for ensuring the safety of visitors to the pool or beach area they are responsible for. While fun is important, safety is paramount. Accidents in and around the water can happen quickly and quietly, and can result in serious injury or death, which is why lifeguards are trained to be vigilant and enforce safety rules.\n\nBy being strict, lifeguards are not trying to spoil anyone's fun but are working to reduce the risk of accidents that can occur if safety rules are not followed.  It's important to remember that it's not only the swimmer who may be at risk, but other pool or beach-goers who may become entangled with or affected by someone engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nUltimately, the role of lifeguards is to ensure the safety of all visitors, and this is best achieved by following strict rules and guidelines.",
