  "content": "I love these ideas! I think I'll go with The Red Card cocktail and pair it with some Manchester Malt beer. That sounds like a winning combination to me! By the way, speaking of Manchester, I watched their final match against Brighton at home with my family and we had an amazing time celebrating their title win. Do you have any other ideas for snacks or decorations that would fit well with this theme?",
