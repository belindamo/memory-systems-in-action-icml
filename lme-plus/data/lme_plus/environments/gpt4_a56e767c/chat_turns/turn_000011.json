You can feed them live or frozen.\n2. **Spirulina:** This algae-based food is rich in nutrients and can be fed as flakes, pellets, or frozen cubes. It's particularly beneficial for herbivorous fish.\n3. **Daphnia:** These small crustaceans are an excellent live food source, rich in protein and omega-3 fatty acids. They're a great treat for small fish.\n4. **Mysis shrimp:** These small, shrimp-like crustaceans are rich in nutrients and can be fed frozen or live. They're a popular food for many fish species.\n5. **Vegetable-based foods:** If you have herbivorous fish, consider adding vegetable-based foods like algae wafers, zucchini, or cucumber slices to their diet.\n6. **Live or frozen plankton:** Plankton is a natural food source for many fish, and it's rich in nutrients. You can feed live or frozen plankton to your fish as a treat.\n7. **Frozen or live krill:** Krill is a small, shrimp-like crustacean that's rich in protein and omega-3 fatty acids. It's a popular food for many fish species.\n\nRemember to research each food type to ensure it's suitable for your specific fish species and their dietary needs. Also, be cautious not to overfeed your fish, as this can lead to water quality issues and digestive problems.\n\nIt's great that you're experimenting with different foods and observing your fish's preferences. Keep in mind that a varied diet can help ensure your fish receive a broad range of nutrients, which can lead to better health and coloration.\n\nWhat type of fish do you have in your 55-gallon tank, by the way? I'm curious to know more about your aquatic friends!",
