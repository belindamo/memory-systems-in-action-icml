The trivia game during halftime is also a fantastic idea to keep everyone engaged and entertained. It'll add an extra layer of fun to the party and give guests something to look forward to during the break.\n\nTo take it to the next level, you could also consider offering some fun prizes for the trivia winners, like Manchester-themed merchandise or even a small trophy. It'll add a competitive element to the game and make it even more exciting.\n\nRemember to keep the trivia questions challenging but not too difficult, so everyone can have a good time participating. You could also consider having a few easy questions to get everyone started, and then gradually increase the difficulty level as the game progresses.\n\nOverall, I think you're planning an amazing party that your guests will love. The combination of delicious food, refreshing drinks, and fun activities will make it a memorable event for everyone. Keep up the great work, and I'm sure your party will be a huge success!",
