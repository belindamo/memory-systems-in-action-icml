  "content": "The narrative structure of \"The Weight of Water\" was really interesting to me because it was non-linear, and the director shared that he was inspired by the concept of memory and how it can be fragmented and unreliable. I loved how the film jumped back and forth in time, slowly revealing the story and characters. It was really effective in building tension and emotional resonance.\n\nAs for my conversation with the director, it definitely inspired me to think more about experimenting with non-linear storytelling in my own work. I've been playing around with some script ideas, and I'm considering using a similar approach to tell a more complex and layered story.",
