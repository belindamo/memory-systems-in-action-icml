It was really inspiring to see someone at her level being so down-to-earth and generous with her time.\n\nAs for the festival itself, I actually had a great conversation with the director of \"The Weight of Water\" after a Q&A session. He shared some fascinating insights about his creative process, and I was really impressed by his unique narrative structure. It was one of the standout films for me at the festival.",
