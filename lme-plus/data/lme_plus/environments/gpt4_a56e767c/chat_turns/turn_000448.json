Display signs and posters: Display signs and posters around the pool or beach area that provide information about water safety, such as the dangers of rip currents or the importance of wearing a life jacket.\n\n3. Provide educational materials: Create brochures or handouts that visitors can take with them, which provide tips on water safety and drowning prevention.\n\n4. Demonstrate proper techniques: Demonstrate proper swimming techniques to visitors, such as how to tread water or how to perform a floating maneuver.\n\n5. Intervene when necessary: If you notice a visitor engaging in unsafe swimming behaviors, such as diving in shallow water, intervene immediately by educating them on the risks and reminding them to follow safety guidelines.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how you might educate visitors about water safety as a lifeguard, but ultimately the approach you take will depend on the specific needs of your pool or beach area and its visitors.",
