It's best to check beforehand.\n\n**Booking and Prices:**\n\n* **Booking websites:** Use websites like Booking.com, Hostelworld, or Japan-specific platforms like Japan-Guide.com to find and book hostels.\n* **Prices:** As you mentioned, prices can vary depending on the location, time of year, and availability. \u00a52,000-\u00a55,000 (around $18-$45 USD) per night is a reasonable range for a shared room in a hostel.\n\nOverall, hostels in Japan are a great way to meet fellow travelers, experience the local culture, and save money.

      "content": "Navigating Tokyo's transportation system can be intimidating, but don't worry, I'm here to help!\n\nWhile taxis are convenient, they can be expensive, especially during peak hours. Fortunately, Tokyo has a comprehensive and efficient public transportation system that's relatively affordable. Here are some affordable transportation options to get you to popular tourist spots like Shibuya Crossing and Tokyo Tower:\n\n**Subway and Train:**\n\n1. **Suica or Pasmo cards:** Buy a prepaid IC card (like Suica or Pasmo) at most train stations. These cards can be refilled and used to ride subways, trains, and buses. A single ride typically costs \u00a5200-\u00a5400 (around $2-$4 USD).\n2. **Tokyo Metro:** The Tokyo Metro is an efficient way to get around the city. A single ride costs \u00a5200-\u00a5400 (around $2-$4 USD), but you can also buy a 24-hour pass for \u00a5600 (around $6 USD).\n3. **JR Train:** Japan Railways (JR) operates trains that connect major stations. A single ride costs \u00a5130-\u00a5240 (around $1.30-$2.40 USD).\n\n**Bus:**\n\n1. **Toei Bus:** Toei Bus is a affordable option for shorter distances. A single ride costs \u00a5210 (around $2 USD).\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **Walking:** Tokyo is a walkable city, and walking is a great way to explore neighborhoods. Just be mindful of pedestrian rules and traffic signs.\n2. **Bicycle:** Some areas, like Shibuya, offer bike-sharing services. This can be a fun and affordable way to get around.\n\n**Getting to Popular Tourist Spots:**\n\n1. **Shibuya Crossing:** Take the JR Yamanote Line to Shibuya Station (\u00a5130, around $1.30 USD). From there, follow the signs to Shibuya Crossing.\n2. **Tokyo Tower:** Take the JR Sobu Line to Hamamatsucho Station (\u00a5130, around $1.30 USD).
