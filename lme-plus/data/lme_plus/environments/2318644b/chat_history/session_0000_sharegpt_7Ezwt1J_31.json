Jeffrey is a valuable member of our team, and you can't just fire him like this!\n\nMr. Smith: (surprised) Thomas, I'm not firing Jeffrey. We're just having a conversation about his recent absence from work.\n\nThomas: (defensive) Oh, I'm sorry. I just assumed that you were going to fire him because of his personal issues.\n\nMr. Smith: (firmly) That's not fair, Thomas. You can't make assumptions about someone's situation without all the facts. We all have personal issues that we have to deal with, and it's not for you to judge.\n\nThomas, feeling embarrassed, starts to realize that he had jumped to conclusions without all the facts.
