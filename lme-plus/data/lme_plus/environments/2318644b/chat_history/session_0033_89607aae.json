Here are a few suggestions to help you achieve better adhesion:\n\n1. **Score and slip:** Before adding a new coil, score the surface of the previous coil with a needle tool or a serrated edge. This creates a rough surface for the new coil to bond to. Then, apply a small amount of slip (a mixture of water and clay) to the scored area. This will help the new coil adhere better.\n2. **Slip and slide:** Apply a small amount of slip to the coil you're about to add, and then gently slide it into place. This helps the coil settle into position and creates a better bond.\n3. **Press and smooth:** Once you've added a new coil, use a gentle pressing motion to ensure it's securely attached. Use a damp sponge or a soft cloth to smooth out any excess slip or bumps.\n4. **Use the right consistency:** Make sure your clay is at the right consistency for coiling. If it's too soft, it might be difficult to work with, and the coils might not hold their shape. If it's too stiff, it might not bend or flex enough to conform to the shape you're trying to achieve.\n5. **Work in thin layers:** Adding thin layers of coils allows each layer to dry slightly before adding the next, which can help prevent the coils from becoming too thick and heavy. This can also reduce the likelihood of cracks or breaks.\n6. **Use a gentle touch:** When adding new coils, use a gentle touch to avoid applying too much pressure, which can cause the coils to distort or separate.\n7. **Dry slowly:** Allow each layer to dry slowly and naturally, either by air-drying or using a controlled drying environment. Avoid using heat guns or rapid drying methods, as this can cause the coils to crack or become brittle.\n8. **Practice makes perfect:** As you continue to coil, you'll develop a sense of how much pressure to apply, how much slip to use, and how to gently shape the coils. With practice, you'll become more comfortable and confident in your technique.\n\nRemember, coiling is a process that requires patience, and it's normal to experience some trial and error. Don't be discouraged if your coils don't stick together perfectly at first. Keep practicing, and you'll soon develop the skills and techniques to create beautiful, cohesive pieces.\n\nI hope these tips help you improve your coiling skills, and I'm sure Rachel will be happy to offer additional guidance and support in your classes!"
