      "content": "Sure, here are some basic rules for \"Chronicles of Everia\" that utilize 10-sided dice:\n\n1. Character Creation:\n\t* Roll 3d10 six times and record each result.\n\t* Assign each result to a different attribute: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.\n\t* Choose a race and class for your character, each of which will provide additional bonuses and abilities.\n2. Combat:\n\t* Determine initiative by rolling a d10 and adding your Dexterity modifier.\n\t* To make an attack, roll a d10 and add your Attack bonus. If the result equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class, the attack hits.\n\t* Roll damage by rolling the appropriate dice for your weapon or spell, and adding any relevant modifiers.\n3. Skill Checks:\n\t* When attempting a skill check, roll a d10 and add the relevant attribute modifier and any relevant bonuses.\n\t* If the result equals or exceeds the difficulty class set by the Game Master, the check is successful.\n4. Magic:\n\t* To cast a spell, roll a d10 and add your Spellcasting bonus.\n\t* The difficulty class for an opponent to resist your spell is equal to 8 + your Spellcasting modifier + the level of the spell.\n5. Experience and Leveling Up:\n\t* Experience is awarded for defeating enemies, completing quests, and achieving other goals as determined by the Game Master.\n\t* When you earn enough experience, you gain a level, which provides additional abilities and bonuses.\n\nOf course, these are just very basic rules, and many other rules and mechanics could be added to make the game more complex and interesting."
