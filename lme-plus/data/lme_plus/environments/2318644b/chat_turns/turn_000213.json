  "content": "Thank you for the information. I stayed in a hostel in Tokyo that cost around $30 per night when I went solo last January, so it's possible for me to find good deals. I'm planning to visit some of the popular tourist spots in Tokyo, such as Shibuya Crossing and the Tokyo Tower. Are there any affordable transportation options available, or should I just take a taxi?",
