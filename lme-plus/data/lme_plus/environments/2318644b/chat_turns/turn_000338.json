It's great that you have something to look forward to.\n\nRegarding task prioritization and workload management, I'd be happy to offer some advice!\n\nHere are some tips that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Set clear goals**: Identify your short-term and long-term goals, and break them down into smaller, actionable tasks. This will help you focus on what's truly important.\n2. **Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix**: Categorize tasks into four quadrants: urgent & important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important. Focus on the first quadrant first.\n3. **Use a task list or planner**: Write down all your tasks and deadlines. Crossing off completed tasks can be very satisfying and help you stay motivated.\n4. **Break tasks into smaller chunks**: Large tasks can be overwhelming. Break them down into smaller, manageable tasks that you can complete one by one.\n5. **Avoid multitasking**: Focus on one task at a time to ensure you do it efficiently and effectively.\n6. **Use time-blocking**: Schedule specific times for tasks, eliminating distractions during that time.\n7. **Take regular breaks**: Take short breaks to recharge and avoid burnout.\n8. **Learn to say no**: Be mindful of taking on too much. Learn to say no to tasks that don't align with your goals or values.\n9. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your task list and adjust your priorities as needed.\n\nRemember, everyone's productivity style is different, so it's essential to experiment and find what works best for you.\n\nIt's great that your friend Alex has been offering tips, and I'm sure you'll find a combination of advice that works best for you.
