  "content": "Yes, camera angles can definitely play a significant role in making the audience feel anxious or scared even during scenes with no jump scares or gore. When done correctly, camera angles can create an atmosphere of suspense, unease, and tension that can build anticipation and fear in the audience's minds. \n\nFor instance, a low-angle shot can give the impression of a character looming over the audience, creating a sense of unease and vulnerability. Using close-up shots on the face of a character can highlight their emotional reactions and create a sense of intimacy or unease. Additionally, using long, slow-moving shots can create a sense of anticipation and generate tension and anxiety as the audience anticipates what will happen next.\n\nTherefore, even without jumpscares or gore, camera angles can still create an atmosphere of suspense that can make the audience feel anxious and afraid. Horror filmmakers often use camera angles together with other techniques like music and lighting to create a genuinely terrifying and immersive horror experience.",
