I'll also consider adding a section for special occasions, like holidays and family gatherings. For the outline, I'll start with a table of contents that lists the main categories and sections, and then break down each category into subcategories or chapters. I'll list the recipes under each subcategory, along with a brief description or note about each recipe. I might also add introduction and conclusion sections to each category, and include any additional content like stories or tips that don't fit into a specific recipe. Thanks for the guidance!",
