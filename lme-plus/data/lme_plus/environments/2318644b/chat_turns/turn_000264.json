  "content": "That's fantastic! It's great that you're pushing yourself to try new things and learn from others in the field. Watching YouTube tutorials, like Sculpting with Sarah, can be a great way to stay inspired and learn new techniques.\n\nExperimenting with different glazing techniques and color combinations can really elevate your work and add an extra layer of depth and interest. It's also exciting that you're feeling like you're departing from your usual style, but still retaining the essence of what makes your sculptures unique. That's a great sign of growth and evolution as an artist!\n\nWhat specific techniques or ideas did you pick up from Sculpting with Sarah that you're excited to apply to your work? Are you planning on sharing your new vase on social media or at the art fair?\n\nAlso, have you considered offering custom commissions or bespoke pieces? With your new skills and techniques, you might find that customers are interested in commissioning unique pieces from you. Just a thought!",
