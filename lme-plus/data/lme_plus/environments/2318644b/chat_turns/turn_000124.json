  "content": "Due to the complexity and variety of functions required for a comprehensive situational awareness system during natural disasters, it is difficult to provide a complete example code here. However, here is an example code snippet for integrating an open-source GIS tool with a guidance system for a drone:\n```python\nimport geopandas as gpd\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\n\n# Load the disaster data into a GeoDataFrame\ndisaster_data = gpd.read_file('path/to/disaster_data.shp')\n\n# Define a polygon representing the search area for the drone\nsearch_area = Polygon([(lon1, lat1), (lon2, lat2), (lon3, lat3), (lon4, lat4)])\n\n# Select the disaster events that intersect with the search area\ndisaster_events = disaster_data[disaster_data.intersects(search_area)]\n\n# Create a list of waypoints for the drone to follow\nwaypoints = [(lon1, lat1, alt1), (lon2, lat2, alt2), (lon3, lat3, alt3), (lon4, lat4, alt4)]\n\n# Initialize the drone guidance system\nguidance_system = DroneGuidanceSystem()\n\n# Set the drone's mission to follow the predetermined waypoints\nguidance_system.set_mission(waypoints)\n\n# Fly the drone over the disaster events and stream live video to the ground station\nfor event in disaster_events:\n    guidance_system.fly_to(event.geometry.centroid.x, event.geometry.centroid.y, event.geometry.centroid.z)\n    guidance_system.start_video_stream()\n\n# Return the drone to its starting point and land\nguidance_system.return_to_home()\nguidance_system.land()\n```\nThis code demonstrates how a GIS tool can be used to select disaster events within a search area, and how the drone guidance system can be used to fly over those events and stream live video to the ground station. Of course, this is just a small part of a larger situational awareness system, but it gives an idea of how these different technologies can be integrated.",
