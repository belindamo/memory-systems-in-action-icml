  "content": "Both approaches can be effective, depending on your personal preferences and goals. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Goal-related mantra:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Focuses your mind on a specific goal or objective\n* Can help you stay motivated and driven towards achieving that goal\n* Can be a powerful reminder of what you're working towards\n\nCons:\n\n* May become too narrow or specific, leading to tunnel vision\n* Might not be applicable to other areas of your life beyond that specific goal\n* Could lead to feelings of guilt or frustration if you don't make progress towards that goal\n\n**General mindset mantra:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Can be applied to multiple areas of your life, providing a broader sense of purpose\n* Can help you develop a positive mindset or attitude that benefits you in various situations\n* May be more flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances\n\nCons:\n\n* Might not be as focused or specific as a goal-related mantra\n* Could be too vague or general, making it harder to apply in practice\n* May not provide the same level of motivation or drive as a goal-related mantra\n\nUltimately, the choice between a goal-related or general mindset mantra depends on your personal needs and preferences.
