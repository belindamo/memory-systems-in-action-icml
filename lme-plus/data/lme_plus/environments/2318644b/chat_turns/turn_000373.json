  "content": "I did buy an Anker wireless charging pad recently, and it's been working great for me. I think I'll stick with Anker for the portable power bank as well. I've already had a good experience with their products, and I like the idea of having a consistent ecosystem. Can you tell me more about the Anker PowerCore Fusion? You mentioned it earlier, and I'm curious about its features and performance.",
