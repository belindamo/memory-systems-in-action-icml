But don't worry, I'm here to help you find your next great watch.\n\nGiven your love for The Expanse, I'll suggest some sci-fi shows with similar themes, complexity, and episode lengths around 45-60 minutes. Since you mentioned you watch The Good Place during your lunch break, I'll focus on shows with similar episode lengths. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Babylon 5** (Amazon Prime): This classic sci-fi series explores politics, war, and humanity in a futuristic setting. With 5 seasons and 110 episodes, it's a great replacement for The Expanse.\n2. **Killjoys** (Amazon Prime): This show follows a team of intergalactic bounty hunters in a distant planetary system. It has a similar blend of action, adventure, and humor, with 4 seasons and 50 episodes.\n3. **Dark Matter** (Netflix): Based on the comic book series, this show follows a group of people who wake up on a spaceship with no memory of who they are or how they got there. It's a great mix of sci-fi, mystery, and action, with 3 seasons and 39 episodes.\n4. **Altered Carbon** (Netflix): Set in a future where human consciousness can be transferred into new bodies, this show explores themes of identity, power, and corruption. With 2 seasons and 18 episodes, it's a great choice for fans of The Expanse.\n5. **Colony** (Netflix): This family drama is set in a dystopian near-future where an occupied Los Angeles serves as the backdrop for a resistance movement. With 3 seasons and 36 episodes, it's a great choice for fans of character-driven sci-fi.\n6. **Travelers** (Netflix): This show follows a team of special agents from the future who travel back in time to the present day to prevent a catastrophic event. With 3 seasons and 34 episodes, it's a great choice for fans of time travel and sci-fi mystery.\n7. **Farscape** (Amazon Prime): This classic sci-fi series follows an astronaut who's flung across the galaxy and joins a group of misfits on a living ship. With 4 seasons and 88 episodes, it's a great choice for fans of space opera and adventure.\n\nAll of these shows have a similar tone and complexity to The Expanse, and their episode lengths are around 45-60 minutes, making them perfect for your lunch break viewing. I hope you find your next favorite show among these recommendations!",
