  "content": "There could be several reasons why the data you are getting from the Uniswap V3 subgraph is different from the data on the Uniswap Info website (<https://info.uniswap.org/#/>). Here are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. Timeframe: The data on the Uniswap Info website is often updated in real-time, while the data on the subgraph may have a slight delay. Additionally, the timeframe of the data may differ between the two sources. For example, the subgraph may provide data for the last 24 hours, while the Uniswap Info website may show data for the last hour.\n2. Metrics: The subgraph and the Uniswap Info website may use different metrics to measure TVL and 24Hr volume. For example, the subgraph may use a different methodology to calculate TVL or may include additional pools in the calculation.\n3. Filters: The subgraph and the Uniswap Info website may apply different filters or criteria when selecting which pools to display. For example, the subgraph may exclude pools with a TVL below a certain threshold, while the Uniswap Info website may include all pools regardless of their TVL.\n4. API errors: Occasionally, there may be issues with the subgraph API that result in incomplete or inaccurate data. If you suspect that the subgraph is not returning accurate data, you can try checking other sources or reaching out to the Uniswap development team for assistance.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Uniswap V3 subgraph is maintained by a third-party developer and is not an official Uniswap product. While the subgraph is generally reliable, it's possible that there may be occasional discrepancies or errors in the data.",
