Colorful bib necklace: A colorful bib necklace can really pop against a black dress. Look for one with bright stones or beads to add some interest to your outfit. 2. Chunky chain necklace: A chunky chain necklace adds an edgy touch to your outfit. Look for one with oversized links or hardware to really make a statement. 3. Layered pendant necklace: A layered pendant necklace adds dimension to your outfit. Look for one with multiple chains and different sized pendants to create a boho-inspired look. 4. Collar necklace: A collar necklace hugs the neckline and adds a touch of retro glam. Look for one with a sleek and geometric design to keep it modern. 5.
