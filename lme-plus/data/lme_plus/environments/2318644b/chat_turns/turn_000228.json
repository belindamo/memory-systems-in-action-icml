  "content": "Certainly, there are many examples of horror films where camera angles played a significant role in building suspense, but one of the most famous is the 1960 horror-thriller \"Psycho,\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nIn \"Psycho,\" Hitchcock makes masterful use of camera angles, particularly in the famous shower scene. For example, he uses a series of quick, close-up shots of the killer's knife, which helps to build tension and create a sense of danger. Hitchcock also uses an overhead shot to show the bloody water swirling around the drain, which adds to the sense of disorientation and chaos.\n\nAnother example is the use of a low-angle shot when the killer first approaches the victim, which creates a sense of vulnerability and powerlessness for the audience. Additionally, Hitchcock uses a high-angle shot moments later to show the victim's lifeless body on the shower floor, which adds to the feeling of horror and shock.\n\nOverall, the camera angles used in \"Psycho\" effectively created suspense and terror that are still considered remarkable today. Hitchcock used these specific angles to manipulate the audience's perspective and create an unsettling, uncomfortable feeling that remains unforgettable.",
