This will help your body adapt to the demands of running and build your endurance.\n2. **Incorporate longer runs**: Once a week, do a longer run (6-8 miles) at a moderate pace. This will help you build your endurance and mental toughness.\n3. **Include recovery runs**: Make sure to include recovery runs (easy runs at a slow pace) after your longer runs to help your body recover.\n\n**Speed Development (Phase 2: Weeks 5-8)**\n\n1. **Introduce interval training**: Start incorporating interval workouts once or twice a week.
