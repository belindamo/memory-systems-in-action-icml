  "content": "To get the top pools by total volume locked (TVL) and 24Hr volume on Uniswap V3 Subgraph, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, you need to identify the Uniswap V3 Subgraph endpoint URL. You can find it on the official Uniswap V3 Subgraph documentation website.\n2. Once you have the endpoint URL, you can use it to query the subgraph using a tool like GraphiQL or any other GraphQL client.\n3. To get the top pools by TVL, you can use the following GraphQL query:\n```typescript\n{\n  pools(first: 10, orderBy: totalValueLockedUSD, orderDirection: desc) {\n    id\n    token0 {\n      symbol\n    }\n    token1 {\n      symbol\n    }\n    totalValueLockedUSD\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this query, we are querying for the top 10 pools ordered by `totalValueLockedUSD` in descending order. We are also returning the pool ID, the symbols of the tokens in the pool (`token0` and `token1`), and the `totalValueLockedUSD` of each pool.\n\n1. To get the top pools by 24Hr volume, you can use the following GraphQL query:\n```php\n{\n  pools(first: 10, orderBy: volumeUSD, orderDirection: desc, where: {volumeUSD_gt: 0}) {\n    id\n    token0 {\n      symbol\n    }\n    token1 {\n      symbol\n    }\n    volumeUSD\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this query, we are querying for the top 10 pools ordered by `volumeUSD` in descending order. We are also returning the pool ID, the symbols of the tokens in the pool (`token0` and `token1`), and the `volumeUSD` of each pool. We are also using the `where` parameter to filter out any pools with a 24Hr volume of zero.\n\n1. Once you have executed the queries, you will receive the data as a JSON response, which you can then parse and display as per your requirements.",
