You might need to move it a few millimeters to find the sweet spot.\n7. **Monitor the charging indicator**: Keep an eye on your phone's charging indicator to ensure it's charging correctly. If it's not charging, try repositioning the phone or checking for any software updates.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to get the best wireless charging experience with your new Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and charging pad.
