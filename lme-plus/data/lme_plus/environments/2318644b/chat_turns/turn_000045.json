It's possible that it may take some time to see improvements, or you might need to make some additional adjustments.\n\n**Anxiety Meds and Stomach Issues:**\nIt's definitely possible that the switch to a generic brand could be affecting your stomach. Some people may experience gastrointestinal side effects when starting or switching medications, including anxiety meds. If you suspect that the medication change is contributing to your stomach issues, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about potential alternatives or adjustments.\n\n**Coughing and Digestion:**\nThe lingering cough is quite frustrating, I'm sure! While the remedies I mentioned earlier are primarily focused on digestion, some of them might have a positive impact on your cough as well. Here are a few connections to consider:\n\n1. **Ginger**: Ginger has natural anti-inflammatory properties, which can help soothe a sore throat and reduce inflammation that might be contributing to your cough.\n2. **Probiotics**: Research suggests that probiotics can help boost your immune system and reduce inflammation in the body, which might aid in fighting off the underlying cause of your cough.\n3. **Slippery Elm**: Slippery elm is a natural demulcent that can help soothe and protect the mucous membranes in your throat, making it a potential natural cough remedy.\n4. **Honey**: Honey has antimicrobial properties and can help soothe a sore throat. You can try mixing a spoonful of honey with warm water or tea to create a soothing drink.\n\n**Additional Suggestions for Your Cough:**\n\n1. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, like water, herbal tea, or warm broth, to help thin out mucus and keep your throat moist.\n2. **Elevate Your Head**: When sleeping, try elevating your head with an extra pillow to reduce congestion and make breathing easier.\n3. **Steam Inhalation**: Inhale steam from a bowl of hot water or a steam humidifier to help loosen mucus and reduce coughing.\n4. **Throat Coat Tea**: Try drinking Throat Coat tea, which contains slippery elm, licorice root, and other herbs that can help soothe the throat.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Consult Your Doctor**: If your cough persists or worsens, it's essential to consult with your doctor to rule out any underlying conditions that may need medical attention.\n2. **Keep a Food and Symptom Journal**: Tracking your food intake, symptoms, and medication can help you identify potential patterns or correlations between your diet, anxiety meds, and stomach issues.\n3. **Consider a Gut-Healing Diet**: If you suspect that your stomach issues are related to gut health, you might want to explore a gut-healing diet, such as the GAPS diet or the Low FODMAP diet, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet or supplement routine, especially if you're taking medications or have underlying health conditions.",
