  "content": "Sure, here are some possible ways to expand on the example code:\n\n1. Data visualization: The example code shows how to load and plot geospatial data, but there are many other ways to visualize data, such as heat maps, scatter plots, or time series. By using a library like Matplotlib or Plotly, you could create dynamic visualizations that help decision-makers understand the current situation and identify trends or patterns.\n2. Real-time data acquisition: In the example code, the geospatial data is loaded from a file, but in a real-time situation, the data may need to be acquired from sensors or other sources in real-time. By using an API like OGC SensorThings, you could retrieve real-time data from a variety of sensors, such as weather stations or seismic sensors, and incorporate this data into your situational awareness system.\n3. Machine learning: The example code shows how to filter and manipulate geospatial data, but there may be patterns or anomalies in the data that are difficult to identify with traditional techniques. By using machine learning algorithms, such as clustering or anomaly detection, you could identify these patterns and use them to make more informed decisions.\n4. Collaboration: In a natural disaster situation, multiple agencies or organizations may be involved in the response effort. By using a collaboration platform, such as ArcGIS Online or Google My Maps, you could share data and visualizations with other stakeholders, enabling them to make more informed decisions and coordinate their efforts more effectively.\n5. Alerting and notification: In addition to visualizing data, it may be useful to automatically notify stakeholders of important events or changes in the situation. By using a messaging platform, such as Twilio or AWS SNS, you could send automated notifications based on predefined thresholds or events, such as a sudden increase in seismic activity or a change in wind direction.",
