  "content": "I'm planning to visit the Tsukiji Fish Market during my trip, but I've heard it's really crowded. Are there any tips for visiting the market, and are there any other fish markets in Tokyo that are worth visiting? By the way, I've had some amazing street food in Tokyo before, and I'm looking forward to trying some more during this trip.",
