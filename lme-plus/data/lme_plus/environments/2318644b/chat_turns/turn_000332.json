But I can help you create a schedule outline that you can then input into your calendar or planner.\n\nHere's a suggested schedule outline for your regular meetups:\n\n**Tuesday**\n\n* Lunch with Alex\n\n**Thursday**\n\n* Lunch with Alex\n\nYou can add these events to your calendar or planner, and set reminders accordingly. You can also add any other appointments, tasks, or events you have scheduled for the week.\n\nIf you'd like to add any other regular meetups or events, feel free to let me know and I can help you add them to the schedule outline!",
