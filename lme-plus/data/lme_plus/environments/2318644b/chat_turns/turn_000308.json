Here are some tips to help you keep it safe and showcase it nicely:\n\n**Storage:**\n\n1. **Avoid direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade, glazes to crack, and metal to tarnish. If possible, store your tea set in a room with filtered or indirect sunlight.\n2. **Keep it away from moisture**: Moisture can cause damage to the porcelain, glaze, or metal components. Store your tea set in a dry, well-ventilated area, and avoid basements or attics with high humidity.\n3. **Use a protective case or box**: Store each piece individually in a soft, padded case or box lined with acid-free tissue paper or velvet. This will prevent scratching and chipping.\n4. **Avoid stacking**: Refrain from stacking your tea set pieces on top of each other, as this can cause chipping, cracking, or breakage.\n5. **Consider a climate-controlled environment**: If you live in an area with extreme temperature fluctuations, consider storing your tea set in a climate-controlled environment, such as a temperature- and humidity-controlled storage unit.\n\n**Display:**\n\n1. **Choose a sturdy display case**: Select a display case that is specifically designed for delicate items, with a sturdy base and secure shelves.\n2. **Use risers and stands**: Use risers or stands to create a visually appealing display and prevent the tea set pieces from touching each other.\n3. **Avoid direct contact with wooden surfaces**: Wood can transfer oils and acids to your tea set, so use a barrier, such as a glass or acrylic shelf, to separate the two.\n4. **Keep it dust-free**: Regularly dust your display case and tea set using a soft, dry cloth to prevent the buildup of dust and dirt.\n5. **Consider a glass-fronted case**: A glass-fronted case will protect your tea set from dust and UV light while allowing you to admire it.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Handle with care**: Always handle your tea set pieces with clean, dry hands, and avoid touching the surfaces to prevent oils from your skin from damaging the glaze or metal.\n2. **Clean carefully**: Clean your tea set gently with a soft, dry cloth and a mild soap solution specifically designed for antique ceramics. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials.\n3. **Consider professional conservation**: If your tea set requires restoration or conservation, consult a professional conservator or restorer who specializes in antique ceramics and metalwork.\n4. **Document your tea set**: Keep a record of your tea set's history, including its provenance, maker's marks, and any restoration or conservation work.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to preserve your beautiful antique tea set and showcase it proudly for generations to come.",
