  "content": "Integrating the guidance system of the cardboard drone with the GIS tool can provide comprehensive situational awareness during natural disasters. By using the GIS tool, we can create a detailed map of the affected area, highlighting the areas that are at the highest risk and the locations of important infrastructure such as hospitals, emergency shelters, and evacuation routes.\n\nThe guidance system of the cardboard drone can then be used to fly over the affected area and collect real-time data such as images, videos, and environmental data. This data can be used to update the map created by the GIS tool, allowing first responders and emergency management teams to make informed decisions based on the latest information.\n\nHere is an example code snippet showing how the guidance system of the cardboard drone can be integrated with a GIS tool using Python:\n```python\nimport gis_toolkit # import the GIS tool library\nimport cardboard_drone # import the cardboard drone library\n\n# create a GIS map of the affected area\ngis_map = gis_toolkit.create_map(area='disaster_zone')\n\n# create a cardboard drone instance\ndrone = cardboard_drone.CardboardDrone()\n\n# define a mission plan for the drone to fly over the affected area\nmission_plan = [\n    {'latitude': 12.345, 'longitude': 67.890, 'altitude': 50},\n    {'latitude': 12.346, 'longitude': 67.891, 'altitude': 50},\n    {'latitude': 12.347, 'longitude': 67.892, 'altitude': 50},\n    {'latitude': 12.348, 'longitude': 67.893, 'altitude': 50},\n]\n\n# fly the drone over the affected area and collect real-time data\nfor waypoint in mission_plan:\n    drone.fly_to(waypoint)\n    images = drone.capture_images()\n    videos = drone.capture_videos()\n    environmental_data = drone.capture_environmental_data()\n\n    # update the GIS map with the latest data\n    gis_map.update_map(images, videos, environmental_data)\n\n# display the final GIS map with the latest data\ngis_map.display_map()\n```\nIn this example, the `gis_toolkit` library is used to create a GIS map of the affected area, and the `cardboard_drone` library is used to control the drone's flight and collect real-time data. The `mission_plan` defines a set of waypoints for the drone to fly over, and at each waypoint, the drone captures images, videos, and environmental data which are used to update the GIS map. Finally, the updated GIS map is displayed to provide comprehensive situational awareness during the natural disaster.",
