Then, you draw a picture of what you see from way up in the tree!\n\nLots of people in a community can do this and put their drawings together on a big map. It's a fun way to get to know your community and all the different things you can see from different spots.\n\nPeople can even have competitions to see who can draw the best picture, and they can win awards for their drawings!",
