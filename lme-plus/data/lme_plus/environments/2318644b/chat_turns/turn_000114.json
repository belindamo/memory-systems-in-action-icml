I'm just here to provide information and assist you with your queries!\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to continue discussing cloud storage options for your security camera footage if you'd like. We can explore the free or low-cost services I mentioned earlier, or we can discuss other options that might be suitable for your needs.\n\nPlease let me know how I can further assist you!",
