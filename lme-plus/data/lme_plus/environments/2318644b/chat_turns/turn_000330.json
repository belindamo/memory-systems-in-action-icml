I'm happy to help, but I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have information about Oprah's book club on Apple TV+ because it's a relatively new platform and I'm not trained on real-time data. However, I can provide general information about Oprah's book club and its history.\n\nOprah's Book Club was a highly influential and popular book club founded by Oprah Winfrey in 1996. It was originally featured on her talk show, \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\" and later on her own television network, OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network). The book club was known for its thought-provoking book selections, which often focused on literary fiction, memoirs, and non-fiction works that explored themes of identity, social justice, and personal growth.\n\nThe selection process typically involved Oprah choosing a book that resonated with her, and then featuring the author and book on her show. The discussions were often in-depth and insightful, with Oprah leading the conversation and encouraging readers to share their thoughts and opinions.\n\nIn 2019, Oprah launched a new iteration of her book club on Apple TV+, called \"Oprah's Book Club.\" This new series features Oprah discussing books with authors and thought leaders, as well as exploring the themes and ideas presented in the selected books.\n\nWhile I don't have specific information about the Apple TV+ book club, I can suggest checking out the Apple TV+ website or social media channels for more information on the selection process and discussions.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring Oprah's book club recommendations, you can find lists of her past book club picks online. Her choices often spark important conversations and can be a great way to discover new authors and books.",
