By setting up a price alert, you'll receive notifications when the price of your desired flight drops or reaches a certain threshold.\n\nHere are some additional tips to get the most out of Kayak's price alerts:\n\n1. **Set up multiple alerts**: Create separate alerts for different flight routes, dates, or airlines to cover all your options.\n2. **Be flexible with dates**: If you have flexibility in your travel plans, set up alerts for nearby dates to catch potential price drops.\n3. **Choose the right alert frequency**: Adjust the alert frequency to suit your needs. If you're looking for a specific deal, you might want to receive daily alerts. If you're just keeping an eye on prices, weekly or bi-weekly alerts might be sufficient.\n4. **Monitor multiple airlines**: Don't focus on a single airline; set up alerts for multiple carriers to compare prices and find the best deals.\n5. **Keep an eye on error fares**: Occasionally, airlines or online travel agencies (OTAs) might list error fares, which can be significantly cheaper than usual. These fares are usually corrected quickly, so be prepared to act fast if you spot one.\n6. **Use fare sale alerts**: Many airlines offer fare sale alerts, which can notify you about special promotions or discounts. Sign up for these alerts to stay informed about potential deals.\n7. **Be prepared to book quickly**: When you receive a price alert, be prepared to book quickly, as prices can change rapidly.\n\nBy using Kayak's price alerts effectively, you'll be well on your way to finding the best deals on flights to Rome!\n\nNow, I'm curious \u2013 have you found any good deals on flights to Rome yet?",
