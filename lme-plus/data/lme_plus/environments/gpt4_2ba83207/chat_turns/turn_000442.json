  "content": "Both \"The Good Place\" and \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" are amazing shows!\n\nIf you're mainly using Hulu to keep up with current episodes of these two shows, you might want to consider a few options:\n\n1. **Wait for the seasons to drop on Netflix**: Both \"The Good Place\" and \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" are available on Netflix, although they might not be the current seasons. If you're not in a rush to watch the latest episodes, you could wait until the seasons are added to Netflix.\n2. **Purchase individual episodes or seasons**: You can buy individual episodes or seasons of both shows on platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, or iTunes. This way, you can still access the latest episodes without committing to a Hulu subscription.\n3. **Consider a Hulu ad-supported plan**: If you still want to keep up with current episodes, Hulu's ad-supported plan ($5.99/month) might be a more affordable option. You'll have to watch ads, but it's a cheaper alternative to the ad-free plan.\n4. **Look into other streaming services**: If you're not using Hulu for much else, you might want to explore other streaming services that offer current TV shows. For example, NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service offers a free tier with ads, which includes current episodes of \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\".\n\nBefore making a decision, take a closer look at your Hulu usage and consider the following:\n\n* Are there other shows or content on Hulu that you enjoy or want to watch?\n* How important is it for you to keep up with the latest episodes of \"The Good Place\" and \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\"?\n* Are you willing to wait for the seasons to drop on Netflix or purchase individual episodes/seasons?\n\nBy weighing these factors, you can decide whether to keep your Hulu subscription, adjust your plan, or explore alternative options.",
