However, according to recent news reports:\n\n- Macy's restructuring in early 2020 included closing around 125 stores and cutting 2,000 corporate jobs in an attempt to improve profitability and reposition the company for growth.\n- In February 2021, Macy's announced that it would cut another 3,900 corporate and management jobs and close 45 more stores by 2022 as part of its ongoing cost-cutting effort.\n- Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette said in a recent earnings call that the company's restructuring had helped it reduce expenses and focus on its digital business, which grew by double digits in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n- Macy's reported a 20.2% decline in total revenue for the fiscal year 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic and store closures, but its online sales increased by 21% for the year.\n- Macy's reported better-than-expected earnings and sales in the first quarter of 2021, thanks to strong gains in its e-commerce business and a rebound in demand for apparel and accessories.\n\nOverall, it seems that Macy's restructuring and leadership changes have helped the company cut costs and realign its business for the digital age, which has been crucial during the pandemic. However, it remains to be seen whether Macy's can continue to improve its financial performance in a highly competitive retail environment.",
