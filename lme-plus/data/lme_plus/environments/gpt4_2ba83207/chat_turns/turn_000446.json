  "content": "I'd be happy to help you with meal planning and grocery lists.\n\nFirst, let's talk about meal planning. Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)? Are there any specific cuisines or types of food you enjoy cooking or eating?\n\nAlso, how many meals are you planning to cook for the next week? Would you like me to suggest breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, or just a few dinners?\n\nRegarding Instacart, that's a great service! $60 for a week's worth of groceries from Publix sounds like a reasonable amount. Do you have any staples at home that you'd like to use up, or would you like me to suggest recipes that don't require any specific pantry items?\n\nLet me know, and I can start suggesting some recipes and ingredients for you!",
