  "content": "My boots are brown, knee-high, and have a bit of a heel, so they're dressy but still comfortable. The sweater is a soft, cream-colored one that's a bit oversized. I got them both at Macy's during their Black Friday sale, and I was really happy to snag them at a discount - the boots were originally $150 but I got them for $90, and the sweater was $40 instead of $50. As for my personal style, I'd say it's pretty classic and elegant, but I also like to add some trendy touches here and there. I'm planning to wear these outfits to some casual holiday gatherings with friends and family.",
