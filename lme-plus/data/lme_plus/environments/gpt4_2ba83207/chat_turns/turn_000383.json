  "content": "The section describes Peripheral Paradise, which is the outer part of the central Isle of Paradise. The peripheral surface of Paradise is occupied by the landing and dispatching fields for various groups of spirit personalities, and the Seven Master Spirits have their personal seats of power and authority on the seven spheres of the Spirit that circle around Paradise. There are enormous historic and prophetic exhibit areas assigned to the Creator Sons, dedicated to the local universes of time and space. The area assigned to these activities is at least one million times that actually required for such purposes and Paradise is large enough to accommodate the activities of an almost infinite creation. The author suggests that it is futile to try to visualize the glories of Paradise and that one must wait and ascend while they wait, as the things that the Universal Father has prepared for those who survive the life in the flesh on the worlds of time and space are beyond human comprehension.",
