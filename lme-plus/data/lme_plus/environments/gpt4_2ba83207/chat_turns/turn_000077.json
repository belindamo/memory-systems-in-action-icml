  "content": "To implement this feature, you could follow these general steps:\n\n1. Create a WebSocket server that accepts connections from clients.\n2. When a user connects to the WebSocket server, ask them to select the tags they are interested in.\n3. Store the selected tags for each user in a database or in memory on the server.\n4. Whenever a user selects new tags, update their tags in the database or memory.\n5. When a new user connects, compare their selected tags to the other users' selected tags.\n6. If there is a match between two users' selected tags, create a new WebRTC peer connection between them.\n7. Use the WebRTC peer connection to establish a video chat session between the two users.\n\nHere are some more detailed steps:\n\n1. Create a WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections from clients. You can use a library like Socket.IO or ws to make this process easier.\n2. When a new user connects to the WebSocket server, ask them to select the tags they are interested in. You can send a message to the client with a list of available tags, and ask them to select one or more tags. You can use a simple text-based interface or a more sophisticated UI, depending on your needs.\n3. Store the selected tags for each user in a database or in memory on the server. You can use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL, or you can use an in-memory data structure like a hash table or a tree.\n4. Whenever a user selects new tags, update their tags in the database or memory. You can send a message to the server with the new tags, and the server can update the user's tags in the database or memory.\n5. When a new user connects, compare their selected tags to the other users' selected tags. You can iterate over all the users in the database or memory, and compare the new user's tags to each user's tags. You can use a simple algorithm like Jaccard similarity or cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between the tags.\n6. If there is a match between two users' selected tags, create a new WebRTC peer connection between them. You can use a library like SimpleWebRTC or PeerJS to create the WebRTC connection.\n7. Use the WebRTC peer connection to establish a video chat session between the two users. You can use the WebRTC API to set up the video chat session, including establishing the audio and video streams, and sending messages between the two peers.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a high-level overview, and there are many details that you will need to consider and implement to create a fully functional video chat application with WebSockets and WebRTC.",
