  "content": "Substituting ingredients can be a great way to reduce costs without sacrificing too much flavor or quality. Here are some suggestions:\n\n* **Canned tomatoes instead of fresh:** Absolutely! Canned tomatoes are a great substitute for fresh tomatoes, especially in recipes like the Lentil Soup or the Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake. They're often cheaper and have a longer shelf life. You can use crushed, diced, or whole canned tomatoes, depending on the recipe.\n* **Frozen vegetables:** If you can't find fresh bell peppers or Brussels sprouts at a good price, consider using frozen ones. They're just as nutritious and can be used in a pinch.\n* **Ground turkey or chicken instead of beef:** If you're looking to reduce the cost of ground beef, consider using ground turkey or chicken as a substitute. They're often cheaper and can be used in similar recipes.\n* **Shredded cheese instead of mozzarella:** If you already have shredded cheese at home, you can use it as a substitute for mozzarella in the Creamy Tomato Pasta Bake. It might not melt as well, but it'll still be delicious.\n* **Omitting the balsamic glaze:** If you don't have balsamic glaze or don't want to spend money on it, you can omit it from the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and Roasted Vegetables recipe. The dish will still be flavorful with just the balsamic vinegar and honey.\n\nBy making these substitutions, you can reduce your total cost to around $60-$75, depending on the specific ingredients you choose. Keep in mind that you might need to adjust the recipes slightly to accommodate the substitutions.\n\nRemember, the key to reducing costs is to be flexible with your ingredients and recipes. Don't be afraid to experiment and find cheaper alternatives that still deliver great flavor and quality.",
