However, I have to clarify that there is no theme park called \"Thrill Kingdom.\" It's possible that you may be thinking of a different park, or perhaps it's a fictional park?\n\nIf you could provide more information or clarify which park you're actually planning to visit, I'd be happy to try and assist you with your question about the park's operating hours.\n\nAlso, I'm curious - if you didn't visit Thrill Kingdom last month, which park did you actually visit for the behind-the-scenes tour on October 16th? I'm here to help and provide information to the best of my abilities!",
