For the target audience, I'm focusing on small to medium-sized businesses in the local area who need marketing guidance. They're likely busy entrepreneurs who want to grow their business but don't have the expertise or resources to handle marketing in-house. In terms of tone and voice, I want to come across as friendly, approachable, and knowledgeable. Can you suggest some specific content ideas for the educational and behind-the-scenes categories that would resonate with this audience?",
