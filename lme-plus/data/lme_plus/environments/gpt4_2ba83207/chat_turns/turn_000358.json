The one I saw was still pretty new, and we got to see the control room and learn about how they operate the rides, which was really cool. Anyway, I'm still trying to figure out the operating hours of a typical theme park. You mentioned earlier that they usually open between 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and close between 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. Are the hours usually the same on weekends and weekdays?",
