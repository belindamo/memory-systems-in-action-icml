Here are a few options:\n\n1. **The Rumpus Book Club**: This club focuses on books that explore different cultures, identities, and experiences.\n2. **The Culture Trip Book Club**: As the name suggests, this club features books that celebrate cultural diversity and exploration.\n3. **The Literary Guild**: This club offers a wide range of fiction and non-fiction books, including titles that explore cultural heritage and travel.\n\nYou could also consider a subscription to a service like **Book of the Month**, which often features debut authors and books that explore diverse perspectives.\n\nNow, let's talk about the literary walking tour in Paris! What a fantastic idea! Paris is a city steeped in literary history, and a guided tour would be an unforgettable experience for your friend. You can book a tour that focuses on famous authors like Hemingway, Fitzgerald, or Joyce, or explore the city's literary landmarks like Shakespeare and Company bookstore or the Luxembourg Gardens.\n\nTo make it an even more special experience, you could consider adding a few extras, such as:\n\n* A private guide or small group tour to ensure a more personalized experience\n* A stop at a charming caf\u00e9 or bistro for coffee or lunch\n* A visit to a local bookstore or market to explore French literature and culture\n* A souvenir book or journal to commemorate the experience\n\nWhat do you think? Should we start looking into specific tour operators and book clubs to make this gift a reality?",
