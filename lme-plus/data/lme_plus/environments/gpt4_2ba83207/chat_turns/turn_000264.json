  "content": "The `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is used to specify the path to the JSON key file for the Google DNS API. It is necessary for the Certbot command to authenticate with the Google DNS API and obtain or renew the TLS certificates.\n\nRegarding the cron job, you can add the following line to the `renew-cert.sh` script to schedule the renewal to run at 3:15 am every day:\n```javascript\n15 3 * * * /path/to/renew-cert.sh >> /var/log/certbot-renew.log 2>&1\n```\nThis line should be added at the end of the script, before the `EOF` line, and it will write the output to `/var/log/certbot-renew.log`. Make sure to replace `/path/to/renew-cert.sh` with the actual path to the script on your server.\n\nNote that in order to set up the cron job, you will need to make the script executable by running `chmod +x /path/to/renew-cert.sh`, and then add the above line to the crontab file by running `crontab -e`.",
