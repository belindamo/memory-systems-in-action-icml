  "content": "You're thinking like a detective! That's a fantastic idea! Most theme parks have official websites and social media pages where they post updates about operating hours, special events, new attractions, and behind-the-scenes insights.\n\nIf you're still unable to recall the name of the park, you could try searching for theme parks in your local area and checking their websites and social media pages to see if they match your memories. You might stumble upon a park that has a coaster called \"Storm Chaser\" or has a similar behind-the-scenes tour experience.\n\nAdditionally, you could also try searching for keywords like \"theme parks near me\" or \"amusement parks in [your city/state]\" to find a list of parks in your area. Then, you can visit their websites and social media pages to see if any of them seem familiar.\n\nRemember, theme parks often post updates about special events, closures, and new attractions on their social media pages, so it's possible that you might find some clues about the park you're thinking of. Good luck, and I hope you're able to figure out which park you visited!",
