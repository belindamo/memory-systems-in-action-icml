  "content": "Yes, there are several examples of AI being used in robotic surgery currently. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci surgical system: This robotic surgery system uses AI to provide real-time data analysis and feedback to surgeons during procedures. The system's advanced imaging technology and AI algorithms help surgeons to make more precise and accurate movements during surgery.\n\n2. Stryker's Mako robotic-arm assisted surgery system: This system uses AI to plan and execute joint replacement surgeries. The system's AI algorithms analyze preoperative imaging data to help the surgeon determine the optimal implant positioning and size, as well as the most appropriate surgical approach.\n\n3. Johnson & Johnson's Verb Surgical platform: This platform is being developed with the goal of using AI to help surgeons plan and execute complex surgical procedures. The platform's AI algorithms will analyze large amounts of data from a variety of sources, including preoperative imaging, patient history, and even video feeds from the surgical site, to help surgeons make more informed decisions during surgery.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many other companies and organizations working on developing AI-enabled robotic surgery systems.",
