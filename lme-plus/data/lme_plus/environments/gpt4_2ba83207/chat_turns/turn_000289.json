I'll also use the \"Sweet Pea\" scented candles and massage oil to complement the gift set I got her. By the way, I think she also loved the cashmere scarf I got her for $70 during the holiday season. Do you have any recommendations for a healthy snack or drink that I can offer her during the spa day?",
