  "content": "Macy's digital transformation initiatives have been successful in both attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. Here are some insights to support this:\n\n1. Attracting new customers: Macy's digital initiatives have helped the company reach a younger, more tech-savvy audience that prefers to shop online. According to Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette, the company's digital sales grew by 45% among new customers in the fourth quarter of 2020. Macy's digital growth has also been driven by increased traffic to its website and mobile app, which has led to higher conversion rates and sales.\n\n2. Retaining existing customers: Macy's focus on enhancing its online business and omnichannel capabilities has helped the company retain existing customers who have shifted their shopping preferences to e-commerce during the pandemic. Macy's BOPIS service, for example, has been particularly popular among customers who wish to avoid in-store shopping due to safety concerns. Macy's loyalty program, which offers free shipping, exclusive discounts, and other perks to members, has also been effective in retaining existing customers.\n\nOverall, Macy's digital transformation initiatives have helped the company adapt to the changing retail landscape and attract new customers while retaining existing ones. By enhancing its online business and omnichannel capabilities, Macy's has positioned itself for long-term growth and success in a highly competitive retail environment.",
