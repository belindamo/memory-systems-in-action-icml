Congrats on the new figurine, by the way!\n\nCollectify is an excellent choice, and it can definitely be used to track comic book collections, including your Walking Dead issues. While it's a more general collectibles app, it has a robust feature set that can accommodate comic book collections.\n\nHere are some reasons why Collectify can work well for tracking your comic book collection:\n\n1. **Customizable fields**: Collectify allows you to create custom fields to track specific details about your comics, such as issue number, publication date, condition, grade, and more.\n2. **Barcode scanning**: You can use the app's barcode scanner to quickly add comics to your collection, making it easy to catalog your Walking Dead issues.\n3. **Image storage**: Collectify allows you to add images of your comics, which is perfect for showcasing your collection and keeping track of the condition of each issue.\n4. **Wishlist**: You can create a wishlist of comics you're looking to acquire, making it easy to keep track of the issues you're missing.\n5. **Valuation tracking**: Collectify allows you to track the value of your comics, which is useful for insurance purposes or if you decide to sell your collection in the future.\n\nTo make the most of Collectify for your comic book collection, you might consider creating custom folders or categories for different series, such as \"The Walking Dead\" or \"Marvel Comics.\" You can also use the app's note-taking feature to record any additional information about each issue, like its condition, signature, or other unique features.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more comic book-specific features, you might also consider checking out ComicConnect or CGC Census, which I mentioned earlier. These platforms are specifically designed for comic book collectors and offer more specialized features, such as comic book grading and certification tracking.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a more general collectibles app that can handle multiple types of items, Collectify is an excellent choice. Its flexibility and customization options make it a great fit for tracking various collectibles, including comic books.",
