I'm starting from scratch with each response.\n\nHowever, if you'd like to share more about the litter mat you got for Luna, I'd be happy to help you explore whether a pet bed with a similar design or material could work well for her. Please feel free to share more details, and I'll do my best to provide helpful advice!",
