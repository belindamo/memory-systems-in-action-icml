Here are some specific initiatives that Macy's has implemented to improve its digital business:\n\n1. Enhanced website: Macy's has improved its website design and functionality to provide a better user experience, including faster load times, easier navigation, and more personalized recommendations.\n\n2. Mobile app: Macy's has a mobile app that allows customers to shop, track orders, and access coupons and rewards. The app has been updated with new features such as visual search, augmented reality, and scan-and-shop capabilities.\n\n3. Buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS): Macy's has expanded its BOPIS service to more stores to meet the growing demand for contactless shopping options. Customers can place an order online and pick it up at a nearby store, often within the same day.\n\n4. Virtual shopping tools: Macy's has introduced virtual shopping tools, such as virtual try-on and styling services, to help customers make informed purchasing decisions and improve their overall shopping experience.\n\n5. Enhanced omnichannel capabilities: Macy's has integrated its online and offline sales channels to create a seamless shopping experience for customers. For example, customers can return online purchases at a physical store or use their loyalty rewards both online and in-store.\n\nThese initiatives have helped Macy's grow its online business and reach new customers. Macy's reported that its digital sales increased by double digits in the fourth quarter of 2020, and online sales accounted for 44% of its total net sales in the same period.",
