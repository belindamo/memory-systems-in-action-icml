I'd be happy to help you find a good webcam that's compatible with OBS Studio.\n\nFirstly, I have to clarify that you mentioned going live on Instagram, but Instagram doesn't support live streaming with external cameras or software like OBS Studio. Instagram Live is a native feature that uses your mobile device's camera. Perhaps you meant to say you went live on YouTube or another platform?\n\nNow, about the webcam for your YouTube live stream with OBS Studio:\n\nHere are some factors to consider when choosing a webcam:\n\n1. **Resolution**: Look for a webcam that can capture at least 720p (HD) or 1080p (Full HD) video.\n2. **Frame Rate**: A higher frame rate (e.g., 60fps) will provide a smoother video experience.\n3. **Field of View**: If you plan to have multiple people in the frame or want to show your surroundings, look for a webcam with a wider field of view (e.g., 90\u00b0 or more).\n4. **Low Light Performance**: If you'll be streaming in a dimly lit environment, look for a webcam with good low-light performance.\n\nBased on these factors, here are some popular webcam options compatible with OBS Studio:\n\n1. **Logitech C920**: A popular and affordable option with 1080p resolution, 30fps, and a 78\u00b0 field of view.\n2. **Razer Kiyo**: A high-end webcam with 720p resolution, 60fps, and a 60\u00b0 field of view. It also has a built-in ring light and supports HDR.\n3. **Elgato Cam Link 4K**: A 4K-capable webcam with a 60\u00b0 field of view and support for 60fps at 1080p.\n4. **Anker PowerConf C200**: A budget-friendly option with 1080p resolution, 30fps, and a 65\u00b0 field of view.\n\nAll of these webcams are plug-and-play with OBS Studio, and you can easily set them up by selecting them as your video input device within the software.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I recommend checking reviews and comparing prices to find the best fit for your budget and specific needs.\n\nGood luck with your live stream, and I hope this helps!",
