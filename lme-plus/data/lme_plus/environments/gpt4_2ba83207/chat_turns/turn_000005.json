It's a thoughtful and meaningful present that shows you care.\n\nHere's a rough guideline:\n\n* For close family members (siblings, parents, children): $50-$100+\n* For close friends: $20-$50\n* For acquaintances or coworkers: $10-$20\n\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and the right price depends on your individual circumstances.\n\nNow, back to your friend's birthday gift! Combining the personalized book club subscription and literary walking tour ideas could be an amazing way to celebrate her special day. How about we brainstorm some more to make it an unforgettable gift?\n\nDo you have any specific ideas or preferences for the book club subscription (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, genre-specific)? And which city or destination would you like to focus on for the literary walking tour?",
