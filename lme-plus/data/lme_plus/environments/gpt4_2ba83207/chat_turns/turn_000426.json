Keep in mind that layovers can add to your overall travel time, but they can also provide a break and a chance to stretch your legs.\n\nAs before, I recommend checking the airlines' websites or a meta-search engine like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak to find the best options for your specific travel dates. Additionally, consider the layover duration and the airport facilities when making your decision.\n\nDo any of these options appeal to you, or would you like me to explore more possibilities?",
