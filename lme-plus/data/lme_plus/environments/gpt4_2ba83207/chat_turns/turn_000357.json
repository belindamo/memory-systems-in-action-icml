  "content": "\"Storm Chaser\" does sound like a plausible name for a roller coaster, and it's definitely a type of ride that can be found in many theme parks! However, I couldn't find any information about a specific coaster called \"Storm Chaser\" at a theme park called \"Thrill Kingdom\".\n\nThat being said, there is a roller coaster called \"Storm Chaser\" located at Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky. It's a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel elements, featuring a 100-foot drop, multiple inversions, and a top speed of 60 mph. Could this be the coaster you're thinking of?\n\nIf this isn't the coaster you're thinking of, please let me know if you remember any other details about the ride or the park. I'm happy to try and help you figure out which park you actually visited!",
