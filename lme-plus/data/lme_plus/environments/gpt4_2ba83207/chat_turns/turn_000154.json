  "content": "I think I'll focus on tracking views, engagement, watch time, and drop-off points to start. These metrics will give me a good idea of how well my video is resonating with my audience and where I can improve.\n\nFor engagement, I'll make sure to ask questions or encourage viewers to share their thoughts in the comments. This will help me understand what they're taking away from the video and what they'd like to learn more about.\n\nI'll also make sure to include a clear call-to-action (CTA) at the end of the video, such as visiting my website or signing up for a free consultation. This will help me track the conversion rate and see how many viewers are taking action.\n\nThanks for your help in outlining the key points for my \"What is SEO?\" video and providing guidance on how to measure its success. I feel more confident now in creating a valuable and engaging video for my target audience.",
