While my previous response provided a general idea of typical operating hours, it's not uncommon for parks to have different hours on weekends and weekdays.\n\nUsually, theme parks tend to have longer hours on weekends and during peak seasons (summer, holidays, and school breaks) to accommodate more visitors. On weekdays, especially during off-peak seasons, parks might have shorter hours or even be closed certain days of the week.\n\nHere's a rough idea of what you might expect:\n\n* Weekdays (Monday to Thursday): 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM or 7:00 PM\n* Weekends (Friday to Sunday): 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM or 10:00 PM\n* Peak seasons (summer, holidays, and school breaks): 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM or 11:00 PM\n* Off-peak seasons (weekdays during school months): 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM or 6:00 PM\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates, and the actual operating hours can vary significantly from park to park. It's always best to check the park's website, social media, or contact them directly to confirm their operating hours before planning your visit.\n\nIf you're still unsure about the park you're thinking of, feel free to ask more questions or share any other details you remember.
