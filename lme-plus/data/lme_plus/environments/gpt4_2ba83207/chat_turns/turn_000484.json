PLease ask for specific information if needed.\nThe setting for the next chapter is the 3 of them back at Elenas and C's place. C is preparing a spicy tea for all of them while Elena and Alex are lying on the big bed. They also got a vaping pen that they are passing around. All of them are somewhat exhausted, but C is trying to keep everything up and also not let the others know and stays focussed on caring for them. \nFocus on a warm tone, especially between Elena and C. Alex starts slipping back into darker states of mind while C tries to counteract that. Consider their inner dialogue",
