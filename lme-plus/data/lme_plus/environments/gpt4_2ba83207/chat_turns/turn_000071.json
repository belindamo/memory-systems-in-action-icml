  "content": "I've been doing a lot of cycling lately, and I'm glad I've been working on my flexibility and injury prevention through yoga. By the way, I played in a recreational soccer league game on March 5th, where our team won 3-1 against our arch-rivals, and I scored a goal in the 65th minute. Anyway, back to yoga - do you have any recommendations for yoga props or equipment that can help with flexibility and injury prevention for cyclists?",
