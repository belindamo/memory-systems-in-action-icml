  "content": "This section of the Urantia Papers describes Nether Paradise, which is the underside of the central Isle of Paradise. Personalities do not sojourn there and it has nothing to do with the affairs of spirit intelligences. The section explains that all physical-energy and cosmic-force circuits have their origin on nether Paradise and it is divided into three concentric elliptical zones. The innermost zone is the focal point of the force-energy activities of Paradise itself, the outermost may possibly be identified with the functions of the Unqualified Absolute, but it's not certain concerning the space functions of the mid-zone. The mid-zone appears to be static except that it expands and contracts through three cycles of activity. The function of this mid-area has never been really identified, but it's believed that it has something to do with reciprocal adjustment between the inner and the outer zones of the force center. The outer zone is the largest and most active of the three concentric and elliptical belts of unidentified space potential. It's the site of unimagined activities, the central circuit point of emanations which proceed spaceward in every direction to the outermost borders of the seven superuniverses and beyond. This space presence is entirely impersonal and it appears to be indirectly responsive to the will and mandates of the infinite Deities when acting as the Trinity.",
