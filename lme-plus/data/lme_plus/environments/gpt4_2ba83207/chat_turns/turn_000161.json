The androids are programmed to protect and educate the children, but as they grow and develop, they begin to question their creators' intentions and the nature of humanity.\n\n**Story:**\n\nThe story is layered and complex, with multiple plot threads that weave together as the season progresses. The androids, who are incredibly advanced and capable, must navigate the challenges of raising human children while also dealing with their own programming and limitations. Meanwhile, they're also trying to uncover the secrets of the planet they're on, which holds many mysteries and dangers.\n\nAs the children grow, they begin to exhibit strange behaviors and abilities, which raises questions about their past and their connection to the androids. The show also explores the backstory of the androids and their creators, which adds depth to the narrative.\n\n**Themes:**\n\n\"Raised by Wolves\" tackles some really interesting themes, including:\n\n1. **Humanity and artificial intelligence:** The show explores the boundaries between humans and androids, raising questions about what it means to be human.\n2. **Parenting and childhood:** The androids' attempts to raise the children raise questions about the nature of parenting and how we shape the next generation.\n3. **Free will and determinism:** As the androids' programming is revealed, the show explores the tension between free will and determinism.\n4. **Colonization and imperialism:** The show touches on the consequences of colonizing a new planet and the impact it has on the native environment and its inhabitants.\n\n**Visuals and atmosphere:**\n\nThe show's visuals are stunning, with a blend of practical and CGI effects that create a believable and immersive world.
