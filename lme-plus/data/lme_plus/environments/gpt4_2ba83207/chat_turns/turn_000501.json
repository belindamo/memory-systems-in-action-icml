  "content": "When listing a figurine, it's essential to provide a detailed description of both the figurine itself and the packaging, especially if the packaging is still in good condition. Here's why:\n\n**Why mention the packaging condition:**\n\n1. **Collector appeal**: Many collectors prioritize the condition of the packaging, especially if it's a rare or hard-to-find item. Even if the figurine is in perfect condition, a damaged or worn-out box can significantly impact the overall value.\n2. **Authenticity**: The packaging can serve as proof of authenticity, especially if it includes a unique serial number, hologram, or other security features.\n3. **Resale value**: If the buyer intends to resell the figurine in the future, the condition of the packaging can affect its resale value.\n\n**What to mention about the packaging:**\n\n1. **Condition**: Describe the condition of the box, including any damage, creases, tears, or wear.\n2. **Seal**: Mention if the packaging is still sealed or if it's been opened.\n3. **Inclusions**: List any included items, such as instructions, stickers, or bonus materials.\n4. **Original packaging**: Specify if the packaging is the original one that came with the figurine or if it's a replacement.\n\n**Balance between figurine and packaging details:**\n\nWhile it's essential to provide details about the packaging, don't forget to focus on the figurine itself. Make sure to include:\n\n1. **Figurine condition**: Describe the condition of the figurine, including any paint chips, scratches, or other flaws.\n2. **Figurine details**: Mention any unique features, such as articulation, accessories, or special effects.\n3. **Figurine size and material**: Provide the figurine's size and material, as this can be important to collectors.\n\nWhen writing your listing, aim for a balance between providing detailed information about the figurine and the packaging. You can dedicate a section to the figurine itself and another section to the packaging. This will help potential buyers make an informed decision and appreciate the value of your item.\n\nIn your case, since you have duplicates of Light Yagami from Death Note, you may want to highlight the condition of the packaging, especially if it's still sealed or in excellent condition. This can be a selling point for collectors who are looking for a mint-condition figurine with original packaging.",
