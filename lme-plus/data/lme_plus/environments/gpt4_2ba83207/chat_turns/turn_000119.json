However, Macy's has been actively experimenting with new technologies and features to improve the customer experience and stay ahead of the competition. Here are some recent virtual shopping tools that Macy's has introduced:\n\n1. \"Macy's Star Rewards AR Experience\": Macy's has launched an augmented reality (AR) experience in its mobile app that lets customers scan product barcodes and unlock digital surprises, such as bonus reward points, instant win games, and exclusive offers. The AR experience uses gamification to engage customers and make shopping more fun and rewarding.\n\n2. Personalized product recommendations: Macy's has introduced an AI-powered tool called \"Product Matchmaker\" that suggests products based on customers' personal preferences and past purchases. The tool uses a recommendation engine to analyze customer data and provide personalized product suggestions that are relevant and timely.\n\n3. Style inspiration: Macy's has partnered with fashion influencers and stylists to create curated collections and outfit ideas that customers can browse and shop online. The company has also launched a virtual styling service called \"Macy's Style Crew\" that lets customers book one-on-one appointments with professional stylists and get personalized fashion advice.\n\nBased on these recent initiatives, it's clear that Macy's is committed to expanding its virtual shopping tools and using technology to enhance the customer experience.
