  "content": "While both warranty and guarantee are often used interchangeably, there is a slight difference in their meaning. A warranty is a promise from the manufacturer or seller that the product will be free from defects for a certain period of time. A guarantee, on the other hand, is a promise that the manufacturer or seller will provide a remedy if the product fails to meet certain performance standards.\n\nTherefore, it is perfectly acceptable to mention both warranty and guarantee in your statement. By doing so, you are assuring your customers that you stand behind the quality of your products and are willing to address any issues that may arise.",
