  "content": "That's a great decision! Downgrading to the ad-supported plan can help you save some money, and if you're only using Hulu for those two shows, it's a good way to minimize your costs.\n\nThe ad-supported plan is a great option for casual viewers who don't mind watching ads in exchange for a lower monthly price. You'll still get access to the latest episodes of \"The Good Place\" and \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\", and you can always upgrade to an ad-free plan if you find that you're using Hulu more frequently or want to access additional features.\n\nBy downgrading, you'll be saving some money each month, which you can use towards other streaming services, rent or buy individual episodes/seasons of other shows, or simply keep in your pocket.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding the right balance between the streaming services you use and your budget. You're making a smart decision by optimizing your streaming setup to fit your viewing habits!\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask. Otherwise, enjoy your ad-supported Hulu plan and happy streaming!",
