  "content": "Yes, the filmmakers of Shrek carefully chose popular songs to both fit the overall mood and tone of the movie, and also to help further develop the characters and storyline. For example, the opening song, \"All Star\" by Smash Mouth, helps to establish Shrek's character as an outsider who is content to live his life in solitude. The song \"Hallelujah\" by Leonard Cohen is used later in the film during a montage depicting Shrek and Fiona's growing relationship, helping to emotionally connect the audience to their story. And the song \"I'm a Believer\" by The Monkees is played during the film's final scene and end credits, providing a fun and uplifting conclusion to the story. The use of popular songs not only helped to make the movie more relatable for audiences, but also added an additional layer of meaning and emotional resonance to the film.",
