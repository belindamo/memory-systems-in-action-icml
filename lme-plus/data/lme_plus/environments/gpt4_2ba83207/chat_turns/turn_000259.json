Here are a few more examples of horror movies that use silence effectively:\n\n1. \"The Babadook\" (2014) - This movie uses silence to create tension and uncertainty in many of its scenes. The sound design is minimalistic but extremely effective, with long moments of silence that keep the viewer on edge.\n\n2. \"It Follows\" (2014) - This movie features a haunting electronic score that is often accompanied by moments of complete silence, enhancing the film's eerie atmosphere.\n\n3. \"Hush\" (2016) - This movie follows a deaf writer who must fight off a masked intruder in her secluded home. As a result, the movie relies heavily on silence to create tension and emphasize the protagonist's disability.\n\n4. \"Don't Breathe\" (2016) - This movie is about a group of burglars who break into the home of a blind man, only to find themselves trapped and hunted. The film's sound design is particularly impressive, with moments of complete silence punctuated by sudden and jarring sounds.\n\nAll of these movies use silence in unique and effective ways to generate fear and tension in the viewer. I hope this gives you some ideas for your next horror movie night!",
