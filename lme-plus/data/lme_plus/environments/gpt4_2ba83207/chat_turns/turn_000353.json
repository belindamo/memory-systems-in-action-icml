  "content": "I apologize again, but I think there might be some confusion. As I mentioned earlier, there is no theme park called \"Thrill Kingdom\" that I'm aware of. It's possible that you might be thinking of a different park, or perhaps it's a fictional park?\n\nIf you could provide more information or clarify which park you're actually planning to visit, I'd be happy to try and assist you with your question about the park's operating hours. Alternatively, you can try checking the park's website or social media pages to find the most up-to-date information on their operating hours.\n\nRegarding the behind-the-scenes tour, I'm glad you had a great experience! However, if it wasn't Thrill Kingdom, which park did you actually visit?\n\nTypical theme park operating hours can vary depending on the park, day of the week, and time of year. However, most theme parks usually open between 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and close between 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. But again, it's best to check the specific park's website or contact them directly for the most accurate information.",
