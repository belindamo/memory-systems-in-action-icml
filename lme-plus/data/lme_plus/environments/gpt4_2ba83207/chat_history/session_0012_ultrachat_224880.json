However, according to recent news reports:\n\n- Macy's restructuring in early 2020 included closing around 125 stores and cutting 2,000 corporate jobs in an attempt to improve profitability and reposition the company for growth.\n- In February 2021, Macy's announced that it would cut another 3,900 corporate and management jobs and close 45 more stores by 2022 as part of its ongoing cost-cutting effort.\n- Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette said in a recent earnings call that the company's restructuring had helped it reduce expenses and focus on its digital business, which grew by double digits in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n- Macy's reported a 20.2% decline in total revenue for the fiscal year 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic and store closures, but its online sales increased by 21% for the year.\n- Macy's reported better-than-expected earnings and sales in the first quarter of 2021, thanks to strong gains in its e-commerce business and a rebound in demand for apparel and accessories.\n\nOverall, it seems that Macy's restructuring and leadership changes have helped the company cut costs and realign its business for the digital age, which has been crucial during the pandemic. However, it remains to be seen whether Macy's can continue to improve its financial performance in a highly competitive retail environment."

      "content": "Macy's digital transformation initiatives have been successful in both attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. Here are some insights to support this:\n\n1. Attracting new customers: Macy's digital initiatives have helped the company reach a younger, more tech-savvy audience that prefers to shop online. According to Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette, the company's digital sales grew by 45% among new customers in the fourth quarter of 2020. Macy's digital growth has also been driven by increased traffic to its website and mobile app, which has led to higher conversion rates and sales.\n\n2. Retaining existing customers: Macy's focus on enhancing its online business and omnichannel capabilities has helped the company retain existing customers who have shifted their shopping preferences to e-commerce during the pandemic. Macy's BOPIS service, for example, has been particularly popular among customers who wish to avoid in-store shopping due to safety concerns. Macy's loyalty program, which offers free shipping, exclusive discounts, and other perks to members, has also been effective in retaining existing customers.\n\nOverall, Macy's digital transformation initiatives have helped the company adapt to the changing retail landscape and attract new customers while retaining existing ones. By enhancing its online business and omnichannel capabilities, Macy's has positioned itself for long-term growth and success in a highly competitive retail environment."
