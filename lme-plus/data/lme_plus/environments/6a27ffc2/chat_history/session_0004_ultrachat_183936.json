Some of the most notable players include Shaquille O'Neal, Dwight Howard, Tracy McGrady, and Penny Hardaway, who were all selected for multiple NBA All-Star Games during their time with the team. Dwight Howard, in particular, had some outstanding statistics during his time with the team. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year three times, led the league in rebounds per game five times, and was selected to the All-NBA First Team five times. Additionally, Tracy McGrady led the league in scoring for two consecutive seasons and was selected to the All-NBA First Team twice while playing for the Magic.
