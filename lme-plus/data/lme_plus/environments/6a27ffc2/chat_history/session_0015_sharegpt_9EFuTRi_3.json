      "content": "LLCs (Limited Liability Companies) can act on behalf of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and provide them with a separate legal identity to manage the DAO's affairs and protect the members from personal liability. This can be done through the use of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) that attach an LLC to a DAO treasury or multi-sig. The creation of an LLC does not centralize the membership of a DAO but simply provides a legal identity to the DAO.\n\nOpening a bank account for an LLC and handling taxes can be done through the LexDAO Clinic or by filling out a form online. The KALI team handles the maintenance of the Wrappr LLC writings and annual State franchise tax.\n\nInvestors can purchase shares in the LLC but should respect local law and regulations. Automated investor onboarding processes are available through the Wrappr application in partnership with kycDAO. KALI provides open-source legal forms for self-certification of investors in private sales. If the sale is public, taking advantage of the Wrappr whitelisted minting and transfers is recommended."
