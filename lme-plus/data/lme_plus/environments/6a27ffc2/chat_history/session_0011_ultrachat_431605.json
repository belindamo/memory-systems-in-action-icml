      "content": "I do not have access to current data and statistics. however, i can provide an analysis of how kobe bryant's retirement may have affected the los angeles lakers' performance in the past.\n\nkobe bryant retired from the nba after the 2015-2016 season, and his absence was a significant blow to the lakers. kobe was a five-time nba champion and one of the most dominant players of his time. during his 20-year career, he became the face of the lakers, leading them to numerous playoff appearances and championships.\n\nafter kobe's retirement, the lakers struggled to find a new identity. they had relied on kobe for so long that they didn't have a clear way forward. the team saw several struggles in the post-kobe era, with the lakers finishing with a 26-56 record in their first season without him.\n\nhowever, in recent years, the lakers have rebounded and have found success with new leadership. the arrival of lebron james and anthony davis has brought new life to the team, and they have since won the 2020 nba championship.\n\noverall, although kobe's retirement was a significant event for the lakers, they have been able to move forward and find success with new leadership in recent years."
