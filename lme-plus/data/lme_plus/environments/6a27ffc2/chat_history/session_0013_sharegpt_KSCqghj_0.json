      "content": "Please summarize this abstract in 1 sentence: At Rutgers University's New Brunswick campus, an environmental scan revealed the need for a more focused approach on sustaining partnerships, pedagogical approaches, implementation of teaching technology, and assessment. This necessitated increased cooperation and communication among library faculty located at various campus libraries regarding participating in the information literacy instruction program. Therefore, a TeachMeet series was developed for sharing expertise, providing input on instruction and assessment techniques for undergraduate students, and for fostering more teamwork among librarians.\n\nThe CIPP Evaluation Model was employed to determine the impact of the TeachMeets. It revealed an effective, impactful, and sustainable vehicle for communication and thereby for enhancing an instruction program. TeachMeets reached unexpected constituents and the term has now become common at the libraries, conveying the notion of professional development. This type of gathering allows for a wide range of topics, engages varied groups, and is adaptable to different types of academic libraries."

      "content": "Rutgers University found that their librarians needed to work together more closely to improve the way they teach students about finding and using information. To do this, they created a series of meetings called TeachMeets, where librarians could share their ideas and expertise. These meetings were successful and helped improve the instruction program. They also reached more people than expected and became known as a way for librarians to develop professionally. TeachMeets cover many topics and are useful for different types of libraries."
