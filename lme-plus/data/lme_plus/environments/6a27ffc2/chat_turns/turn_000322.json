  "content": "Functional Specification: Specific Task Management and Annotation Tool\n\nGoals:\n\n1. To provide a user-friendly and efficient interface for task management and document annotation.\n2. To enable administrators to create, manage and monitor tasks and their progress.\n3. To enable taggers to annotate and tag documents efficiently and accurately.\n4. To enable checkers to review and verify the annotations made by taggers.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. Task Management: The task management screen provides a comprehensive view of all tasks assigned to the system. The administrator can create a new task, edit existing tasks, and assign tasks to taggers and checkers.\n2. Document List: The document list displays all the documents assigned to a specific task. The list includes information such as the document name, assigned tagger, assigned checker, due date, and description.\n3. Progress Bar: A progress bar provides a visual representation of the progress made on each task. The bar displays the percentage of documents that have been tagged and verified.\n4. Status Change: Administrators can change the status of a task from \"Not Started\" to \"In Progress\" once the task has been assigned to a tagger. Tagging will then begin, and the status will change to \"Ready for Review\" once the tagging is completed. The checker can then review the annotations and change the status to \"In Review.\" If the annotations are verified, the status will change to \"Complete.\" If the annotations require further revisions, the status will change to \"Rejected.\"\n5. Task Description: The task description provides a brief overview of the task and its requirements.\n6. Annotation Tool: The annotation tool enables taggers to efficiently annotate and tag documents. The tool includes features such as text highlighting, entity recognition, and relationship extraction.\n7. Review and Verification: The checker can review the annotations made by the tagger and verify the accuracy of the annotations. The checker can also reject annotations that are incorrect or need further revisions.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n1. Admin wants to view the progress of the task:\na. Admin logs in to the system.\nb.
