  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot recommend attorneys who can help you with the expungement process for free, but there are some organizations that provide free or low-cost legal assistance to individuals who cannot afford to hire an attorney. Here are a few resources you can explore:\n\n1. Legal Aid Society: This non-profit organization provides free legal assistance to low-income individuals who cannot afford an attorney. They may be able to help you with the expungement process.\n\n2. State Bar Association: Many state bar associations offer pro bono (free) legal services to individuals who cannot afford to hire an attorney. You can contact your state bar association to find out if they have a pro bono program.\n\n3. National HIRE Network: This organization provides legal assistance to individuals with criminal records who are seeking employment. They may be able to help you with the expungement process or refer you to an attorney who can provide free or low-cost legal assistance.\n\nBear in mind that free legal assistance may be limited and may not cover the entire expungement process, but it's always worth checking whether these organizations can help you.",
