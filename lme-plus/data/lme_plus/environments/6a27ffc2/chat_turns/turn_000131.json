  "content": "Please rewrite this at a 10th-grade reading level: At Rutgers University's New Brunswick campus, an environmental scan revealed the need for a more focused approach on sustaining partnerships, pedagogical approaches, implementation of teaching technology, and assessment. This necessitated increased cooperation and communication among library faculty located at various campus libraries regarding participating in the information literacy instruction program. Therefore, a TeachMeet series was developed for sharing expertise, providing input on instruction and assessment techniques for undergraduate students, and for fostering more teamwork among librarians.\n\nThe CIPP Evaluation Model was employed to determine the impact of the TeachMeets. It revealed an effective, impactful, and sustainable vehicle for communication and thereby for enhancing an instruction program. TeachMeets reached unexpected constituents and the term has now become common at the libraries, conveying the notion of professional development. This type of gathering allows for a wide range of topics, engages varied groups, and is adaptable to different types of academic libraries.",
