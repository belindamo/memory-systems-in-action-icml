The Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens is an excellent choice for portrait photography, and paired with your Nikon D850, you have a powerful combination. Here are some tips and resources to help you get the most out of your gear:\n\n**Lens Characteristics**\n\nBefore we dive into tips, it's essential to understand the characteristics of your lens:\n\n* The 24-70mm focal length range is versatile for portraits, offering a wide angle for environmental portraits and a telephoto end for more intimate, compressed shots.\n* The f/2.8 aperture provides a shallow depth of field, which is ideal for separating your subject from the background.\n* Optical Stabilization (OS) helps reduce camera shake and blur caused by hand movement or low light conditions.\n* The Art series is known for its exceptional optical quality, with high contrast and color accuracy.\n\n**Portrait Photography Tips**\n\n1. **Understand your subject**: Before you start shooting, take time to understand your subject's personality, style, and preferences. This will help you capture their essence and create a more compelling portrait.\n2. **Use the right focal length**: Experiment with different focal lengths to find the one that works best for your subject and composition. The 50-60mm range is often considered ideal for portraits, as it provides a natural perspective without distortion.\n3. **Aperture and depth of field**: f/2.8 is a great starting point, but don't be afraid to experiment with different apertures to control the depth of field. A smaller aperture (higher f-stop number) will keep more of the image in focus, while a larger aperture (lower f-stop number) will create a shallower depth of field.\n4. **Pay attention to lighting**: Natural light is always a great option, but if you're shooting indoors or in low light conditions, use your lens's OS feature to compensate for camera shake. You can also experiment with artificial light sources, like strobes or continuous lights.\n5. **Composition**: Consider the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing your subject with elements in the environment. Don't be afraid to experiment and break the rules to create a more interesting composition.\n6. **Focus on your subject's eyes**: The eyes are the windows to the soul, and sharp focus on them is crucial for a compelling portrait. Use your camera's autofocus system or manual focus to ensure the eyes are tack sharp.\n7. **Experiment with angles and perspectives**: Don't be afraid to get low, climb high, or experiment with unusual angles to add variety to your portraits.\n8. **Post-processing**: Develop a consistent post-processing style to enhance your portraits. The Sigma lens is known for its excellent color accuracy, so you may want to focus on subtle adjustments to exposure, contrast, and skin tones.\n\n**Resources**\n\n1. **Sigma's Website**: Sigma offers a wealth of resources, including tutorials, workshops, and a blog with tips and inspiration from professional photographers.\n2. **Nikon's Website**: Nikon's website has a dedicated section for portrait photography, with tips, tutorials, and inspiration from Nikon ambassadors.\n3. **YouTube Channels**: Channels like Peter McKinnon, Tony Northrup, and Jared Polin offer excellent tutorials and tips on portrait photography, gear reviews, and post-processing techniques.\n4. **Online Courses**: Websites like Udemy, Skillshare, and CreativeLive offer online courses and workshops on portrait photography, lighting, and post-processing.\n5. **Practice and Experimentation**: The best way to improve is to practice regularly and experiment with different techniques, lighting setups, and compositions.\n\nBy following these tips and resources, you'll be well on your way to capturing stunning portraits with your Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art Lens and Nikon D850. Happy shooting!",
