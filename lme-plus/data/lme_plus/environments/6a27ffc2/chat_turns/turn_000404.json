However, you can search for attorneys who specialize in criminal law in your state, and then contact them to inquire about their experience with expungements. Additionally, you can ask for referrals from family or friends who may have used an attorney for expungement services. It is important to research the attorney's background, experience, and success rate before hiring them to handle your case.",
