  "content": "Rutgers University found that their librarians needed to work together more closely to improve the way they teach students about finding and using information. To do this, they created a series of meetings called TeachMeets, where librarians could share their ideas and expertise. These meetings were successful and helped improve the instruction program. They also reached more people than expected and became known as a way for librarians to develop professionally. TeachMeets cover many topics and are useful for different types of libraries.",
