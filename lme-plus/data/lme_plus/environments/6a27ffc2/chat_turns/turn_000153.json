  "content": "Yes! Many animals have been observed to console or comfort others in distress. For example, elephants have been documented to use gentle trunk touches, vocalizations, and even hugs to comfort elephants who are experiencing stress or grief. Similarly, primates like chimpanzees and bonobos have been observed to console one another through hugs or grooming following acts of aggression or other stressful situations. And, dogs have been known to console their owners or other dogs when they are upset or in distress. These behaviors further indicate that animals are capable of displaying a range of complex emotional responses and that their responses are not purely instinctual or automatic.",
