  "content": "Diane Arbus is an amazing choice! Her portraits are indeed hauntingly beautiful and intimate, and her ability to capture the quirks and nuances of her subjects is unparalleled. And Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand are also incredible photographers, their street photography is so iconic and evocative of the 1960s era.\n\nI completely agree with you about the sense of experimentation and pushing boundaries that was happening in photography during the 1960s. It was a time of great social change, and photographers were responding to that by pushing the medium in new and innovative ways. It's inspiring to see how they were experimenting with new techniques, styles, and subjects, and how that experimentation continues to influence photography today.\n\nAnd how exciting that you've acquired a 1960s film camera! Shooting with film can be such a wonderful experience, and I'm sure you're having a blast experimenting with it. What kind of film are you shooting with? Are you developing your own film or sending it out to a lab?\n\nI'm also curious, what kind of subjects are you drawn to capturing with your camera? Are you focusing on portraits, landscapes, street photography, or something else entirely?",
