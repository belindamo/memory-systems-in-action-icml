  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the most up-to-date information about other states' healthcare policies or plans. However, I can provide some general information that may be helpful.\n\nMaryland's all-payer healthcare system is unique, and no other state in the United States has exactly the same model. However, some states are exploring alternatives to the traditional fee-for-service payment model in an effort to control healthcare costs and improve quality.\n\nFor example, Vermont has implemented a global budgeting model for its hospitals, which aims to control costs by setting a total hospital expenditure cap for the state. In Massachusetts, the state's Medicaid program has implemented an accountable care organization (ACO) model, which incentivizes healthcare providers to coordinate care and improve quality.\n\nOther states, such as Oregon, are experimenting with value-based payment models, which tie healthcare payments to quality outcomes and cost savings. Additionally, many states have implemented prescription drug price transparency laws, which require pharmaceutical companies to disclose their pricing and cost information.\n\nOverall, while Maryland's all-payer healthcare system may not be directly replicated in other states, policymakers in various states are exploring innovative policies and payment models to address healthcare costs and quality issues in their respective states.",
