Injuries can often derail even the best teams, so the Lakers will need to take care of themselves and make sure they are in top physical condition. And as you mentioned, LeBron James and Anthony Davis will be key in leading their team to victory. They are outstanding players with a wealth of experience and talent, and they will need to be at their best to guide the Lakers through the playoffs.
