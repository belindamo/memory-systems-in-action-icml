Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Gating the template behind an email opt-in form:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Builds your email list**: By requiring an email address in exchange for the template, you'll grow your email list and have a way to nurture leads and promote your services.\n2. **Targeted follow-up**: You can send targeted follow-up emails with additional resources, tips, or promotions that are relevant to designers and entrepreneurs who downloaded the template.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **Barrier to access**: Some visitors might be hesitant to provide their email address, which could reduce the number of downloads.\n2. **Less visibility**: The template might not get as much visibility or shares if it's hidden behind an opt-in form.\n\n**Making the template freely available for download:**\n\nPros:\n\n1. **Increased visibility**: The template will be easily accessible, and visitors can share it with others, potentially increasing its reach and visibility.\n2. **Establishes trust**: By providing value without asking for anything in return, you'll establish trust with your audience and demonstrate your expertise.\n\nCons:\n\n1. **No email list growth**: You won't capture email addresses, making it harder to follow up with leads or promote your services.\n2. **Less targeted engagement**: Without an email list, you'll have limited opportunities for targeted engagement and nurturing leads.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide:\n\n1. Is building your email list a priority for your business?\n2. Do you have a solid follow-up strategy in place to nurture leads who download the template?\n3. Is the template valuable enough that visitors will be willing to provide their email address in exchange for it?\n\nIf you decide to gate the template, make sure your opt-in form is clear, concise, and easy to fill out. You can also offer a sample or a preview of the template to entice visitors to download it.\n\nIf you choose to make the template freely available, consider adding a call-to-action (CTA) on the download page, encouraging visitors to explore your services or contact you for more information.\n\nUltimately, you can experiment with both approaches and analyze the results to determine which one works best for your business goals and target audience.",
