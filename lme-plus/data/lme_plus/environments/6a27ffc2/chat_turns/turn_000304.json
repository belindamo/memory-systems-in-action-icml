I want sin.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Mustapha Mond, \"you're claiming the right to be unhappy.\"\n\n\"All right then,\" said the Savage defiantly, \"I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.\"\n\n\"Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.\" There was a long silence.\n\n\"I claim them all,\" said the Savage at last.\n\nMustapha Mond shrugged his shoulders. \"You're welcome,\" he said.\n\nAnd then, brushing the objection aside, \"Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.\"\n\n\"But it's the only thing that counts,\" said the Savage.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the Controller. \"Happiness is the useful illusion, the spoonful of sugar, that makes the medicine go down. The coaxing little opiate that the civilized man takes to secure his muddle-headed contentment. Not the natural happiness that comes from a healthy body or a happy mind, but the manufactured happiness that comes from a bottle of soma. Take a holiday from reality whenever you like, and come back to it refreshed, and with a readjusted will.\"\n```",
