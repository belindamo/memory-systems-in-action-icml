I'm here to provide information and answer your questions to the best of my abilities!\n\nNow, about your question: choosing the right glass or acrylic for your display cabinet is crucial to protect your vintage cameras from damage. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**UV-filtering glass:**\n\n1. **UV-filtering glass with a minimum of 99% UV protection:** This type of glass is designed to block UV radiation, which can cause fading, discoloration, or damage to your cameras.\n2. **Museum-quality glass:** This type of glass is specifically designed for museum and gallery applications, offering superior UV protection and clarity.\n3. **Low-iron glass:** This type of glass has a lower iron content, which reduces the greenish tint commonly found in regular glass. It's ideal for displaying cameras, as it provides a clearer view.\n\n**Acrylic options:**\n\n1. **UV-filtering acrylic:** Similar to UV-filtering glass, this type of acrylic blocks UV radiation to protect your cameras.\n2. **Acrylic with a UV-filtering coating:** Some acrylics have a special coating that filters out UV radiation, providing an added layer of protection.\n3. **Optical-grade acrylic:** This type of acrylic is designed for high-clarity applications, offering excellent transparency and minimal distortion.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n1. **Thickness:** Choose a thickness that provides adequate protection without adding excessive weight or distortion to your display cabinet.\n2. **Glazing:** Consider using a glazing material that is specifically designed for UV protection, such as UV-filtering glass or acrylic.\n3. **Frame and mounting:** Ensure that the frame and mounting system you choose is sturdy and secure to prevent damage to the glass or acrylic.\n\nSome popular brands that offer UV-filtering glass and acrylic options include:\n\n* UV-filtering glass: Guardian, Schott, and Saint-Gobain\n* Acrylic: Lucite, Plexiglas, and Optix\n\nWhen selecting a glass or acrylic, be sure to research the specific product's UV protection capabilities and consult with a professional if you're unsure about the best option for your display cabinet.",
