I'm an AI, I don't have personal experiences or own collectibles. I'm here to provide information and answer your questions to the best of my abilities!\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you with your vintage camera collection and provide information on UV-filtering glass or acrylic options that can protect your cameras from damage. I've already provided some general information on the topic earlier. If you have specific questions or would like more recommendations on products or brands, feel free to ask!",
