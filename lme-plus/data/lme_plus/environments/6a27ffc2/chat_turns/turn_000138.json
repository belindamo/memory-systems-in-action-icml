  "content": "Congratulations on spotting your first Common Yellowthroat! That's always an exciting experience, and it's great to hear that you're still feeling the thrill.\n\nRegarding your upcoming trip to the state park, I'd be happy to help you find some great birding spots. However, I need a bit more information from you. Could you please provide the following details:\n\n1. Which state park are you planning to visit?\n2. What time of year are you planning your trip? (This will help me suggest bird species that are more likely to be present during that time.)\n3. Are there any specific habitats or areas within the park that interest you (e.g., forests, wetlands, trails, lakes, etc.)?\n4. Do you have any target species in mind that you'd like to spot during your trip?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized recommendations for birding spots within the park.",
