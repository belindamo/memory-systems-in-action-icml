Here are a few resources you can use:\n\n1. The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) provides a state-by-state guide on expungement laws and eligibility requirements. You can access this guide on their website.\n\n2. The Legal Aid Society is a non-profit organization that provides legal assistance to low-income individuals. They have information on their website about expungement and sealing of criminal records, as well as resources for finding legal assistance in your state.\n\n3. The ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) has a database of state-specific expungement laws and eligibility requirements which can be found on their website.\n\n4. The National HIRE Network (Helping Individuals with criminal records Re-enter through Employment) has a state-by-state list of legal service providers on their website.\n\nIt is important to note that laws related to expungement and eligibility requirements can change, so it is best to consult with an attorney who practices in your state to get the most up-to-date information.",
