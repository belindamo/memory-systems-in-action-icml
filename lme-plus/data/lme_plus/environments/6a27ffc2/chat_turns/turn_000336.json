Here are some tips and online resources to get you started:\n\n**Tips for capturing birds in flight:**\n\n1. **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the better you'll become at anticipating and tracking birds in flight.\n2. **Know your gear**: Familiarize yourself with your camera's autofocus settings, burst mode, and continuous shooting capabilities.\n3. **Use the right equipment**: A telephoto lens with a focal length of at least 200mm is ideal for capturing birds in flight. A camera with good autofocus and burst mode capabilities is also essential.\n4. **Anticipate behavior**: Study the behavior of the birds you're photographing. Learn their flight patterns, habits, and habitats to increase your chances of capturing them in flight.\n5. **Use the right settings**: Set your camera to a fast shutter speed (at least 1/1000th of a second) and a wide aperture (around f/5.6) to freeze motion and create a shallow depth of field.\n6. **Panning**: Follow the bird with your camera, moving your body and camera in a smooth motion to track the bird's flight. This helps to create a blurred background and a sharp subject.\n7. **Focus on the eyes**: Make sure the bird's eyes are in sharp focus, as this will draw the viewer's attention to the bird's face.\n8. **Be patient**: Capturing birds in flight requires patience and persistence. Be prepared to spend hours waiting for the perfect shot.\n\n**Online resources:**\n\n1. **Bird Photography Tutorials** by B&H Photo: This series of tutorials covers various aspects of bird photography, including capturing birds in flight.\n2. **The Bird Photography Academy**: This online course offers in-depth lessons and tutorials on bird photography, including flight photography.\n3. **Birds as Art** by Arthur Morris: Arthur Morris is a renowned bird photographer who shares his expertise through online tutorials, eBooks, and workshops.\n4. **Flickr groups**: Join bird photography groups on Flickr to connect with other photographers, share your work, and learn from others.\n5. **YouTube channels**:\n\t* **Bird Photography with Tim Boyer**: Tim shares his expertise on bird photography, including flight photography.\n\t* **The Bird Photographer**: This channel offers tutorials, tips, and inspiration for bird photographers.\n\t* **Wildlife and Bird Photography by David Tipling**: David shares his experiences and techniques for capturing stunning bird photographs.\n\n**Additional resources:**\n\n1. **eBooks and guides**: Check out eBooks and guides on bird photography, such as \"The Art of Bird Photography\" by Arthur Morris or \"Bird Photography: A Guide to Better Images\" by David Tipling.\n2. **Workshops and tours**: Consider attending workshops or guided tours with experienced bird photographers to learn from them in the field.\n3. **Practice with slower-moving subjects**: If you're struggling to capture birds in flight, try practicing with slower-moving subjects like butterflies or dragonflies to improve your tracking and panning skills.\n\nRemember, capturing birds in flight takes time, patience, and practice. Keep working at it, and you'll eventually see improvement in your photography skills. Good luck!",
