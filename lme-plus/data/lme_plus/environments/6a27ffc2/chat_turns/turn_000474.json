  "content": "There are several examples of airlines that have successfully integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into their operations. One example is KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which has been at the forefront of SAF adoption. Here are some details about KLM's sustainable aviation fuel initiatives:\n\n- Since March 2019, KLM has been operating flights between Amsterdam and Paris using a 75:25 blend of conventional jet fuel and SAF made from cooking oil.\n- KLM partnered with Finnish producer Neste to secure a supply of SAF. Neste produces SAF from feedstock such as used cooking oil, beef fat, and other wastes.\n- KLM has also invested in several co-production projects to develop its own sources of SAF. For example, KLM joined a consortium in Rotterdam to build an SAF plant that converts waste into sustainable aviation fuel.\n- In 2020, KLM secured a supply of SAF produced by 80% waste cooking oil and 20% residual flow from paper production, for flights between Amsterdam and Shanghai.\n- KLM has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% per passenger-kilometre by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. The adoption of SAF plays a significant role in achieving this target, along with other measures such as increased fuel efficiency and offsetting.\n\nKLM's successful adoption of SAF demonstrates that airlines can integrate sustainable aviation fuel into their operations, reduce their carbon footprint, and contribute to a more environmentally sustainable aviation industry.",
