It's a great all-purpose film that seems to handle a variety of lighting conditions really well. And I've been developing my own film at home, which has been a really fun and rewarding process.\n\nAs for subjects, I've been drawn to capturing a mix of things. I love shooting portraits of friends and family, but I've also been enjoying capturing street scenes and landscapes. There's something about the 1960s aesthetic that lends itself well to capturing everyday life, you know? I've also been experimenting with still life photography, capturing old cameras, records, and other vintage items that I've collected.\n\nI think what I love most about shooting with film is the process of slowing down and being more intentional with each shot. With digital photography, it's so easy to just snap away and hope for the best, but with film, you have to be more",
