  "content": "The Nikon Z6 is an excellent choice as a backup camera body! As a hybrid mirrorless camera, it offers impressive video capabilities, making it an excellent option for both stills and video shooters. Here's an overview of its video features:\n\n**Video Resolution and Frame Rates**\n\n* The Z6 can record 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) video at 30p, 25p, and 24p, with a maximum bitrate of 100 Mbps.\n* It can also record Full HD (1920 x 1080) at 120p, 100p, 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, and 24p.\n* Slow-motion video is available in Full HD at 120p and 100p.\n\n**Sensor and ISO**\n\n* The Z6 uses a 24.5MP full-frame CMOS sensor, which provides excellent low-light performance and a wide dynamic range.\n* The camera's native ISO range for video is 100-25,600, expandable to 51,200. However, it's recommended to keep ISOs below 6,400 for optimal video quality.\n\n**Autofocus and Stabilization**\n\n* The Z6 features Nikon's advanced autofocus system, which includes 273 phase-detection points and 90% coverage of the frame.\n* The camera has built-in 5-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS), which provides up to 5 stops of stabilization. This feature is especially useful for handheld shooting or when using non-stabilized lenses.\n\n**Other Video Features**\n\n* The Z6 has a flat, log-based profile called N-Log, which provides a wider dynamic range and more flexibility in post-production.\n* It also features a 10-bit 4:2:2 HDMI output, allowing for external recording of high-quality video.\n* The camera has a built-in stereo microphone, and you can also use an external microphone via the 3.5mm audio input.\n* Time-lapse video creation is possible, with options for 4K and Full HD resolutions.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations**\n\n* The Z6 has a 29-minute, 59-second recording limit for 4K video, which may not be suitable for longer events or productions.\n* The camera's autofocus system can be sensitive to certain lighting conditions, such as low light or high contrast, which may affect performance.\n* As with any camera, it's essential to monitor your audio levels and adjust them accordingly to avoid distortion or clipping.\n\n**Comparison to the D850**\n\n* The Z6's video capabilities are more advanced than the D850's, with features like 4K UHD, 10-bit 4:2:2 HDMI output, and built-in IBIS.\n* However, the D850 is still a great camera for stills, and if you're primarily a stills shooter, the D850 might remain your primary camera.\n\nOverall, the Nikon Z6 is an excellent choice for those who want a versatile camera that can handle both stills and video. Its video capabilities are well-suited for a wide range of applications, from weddings and events to documentaries and short films.",
