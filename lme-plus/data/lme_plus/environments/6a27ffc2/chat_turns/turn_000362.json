  "content": "Yes, there have been several recent eruptions in Hawaii. The most recent was on May 3, 2018, when the Kilauea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii began a series of explosive eruptions and fissure outbreaks that lasted until August 2018. These eruptions caused significant damage to nearby communities and resulted in the loss of homes and infrastructure. The Kilauea eruption was one of the most destructive in Hawaii's history.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that volcanic activity is an ongoing process in Hawaii, as the Hawaiian Islands were formed by volcanic activity and continue to experience occasional eruptions and volcanic activity on different islands. The US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory monitors volcanic activity in Hawaii and provides regular updates to the public to ensure public safety.",
