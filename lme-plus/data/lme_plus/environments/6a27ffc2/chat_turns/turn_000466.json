  "content": "The different beliefs about the afterlife impact the religious practices of Orthodox and Reform Jews in several ways.\n\nFor Orthodox Jews, the belief in the afterlife and the importance of good deeds influence their daily observance of religious practices. They tend to place a high value on performing mitzvot (commandments) and following Jewish law as a means of securing a positive outcome in the afterlife. This can include observing Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath), attending synagogue services, studying the Torah, and performing acts of charity. The afterlife is seen as a reward for performing these actions and living a good life, which often motivates Orthodox Jews to adhere strongly to traditional Jewish practices.\n\nFor Reform Jews, the belief in the afterlife is less central to their religious practice. Instead, they tend to emphasize ethical behavior and social justice as important aspects of their faith. While some Reform Jews may believe in an afterlife, they are more likely to focus on the importance of doing good deeds in the present, such as participating in volunteer work, advocating for social justice causes, and engaging in environmental activism. Reform Jews also tend to be more open to different forms of religious expression, including interfaith marriages and non-traditional worship styles, which can vary widely from congregation to congregation.\n\nOverall, while Orthodox Jews tend to focus on religious practices as a means of securing a positive outcome in the afterlife, Reform Jews are more likely to focus on living a good life in the present, with less emphasis on specific religious practices or beliefs surrounding the afterlife.",
