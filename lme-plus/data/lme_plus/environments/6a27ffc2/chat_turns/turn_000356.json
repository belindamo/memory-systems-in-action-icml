  "content": "Sure, here are some mental stimulation activities that you can try with your dog:\n\n1. Puzzle toys: Puzzle toys are designed to challenge your dog's brain by making them work for treats. Some toys can be filled with kibble or treats, while others require your dog to solve a puzzle to get to the reward. 2. Hide-and-seek: Hide treats around your home or yard and encourage your dog to find them using their nose. You can start with simple hiding spots and then gradually increase the difficulty level. 3. Agility training: Set up an obstacle course with jumps, tunnels, and other obstacles. This type of training will challenge your dog's focus and coordination. 4. Obedience training: Teach your dog new commands and tricks. This type of training will keep them mentally engaged and help you build a stronger bond with them. 5. Scent work: Dogs have a great sense of smell, and you can challenge them by hiding scented objects around your home or yard. 6. Interactive games: Play games like fetch or tug-of-war with your dog. These activities will keep your dog mentally stimulated and help release their excess energy too. Remember, mental stimulation is just as important as physical exercise. So, try to incorporate mental stimulation activities into your dog's daily routine to help them stay happy and healthy.",
