The gameplay is relatively straightforward, and the rules are simple to understand. The game's mechanics are also very intuitive, so even players who aren't familiar with strategy games can pick it up quickly.\n\nThe game's designer, Michael Kiesling, has mentioned that he aimed to create a game that's accessible to a wide range of players, including those who aren't typically drawn to strategy games. As a result, Azul has a gentle learning curve, and players can start enjoying the game right away.\n\nThat being said, Azul does have some strategic depth, and experienced gamers will find plenty of opportunities to optimize their gameplay and explore different strategies. However, the game's strategic elements are not overwhelming, and casual players can still have a great time playing the game without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nIn terms of player experience, Azul is a great choice for:\n\n* Casual players who enjoy puzzle-like games or tile-laying games\n* Families with older children (around 10+ years old) who can understand the game's mechanics\n* Players who enjoy games with a strong visual component (the mosaic-building is very appealing)\n* Those who prefer shorter games (Azul typically takes around 30-45 minutes to play)\n\nIf your sister is not a big fan of strategy games, Azul is still a great choice because:\n\n* The game's strategic elements are relatively light, and the gameplay is more focused on pattern-building and tile-laying\n* The game has a very short rules explanation, and you can teach it to your sister in about 10-15 minutes\n* The game is very forgiving, and mistakes are not severely punished, so your sister can experiment and learn as she plays\n\nOverall, Azul is an excellent choice for a family game night, and it's suitable for casual players. I think your sister will enjoy the game's puzzle-like gameplay, the beautiful components, and the sense of accomplishment when she completes her mosaic.",
