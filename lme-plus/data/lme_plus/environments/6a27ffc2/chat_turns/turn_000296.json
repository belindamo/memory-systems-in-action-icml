For example, if your tea set has a prominent gold trim, consider incorporating gold accents or warm neutrals like beige, cream, or wood tones.\n2. **Use a consistent style or era**: Group pieces from similar styles or eras together to create a sense of cohesion. For instance, you could create a Victorian-era vignette with your great-aunt's antique silverware and your grandmother's tea set.\n3. **Select a common material**: Use a common material, like wood, metal, or ceramic, to tie the pieces together. This can help create a sense of harmony and visual flow.\n\n**Creating a Focal Point:**\n\n1. **Designate a centerpiece**: Choose a statement piece, like the vintage typewriter, to be the focal point of the display.
