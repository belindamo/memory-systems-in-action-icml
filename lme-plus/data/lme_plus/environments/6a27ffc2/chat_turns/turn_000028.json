  "content": "Choosing a community platform largely depends on your club's needs and preferences. Both WhatsApp and Discord are popular communication platforms that offer group chat, voice, and video call features. WhatsApp is a more traditional messaging platform that is easy to use and offers end-to-end encryption, while Discord is more geared towards gaming and offers additional features such as screen sharing and server customization.\n\nOther community platforms you might consider include Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Telegram. Slack and Microsoft Teams are more commonly used in professional settings and offer advanced features such as file sharing, task management, and integrations with other tools. Telegram is a secure messaging app that offers group chat, voice and video calls, and file sharing.\n\nAs for documentation, there are many other options besides Notion.
