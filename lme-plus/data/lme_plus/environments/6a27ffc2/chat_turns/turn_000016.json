  "content": "That's a great question! I think my interests in vinyl records and stamp collecting actually do influence my approach to photography. I've always been drawn to the tactile nature of these hobbies - the feel of holding a physical record or stamp, the process of carefully handling and admiring them. With photography, I think I'm drawn to the similar tactile nature of shooting with film - loading the camera, advancing the roll, and waiting to see how the photos turn out. There's something about the process of creating something physical that I really enjoy.\n\nAlso, I think my interests in collecting and appreciating the aesthetic of different eras - whether it's 1960s photography, vinyl records, or stamps - all tie together in some way. I'm drawn to the nostalgia and history behind these objects, and I think that appreciation carries over into my photography. I'm always on the lookout for unique textures, colors, and compositions that evoke a sense of timelessness.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you",
