A peace lily can be a wonderful addition to your apartment, and it's great that you're feeling more confident about plant care after repotting your spider plant.\n\nPeace lilies can tolerate low light conditions, but they'll still require some indirect light to photosynthesize and thrive. Here's what you need to know:\n\n* **Low light tolerance:** Peace lilies can survive in low light conditions, but they might not bloom as frequently or produce as many flowers.\n* **Indirect light:** Place your peace lily near a north- or east-facing window to provide it with indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause leaf scorch.\n* **Minimum light requirements:** Peace lilies need at least 50-75 foot-candles of light per day. To put this into perspective, a typical living room with a north-facing window receives around 50-100 foot-candles of light.\n\nIf your room receives very low light, you can consider using grow lights to supplement the natural light. However, if you're unsure about the light levels in your room, you can start by placing the peace lily in a spot with moderate light and observe its response.\n\nSome signs that your peace lily is receiving too little light include:\n\n* Weak, spindly growth\n* Fewer or no flowers\n* Yellowing or droopy leaves\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, you can try moving the plant to a brighter location or using grow lights to provide additional light.\n\nRemember, peace lilies are adaptable plants, and they'll still benefit from being in a room with low light. They'll just require more attention to their watering, fertilization, and pruning needs.\n\nI'm excited for you to bring home your new peace lily and enjoy the benefits of cleaner air and a more peaceful atmosphere!",
