  "content": "Most of the countries in the Caribbean have democratic governments. However, there are a few exceptions. \n\nCuba, for example, is a one-party communist state with a planned economy. The government exercises significant control over the country's media and has been known to suppress political dissidents. \n\nHaiti has a history of political instability and has faced challenges transitioning to a stable democratic government. In recent years, the country has made some progress toward democracy, but political corruption and violence remain significant issues.\n\nIn addition, some British overseas territories in the Caribbean, such as Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands, have a parliamentary system of government with a governor appointed by the British monarch.\n\nOverall, the majority of Caribbean countries have democratic governments, but each country has its own unique political challenges and system of government.",
