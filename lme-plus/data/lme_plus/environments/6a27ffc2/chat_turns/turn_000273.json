I've been really into the indie-folk scene lately, and I've been listening to a lot of The Lumineers and Arlo Parks. I recently attended a live show by Glass Animals at the local arena, and it was amazing - the energy in the crowd was electric, and the band's performance was top-notch. Do you have any tips on how to discover new indie-folk artists and bands?",
