Engage your core: Engaging your core muscles will help support your lower back when doing poses that require deep backbends. 5. Listen to your body: Always listen to your body and stop immediately if you experience any discomfort or pain in your lower back. It is always advised to consult your doctor or a certified yoga teacher before starting any new poses or if you have a pre-existing condition of lower back pain."
