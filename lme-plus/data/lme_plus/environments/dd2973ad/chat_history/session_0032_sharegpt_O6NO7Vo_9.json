      "content": "Sure, here's another part where the reader deals with separation anxiety:\n\nAs time went on, you and Connor grew closer and closer. You started to rely on him more and more for emotional support and guidance, and you found yourself feeling lost and anxious whenever he wasn't around.\n\nYou didn't realize it at first, but you had developed separation anxiety. You would get nervous and jittery whenever Connor had to leave for work or go out of town for a few days.\n\nOne day, Connor noticed that you were acting differently. You were clingier than usual, and you seemed to be on edge all the time.\n\n\"Hey, what's going on?\" he asked you, as you sat on the couch together.\n\nYou fidgeted nervously, not sure how to put your feelings into words. \"I don't know,\" you admitted. \"I just feel really anxious whenever you're not around.\"\n\nConnor's expression softened. \"That sounds like separation anxiety,\" he said gently. \"It's a common condition, and there are ways to manage it.\"\n\nHe went on to explain some techniques for managing separation anxiety, such as breathing exercises and grounding techniques. He also suggested that you speak with a therapist, who could help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies.\n\nOver the next few weeks, you worked hard to manage your separation anxiety. You practiced the techniques that Connor had taught you, and you started seeing a therapist who specialized in anxiety disorders.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but with time and effort, you started to feel more confident and less anxious when Connor wasn't around. You knew that he was always just a phone call away, and that he would be there for you whenever you needed him.\n\n\"Thanks, Dad,\" you said, using the term of endearment that had become so natural for you.\n\nConnor smiled and hugged you. \"You're welcome, son,\" he said. \"I'm proud of you for working through your anxiety. You're stronger than you think.\""

      "content": "Sure, here's another part where the reader's separation anxiety kicks in:\n\nOne day, Connor had to leave for a medical conference out of town. You knew he had to go, but you felt nervous and on edge as soon as he started packing his bags.\n\nYou tried to hide your anxiety from Connor, not wanting to burden him with your feelings. But as the time for him to leave drew closer, you found it harder and harder to keep your emotions in check.\n\nWhen Connor finally hugged you goodbye and headed out the door, you felt a sense of panic wash over you. You knew he would only be gone for a few days, but it felt like an eternity to you.\n\nYou tried to distract yourself by keeping busy, but everything felt pointless and dull without Connor around. You couldn't focus on anything, and you felt a constant knot in your stomach.\n\nAs the first day turned into the second, your anxiety only grew worse. You tried to call Connor several times, but he was busy with the conference and didn't pick up.\n\nYou started to worry that something bad had happened to him, or that he had forgotten about you altogether. Your thoughts spiraled out of control, and you felt like you were losing your grip on reality.\n\nFinally, on the third day, Connor called you back. You could hear the exhaustion in his voice, but you didn't care. You just needed to hear his voice, to know that he was okay.\n\n\"Hey, kiddo, how are you doing?\" he asked, his voice warm and comforting.\n\nYou felt tears spring to your eyes. \"I'm sorry, Dad,\" you said, your voice shaking. \"I just miss you so much. I don't know what to do without you here.\"\n\nConnor's tone softened even more. \"It's okay, son,\" he said. \"I miss you too. But remember what we talked about? You can do this. You're strong, and you can manage your anxiety.\"\n\nHe went on to offer some words of encouragement and advice, reminding you of the techniques you had learned to manage your separation anxiety. By the end of the call, you felt a bit better, knowing that Connor was thinking of you and supporting you even from a distance.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but you managed to get through the rest of Connor's trip with the help of your therapist and the techniques that Connor had taught you. When he finally returned home, you felt a sense of relief and joy that was hard to describe.\n\n\"Welcome back, Dad,\" you said, as you hugged him tightly.\n\nConnor smiled and hugged you back. \"Thanks, son,\" he said. \"I missed you too.\""

      "content": "Sure, here's another part where the reader age regresses due to stress:\n\nAs time went on, you found that life was becoming increasingly stressful. Between work, school, and other responsibilities, you felt like you were constantly running on empty.\n\nOne day, the stress finally became too much to handle. You were sitting at home, trying to get some work done, when you felt a wave of anxiety wash over you.\n\nYour heart started racing, and you felt like you couldn't catch your breath. Suddenly, you found yourself slipping into a state of regression, feeling small and vulnerable.\n\nYou curled up on the couch, your body shaking with sobs. You didn't know what was happening to you, but you felt like a child again, helpless and scared.\n\nConnor came home a few hours later, and he found you in this state. He knelt down beside you and wrapped his arms around you, holding you tight.\n\n\"It's okay, kiddo,\" he said, his voice soothing. \"You're safe. You're okay.\"\n\nYou clung to him, feeling like you couldn't let go. You didn't want to be an adult anymore. You wanted to be a child, to let someone else take care of you for a change.\n\nConnor seemed to sense what was happening, and he shifted his approach. \"Do you want to watch a movie?\" he asked gently. \"Or maybe play a game?\"\n\nYou nodded, feeling grateful for his understanding. Together, you settled in on the couch and watched a children's movie, the colors and sounds of the screen providing a comforting distraction from the stress of adult life.\n\nAs the movie went on, you felt yourself slipping deeper into regression, feeling small and safe in Connor's arms. For the first time in a long time, you didn't feel like you had to be responsible for anything. You could just be a child, and let Connor take care of you.\n\nIt wasn't until later that night, when you were snuggled up in bed, that you started to come out of regression. You felt embarrassed and ashamed, not wanting to admit what had happened.\n\nBut when Connor came in to say goodnight, he didn't judge or criticize you. Instead, he simply sat down on the edge of the bed and held your hand.\n\n\"It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, son,\" he said gently. \"And it's okay to need a break. You don't have to be strong all the time.\"\n\nYou nodded, feeling grateful for his understanding. You knew that you still had a lot to learn about managing stress and anxiety, but you felt a bit more hopeful knowing that Connor was there to support you."

      "content": "Sure, here's a hurt/comfort fic in which the reader has anxiety over conflict:\n\nIt had been a long day at work, and you were looking forward to coming home and relaxing. But as you walked up to your apartment, you could hear the sound of raised voices coming from inside.\n\nYour heart started racing as you realized that your neighbors were having a fight. You hated conflict of any kind, and the thought of being near it made you feel sick to your stomach.\n\nYou hesitated, wondering if you should go inside or if it would be better to just leave. But before you could make a decision, the door to your apartment opened and Connor stepped out.\n\n\"Hey, there you are,\" he said, smiling at you. But as he looked closer, he saw the look of anxiety on your face. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"They're fighting,\" you said, your voice trembling. \"I can't be around it. It makes me so anxious.\"\n\nConnor nodded, understanding. \"Come with me,\" he said, taking your hand. \"Let's go for a walk. Get some fresh air.\"\n\nTogether, you walked down the street, your thoughts swirling with anxiety. You hated conflict, hated the way it made you feel. You wished you could just ignore it, but you knew that wasn't an option.\n\nAs you walked, Connor kept up a steady stream of conversation, trying to distract you from the anxiety. He talked about his day at the hospital, his patients, his colleagues. And slowly, bit by bit, your anxiety began to ease.\n\nBy the time you got back to the apartment, the fight had ended. You could see your neighbors inside, sitting at their kitchen table and talking quietly.\n\nConnor put his arm around your shoulders. \"It's over,\" he said softly. \"You're safe now.\"\n\nYou nodded, feeling grateful for his understanding. You knew that your anxiety over conflict wasn't something that would just go away overnight. But with Connor by your side, you felt a bit more hopeful. Maybe one day, you'd be able to handle it a bit better."
