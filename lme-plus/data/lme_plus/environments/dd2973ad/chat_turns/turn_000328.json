  "content": "That's a great point about displaying my products at the Night Market! I was thinking of having a simple table setup with baskets or containers to hold my soap and lotion bars. But using risers or decorative containers to create a visually appealing display is a wonderful idea. I could also consider grouping my products by scent, so customers can easily find what they're looking for. And maybe I could have a small sign or card with a brief description of each scent, like \"Lavender Dreams\" or \"Peppermint Refresh\". What do you think?",
