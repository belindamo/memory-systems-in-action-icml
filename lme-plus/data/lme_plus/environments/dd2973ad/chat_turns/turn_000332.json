I'm excited to hear that you're feeling more confident and prepared for the Night Market.\n\nAs for your question, I haven't been to the Night Market personally, but I've heard great things about it from other vendors and attendees. One tip I've heard is to be prepared for a lively and bustling atmosphere, so make sure you're energized and ready to engage with customers.\n\nAnother tip is to be flexible and adaptable. Things might not always go as planned, so be prepared to adjust your display or sales strategy if needed. And don't forget to take breaks and stay hydrated throughout the night!\n\nFinally, I've heard that the Night Market is a great opportunity to connect with other vendors and attendees, so be sure to network and make connections. You never know who might become a valuable contact or customer in the future!\n\nI hope these tips are helpful, and I wish you all the best for a successful and enjoyable Night Market experience!",
