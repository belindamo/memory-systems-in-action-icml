  "content": "Sure, here's another part where the reader age regresses due to stress:\n\nAs time went on, you found that life was becoming increasingly stressful. Between work, school, and other responsibilities, you felt like you were constantly running on empty.\n\nOne day, the stress finally became too much to handle. You were sitting at home, trying to get some work done, when you felt a wave of anxiety wash over you.\n\nYour heart started racing, and you felt like you couldn't catch your breath. Suddenly, you found yourself slipping into a state of regression, feeling small and vulnerable.\n\nYou curled up on the couch, your body shaking with sobs. You didn't know what was happening to you, but you felt like a child again, helpless and scared.\n\nConnor came home a few hours later, and he found you in this state. He knelt down beside you and wrapped his arms around you, holding you tight.\n\n\"It's okay, kiddo,\" he said, his voice soothing. \"You're safe. You're okay.\"\n\nYou clung to him, feeling like you couldn't let go. You didn't want to be an adult anymore. You wanted to be a child, to let someone else take care of you for a change.\n\nConnor seemed to sense what was happening, and he shifted his approach. \"Do you want to watch a movie?\" he asked gently. \"Or maybe play a game?\"\n\nYou nodded, feeling grateful for his understanding. Together, you settled in on the couch and watched a children's movie, the colors and sounds of the screen providing a comforting distraction from the stress of adult life.\n\nAs the movie went on, you felt yourself slipping deeper into regression, feeling small and safe in Connor's arms. For the first time in a long time, you didn't feel like you had to be responsible for anything. You could just be a child, and let Connor take care of you.\n\nIt wasn't until later that night, when you were snuggled up in bed, that you started to come out of regression. You felt embarrassed and ashamed, not wanting to admit what had happened.\n\nBut when Connor came in to say goodnight, he didn't judge or criticize you. Instead, he simply sat down on the edge of the bed and held your hand.\n\n\"It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, son,\" he said gently. \"And it's okay to need a break. You don't have to be strong all the time.\"\n\nYou nodded, feeling grateful for his understanding. You knew that you still had a lot to learn about managing stress and anxiety, but you felt a bit more hopeful knowing that Connor was there to support you.",
