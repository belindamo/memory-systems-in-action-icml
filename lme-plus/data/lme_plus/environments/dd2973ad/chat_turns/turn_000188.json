  "content": "The Santa Monica Pier Twilight Concerts are free and open to the public, so you don't need to reserve tickets in advance. However, since it's a popular event, it's a good idea to arrive early to secure a good spot. The gates to the pier open at 5 PM, and the concerts generally begin around 7 PM. You can bring your own blanket or beach chair to sit on, and there are also food and drink vendors available at the pier. Keep in mind that the Twilight Concerts often attract large crowds and can get quite busy, so be prepared for a lively atmosphere!",
