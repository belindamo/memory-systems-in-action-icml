  "content": "If the client asks you a question that you don't know the answer to, it's important to remain calm and handle the situation professionally. Here are some tips to help you deal with questions that you may not know the answer to:\n\n1. Don't panic: The first step is not to panic. Take a deep breath and calmly inform the client that you need a moment to think about their question.\n\n2. Take a moment to understand the question: Ask the client to clarify their question if you don't understand it. This can help you understand better and give you time to gather your thoughts.\n\n3. Be honest: If you don't know the answer, it's better to be honest and admit it. Let the client know that you'll research the question and get back to them with an answer later.\n\n4. Show your expertise: You can also show your expertise by explaining how you would go about finding the answer. This can help you appear knowledgeable and professional.\n\n5. Offer to research and follow-up: Make a commitment to research the question and get back to the client with an answer. This shows the client that you're proactive, reliable, and committed to helping them.\n\nRemember, not having an immediate answer to a question doesn't mean that you're incompetent. How you handle the situation is important. Be honest, professional, and show your expertise in other areas.",
