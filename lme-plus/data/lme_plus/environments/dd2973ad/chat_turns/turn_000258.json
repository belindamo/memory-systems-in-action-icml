It's great that you have a yoga class to look forward to - exercise and self-care are essential for both physical and mental well-being.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself and don't overexert yourself, especially if you're still feeling a bit exhausted from Thursday. Take breaks when you need them, and don't hesitate to adjust your schedule if things don't go as planned.\n\nYou've got this! You're taking proactive steps towards your health and well-being, and that's something to be proud of. Keep up the good work, and I hope you have a fantastic Tuesday!\n\nIf you need any more help or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I'm always here to help. Namaste!",
