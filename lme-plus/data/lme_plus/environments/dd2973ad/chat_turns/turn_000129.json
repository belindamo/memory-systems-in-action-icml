  "content": "I think I'll start by trying to practice mindfulness during my daily commute. I usually take the bus to work, so I can use that time to practice deep breathing or body scan meditation. I'll also try to set aside 10 minutes in the morning to practice mindfulness before starting my day. My goal is to make mindfulness a habit, so I'll try to be consistent and not get discouraged if I miss a day or two.",
