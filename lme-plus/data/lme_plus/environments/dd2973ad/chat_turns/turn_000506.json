The Steep Ravine Trail was a great workout, and I'm looking for something similar in terms of difficulty and views. Do you know if the Dipsea Trail or Stevens Creek Trail would be a good fit? Or are there any other trails in Mount Tamalpais State Park that would offer similar challenges and views?",
