  "content": "Sure, here's another part where the reader's separation anxiety kicks in:\n\nOne day, Connor had to leave for a medical conference out of town. You knew he had to go, but you felt nervous and on edge as soon as he started packing his bags.\n\nYou tried to hide your anxiety from Connor, not wanting to burden him with your feelings. But as the time for him to leave drew closer, you found it harder and harder to keep your emotions in check.\n\nWhen Connor finally hugged you goodbye and headed out the door, you felt a sense of panic wash over you. You knew he would only be gone for a few days, but it felt like an eternity to you.\n\nYou tried to distract yourself by keeping busy, but everything felt pointless and dull without Connor around. You couldn't focus on anything, and you felt a constant knot in your stomach.\n\nAs the first day turned into the second, your anxiety only grew worse. You tried to call Connor several times, but he was busy with the conference and didn't pick up.\n\nYou started to worry that something bad had happened to him, or that he had forgotten about you altogether. Your thoughts spiraled out of control, and you felt like you were losing your grip on reality.\n\nFinally, on the third day, Connor called you back. You could hear the exhaustion in his voice, but you didn't care. You just needed to hear his voice, to know that he was okay.\n\n\"Hey, kiddo, how are you doing?\" he asked, his voice warm and comforting.\n\nYou felt tears spring to your eyes. \"I'm sorry, Dad,\" you said, your voice shaking. \"I just miss you so much. I don't know what to do without you here.\"\n\nConnor's tone softened even more. \"It's okay, son,\" he said. \"I miss you too. But remember what we talked about? You can do this. You're strong, and you can manage your anxiety.\"\n\nHe went on to offer some words of encouragement and advice, reminding you of the techniques you had learned to manage your separation anxiety. By the end of the call, you felt a bit better, knowing that Connor was thinking of you and supporting you even from a distance.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but you managed to get through the rest of Connor's trip with the help of your therapist and the techniques that Connor had taught you. When he finally returned home, you felt a sense of relief and joy that was hard to describe.\n\n\"Welcome back, Dad,\" you said, as you hugged him tightly.\n\nConnor smiled and hugged you back. \"Thanks, son,\" he said. \"I missed you too.\"",
