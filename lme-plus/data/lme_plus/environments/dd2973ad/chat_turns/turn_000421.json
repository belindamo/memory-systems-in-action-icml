  "content": "That's frustrating! I'd definitely recommend reaching out to your brother again to remind him to return the duffel bag. It's understandable that he might have forgotten, but it's your property and you need it for your own trip.\n\nBefore buying a new one, try sending him a polite and friendly reminder. You can say something like:\n\n\"Hey bro, hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on my duffel bag that I lent you for your camping trip. I need it back for my own trip coming up in April and I'd really appreciate it if you could return it to me ASAP. Let me know when I can expect it back. Thanks!\"\n\nIf you don't hear back from him or if he's unable to return it, then you might need to consider buying a new one. But it's worth trying to get your original bag back, especially if it's a good quality one that you like.\n\nFingers crossed that your brother returns your bag promptly!",
