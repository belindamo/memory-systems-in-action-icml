The album's deluxe editions also included exclusive merchandise and bonus tracks, encouraging fans to purchase physical copies and boosting its chart performance. \n\nOverall, the combination of Swift's dedicated fanbase, strategic promotion, and critical acclaim all contributed to the success of \"Lover\" on the Billboard 200 chart.",
