  "content": "I'm thinking of taking the Permaculture Design Course (PDC) Online first, as it seems like a solid foundation for understanding regenerative agriculture practices. I've got about 3-4 months to dedicate to the course, so I think I can manage the 120 hours required. After completing the PDC course, I'll have a better understanding of permaculture principles and design strategies, which will help me make the most of the Regenerative Agriculture Online Course. Plus, the PDC course will give me a broader understanding of how to apply regenerative practices in different contexts, which is really appealing to me.",
