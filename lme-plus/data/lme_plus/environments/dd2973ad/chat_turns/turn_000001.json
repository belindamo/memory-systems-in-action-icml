Size and Type of Boat: Fishing boats that are intended for deep-sea fishing expeditions are designed to withstand the harsh sea conditions. Such boats are usually larger, heavier, and equipped with durable materials that can handle the pounding waves.\n\n2. Ballast System: Fishing boats use a ballast system that allows them to adjust their weight depending on the wave conditions. This helps to keep the boat stable in rough seas.\n\n3. Fishing Gear: Fishing boats use specialized fishing gear that is designed to withstand the forces of the waves. This includes stronger fishing lines and nets that can hold the catch in turbulent waters.\n\n4. Radar and GPS: Fishing boats are equipped with radar and GPS technology to help the crew navigate in rough seas, avoid hazardous areas, and locate fish more easily.\n\n5. Communication: Communication is key when it comes to dealing with rough seas. Fishing boats have a reliable communication system in place to help the crew stay in contact with the shore and with other boats.\n\n6. Experienced Crew: An experienced crew is essential for deep-sea fishing expeditions. The crew must be skilled in handling the boat in rough seas, and have the necessary knowledge and experience to deal with any potential dangers.",
