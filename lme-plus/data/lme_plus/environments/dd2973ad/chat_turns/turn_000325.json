Here are some ideas to help you package your soap and lotion bars in a way that highlights the different scents and makes them visually appealing:\n\n1. **Color-coding**: Use different colored labels, wrappers, or packaging materials to match each scent. For example:\n\t* Lavender: soft purple or pastel blue labels\n\t* Peppermint: bright green or refreshing blue labels\n2. **Scents-inspired design**: Incorporate design elements that evoke the scent's essence:\n\t* Lavender: a subtle floral pattern, a sprig of lavender illustration, or a soft, watercolor-inspired design\n\t* Peppermint: a bold, geometric pattern, a stylized peppermint leaf illustration, or a fresh, green background\n3. **Clear or transparent packaging**: Use clear or transparent packaging to showcase the product itself. This works particularly well for soap bars, where the color and texture can be a selling point.\n4. **Custom illustrations**: Create custom illustrations that reflect the scent's personality or inspiration.
