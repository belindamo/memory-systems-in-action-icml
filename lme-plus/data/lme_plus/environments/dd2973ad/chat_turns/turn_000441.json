  "content": "I completely agree with you. Addressing the plastic waste problem requires a collective effort from both governments and individuals. While governments can provide the infrastructure and incentives to promote sustainable practices, individuals also have the power to make a difference through their choices and actions. By adopting sustainable practices such as reducing their use of single-use plastics, recycling, and supporting businesses that use eco-friendly materials, individuals can help reduce plastic waste and promote a more sustainable future. Therefore, it is indeed a collective effort that requires both top-down and bottom-up approaches.",
