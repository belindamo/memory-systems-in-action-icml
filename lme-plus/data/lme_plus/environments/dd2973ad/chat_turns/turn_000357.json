  "content": "Sure, here's a hurt/comfort fic in which the reader has anxiety over conflict:\n\nIt had been a long day at work, and you were looking forward to coming home and relaxing. But as you walked up to your apartment, you could hear the sound of raised voices coming from inside.\n\nYour heart started racing as you realized that your neighbors were having a fight. You hated conflict of any kind, and the thought of being near it made you feel sick to your stomach.\n\nYou hesitated, wondering if you should go inside or if it would be better to just leave. But before you could make a decision, the door to your apartment opened and Connor stepped out.\n\n\"Hey, there you are,\" he said, smiling at you. But as he looked closer, he saw the look of anxiety on your face. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"They're fighting,\" you said, your voice trembling. \"I can't be around it. It makes me so anxious.\"\n\nConnor nodded, understanding. \"Come with me,\" he said, taking your hand. \"Let's go for a walk. Get some fresh air.\"\n\nTogether, you walked down the street, your thoughts swirling with anxiety. You hated conflict, hated the way it made you feel. You wished you could just ignore it, but you knew that wasn't an option.\n\nAs you walked, Connor kept up a steady stream of conversation, trying to distract you from the anxiety. He talked about his day at the hospital, his patients, his colleagues. And slowly, bit by bit, your anxiety began to ease.\n\nBy the time you got back to the apartment, the fight had ended. You could see your neighbors inside, sitting at their kitchen table and talking quietly.\n\nConnor put his arm around your shoulders. \"It's over,\" he said softly. \"You're safe now.\"\n\nYou nodded, feeling grateful for his understanding. You knew that your anxiety over conflict wasn't something that would just go away overnight. But with Connor by your side, you felt a bit more hopeful. Maybe one day, you'd be able to handle it a bit better.",
