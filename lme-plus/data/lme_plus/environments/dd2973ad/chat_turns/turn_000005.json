  "content": "Fishing boats usually do not have medical professionals on board. However, they have first aid kits and emergency medical supplies to deal with minor medical issues. If a crew member becomes severely seasick during a deep-sea fishing expedition, the captain or another crew member might provide medical attention if they have some medical training or experience. \n\nIf the crew member's condition is critical, the boat may need to return to shore immediately to seek medical attention at a hospital. The captain may also contact the coast guard or other emergency medical services for assistance. It is essential to ensure the crew member's safety and well-being during such situations.\n\nPrevention is the key to avoid such instances. Crew members can take medications that prevent motion sickness or use other preventative measures, such as staying hydrated, eating light meals, and getting enough rest before going to sea. Also, it may be beneficial for crew members to undergo training on first aid and emergency medical procedures before embarking on deep-sea fishing expeditions.",
