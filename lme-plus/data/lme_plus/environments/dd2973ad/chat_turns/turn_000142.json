It's not uncommon for dogs to get more energetic and playful as they get more exercise and mental stimulation.\n\nAh, leash pulling can be a challenge, indeed! It's great that you're working on training Max to walk by your side. Consistent training and positive reinforcement can go a long way in helping him learn to walk nicely on a leash.\n\n**Tips for Reducing Leash Pulling**\n\n1. **Start with short sessions**: Begin with short training sessions and gradually increase the duration as Max becomes more comfortable with walking by your side.\n2. **Use positive reinforcement**: Reward Max with treats, praise, and affection when he walks beside you without pulling on the leash.\n3. **Choose the right equipment**: Consider using a harness instead of a collar, as it can be more comfortable for Max and help reduce pulling.\n4. **Practice loose-leash walking**: Hold the leash with a relaxed grip, allowing Max to move freely while still maintaining control. When he starts to pull, stop moving forward and wait for him to come back to your side before continuing the walk.\n5. **Avoid pulling back**: When Max pulls on the leash, try not to pull back on the leash. This can create a tug-of-war scenario, making the problem worse. Instead, stop moving forward and wait for him to come back to your side.\n6. **Be patient and consistent**: Training takes time and patience. Stick to your training routine and remember to reward good behavior.\n\nRemember, every dog is different, so it may take some time to find the right approach for Max. If you're struggling with leash pulling or need additional guidance, consider consulting with a professional dog trainer or behaviorist for personalized advice.\n\nHow's Max doing with the training so far? Have you noticed any improvements in his leash walking?",
