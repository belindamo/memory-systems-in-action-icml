It's definitely possible that your brother might have accidentally taken something else of yours, especially if he was packing up his camping gear in a hurry.\n\nYou could ask him to double-check his stuff and see if he has your scarf or any other items that might belong to you. You can add a sentence or two to your message, like:\n\n\"Also, while you're checking for the duffel bag, could you please take a look around and see if you have my scarf that I lost during my work trip to Chicago? I've been missing it and I'm hoping it might have gotten mixed up with your gear. Let me know if you find anything else that belongs to me!\"\n\nThis way, you're covering your bases and giving your brother a chance to return any other items that might be yours. Fingers crossed that he finds your scarf and returns it to you!",
