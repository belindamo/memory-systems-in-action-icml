Here are some kid-friendly games that are easy to set up and play:\n\n1. **Treasure Hunt**: Create a simple treasure hunt around the house or backyard with clues and small prizes at the end.

For older kids, you can introduce games like Monopoly Junior, Scrabble Junior, or Clue.\n3. **Charades or Pictionary**: Divide the family into two teams and have them take turns acting out words or drawing pictures. This game encourages creativity and laughter.\n4. **Karaoke Contest**: Set up a mic and speaker, and let the kids take turns singing their favorite songs. You can even offer fun prizes for the best performance.\n5. **Indoor Obstacle Course**: Create a mini obstacle course using household items like couch cushions, chairs, and blankets. Time each child and see who can complete it the fastest.\n6. **Movie Night**: Choose a kid-friendly movie and set up a cozy movie area with blankets, pillows, and snacks. You can even make it more special by setting up a popcorn bar with different toppings.\n7. **Would You Rather**: Prepare a list of \"Would You Rather\" questions, such as \"Would you rather have a giant water slide in your backyard or a treehouse with a secret passageway?\" This game sparks interesting conversations and laughter.\n8. **Scavenger Bingo**: Create bingo cards with items commonly found around the house or backyard, such as a leaf, a certain type of candy, or a stuffed animal. The first one to mark off all their items wins.\n9. **Simon Says**: A classic game that's great for getting the kids moving and laughing. One person is \"Simon\" and gives instructions starting with \"Simon says,\" while the others must follow.\n10. **Freeze Dance**: Put on some fun music and have the kids dance. Suddenly, stop the music and say \"Freeze!\" The last one to freeze in place is out.\n\nRemember to keep the games simple and enjoyable for all ages and abilities.

Here are some tips to modify your grandma's lasagna recipe to make it more appealing to Emma and Max:\n\n1. **Hide the Veggies**: Finely chop the veggies like onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms, so they're not visible to the kids. This way, they'll still get the nutrients without complaining about the \"green stuff.\"\n2. **Use Mild Sauce**: If your grandma's recipe uses a strong or spicy tomato sauce, consider toning it down with a milder version. You can also add a bit of sugar to balance out the acidity.\n3. **Add Kid-Friendly Meat**: Use ground beef or turkey instead of sausage or meatballs, which can be spicy or have strong flavors. You can also add cooked, diced chicken or ham for added protein.\n4. **Mac 'n Cheese Layer**: Add a layer of macaroni and cheese to the lasagna for a comforting, kid-friendly twist. This can be a fun surprise in the middle of the dish.\n5. **Use Mild Cheese**: Opt for milder cheeses like mozzarella, ricotta, or cottage cheese instead of strong cheeses like parmesan or gorgonzola.\n6. **Add Some Fun Toppings**: Offer toppings like shredded mozzarella, chopped olives, or pepperoni slices to let the kids customize their own lasagna slices.\n7. **Make it Bite-Sized**: Cut the lasagna into bite-sized squares or rectangles to make it easier for the kids to handle and eat.\n8. **Serve with a Side**: Offer a side of garlic bread, fruit, or a simple green salad to provide a refreshing contrast to the rich lasagna.\n9. **Involve the Kids**: Let Emma and Max help with the preparation, like sprinkling cheese or adding toppings. This can make them more excited to try the finished dish.\n10. **Be Flexible**: Be prepared for some kids to be picky, and have some alternative options available, like plain pasta or a simple sandwich.\n\nBy incorporating some or all of these tips, you can create a kid-friendly lasagna that Emma and Max will love. Good luck, and I hope you all have a fantastic game night!"
