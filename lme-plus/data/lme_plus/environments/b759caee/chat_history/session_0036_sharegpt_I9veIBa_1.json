      "content": "As a highly experienced engineering leader and software architect, I offer a unique blend of entrepreneurial spirit, R&D focus, and a decade of technical leadership in startup and consulting environments. I am well-versed in various domains, including ecommerce, financial crime prevention, adtech, and cybersecurity. My extensive background in founding and leading startups, mid-sized, and enterprise companies has equipped me with a diverse set of skills that can make a significant impact in any organization.\n\nMy technical expertise is supported by a Master's degree in Computer Science, and I have been recognized for my contributions to scientific research with a special recognition prize from the University Rector. My specialties include systems engineering, software architecture, distributed systems, functional programming, domain-driven design (both strategic and tactical), reactive systems design, and Scala and its ecosystem.\n\nWith strong writing and communication skills, I excel in mentoring and coaching, leadership, change management, consulting, and domain exploration facilitation. I am seeking an engineering management or technical leadership role where I can utilize my leadership, people management, and technical experience to create a holistic impact in the organization.\n\nAs VP of Engineering at Ematiq, I was responsible for running a 20-person engineering team, which included two Scala teams, one Python team, and one external team. I introduced scaffolding for career ladders and performance evaluations, and I developed the line of engineering management. I procured external technological partners and directly led high-impact R&D projects, such as a custom message broker with 1ms latency. Additionally, I set up a data engineering/product research engineering department and facilitated domain exploration sessions, introducing DDD where it brought real value.\n\nIn my previous role at Cisco Systems, I led product architecture of ML-based extended detection and response cybersecurity products, leading six R&D teams towards domain-driven architecture. As a leader of DDD competence, I facilitated domain discovery practices, including event storming and domain modeling workshops. I acted as a solution architect for complex feature development and aligned tech leads towards the bigger picture vision, influencing strategic bets in terms of product investments. I also coordinated across product line initiatives with external principal engineers/product managers.\n\nAs the first foundational hire in an AI-focused R&D incubator, I scouted, recruited, and mentored a Scala R&D team in Kosice, Slovakia, and coached systems engineering teams into transitioning towards Scala/functional programming stacks. I have also been involved in multiple high-profile projects in various domains and have experience in fast-tracking teams to adopt Scala and Lightbend technology stacks.\n\nI co-founded and led the R&D efforts of two startups, one of which was a business networking platform for conferences that won first place in Startup Weekend Kosice and went on to participate in an 8-month Wayra accelerator program with a 50k seed investment. In another startup, I contributed to the research, analysis, and architecture of an integrated platform to raise the living standards of visually impaired people.\n\nIn summary, my unique blend of entrepreneurial, technical, and leadership experience, along with my diverse skill set, strong communication skills, and ability to facilitate domain exploration and adoption of emerging technologies, make me an excellent candidate for engineering management and technical leadership roles."
