      "content": "NAMM is primarily an industry association that helps its members navigate the music industry and offers various resources to support their success. While NAMM may be able to offer guidance on how to distribute music through digital music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal, it cannot directly help with the verification process.\n\nVerification is typically handled by the platform itself and is often based on factors such as the artist's popularity, number of followers, and social media presence. However, there are various music distribution and management companies that can offer assistance with verification and provide other services related to digital music platforms. It may be worth considering partnering with one of these companies to help you navigate the digital landscape and achieve your goals on these platforms."
