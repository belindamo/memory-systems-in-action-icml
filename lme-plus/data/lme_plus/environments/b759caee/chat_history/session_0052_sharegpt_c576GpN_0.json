REST API: The PrestaShop REST API allows you to interact with the platform using HTTP requests. It supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for resources such as products, categories, customers, and orders.\n2. Web service API: The PrestaShop Web service API is an XML-based API that allows you to interact with the platform using SOAP requests. It supports similar operations to the REST API, including CRUD operations for resources.\n\nPrestaShop is built using PHP and MySQL, and it uses the Smarty templating engine for generating HTML. It is a server-side application that can be installed on a web server, such as Apache or Nginx.\n\nPrestaShop does support the creation of marketplaces with multi-vendor functionality, but this requires the use of a third-party module or extension. There are several such modules available in the PrestaShop Marketplace that can be used to create a multi-vendor marketplace.\n\nTo create Android and iOS apps for your PrestaShop store, you can use a mobile app builder that supports integration with PrestaShop.
