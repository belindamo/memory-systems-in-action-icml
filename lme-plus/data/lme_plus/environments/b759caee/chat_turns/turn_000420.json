Here's how:\n\n**Seat Configuration:**\n\nThe CRUZ has a reversible seat, which means you can configure it to face you (parent-facing) or face outwards (world-facing). This allows you to choose the best view for your baby, depending on their age and mood.\n\n**Infant Mode (0-6 months):**\n\nFor newborns, the CRUZ comes with a built-in infant insert that provides extra support and comfort. You can attach the MESA car seat to the stroller, and the infant insert will cradle your baby snugly. This setup is perfect for those early days when your baby needs to be close to you.\n\n**Toddler Mode (6 months+):**\n\nAs your baby grows, you can remove the infant insert and use the stroller seat in its upright position. The CRUZ seat has multiple recline positions, allowing you to adjust the angle to your baby's comfort. The seat is also quite spacious, with a generous canopy to provide shade and protection from the elements.\n\n**Toddler Seat Extension (12 months+):**\n\nWhen your baby becomes a toddler, you can extend the seat to its highest position, providing even more room for their growing legs. The CRUZ also has a footrest that can be adjusted to different heights, ensuring your toddler's comfort and support.\n\n**Other Adaptable Features:**\n\nThe CRUZ has several other features that adapt to your baby's growth:\n\n* **Adjustable Handlebar:** The handlebar is adjustable, allowing you to customize the height to your comfort.\n* **Storage Basket:** The large storage basket is accessible from the front and back, making it easy to store essentials like diapers, toys, and snacks.\n* **Canopy:** The canopy is extendable and has multiple positions, providing shade and protection from the sun.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe UPPAbaby CRUZ is an excellent choice for parents who want a stroller that can grow with their baby. Its adaptable seat configuration, infant insert, and toddler seat extension make it an ideal option for families who want a stroller that can accommodate their baby's development from birth to toddlerhood.\n\nI hope this helps you visualize how the CRUZ can adapt to your baby's growth!",
