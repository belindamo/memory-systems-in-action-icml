Movies such as iRobot and Wall-E sparked my imagination and fueled my curiosity about the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. Rather than just a fantasy, I saw possibilities. My passion and interest only grew stronger as I grew older, and it wasn't until a 20-day study camp at the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, a leading institution that researches sustainable development and environmental stability, that I became acutely aware of the urgent need to address the environmental challenges facing the world today. This experience made me realize that I could combine my passion for AI with my commitment to environmental sustainability to dedicate my life to a pursuit that ensures a better future for our planet.\n\nI have been thinking about various ways in which we can use AI to address environmental challenges such as pollution, climate change, and destruction of ecosystems. For example, robots that can take away plastic waste, or drones that can help monitor and manage ecosystems to identify early warning signs of degradation and/or damage. My ambition is to be an AI researcher in one of the world's best robotics and autonomous systems research facilities that aligns with my goals.\n\nAlthough AI was a new and emerging field in India in 2010 with limited specialized bachelor's degree courses, I pursued a computer science degree, which I completed with distinction. Due to the lack of resources at that time, I was not able to pursue a Master's in AI. Instead, I joined IBM, where I had the opportunity to take up additional AI projects, honing my technical skills and gaining real-world experience in the field. I continued to learn as much as I could about reinforcement learning, and my project EXA(Expert Advice) was chosen as one of the top 10 projects in the IBM Cognitive Build contest associated with IBM Watson. My focus became clearer and more defined, so I quit my job at IBM to fully concentrate on deep learning. My perseverance, tenacity, and months of hard work enabled me to land a job in Quinnox as a full-time AI engineer, where I have been able to ideate, create, and deploy more than 30 deep learning models in production involving computer vision, NLP, and Reinforcement learning during the past five years. I was also granted a patent in 2021 for one of the AI Algorithms I have developed (US11205041B2) which was a catalyst in believing my ability to create unique and innovative solutions.\n\nMy objective became more refined and lucid when I was developing an autonomous agent, Rover, for my recent project. I realized multi-agent and multi-modal reinforcement learning interests me the most and would help me in achieving my dream of creating autonomous agents that can help maintain a sustainable planet. The dream became more of a goal now. I am now at a crossroads in my life and career. I look around and find that I have more resources and opportunities than I first started. So I feel like I owe it to myself and my younger self to pursue this next step that will take me closer to the goal. After my master's, I would like to pursue a PhD to focus solely on the field and become eligible to become an AI researcher in one of the top research centers for Robotics and Autonomous Systems.\n\nI have been following research and publications in multi-agent and multimodal reinforcement learning, and I came to know about the research by Dr. Stefano V Aldrich of the University of Edinburgh. I was intrigued by it as it aligns perfectly with what I want to do in AI. Being a global leader in robotics and autonomous systems, the MSc in AI from the School of Inform",
