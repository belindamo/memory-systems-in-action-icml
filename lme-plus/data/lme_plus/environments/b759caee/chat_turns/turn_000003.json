I'd be delighted to help you with some side dish ideas that would complement your fettuccine perfectly.\n\nRoasting vegetables with olive oil is an excellent way to bring out their natural flavors, and it's a great starting point for many side dishes. Here are some ideas that might interest you:\n\n1. **Roasted Asparagus with Parmesan**: Asparagus is a natural pairing with fettuccine, and adding some grated Parmesan cheese will enhance the flavor. Simply toss asparagus spears with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven until tender.\n2. **Garlic and Lemon Broccoli**: Roasted broccoli florets with minced garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice will create a bright, citrusy flavor that complements the richness of fettuccine.\n3. **Saut\u00e9ed Spinach with Garlic and Cherry Tomatoes**: Quickly saut\u00e9ing a handful of spinach with garlic and halved cherry tomatoes will create a flavorful and healthy side dish that pairs well with fettuccine.\n4. **Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Balsamic Glaze**: If you like a bit of sweetness with your savory pasta, try roasting Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then drizzling with a balsamic glaze (reduced balsamic vinegar) before serving.\n5. **Grilled or Roasted Zucchini with Herbs**: Zucchini is another natural pairing with fettuccine, and adding some chopped fresh herbs like parsley, basil, or dill will add a fresh flavor dimension.\n6. **Sauteed Mushrooms with Thyme**: Earthy mushrooms saut\u00e9ed with olive oil, thyme, and a pinch of salt will create a hearty, savory side dish that pairs well with fettuccine.\n7. **Roasted Carrots with Pine Nuts and Parsley**: Sweet and earthy roasted carrots with toasted pine nuts and chopped parsley will provide a nice contrast to the rich pasta.\n8. **Green Beans Almondine**: Blanch green beans, then saut\u00e9 them with sliced almonds, garlic, and a squeeze of lemon juice for a crunchy, flavorful side dish.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started. Feel free to experiment with different vegetables, herbs, and seasonings to find your favorite combinations. Buon appetito!",
