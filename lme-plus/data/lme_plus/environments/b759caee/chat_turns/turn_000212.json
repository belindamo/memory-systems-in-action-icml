Featuring your new flavors prominently can be a great way to generate buzz and attract attention to your stall, but it's also important to consider the benefits of showcasing your best-selling products. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to help you decide:\n\n**Featuring new flavors:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Creates a sense of excitement and novelty, which can attract customers who are looking for something new and unique.\n* Can help you gauge interest and gather feedback on your new products.\n* May appeal to customers who are looking for a limited-edition or exclusive offering.\n\nCons:\n\n* May not be as familiar to customers, which could lead to fewer sales if people are hesitant to try something new.\n* If the new flavors don't resonate with customers, it could detract from the overall appeal of your stall.\n\n**Featuring best-selling products:**\n\nPros:\n\n* These products have already proven to be popular, so you know they'll likely attract customers.\n* Can help to build trust and credibility with customers who are familiar with your brand.\n* May lead to more sales and revenue, as customers are more likely to purchase products they know and love.\n\nCons:\n\n* May not create as much excitement or buzz, as customers may have seen these products before.\n* Could make your stall feel stale or uninteresting if you're not offering anything new.\n\nHere's a possible compromise:\n\n* Create a \"New Arrivals\" or \"Limited Edition\" section in your display that showcases your new flavors. This way, you're highlighting the novelty of these products without overwhelming your customers.\n* Place your best-selling products in a prominent location, such as at eye-level or near the front of the stall, to make them easily accessible to customers.\n* Consider offering a \"Taste the New Flavors\" or \"Buy One, Get One Free\" promotion to incentivize customers to try your new products.\n* Make sure to have plenty of samples available for customers to try, so they can experience your new flavors and decide if they want to purchase.\n\nUltimately, the key is to strike a balance between showcasing your new and exciting products while still highlighting your tried-and-true best-sellers. By doing so, you'll create a visually appealing display that appeals to both new and loyal customers.",
