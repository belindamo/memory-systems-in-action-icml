Typically, it's every 5,000 to 7,500 miles (8,000 to 12,000 km) for conventional oil, and up to 15,000 miles (24,000 km) for synthetic oil.\n2. **Oil change history**: You mentioned you had your oil changed on February 2nd at the local Honda dealership. You should have received a sticker on your windshield or a record of the oil change with the recommended next service date.\n3. **Your driving habits**: If you drive in extreme temperatures, tow a trailer, or drive in stop-and-go traffic, you may need to change your oil more frequently.\n\nAssuming you drive a 2022 Honda Civic with a conventional oil change interval of 5,000 to 7,500 miles, and you've driven approximately 3,000 to 4,000 miles since your last oil change (depending on your daily commute and driving habits), you're likely due for an oil change soon.\n\n**Recommended next oil change date:**\n\nBased on this information, I would estimate your next oil change is due around:\n\n* Late May to early June (around 5,000 miles)\n* Late July to early August (around 7,500 miles)\n\nHowever, please consult your owner's manual, the oil change sticker on your windshield, or contact the Honda dealership where you had your oil changed for a more accurate recommendation. They can provide you with a specific date or mileage interval based on your vehicle's maintenance schedule.\n\nRemember to always follow the recommended maintenance schedule to ensure your car runs smoothly, efficiently, and safely.",
