But I can suggest a few ways to find a great coffee shop near your office:\n\n1. Online Review Sites: Check out review sites like Yelp, Google Reviews, or TripAdvisor to see what other customers have to say about coffee shops in your area. You can filter the results by rating, distance, and hours of operation to find a spot that fits your needs.\n2. Ask Colleagues or Friends: Ask your coworkers or friends who work or live in the area for recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge about the best coffee shops in the area.\n3. Social Media: Check out social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook to see which coffee shops in your area have a strong online presence and what kind of coffee they offer.\n4. Walk Around: Take a short walk around your office area during your lunch break or after work to explore the local coffee scene. You might stumble upon a hidden gem that you wouldn't have found otherwise.\n\nAs for your habit of grabbing a coffee before boarding the 7:15 AM bus, it's great that you've found a routine that works for you! It's always nice to have a consistent start to the day, especially on busy mornings.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck in finding a great coffee shop near your office!",
