  "content": "**Sprint 2 Task 1 - Implement user authentication and authorization**\n\n**Task:** Implement user authentication and authorization\n\n**Story Points:** 8\n\n**Priority:** High\n\n**Time Estimation:** 4-5 days\n\n**Description:**\n\nThis task involves implementing user authentication and authorization for the reservation website. The following are the steps involved in this task:\n\n1. Design the database schema for user authentication and authorization.\n2. Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).\n3. Integrate user authentication and authorization with the Angular frontend.\n4. Implement a user interface for user login and registration.\n5. Test the user authentication and authorization functionality to ensure that it works as intended.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n1. A working user authentication and authorization functionality that is integrated with the Angular frontend.\n2. Documentation of the implemented functionality and the testing process.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and log out using the reservation website.\n2. Users should be able to access protected resources based on their roles and permissions.\n3. The implemented functionality should be well-documented, and the testing process should be well-documented.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nUser authentication and authorization is a critical security feature for any web application, and it is especially important for a reservation website that handles sensitive data such as user information and hotel bookings. Spring Security is a widely-used framework for implementing user authentication and authorization in Java applications, and it provides a range of features for securing web applications. JWT is a popular token-based authentication mechanism that is used to securely transmit user information between the frontend and backend. The Angular frontend should provide an intuitive user interface for user login and registration, and the user authentication and authorization functionality should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it works as intended.",
