  "content": "Let's finalize the design for the labels and tags. For the wildflower seed packets, I think \"Emily's Wildflowers\" with a small illustration of a wildflower would be lovely. For the homemade cookies or treats, I like \"Sweet Treats from Emily & [Partner's Name]\" with a simple illustration of a cookie or a heart. The rustic fonts and natural materials will add a nice touch to the overall design. What do you think?",
