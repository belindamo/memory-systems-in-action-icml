  "content": "While tempo runs do primarily work your legs (specifically your quads, hamstrings, calves, and glutes), the benefits of improved anaerobic capacity and lactate threshold can extend to your entire body.\n\nAnaerobic capacity refers to your body's ability to produce energy without using oxygen. Improving your anaerobic capacity through tempo runs can help you maintain a higher intensity of exercise for longer periods of time, which can benefit your entire body. This increased intensity can also help to stimulate muscle growth and improve cardiovascular health.\n\nLactate threshold is the point at which your body begins to accumulate lactic acid, leading to muscle fatigue and decreased performance. By regularly performing tempo runs, you can increase your lactate threshold, which means your body can tolerate higher levels of lactic acid before fatigue sets in. This can improve your endurance and overall fitness, as well as reduce your risk of injury.\n\nIn short, while tempo runs primarily work your leg muscles, the benefits of improved anaerobic capacity and lactate threshold can extend to your entire body, improving your overall fitness and performance.",
