  "content": "that would arise by me staying there like the long drive to my job from her apartment would be a little over an hour compared to the 15 minutes from my house to work and how I would need to wake up way earlier. But she needed me right now and I couldn't leave her all alone and it would be good for me to have some company at this time too.\n\nSo, I told her \"Sure mom.\" She said \"Thank you dear.\" I said \"No worries, want me to drive you to your apartment instead of taking the bus?\" She said \"That would be lovely, thank you again.\" I said \"You're welcome\" and we walked over to my car and I opened the door for her and helped her in.\n\nShe asked me if I could give her the auxiliary cord, so I said \"The car doesn't have one, it uses Bluetooth.\" She asked me \"Can you help me connect?\" and I said \"Sure, give me the phone.\" I typed in my car radio password then it connected and I gave it back to her. She thanked me and we started driving to her apartment.\n\nAs we were driving, I couldn't help but think about how my mom was coping with the loss of my dad. I wanted to help her, but I didn't know how. I decided that I would try to be there for her as much as I could and support her during this difficult time.\n\nWhen we arrived at her apartment, I helped her inside and made sure she was comfortable. We talked for a while and I listened to her as she reminisced about my dad and shared some of her favorite memories with me. I tried to be supportive and understanding, even though it was hard for me to hear some of the things she was saying.\n\nAfter a while, we both started to feel tired and we decided to go to bed. I promised her that I would be there for her and help her through this tough time. I know that it will be difficult, but I am determined to be there for my mom and help her in any way that I can.",
