  "content": "The Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds are an excellent choice for everyday use, but when it comes to workouts, their sweat and water resistance might be a concern.\n\nThe Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds have a rating of IPX4, which means they're designed to withstand splashes and sweat, but they're not fully waterproof. Here's what IPX4 means:\n\n* \"IP\" stands for \"Ingress Protection\" or \"International Protection Marking.\"\n* The \"X\" in IPX4 means the earbuds haven't been tested for solid particle ingress (i.e., dust).\n* The \"4\" in IPX4 means the earbuds can withstand water splashes from any direction, but only up to a certain pressure. Specifically, they can handle:\n\n\t+ Water splashes from any direction (e.g., rain, sweat)\n\t+ Water pressure equivalent to a 10-minute exposure to water jets from a 12.5 L/min nozzle at a distance of 3 meters\n\nWhile the IPX4 rating provides some protection against sweat and water, it's essential to note that the earbuds are not designed for:\n\n* Submersion in water (e.g., swimming, diving)\n* Exposure to high-pressure water jets (e.g., showering, heavy rain)\n* Prolonged exposure to moisture (e.g., wearing them in a sauna or steam room)\n\nIf you plan to use your Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds for intense workouts, such as running, cycling, or high-intensity training, you might want to consider the following:\n\n* Sweat can still seep into the earbuds and cause damage over time.\n* The earbuds may not be as secure in your ears during intense movements, which could lead to them falling out.\n\nIf you're concerned about the limitations of your Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, you might want to consider using a more sweat-resistant or waterproof option for your workouts. However, if you're only doing low-to-moderate intensity exercises, such as yoga or walking, your Sony earbuds might still be suitable.\n\nRemember to always wipe your earbuds clean and dry them after use to prevent damage and maintain their performance.",
