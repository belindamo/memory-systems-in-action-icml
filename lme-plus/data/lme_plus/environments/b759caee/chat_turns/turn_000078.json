I'd be delighted to help you maximize your bird sightings at the sanctuary and share some additional tips for attracting birds to your backyard.\n\n**Tips for maximizing bird sightings at the sanctuary:**\n\n1. **Timing is everything**: Plan your visit during the early morning or late afternoon when birds are most active. Avoid mid-day when birds may be resting or hiding from the heat.\n2. **Dress appropriately**: Wear earth-toned clothing, bring a hat, and apply insect repellent to minimize distractions and blend in with the surroundings.\n3. **Bring binoculars**: A good pair of binoculars will help you spot birds at a distance and get a closer look without disturbing them.\n4. **Know your target species**: Familiarize yourself with the sanctuary's bird list and focus on species you want to see. This will help you know where to look and what to look for.\n5. **Walk slowly and quietly**: Move calmly and quietly to avoid startling birds. Listen for bird calls and rustling in the underbrush to locate birds.\n6. **Look for bird-friendly habitats**: Focus on areas with dense vegetation, water sources, and food sources like seed-bearing plants or insect-attracting flowers.\n7. **Be patient**: Birdwatching requires patience. Take your time, and don't rush through the sanctuary. Sit and observe an area for a while to increase your chances of spotting birds.\n8. **Check with staff or volunteers**: Sanctuary staff and volunteers often have insider knowledge on recent bird sightings and can provide valuable tips on where to find specific species.\n\n**Additional tips for attracting birds to your backyard:**\n\n1. **Diversify your plant selection**: In addition to native species, consider planting flowers that attract specific birds, like sunflowers for cardinals or coneflowers for finches.\n2. **Provide suet and seed**: Offer high-energy food sources like suet and seed to attract birds during the winter months or when natural food sources are scarce.\n3. **Maintain a clean birdbath**: Change the water regularly to prevent bacterial growth and keep the birdbath clean and attractive to birds.\n4. **Create a bird-friendly landscape**: Incorporate native trees, shrubs, and plants that provide shelter, nesting sites, and food for birds.\n5. **Avoid using pesticides**: These can harm birds and other wildlife, so opt for natural methods to control pests in your garden.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've already seen an increase in bird visitors to your backyard, including the Downy Woodpeckers and White-breasted Nuthatch! Keep up the good work, and I'm sure you'll attract even more species to your yard.\n\nEnjoy your trip to the bird sanctuary, and happy birding!",
