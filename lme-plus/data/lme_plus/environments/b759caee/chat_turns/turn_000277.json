In addition to tempo running 5k twice a week, I swim 1 km in relaxed pace in the weekend, and then I do three fullbody resistance trainings a week each made from four big composite exercises. One of them is an explosive focused one with few reps and high weight, the two others resistance trainings are more hypertrophy-focused with more reps and lower weight.",
