While there is still much progress to be made, it is important to recognize the significant strides that have been made in improving workers' rights and safety over the years. It is incumbent upon us to continue to push for progress and to ensure that all workers are treated with dignity and respect, and are able to work in safe and healthy environments. This includes advocating for fair wages, reasonable working hours, access to benefits, and protection against discrimination and harassment. By working together and supporting one another, we can build a more just and equitable society for all.",
