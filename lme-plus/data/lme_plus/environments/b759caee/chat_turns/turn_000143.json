I'm also thinking of reaching out to my company to see if they'd be willing to sponsor the event or provide some support. Since they sponsored my charity cycling event in September, where I raised $150 through online donations and sponsorships, I'm hoping they might be open to supporting this event as well. Do you have any tips on how to approach them and what kind of support I should ask for?",
