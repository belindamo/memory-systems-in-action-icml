  "content": "That's a great plan! Getting there a bit earlier will definitely give you a better chance to grab a good seat and get settled before the service starts. And I'm sure you'll be impressed by the organ - it's always a treat to hear a beautiful instrument being played live.\n\nAs you take in the service and the music, don't forget to also pay attention to the atmosphere and the community. Notice how the congregation interacts with each other, and how the clergy and staff welcome and engage with the visitors.\n\nRemember, finding the right church is not just about the music or the sermon - it's also about finding a community that resonates with you and makes you feel at home. So, take your time, soak it all in, and see if St. John's feels like a place where you could grow and connect with others.\n\nOh, and one more thing - don't be afraid to introduce yourself to the organist or the music director after the service. They might be able to give you more information about the organ, the music program, or even offer you a tour of the church.\n\nHave a wonderful time at St. John's, and I hope you enjoy the service and the music!",
