  "content": "Yes, there were efforts made to improve working conditions at the Ford Dagenham plant over time. The most significant change came with the introduction of trade unions, which gave workers a voice and improved their bargaining power. In the 1930s, the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) began to organize workers at the Dagenham plant, leading to improvements in pay and working conditions. In the 1940s and 1950s, the factory began to introduce more safety measures, such as the use of protective gear and the installation of fire alarms. In the 1960s, workers at the plant went on strike to demand better pay and working conditions, which ultimately led to the introduction of the Equal Pay Act of 1970. By the 1970s, conditions had improved significantly, with workers enjoying better pay, a more reasonable work-life balance, and safer and more comfortable working conditions, although the industry has been in decline since then.",
