  "content": "The Party in the Paddock festival is an all-ages event, which means that people of all ages can attend the festival. However, those under 18 years old must be accompanied by a parent or guardian, and there are specific designated areas for those who are under 18. The festival organizers take special measures to ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable time at the festival, including enforcing a strict no drug or alcohol policy for those who are under 18. So, it should be okay to bring your little sister along, but make sure to check with the festival organizers as their policies might change from year to year.",
