  "content": "Yes, you can use mango instead of lemon to make a fruit curd. The process is similar to making lemon curd, but you will use pureed mango in place of the lemon juice. Here's a simple recipe for mango curd that uses 10 egg yolks:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 10 egg yolks\n* 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup (120ml) mango puree\n* 1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a medium-sized heatproof bowl.\n2. Stir in the mango puree.\n3. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water.\n4. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until thickened and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the mixture registers 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C).\n5. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and stir in the butter, one piece at a time, until fully incorporated.\n6. Strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean container.\n7. Let it cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until chilled.\n\nThis recipe makes about 2 cups of mango curd. You can use it as a spread on toast or scones, as a filling for cakes or tarts, or as a topping for ice cream or yogurt. Enjoy!\n\n\\*Note that, depending of the quality and ripeness of the mango you are using, you may need to adjust the amount of sugar or the cooking time to get the desired consistency and sweetness.",
