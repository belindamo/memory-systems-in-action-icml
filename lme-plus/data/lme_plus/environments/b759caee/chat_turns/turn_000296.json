  "content": "Ghirardelli Chocolate Company is a San Francisco institution, and their mochas are indeed legendary. Pairing it with a chocolate treat is the perfect way to start your Wharf adventure.\n\nAs you enjoy your mocha and chocolate, take a moment to appreciate the rich history of Ghirardelli Square. The original Ghirardelli chocolate factory was founded in 1852, and the company has been a San Francisco staple ever since. The current location on the Wharf is a beautiful, historic building that's been restored to its former glory.\n\nWhen you're ready to continue your stroll, you can walk off your chocolate buzz by exploring the Wharf and taking in the sights and sounds of the bay. Don't forget to check out the sea lions at Pier 39, and maybe even grab some lunch at one of the many seafood restaurants in the area.\n\nAfter lunch, you can walk along the pier, take in the views of the Bay Bridge, and maybe even stop by the Musee Mecanique to see some fascinating antique arcade games and musical instruments.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, I hope you have a fantastic time exploring the Wharf and enjoying the beautiful San Francisco weather!",
