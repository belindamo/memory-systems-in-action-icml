  "content": "In recent years, Ajax has been performing better than PSV Eindhoven. Ajax has won the Eredivisie title in the past four seasons (2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22) and has also reached the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League multiple times. In contrast, PSV Eindhoven has finished as runners-up in the Eredivisie in the past two seasons (2020-21 and 2021-22) and has failed to qualify for the Champions League group stages in recent years.
