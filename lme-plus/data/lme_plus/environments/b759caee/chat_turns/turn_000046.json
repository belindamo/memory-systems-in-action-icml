  "content": "As I sat on the edge of the roof, thinking about suicide, suddenly my mind shifted over to what had just happened yesterday, and how it all led up to this moment.\n\nHow my dad had just died from a heart-attack, and I would have to attend his funeral tomorrow and deliver a eulogy. My father was a strict, abusive, and old-fashioned man. He would beat me and my brother as a form of punishment and discipline. From time to time, he would even beat my mom. He was not just physically abusive, but he was also verbally abusive, and he would call my brother a \u201cFatso\u201d even though he knew that my brother was insecure about his weight.\n\nBut, at the end of the day he was still my father and he had provided for and protected me and my brother. And that my...\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the sudden ring of my phone. I glanced at it while my eyes were starting to tear up. I could make out the faint outline of the word \"mom\" and I rushed to pick it up.\n\n\"Hello\" I said in a shaky voice. My mom started asking me if I were okay and if I could deliver the eulogy. I said whilst trying to sound confident \"Yeah mom I\u2019m fine, I\u2019ll deliver the eulogy\" so she asked me if I had finished writing it, I lied and said yes and then told her I would go to bed now and hung-up the phone.\n\nI got down from the roof into my apartment not knowing what I should do, so I sat down and started writing the eulogy \"eulogy text.\" When I finished, I decided that I should go to sleep as it took me 3 hours to write the eulogy and it was now 2:00 AM.\n\nI lay in bed restless thinking about my dad. It is not like this was even sudden news. His health was in terrible condition before he had gotten the heart-attack, but it still hurt. I finally started to sleep after an hour or so of mourning.\n\nThe next day I woke up at 8:00 AM and got dressed to attend the funeral. I drove over to the cemetery. I arrived and got out of the car and started walking over to my father\u2019s grave where I found my family members, some of my father\u2019s friends and colleagues. I saw my mom in tears and felt sorry for her. We started praying over my father.\n\nWhen we were done praying, I had to go up and deliver the eulogy. I went up to the podium and started reading out the eulogy I could feel my voice getting weaker and weaker. My mother noticed and looked concerned, but I pushed through with a heavy heart.\n\nAfter I was done, I sat back down, and we prayed some more. I looked at my mom and stared right into her eyes. I saw how upset she was but remembered all that my dad had done to me and my brother and her and so I got angry because how could my mom mourn for him. I am so confused about my feelings. I am angry; I am upset. I do not know what is going on or what to do. Was I just doing this for my mom? I snapped back to reality and let my thoughts rest.\n\nAfter we were done with the funeral, I started walking over to my car when my mom started calling out my name from behind. I looked back and went over to her and asked her what is up? She asked me if I could stay with her in her apartment while she copes and I started thinking about all the problems",
