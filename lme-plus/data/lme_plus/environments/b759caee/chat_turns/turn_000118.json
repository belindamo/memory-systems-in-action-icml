However, we have not received any response from your side. As such, we have assumed that the project has been completed.\nWe regret to inform you that we recently received notifications from Cloudflare and AWS that our credentials have been revoked and therefore we cannot be held responsible for the current infrastructure. We kindly request that you provide us with instructions on what steps to take next, as we are eager to help and resolve this issue.",
