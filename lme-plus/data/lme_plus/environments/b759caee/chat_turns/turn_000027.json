  "content": "A Manhattan grand jury has indicted former U.S. President Donald Trump on over 30 counts related to business fraud, in a case connected to hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels. This marks the first time in American history that a former president has been indicted. Trump and his supporters claim the indictment is a politically motivated attack on him. The exact charges and evidence against Trump remain unknown as the indictment is under seal. Trump is scheduled to be arraigned in court on Tuesday, and maintains his innocence in this case and others that may pose legal threats.",
