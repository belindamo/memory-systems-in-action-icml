  "content": "Making their own sundaes is a perfect way to get Emma and Max involved in the dessert-making process. It's a fun and interactive way to let them express their creativity and make their own sweet treats.\n\nSetting up a sundae bar with a variety of toppings is a great way to cater to their individual tastes. You can include classic toppings like hot fudge, caramel, whipped cream, and sprinkles, as well as some more unique options like nuts, candy pieces, or even fresh fruit.\n\nTo make it even more special, you could let them create their own sundae names or themes. For example, Emma might create a \"Unicorn Sundae\" with rainbow sprinkles and a cherry on top, while Max might make a \"Monster Mash\" sundae with chocolate sauce and crushed Oreos.\n\nRemember to have fun and be flexible! Making sundaes can get a little messy, but it's all part of the fun. Encourage Emma and Max to get creative and try new combinations of toppings. Who knows, they might just discover a new favorite flavor!\n\nI hope you all have a blast making sundaes and enjoying your family game night together!",
