Here are some additional options:\n\n1. **Wearable fitness trackers**: Devices like Fitbit, Garmin, or Apple Watch can track your daily step count, distance traveled, and even calories burned. They often come with companion apps that provide detailed insights into your activity levels.\n2. **Smartphone pedometer apps**: Many smartphones have built-in pedometer apps that use the phone's accelerometer to track your steps. Some popular options include:\n\t* **Google Fit** (Android)\n\t* **Apple Health** (iOS)\n\t* **Pedometer++** (iOS)\n\t* **Stepz** (Android)\n3. **GPS tracking apps**: Some GPS tracking apps, like those I mentioned earlier, can also track your step count. For example:\n\t* **Citymapper** has a \"Steps\" feature that tracks your walking activity.\n\t* **Google Maps** can estimate your step count based on your GPS data.\n4. **Manual tracking**: You can also keep a manual log or spreadsheet to track your daily step count. This might be more time-consuming, but it's a low-tech option that can still provide valuable insights.\n\nTo track your step count specifically, you can set a daily goal for yourself and monitor your progress. Many fitness trackers and apps allow you to set custom goals and receive reminders to move throughout the day.\n\nIt's great that you're taking steps (pun intended!) to increase your physical activity by getting off the bus earlier and walking to the office. By tracking your step count, you'll be able to see the impact of this habit on your overall activity level and make adjustments as needed.\n\nRemember, every bit counts, and making small changes to your daily routine can add up to make a big difference in your overall health and wellbeing!",
