  "content": "Swan Oyster Depot is a popular spot, and it's a walk-in only establishment. They don't take reservations, so be prepared for a possible wait, especially during peak lunch hours or on weekends.\n\nHere are some tips to help you navigate:\n\n1. **Get there early**: If you can, try to arrive around 11:30 am or 11:45 am to beat the lunch rush. You'll have a better chance of getting a seat at the counter or a table quickly.\n2. **Be prepared to wait**: If you arrive during peak hours (usually between 12:00 pm and 1:30 pm), be prepared to wait in line. The wait can range from 15 minutes to 30 minutes, depending on the crowd.\n3. **Order at the counter**: When you arrive, take a look at the menu on the board above the counter. You can order at the counter, and they'll call your name when your food is ready.\n4. **Seating is limited**: Swan Oyster Depot is a small, cozy spot with limited seating. Be prepared to sit at the counter or share a table with others. It's all part of the charm!\n5. **Cash only**: Don't forget that Swan Oyster Depot is a cash-only establishment, so come prepared with some greenbacks.\n\nIf you're willing to wait, the seafood goodness at Swan Oyster Depot is well worth it. Enjoy your lunch!",
