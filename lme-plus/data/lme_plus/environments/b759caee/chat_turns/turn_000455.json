The following are the steps involved in this task:\n\n1. Identify the data required for hotels search functionality.\n2. Design the GraphQL schema for hotels search based on the identified data.\n3. Implement the GraphQL API for hotels search using Spring Boot and the graphql-java library.\n4. Test the GraphQL API to ensure that it works as intended.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n1. A working GraphQL API for hotels search.\n2. Documentation of the implemented API and the testing process.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. The GraphQL API for hotels search should be successfully implemented and provide accurate search results.\n2. The implemented API should be well-documented, and the testing process should be well-documented.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nGraphQL is a modern technology that allows clients to query data in a flexible and efficient way. By implementing a GraphQL API for hotels search, clients of the reservation website will be able to search for hotels using a flexible query language. The graphql-java library provides a powerful framework for implementing GraphQL APIs in Java, and it is widely used in industry. The API should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it works as intended.",
