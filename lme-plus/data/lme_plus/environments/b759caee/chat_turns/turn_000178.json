Checking local stores first will ensure you have the gift in hand before the baby shower.\n\n**Gift Receipt: Absolutely!**\n\nYes, it's a fantastic idea to get a gift receipt, especially when buying for a baby shower. Here's why:\n\n1. **Flexibility**: A gift receipt allows the parents to exchange the skincare set for a different product or brand if they prefer.\n2. **Personal Preferences**: Parents may have specific preferences for their baby's skincare, and a gift receipt gives them the freedom to choose something that fits their needs.\n3. **Returns or Exchanges**: If the skincare set is not suitable for the baby's skin type or has any defects, a gift receipt makes it easy for the parents to return or exchange it.\n4. **Convenience**: A gift receipt saves the parents the hassle of contacting you to ask about the purchase or trying to find the receipt themselves.\n\nWhen you purchase the skincare set, simply ask the sales associate to include a gift receipt. Most stores will happily provide one, and it will usually include the following information:\n\n* The item(s) purchased\n* The price\n* A return or exchange policy\n* A unique receipt number or code\n\nMake sure to include the gift receipt with your gift, so the parents can easily exchange or return the skincare set if needed.\n\nRemember to check the store's return and exchange policies before making your purchase, so you're aware of any time limits or restrictions.\n\nBy including a gift receipt, you're showing that you care about the parents' preferences and want to ensure they have the perfect gift for their baby.",
