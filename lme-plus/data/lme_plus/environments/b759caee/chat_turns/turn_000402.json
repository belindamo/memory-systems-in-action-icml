  "content": "One popular recipe that uses a large amount of egg yolks is lemon curd. Lemon curd is a tangy and sweet spread that is typically made with lemon juice, sugar, and egg yolks. Here's a simple recipe for lemon curd that uses 10 egg yolks:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 10 egg yolks\n* 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar\n* 1/2 cup (120ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice\n* 1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a medium-sized heatproof bowl.\n2. Stir in the lemon juice.\n3. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water.\n4. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until thickened and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the mixture registers 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C).\n5. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and stir in the butter, one piece at a time, until fully incorporated.\n6. Strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean container.\n7. Let it cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until chilled.\n\nThis recipe makes about 2 cups of lemon curd. You can use it as a spread on toast or scones, as a filling for cakes or tarts, or as a topping for ice cream or yogurt. Enjoy!",
