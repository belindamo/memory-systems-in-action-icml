Here are some tips to help you select the perfect asparagus:\n\n1. **Thick vs. Thin**: For roasting, it's better to choose thicker asparagus spears (about 1/2 inch or 1 cm in diameter). They'll hold their shape better and have a more tender, meaty texture. Thin spears can become too tender and mushy when roasted.\n2. **Freshness**: Look for fresh asparagus with tightly closed buds and no signs of woody or soggy stems. Fresh asparagus will have a more vibrant green color and a slightly sweet aroma.\n3. **Season**: Asparagus is typically in season from February to June, with peak season being April and May. During this time, you'll find the best flavor and texture.\n4. **Variety**: There are several asparagus varieties, but for roasting, you can't go wrong with the following:\n\t* **Jersey Knights**: Known for their thick, tender spears and sweet flavor.\n\t* **Purple Flare**: These have a slightly sweeter and nuttier flavor than green asparagus.\n\t* **Pacific Purple**: A cross between green and purple asparagus, offering a sweet and slightly earthy flavor.\n\nWhen selecting asparagus, gently grasp the spear at the base and gently bend it. If it snaps or breaks, it's fresh and ready to use. If it doesn't snap, it might be old or of poor quality.\n\nOnce you've chosen your asparagus, be sure to store it properly to keep it fresh:\n\n* Wrap the asparagus in a damp paper towel and store it in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.\n* Use asparagus within 2-3 days of purchase for optimal flavor and texture.\n\nNow that you've got your asparagus, it's time to roast it to perfection! Simply toss the spears with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in a preheated oven at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for about 12-15 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.\n\nEnjoy your roasted asparagus with Parmesan alongside your homemade fettuccine!",
