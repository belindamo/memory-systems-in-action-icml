Here are some questions to get started:\n\n* What type of pets are Max and Whiskers (e.g., dogs, cats, birds, etc.)?\n* What expenses have you had for them recently (e.g., food, vet bills, toys, grooming, etc.)?\n* Do you have receipts or records of the expenses, or do you need to estimate the amounts?\n* Is there a specific time period you'd like to track (e.g., last month, last quarter, etc.)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a list of your pet expenses and even provide some suggestions for organizing and tracking your expenses going forward.",
