I'm especially interested in trying some barbecue along the way - I've heard great things about the 'cue in Tennessee. Speaking of Tennessee, I've already driven through the state once before, when I went to Nashville in June for a music festival. That was a great trip, and I'm excited to explore more of the state on this trip.",
