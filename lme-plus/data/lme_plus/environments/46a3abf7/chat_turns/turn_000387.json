I've been really impressed with the brand I recently discovered that offers facial creams and serums in recyclable glass jars and has a \"return and recycle\" program for their packaging. It's amazing to see companies taking steps towards sustainability. Anyway, back to refill options - I'll definitely look into those brands and see which ones align with my values. Do you know if there are any online platforms or resources that help consumers find eco-friendly and sustainable skincare products?",
