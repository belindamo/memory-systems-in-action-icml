Films often explore these themes through the portrayal of characters at different stages of life, and the challenges and experiences they face.\n\nFor example, the film \"Boyhood\" follows the life of a young boy as he grows up over a period of 12 years, exploring the challenges and experiences of childhood and adolescence. The film provides a powerful portrayal of the complex and dynamic nature of human development, and the ways in which individual experiences shape our identity and personality.\n\n7.
