  "content": "API CO2 Booster is a great product, but it's primarily designed to provide a CO2 boost for plants that require high CO2 levels, like those in a planted tank with a CO2 system. While it does contain some micronutrients, it's not a comprehensive fertilizer for aquatic plants.\n\nFor Amazon Swords and Water Wisteria, you'll want to use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer that provides a broad spectrum of essential nutrients. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Seachem Flourish**: This is a popular, balanced fertilizer that provides nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. It's easy to use and suitable for a wide range of aquatic plants.\n2. **API Aquarium Fertilizer**: This is a balanced fertilizer specifically designed for aquatic plants, providing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. It's easy to use and comes in a variety of sizes.\n3. **Tropica Plant Nutrition**: This is a high-quality, balanced fertilizer that provides a broad spectrum of nutrients for aquatic plants. It's a bit more expensive than the other options, but it's a great choice for those who want a premium fertilizer.\n\nWhen choosing a fertilizer, look for the following key nutrients:\n\n* Nitrogen (N): promotes leaf growth and green color\n* Phosphorus (P): promotes root growth and flower production\n* Potassium (K): promotes overall plant health and resistance to disease\n* Micronutrients (e.g., iron, calcium, magnesium): essential for plant growth and development\n\nDosing instructions will vary depending on the fertilizer you choose, so be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. As a general rule, start with a low dose and gradually increase as needed, based on plant growth and water test results.\n\nFor your Amazon Swords and Water Wisteria, you can start with a dose of 1-2 teaspoons per 10 gallons of water, 1-2 times a week. Monitor the plants' response and adjust the dose as needed.\n\nRemember to always test your water parameters regularly to ensure the fertilizer is not causing any imbalances. Happy planting!",
