  "content": "Certainly! Here's how you can establish guidelines for determining complexity:\n\n1. Develop a checklist: Create a checklist of the characteristics you've identified as indicative of a complex property. This checklist should be clear, concise, and easy to follow, and it should include objective criteria that can be consistently applied.\n2. Assign a score: For each characteristic on the checklist, assign a score that reflects the level of complexity the characteristic contributes to the property. For example, you could assign a score of 1 for characteristics that are relatively simple or straightforward, and a score of 5 for characteristics that are highly complex or challenging.\n3. Determine a threshold score: Based on the scores you've assigned, determine a threshold score that indicates when an appraisal order qualifies as complex. This threshold score could be set based on the average score for past appraisal orders, industry standards, or other relevant factors.\n4. Provide clear instructions: Make sure the guidelines are clear and easy to follow, and provide detailed instructions on how to use the checklist and scoring system to determine whether an appraisal order is complex.\n5. Review and adjust: Regularly review and adjust the guidelines as necessary to ensure that they remain relevant and effective. This could involve updating the checklist, changing the threshold score, or making other modifications as needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to establish clear and objective guidelines for determining complexity that your team can use consistently. These guidelines will help ensure that your team is able to accurately determine when an appraisal order is complex and request a higher fee when appropriate.",
