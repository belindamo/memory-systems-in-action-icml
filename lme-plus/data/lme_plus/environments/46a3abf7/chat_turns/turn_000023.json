The chart is based on the circumference of your hand, measured around the knuckles. Here's a general guideline:\n\n* Small: 7-7.5 inches (18-19 cm)\n* Medium: 7.5-8 inches (19-20 cm)\n* Large: 8-8.5 inches (20-21 cm)\n* X-Large: 8.5-9 inches (21-23 cm)\n\n**Fit and Sizing:**\n\nIn general, Pearl Izumi gloves are known to run true to size. However, some riders have reported that they fit slightly snug, especially if you have larger hands or prefer a more relaxed fit. It's always a good idea to try on gloves before purchasing, if possible.\n\n**Tips for Sizing:**\n\n1. **Measure your hand:** Take the time to measure your hand circumference to ensure you're getting the right size.\n2. **Consider your riding style:** If you prefer a more relaxed fit or have larger hands, you may want to size up.\n3. **Check the cuff length:** If you have shorter or longer arms, you may want to consider the cuff length. Pearl Izumi gloves have a slightly longer cuff to provide additional protection and coverage.\n4. **Read reviews:** Check out reviews from other riders to get a sense of how the gloves fit and whether they run true to size.\n\n**Exchange and Return Policy:**\n\nIf you do end up purchasing the Pearl Izumi Select Gloves and find that they don't fit quite right, most online retailers and bike shops have a return or exchange policy in place. Be sure to check the return window and any requirements for returns or exchanges.\n\n**Try Before You Buy:**\n\nIf possible, try on the gloves before purchasing. This will give you a chance to ensure the fit is comfortable and suitable for your riding style.\n\nI hope this helps you with sizing and fitting the Pearl Izumi Select Gloves.
