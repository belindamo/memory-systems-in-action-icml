  "content": "I've been learning about aquarium keeping for about 6 months now, and I've had some experience with cycling a tank. My old tank was a 5-gallon one that I got from my cousin, and I kept a solitary betta fish named Finley. I've since set up a new 20-gallon community tank, and I want to make sure I'm doing everything right. Can you tell me more about how to maintain a healthy biological filter in my tank?",
