I think that would really help keep the conversation going and encourage members to participate. And I like the idea of featuring a \"Member of the Month\" to highlight someone's achievements or experiences.\n\nRegarding the group's privacy settings, I think a private group would be a good idea. It would allow alumni to connect with each other in a more personal setting and share their experiences and stories without feeling like they're broadcasting to the whole world.\n\nBy the way, speaking of sharing experiences, I recently posted a photo of my trip to Hawaii on Instagram, and it got a great response - 50 likes on March 2nd! It's always exciting to share your travel experiences with others and get feedback.\n\nBut back to the alumni group... Do you think I should create a few different channels or categories within the group for different topics, such as job opportunities, events, or just general chat?",
