  "content": "Yes, even though the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many aspects of the tourism and entertainment industry, there have been reports of new roadside attractions opening up during the pandemic. The opening of new attractions likely reflects the optimism of entrepreneurs and tourists regardless of the pandemic's uncertainty. \n\nFor example, the world's largest drive-through light show, called WonderLAnd, opened in Los Angeles in November 2020 during the pandemic's peak. It opened with COVID-19 safety protocols in place, such as the requirement for guests to stay in their cars throughout the experience.\n\nAdditionally, there are reports of new attractions opening up in various places, such as theme parks, museums, outdoor adventure centers, and zoos. These new attractions also take into account the new safety measures required to keep guests safe and healthy amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
