  "content": "The Pearl Izumi Select Gloves do have some features that help them perform well in wet conditions, although they're not fully waterproof. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Water-resistant treatment:**\n\nThe gloves have a water-resistant treatment on the palm and fingers, which helps repel water and reduce the amount of water that penetrates the material. This treatment is designed to provide some protection against light rain or wet roads, but it's not a guarantee against complete waterproofing.\n\n**Pittards WR100X palm material:**\n\nThe Pittards WR100X palm material is also water-resistant and helps to reduce the amount of water that absorbs into the palm. This material is designed to maintain its grip and durability even when wet, which is important for riders who frequently ride in wet conditions.\n\n**Breathability:**\n\nThe breathable mesh on the back of the hand helps to allow moisture to escape, which can help reduce the feeling of clamminess and discomfort when riding in wet conditions. This mesh also helps to dry the gloves faster when they do get wet.\n\n**Grip:**\n\nThe grip on the Pearl Izumi Select Gloves is designed to be effective in both dry and wet conditions. The Pittards WR100X palm material provides a secure grip on the handlebars, even when wet, which is important for riders who need to maintain control in slippery conditions.\n\n**Water ingress:**\n\nWhile the gloves are not fully waterproof, they do have a waterproofing strip at the cuff to help prevent water from entering the glove through the wrist opening. This strip is designed to provide an additional layer of protection against water ingress.\n\n**Performance in heavy rain:**\n\nIn heavy rain or prolonged exposure to wet conditions, the Pearl Izumi Select Gloves may not keep your hands completely dry. However, they will still provide some protection and grip, and the water-resistant treatment and breathable mesh will help to minimize the amount of water that enters the glove.\n\n**Care and maintenance:**\n\nTo ensure the gloves continue to perform well in wet conditions, it's essential to care for them properly. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the water-resistant treatment. Instead, use a gentle soap and water to clean the gloves, and allow them to air dry.\n\nOverall, the Pearl Izumi Select Gloves are designed to provide a good balance of grip, comfort, and water resistance. While they're not fully waterproof, they'll still perform well in wet conditions and provide a secure grip on the handlebars.",
