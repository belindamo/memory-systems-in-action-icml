  "content": "Exploring historical landmarks in Egypt on your own is possible, but safety should always be a top priority. Egypt is generally a safe country for tourists, but there are some safety concerns to be aware of, such as pickpocketing and occasional instances of terrorism. It is recommended to take caution and stay aware of your surroundings when exploring on your own.\n\nIf you do decide to explore on your own, it is recommended that you hire a licensed tour guide to accompany you for safety reasons and to get the most out of your experience. Licensed tour guides can also provide valuable information about the history and culture of the landmarks you are visiting.\n\nIt is also important to research the landmarks you want to visit and plan your itinerary accordingly to ensure that you know their opening hours, visiting policies, and are able to navigate the area safely.\n\nOverall, while it is possible to explore historical landmarks in Egypt on your own, hiring a licensed tour guide or going with a reputable tour company can help ensure your safety and enhance your overall experience.",
