Here's a list of the expenses you've mentioned:\n\n**Max (Golden Retriever)**\n\n* Flea and tick prevention medication: $______\n* Nail clippers: $______\n* Brush: $______\n* First aid kit: $______ (assuming this is for both pets, we can split the cost later)\n\n**Whiskers (Cat)**\n\n* Flea and tick prevention medication: $______\n* Cat tower: $______\n* Litter: $______\n\nCan you please fill in the amounts for each item? If you don't have the exact amounts, estimates are fine.\n\nOnce we have the amounts, I can help you total them up and provide some suggestions for organizing your pet expenses going forward.\n\nAlso, do you want to split the cost of the first aid kit between Max and Whiskers, or assign it to one pet in particular?",
