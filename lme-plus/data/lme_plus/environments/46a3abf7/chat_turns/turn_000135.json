Choose cherries that are plump and firm to the touch, with bright and shiny skin.\n\n2. Look for cherries with fresh green stems, as this indicates that they were recently picked.\n\n3. Avoid cherries that are soft or mushy, have wrinkled skin, or have brown spots.\n\n4. Aim for cherries that are in season and local, which typically means they will be at their freshest and most flavorful.\n\n5. When buying cherries, consider the variety. Here are some popular types of cherries and their flavor profiles:\n\n   - Bing cherries: large and sweet, with a deep red color.\n   \n   - Rainier cherries: yellow and red, with a sweet and delicate flavor.\n   \n   - Skeena cherries: sweet and tangy, with a dark red color.\n   \n   - Lapin cherries: firm and juicy, with a flavor that balances sweetness and acidity.\n   \n   - Sweetheart cherries: heart-shaped, deep red, and sweet with a hint of tartness.\n\n6. If you can, buy cherries with the stem intact as it helps keep them fresh longer.\n\n7. Store cherries in the refrigerator in a plastic bag or container with a lid to help prevent them from spoiling. However, try to eat them within a week as they can quickly lose their freshness and flavor.\n\nI hope these tips help you find the best cherries and enjoy cooking with them!",
