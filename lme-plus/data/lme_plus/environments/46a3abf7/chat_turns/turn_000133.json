  "content": "Yes, dried cherries would work well in the cherry and balsamic crostini. They will lend a sweet and slightly chewy texture to the appetizer. When using dried cherries, it's best to rehydrate them first by soaking them in warm water or a mixture of warm water and vinegar for 10-15 minutes before using them in the crostini. This will help soften them and make them more pliable. You may also want to roughly chop the dried cherries to make them easier to bite into. Give it a try and let me know how it turns out!",
