I had commented on the original post, sharing some statistics about carbon emissions, and someone responded with a skeptical remark. We went back and forth for a bit, but eventually, I decided to just agree to disagree and move on. That was on a Wednesday evening, around 8 pm, when I was taking a break from studying.",
