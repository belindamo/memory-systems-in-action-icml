  "content": "Certainly! Here's another example of a checklist of the characteristics of a complex property:\n\n1. Location:\n\t* Does the property have a unique or challenging location, such as being situated in a difficult-to-reach area, near a hazardous waste site, or in a historic district?\n\t* Is the property located in a rapidly changing or developing area?\n2. Property type and design:\n\t* Does the property have an unusual or complex design, such as a multi-unit building, a property with multiple levels, or a property with an attached garage?\n\t* Does the property have unique or special features, such as a swimming pool, a hot tub, or a large deck?\n3. Age and condition:\n\t* Is the property significantly older or newer than the typical properties in the area?\n\t* Does the property require extensive repairs or renovations?\n4. Zoning and land use:\n\t* Does the property have unique zoning or land use restrictions, such as being located in a floodplain, a conservation area, or a designated historic district?\n\t* Is the property located in an area with complex land use regulations or restrictions?\n5. Market conditions:\n\t* Is the property located in an area with rapidly appreciating or declining markets?\n\t* Does the property's market have unique economic or demographic characteristics, such as a large number of vacation homes or a significant number of high-end properties?\n\nAgain, this is just one example of a checklist of the characteristics of a complex property, and the specific characteristics you include on the checklist will depend on the local market and the types of properties you encounter. The important thing is to create a clear, concise, and easy-to-follow checklist that includes objective criteria that can be consistently applied.",
