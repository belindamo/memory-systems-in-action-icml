Hearing personal experiences from those who have been to the restaurants can provide more trustworthy information. As an AI model, I don't have personal experiences, but I can suggest reaching out to friends or family members who have traveled to Egypt and dined in the area near these landmarks, or checking online forums for advice from locals or recent visitors. You can also check travel blogs or vlogs from bloggers and vloggers who have visited Egypt and explore the food and dining options there.",
