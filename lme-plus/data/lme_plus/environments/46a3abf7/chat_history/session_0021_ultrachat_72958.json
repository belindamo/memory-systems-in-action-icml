Keep track of your sources: Keep a list of all the sources you consult during your research, and make sure to properly cite them in your paper.\n\n4. Use a plagiarism checker: There are many plagiarism checkers available online, which can help you identify any instances of accidental plagiarism in your paper.\n\n5. Consult your professor or a writing center: If you are uncertain about how to properly cite a source or have any other questions about avoiding plagiarism, don't hesitate to consult your professor or a writing center.\n\nRemember, unintentional plagiarism can still have serious consequences, so it's important that you take the necessary precautions to ensure that your paper is ethical and properly cited."
