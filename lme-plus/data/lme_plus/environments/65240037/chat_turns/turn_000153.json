  "content": "As previously mentioned, the title of the review that positively indicates gender neutrality is \"Not just for boys.\" Here's a quote from the review that supports this belief:\n\n\"This is a great product... I have a 10 year old boy and an eight year old girl who are nearly the same size... When they arrived the absolute only difference is that inside the hood around the neck the \u201cboys\u201d hoodie has blue stitching... but it kind of irritated me that the other was labeled for girls when there\u2019s nothing different about the two, except the cost.\"\n\nThis review title and quote show that the reviewer recognizes that the hoodie sweatshirt is not specific to one gender and that it is unfair to label similar products differently for boys and girls. The reviewer believes that all children, regardless of their gender, should have access to the same products at the same price point.",
