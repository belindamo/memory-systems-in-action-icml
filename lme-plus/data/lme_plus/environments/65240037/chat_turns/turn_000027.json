You can update the \"Flight Costs\" column once you have a better idea of the ticket price.\n\nFor now, let's focus on estimating the food and activity costs for your previous LAX trips. Do you think you can give me a rough estimate of your daily expenses for food and activities during those trips? Was it around $50-100 per day, or more/less?\n\nOnce we have those estimates, we can calculate the total cost for each trip and get a better sense of your overall travel expenses.\n\nAlso, feel free to add any other details you think might be relevant for your Chicago trip, such as the meeting dates or any specific transportation or accommodation arrangements.",
