In 2003, a poll by the Eurobarometer survey indicated that 68% of Bulgarians supported membership. However, as Bulgaria\u2019s entry approached, support for EU membership began to decline. \n\nIn the years following Bulgaria\u2019s entry to the EU, opinion polls have shown a fluctuation in public opinion, but remain largely divided. According to Eurobarometer surveys, support for Bulgaria's EU membership was at its highest in 2009 when 57% of the respondents were in favor of EU membership. Nevertheless, this support began to decline over the years, with the lowest approval rating (33%) found in 2014. \n\nSome of the most common reasons for the decrease in support for Bulgaria's EU membership are corruption, economic instability, and perceived unequal treatment within the EU. \n\nWhen Bulgaria joined the EU, many felt it was a significant step towards improving the country's economic and democratic prospects. However, some Bulgarians felt that the EU wasn't fulfilling its commitments regarding the promised development of the Bulgarian economy or tackling corruption. These concerns are still prevalent today. \n\nIn conclusion, public opinion on Bulgaria's EU membership has been mixed, with support fluctuating over time. Concerns about corruption, economic instability, and unequal treatment within the EU continue to influence the opinions of many Bulgarians.",
