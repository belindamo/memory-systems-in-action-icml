Here are some tips to help you keep your flour in top condition:\n\n1. **Airtight containers**: Store your flour in airtight containers, such as glass or plastic bins with tight-fitting lids. This will help to keep moisture, air, and pests out.\n2. **Cool, dry place**: Store your flour in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing flour near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight, as this can cause the flour to degrade.\n3. **Away from strong-smelling foods**: Flour can absorb odors easily, so it's best to store it away from strong-smelling foods like onions, garlic, and spices.\n4. **Freezer storage**: If you don't plan to use your flour within a few months, consider storing it in the freezer. Freezing will help to preserve the flour's nutritional content and flavor. Simply transfer the flour to an airtight container or freezer bag, making sure to press out as much air as possible before sealing.\n5. **Use the \"first in, first out\" rule**: Make sure to use the oldest flour first to ensure that you're not storing old flour for too long.\n6. **Check for pests**: Regularly inspect your flour for signs of pests, such as tiny insects or webs. If you notice any, discard the flour immediately.\n7. **Use a flour scoop or spoon**: When scooping flour, use a dry flour scoop or spoon to prevent moisture from entering the container.\n8. **Avoid bulk storage**: While it might be tempting to buy flour in bulk, it's better to store smaller quantities to maintain freshness. If you do buy in bulk, consider dividing the flour into smaller containers and storing them separately.\n9. **Label and date containers**: Label each container with the date you stored the flour and the type of flour it is. This will help you keep track of how long you've had the flour and ensure you're using the oldest flour first.\n10. **Use within 6-12 months**: Bread flour typically has a shelf life of 6-12 months. If you've had the flour for longer than that, it's best to use it for cooking or baking purposes other than bread making.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to maintain the quality and freshness of your bread flour and continue to enjoy the wonderful breads you've been making!",
