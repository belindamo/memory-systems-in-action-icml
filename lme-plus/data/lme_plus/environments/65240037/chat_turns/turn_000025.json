Can you give me a rough idea of how much you spent on food and activities during each trip? Was it around $50-100 per day, or more/less?\n\nYou can also break down food and activities into separate columns if you'd like, but for now, we can keep it simple.\n\nOnce we have these estimates, we can calculate the total cost for each trip and get a better sense of your overall travel expenses.\n\nAlso, do you have any upcoming trips planned that you'd like to track as well?",
