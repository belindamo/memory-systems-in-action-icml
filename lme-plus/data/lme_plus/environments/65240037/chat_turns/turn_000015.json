  "content": "Bulgarians have expressed concerns about perceived unequal treatment of their country within the EU in various areas. Some of the most commonly cited areas of concern are:\n\n1. Access to funding: Some Bulgarians feel that their country has not been given equal access to EU funding and that other, more developed countries have been given preferential treatment.\n\n2. Political representation: Some Bulgarians believe that their country is not adequately represented in the EU's political institutions, such as the European Parliament and the European Commission.\n\n3. Media coverage: Bulgarian media has frequently reported on what it perceives as negative or biased coverage of the country by Western European media outlets. The country's image is often portrayed in a poor light in terms of its democratic institutions and social problems, which some Bulgarians view as unfair.\n\n4. Discrimination against Bulgarian citizens: Some Bulgarians believe that their citizens are discriminated against, particularly in Western Europe, on issues such as employment, housing, and access to social services.\n\n5. Corruption and the rule of law: Concerns about corruption and the rule of law have been ongoing since Bulgaria's accession to the EU, and some Bulgarians feel that European institutions have not done enough to address these issues.\n\nSome Bulgarians may also feel that their country is viewed as a second-class EU citizen, with less influence and power than other member states. These concerns have led to increased Euroscepticism in Bulgaria, particularly among those who believe that the country is not being treated fairly within the EU.",
