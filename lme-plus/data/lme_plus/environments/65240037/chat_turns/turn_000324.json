I'm a blank slate!\n\nTo get started, could you please tell me what supplies you think you need to pick up from the farm supplier? That way, I can help you create a list and keep track of it for you.\n\nAdditionally, what other tasks do you need to accomplish on your farm? Do you have a to-do list already, or would you like to create one together?",
