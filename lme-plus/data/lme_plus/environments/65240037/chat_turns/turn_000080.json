Dog bed from PetSmart - $40\n2. Stainless steel food bowl from Amazon - $15\n3. Grain-free kibble (one-time purchase, amount TBD)\n4. Measuring cup from local pet store - $5\n5. Shampoo from the vet - $10\n\nWhat about vet visits or any preventative care for Max, like flea and tick medication or heartworm prevention? Have you purchased any of those recently?",
