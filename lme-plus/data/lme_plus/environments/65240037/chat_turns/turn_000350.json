  "content": "Yes, sometimes a workload can feel truly overwhelming, and in those cases, it can be helpful to try the following tips:\n\n1. Ask for help: Don't be afraid to reach out to a coworker for help or support. There may be tasks that could be delegated to someone else.\n\n2. Re-prioritize: Take a close look at your to-do list and reorganize it. Sometimes, we can find that certain tasks are not as critical as we thought.\n\n3. Break down projects: Divide large projects into smaller, achievable steps. This can help to make the overall task feel more manageable.\n\n4. Set boundaries: Communicate with your supervisor, colleagues and friends about your workload, and set realistic boundaries for yourself to avoid over-committing.\n\n5. Take a mental health day: It can be hard to take time off, but taking a break can help you to recharge and come back to work with more focus.\n\n6. Get organized: Spend some time reorganizing your physical and virtual workspaces so you can find what you need more easily. This can also help to reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nRemember, managing excessive workloads can be challenging, but it's important to prioritize your well-being. Take time to implement coping strategies that work for you, and always remember that it's okay to ask for assistance.",
