  "content": "Feta cheese is a fantastic addition to the Quinoa Salad! The salty, tangy flavor of feta will complement the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes and the earthiness of the quinoa perfectly. It's a classic Greek-inspired combination that will elevate the dish to a whole new level.\n\nCrumbled feta will also add a nice texture to the salad, providing a pleasant contrast to the soft quinoa and juicy tomatoes. Just be sure not to overdo it with the amount of feta, as it can be quite strong. A sprinkle of crumbled feta should be enough to add flavor without overpowering the other ingredients.\n\nHere's a rough guide to get you started:\n\n* Add about 1/4 cup of crumbled feta cheese to the quinoa salad\n* Toss gently to combine, making sure the feta is evenly distributed\n\nRemember, you can always adjust the amount of feta to your taste. If you prefer a stronger feta flavor, add a bit more. If you're looking for a more subtle hint of feta, start with a smaller amount and add more to taste.\n\nWith the feta addition, your Quinoa Salad will now have a delightful Mediterranean twist, pairing beautifully with your Lentil and Veggie Burgers. Enjoy!",
