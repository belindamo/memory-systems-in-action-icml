Quinoa Salad with Vegetables and Grilled Chicken: Cook a batch of quinoa and grill chicken breasts on Sunday. Chop up vegetables like cucumber, cherry tomatoes, avocado, and bell peppers. Mix everything together with a light dressing for a nutritious and filling lunch.\n\n2. Lentil Stew: Cook lentils with vegetables like carrots, onions, and celery in a slow cooker. You can add some spices and herbs to flavor it up. This is a great option for those cold winter days when you need something warm and comforting.\n\n3. Mason Jar Salads: These are perfect for people who like to meal prep in advance. Layer your ingredients in a mason jar starting with the dressing on the bottom, followed by grains, protein, and vegetables. Salad greens should go last so that they don't get soggy. These can be made up to 3 days in advance.\n\n4. Sweet Potato and Black Bean Enchiladas: Roast sweet potatoes and assemble black bean enchiladas on Sunday. Then bake them on the day you want to eat them for a warm, satisfying and healthy meal.\n\n5. Soup: Make a big batch of soup with vegetables, protein, and grains like barley or quinoa. Freeze it in individual portions and reheat it for a quick and easy lunch or dinner.",
