Try roasting carrots, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or sweet potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n2. **Quinoa Salad:** Cook quinoa and let it cool. Mix it with chopped veggies like tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers. Add a simple vinaigrette made with olive oil, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt.\n3. **Grilled or Saut\u00e9ed Greens:** Quickly cook a handful of spinach, kale, or collard greens with some garlic and lemon juice. This side dish is packed with nutrients and will help balance the meal.\n4. **Sweet Potato Fries:** Bake or grill sliced sweet potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. They make a delicious and crispy side dish that's healthier than regular fries.\n5. **Avocado Slaw:** Mix diced avocado with chopped red cabbage, carrots, and a squeeze of lime juice. This creamy slaw adds a refreshing touch to the meal.\n6. **Lemon-Herb Brown Rice:** Cook brown rice with lemon juice, olive oil, and chopped fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro.
