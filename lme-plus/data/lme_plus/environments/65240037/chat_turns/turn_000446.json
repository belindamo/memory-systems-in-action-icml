Therefore, it's not possible to find out what items are on sale this week or earn points in its loyalty program.\n\nIf you're looking to plan your shopping trip and maximize your savings, I suggest checking the websites or apps of real grocery stores in your area to see what items are on sale and what loyalty programs they offer. You can also consider using online resources such as Flipp or Checkout 51 to find deals and discounts on the items you need.\n\nAdditionally, if you have a specific store in mind, feel free to let me know and I can try to help you find their weekly ads or loyalty program details!",
