  "content": "The length of time it takes Depeche Mode to plan and rehearse for a major concert can vary depending on the size and complexity of the show. Generally, a major concert can take several months to plan, and rehearsals can also take several weeks, with the band members practicing and perfecting their performances, and the production team working on technical aspects such as lighting, sound, and visuals. The length of rehearsals and the number of rehearsals required may also depend on the band's familiarity with the material, the complexity of the setlist, and any new technical elements that need to be incorporated into the show.",
