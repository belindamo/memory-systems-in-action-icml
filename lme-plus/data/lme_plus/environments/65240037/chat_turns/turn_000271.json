  "content": "All of the techniques listed involve some level of mathematics, but if we are specifically looking for an example that involves discrete mathematics, we could point to Fault Tree Analysis (FTA).\n\nFTA involves constructing a tree diagram to analyze the possible combinations of events that can lead to a specific failure. This technique is based on Boolean logic and combinatorial mathematics, which are both important areas of discrete mathematics. Therefore, Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is an example of a risk management technique that involves discrete mathematics.",
