We can add more columns or categories as needed. Here's a suggested template:\n\n**Travel Expenses Template:**\n\n| Date | Trip Details | Flight Costs | Transportation Costs | Accommodation Costs | Food & Activities | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nYou can add rows for each trip, and columns for each type of expense. For your recent trips, you can fill in the costs we discussed earlier:\n\n| Date | Trip Details | Flight Costs | Transportation Costs | Accommodation Costs | Food & Activities | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Month | NYC to LAX (Trip 1) | $500 | $60 | ? | ? | ? |\n| Month | NYC to LAX (Trip 2) | $500 | $0 | ? | ? | ? |\n\nNow, let's focus on accommodation costs. What were your accommodation costs for each trip? Did you stay at the same hotel both times, or were they different?\n\nAlso, do you want to track food and activity expenses as well, or would you like to focus on flights, transportation, and accommodations for now?",
