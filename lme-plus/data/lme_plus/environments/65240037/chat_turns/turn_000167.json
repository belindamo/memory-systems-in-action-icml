  "content": "A mix of fresh fruits, granola bars, and trail mix is a great choice for a snack that's both healthy and easy to eat.\n\nRegarding regulations and guidelines, it's always a good idea to check with the Children's Museum administration or event organizers to see if they have any specific rules or restrictions when it comes to food and drinks. Here are some general guidelines you might want to consider:\n\n1. **Allergy Awareness**: Be mindful of common food allergies like peanuts, tree nuts, gluten, dairy, and soy. Consider labeling the snacks with ingredients used, so that volunteers with allergies can make informed choices.\n2. **Food Safety**: Ensure that all snacks are stored, handled, and served safely to prevent contamination and foodborne illnesses.\n3. **Waste Disposal**: Make sure to have a plan in place for disposing of trash and recyclables.\n4. **Cleanliness**: Encourage volunteers to wash their hands before handling food and to clean up after themselves.\n5. **Special Diets**: If you're aware of any volunteers with specific dietary needs (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, halal, kosher), try to accommodate them with suitable options.\n\nIn terms of specific regulations, you might want to check on:\n\n1. **Food Permits**: Depending on the museum's policies or local health codes, you might need to obtain a special permit or license to serve food and drinks.\n2. **Labeling and Signage**: You may need to label the snacks with ingredients, allergen warnings, or other relevant information.\n3. **Food Preparation**: Some museums might have specific guidelines for food preparation, handling, and storage.\n\nIt's always better to err on the side of caution and check with the museum administration or event organizers to ensure you're meeting their requirements and guidelines. They may have specific rules or recommendations for volunteer snacks, so it's best to confirm in advance.\n\nI hope that helps, and I'm sure your snack selection will be a hit with the volunteers!",
