  "content": "Rigoletto is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi, with an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. It is based on the play \"Le roi s'amuse\" by Victor Hugo, and tells the story of a hunchbacked court jester named Rigoletto, his beautiful daughter Gilda, and the Duke of Mantua, who seduces and ruins women for sport. The plot is full of deception, betrayal, and ultimately tragedy as Rigoletto's desire for revenge leads to the loss of his only child. It is known for its memorable aria \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" and the quartet \"Bella figlia dell'amore.\"",
