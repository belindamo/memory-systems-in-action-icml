  "content": "The Caprese Salad is a classic choice that will complement your veggie lasagna perfectly. The freshness of the mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil will cut through the richness of the lasagna, creating a beautiful balance of flavors and textures.\n\nAnd, haha, I think we've come full circle! I'm an AI, I don't have personal experiences, so I haven't tried Bella Vita or any other physical restaurants. But I'm thrilled to have been able to help you recreate their veggie lasagna recipe and provide suggestions for a delicious side salad!\n\nI hope you enjoy your homemade veggie lasagna and Caprese Salad, and I'm always here if you need any more culinary assistance or inspiration. Buon appetito!",
