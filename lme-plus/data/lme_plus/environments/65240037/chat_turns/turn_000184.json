  "content": "Another, historically even more interesting problem, was the quadrature of the circle. This asked\nthe philosopher to construct a square, similar (in area ) to a given circle. The problem was interesting,\nof course, because of the divine nature of the circle and orb \u2014 one might also ask for the\nconstruction of a cube similar (in content) to a given orb. That it proved to be quite a nut to\ncrack, only added to the mysterious nature of the circle and encouraged mysticism. But it also\nstimulated philosophers to attempt to resolve the problem with help of geometria.\nOne of the oldest known attempts to solve the problem of the quadrature of the circle, were the\nso-called moons of Hippocrates. Hippocrates of Chios (470 - 410) was a wealthy merchant with\nan appetite for geometria. Allegedly, he was the first to determine the height of the Egyptian pyramids,\nby measuring their shadows and using similarity. Ancient rumour has it, that he was the\nfirst to write a \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (Elements), but like with many of these old philosophers, most things we\nknow of him are from the scribbles of people decades after his demise.\nMathematical worlds 26\nIllustration I.2: The simplest form of Hippocrates\u2019 moons. In the semi-circle (II-III-IV) draw the equilateral triangle\n(III). This triangle is rectangular as a result of the theorem of Thales. The two equal sides of (III) have a ratio to the\nhypothenuse as 1:\u221a2. The small semicircles (I-II and IV-V) on the sides of the triangle therefor are in ratio to the\nbigger semi-circle (II-III) as 1:2. With other words: both small semicircles (I-II and IV-V) together are the same as the\nbig semi-circle (II-III-IV). By removing the common pieces (II and IV), one may observe that the moon-shape figures\nI en V are the same (have the same area) as III.\nAnyway, the moons of Hippocrates are somewhat known, and seemed to offer a way to solve the\nquadrature of the circle. He showed that moon-shaped figures, bounded by different circle segments,\ncould be quadrated rather easily. If it was possible to turn the circle into a puzzle of these\nmoon-shaped objects, he could have solved the problem. It turned out to be a dead end.\nE u c l i d s E l e m e n t s\nWho speaks of the \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (The Elements) nowadays, nearly always refers to The Elements by Euclid,\none of the philosophers who was active around 300 BC in the then thriving political, economical\nand scientific centre of Alexandria, in present-day Egypt, one of many cities of that name in\nthe Alexandrian empire. In many ways, the thirteen books of The Elements have influenced the\nhistory of western culture, and it is one of the most well-known texts from antiquity. It rightly\ndeserves to be so, since as a text it is a stunning example of geometria and it deserves our separate\nattention for that reason alone. We do however have to realise two important aspects of the\nwork, before we marvel at its beauty. First, to Euclid it may have been a textbook or not, but it\ncertainly wasn\u2019t a textbook as we know it. One of the important differences with our present-day\ntextbooks is that it was written and copied, never printed. This may look obvious, but pre-printing\npress culture did not allow for exact copies, neither did it strive for exact copies to be made\nand therefor all the surviving copies of the books, thirteen scrolls or chapters in the most extensive\nversion, show a lot of similarities, but are not the same. Essential part of the various copies of\nThe Elements, for example, were the commentaries, written in the margin by the philosopher (or\npupil) studying the text or reading it aloud. Sometimes the commentaries to a text throughout\nthe centuries became a part of the text itself. In some of the surviving copies these commentaries\nare a substantial part of the manuscript. Second, we don\u2019t know what the original text by\nEuclid looked like. Our closest examples are Arabian sources, produced centuries after the original\nwork, and some Greek text fragments, dating from 100 AD. Much of what we know about the\nbook has been tainted by late nineteenth century views of the work. It is important to realise\nthat \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 (geometria) was about measuring \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9 (the world). That world is not easily recognised\nin the scrolls of the \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, but may be recognised by the one who is able to read between\nthe lines \u2014 and who is able to see that present-day edited versions of The Elements are the\nresult of extensive attention paid by scholars who value our (or late nineteenth century) ideas of\nmathematics, rather than the ancient ideas of geometria. The ancient ideas are notable in book II,\nwhich is an introduction to the problem of the quadrature of the circle; in book XIII which ends\nwith the theorem that there are exactly five regular or Platonic solids, exactly the number of\nelements in Aristotelian physics. This was the subject that could help the philosopher reach into\nthe deeper divine structure of the world order.\nThe Elements presents the reader to the elementary parts of geometria. It starts with a list of defnitions,\nreferring to the objects the reader knows about from drawing figures in the sand but in\nan idealised form: a point is which has no part, a line is length without width. After thus having\nestablished common ground, Euclid presents his axioms and hypotheses, which are the basis of\nMathematical worlds 27\nhis reasoning. The axioms reflect the necessities and possibilities of constructing objects in an\nideal world. So, for example, it is required to be able to construct a circle with any given centre\nand radius, and to prolong a straight line indefinitely, which is of course not always possible in\nthe sand of the average Greek beach. Straight lines and circles are the only objects that exist at\nthe start, the rest is to be constructed. This reflects the divine origin of these objects. The hypotheses\nor postulates are slightly different in nature. They are important steps in reasoning and in\nthat sense the explicit mention of these reasons are stunning: equal things, with equal things\nadded, are equal. The general phrasing allows the reader to apply this rule to line segments, areas,\nvolumes and angles alike. What follows are a list of definitions, theorems and proofs, constructions\nand proofs.\nMathematical worlds 28\nIllustration I.3: classical proof of the Pythagorean theorem from The Elements, theorem I.47. To the left a fragment\nfrom a ninth century Greek manuscript, with marginal notes. To the right a modern reproduction of the illustration\nthe text refers to. On triangle ABC with right angle in C the squares ABDE, BCHK and ACFG are constructed\n(this construction is actually described and proven correct in I.42) CL is drawn parallel to AD and CD and FB are\ndrawn. The proof hinges on the equality of triangle ABF and ACD, which in turn are equal to ACF and ADM, which\nare equal to half the square ACFG and half the rectangle ADLM. Similarly the equality of square BCHK and rectangle\nBELM are proven. Thereby, I.47 not only proofs that the two squares on the rectangular sides are equal to\nthe square on the hypothenuse, but even shows the reader exactly how to make the figures fit!\nBook I consists of elementary triangle geometry, starting from the construction of an equilateral\ntriangle, proof of the triangle inequality (so the fact that a straight line is the shortest path between\ntwo points), and ends with a beautiful proof of both the Pythagorean theorem (I.47) and\nits reverse (I.48). Book II treats a number of theorems that allow the reader to construct quadrangles\nthat are equal to a given figure. Euclid does this in a to the modern reader peculiar way,\nwithout referring to the area of the figures. He uses some general sense of \u201cmagnitude\u201d which\nmakes his theorems more general, but moreover, he never calculates. His version of geometria is\nstrictly about reasoning. As an example of his reasoning, here is theorem II.4: if a line segment is\ndivided into two parts, then the square on the whole line segment is equal to the squares on the\nparts plus two times the rectangle comprised by the two parts. Interpreted in modern day algebra\none could translate this to the formula (a+b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab, and indeed many historians\nhave done so. But by translating one looses the essence of geometria in Euclids work.\nBook II ends with the construction of a square which is the same (in the Euclidean sense) as a given\nn-gon. That way, the student of the book is optimally prepared to study the quadrature of\nthe circle.\nBooks VII-X treat subjects that we would nowadays consider as number theory. To Euclid, number\nwas just one of the earthly manifestations of the more general concept of \u201cmagnitude\u201d. The\nexamples in The Elements usually use line segments, but the theorems from these books are also\nreferred to in later books, and occasionally applied to other magnitudes, such as angles or solids.\nNumber is an amorphous subject to Euclid. Book VII starts with two theorems that together\nmake up the idea of calculating a greatest common divisor \u2014 nowadays known as the Euclidean\nalgorithm. Although indeed these two theorems, or rather, the proofs, do present to us the idea\nof how to do the calculation, the idea by Euclid was different in two significant ways. First, the\nproof is a proof of existence of a greatest common divisor, and that is also the way it is used in\nthe rest of The Elements: when these theorems are invoked in later parts, then the reason is always\nto back up the assumption that such a number exists. Being able to continue reasoning because\none knows a certain number or ratio exists, or actually calculating it, is quite something\ndifferent. Second, Euclid offers us two theorems, and he has a good reason to do so. To him unity\nwas not a number, it was the unit in which magnitudes could be expressed \u2014 which was an extra\nassumption in geometria. The special status of \u201cone\u201d was reflected in the two proofs, since Euclid\nfirst constructed the greatest common divisor of two magnitudes in the case these numbers\nwere co-prime, to construct it in all other cases in the second theorem.\nBooks XI-XIII treat the solids, with a notable sidestep at the start of book XII to proof that circles\nare in the ratio to one another as the squares on their diagonals. Euclid proofs that by double\ncontradiction: with help of the exhaustion principle he first shows that the ratio can\u2019t be smaller\nand after that, proving that it can\u2019t be larger either, leaving as the only option that the ratio has\nto be equal.",
