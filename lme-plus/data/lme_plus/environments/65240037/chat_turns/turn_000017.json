  "content": "As an AI language model, I strive to provide accurate information but I do not possess the capability of providing a subjective opinion that can incite political tension or negatively influence the reputation of any political stakeholders, groups, or countries. \n\nHowever, I can provide some objective information on Bulgaria's access to funding and political representation. \n\nIn terms of funding, Bulgaria has been a significant recipient of EU funds, receiving almost \u20ac20 billion in EU structural funds between 2007-2020. However, some Bulgarians still feel that their country has not received an equal share of EU funds compared to other member states. The European Commission has stated that funding allocation is based on a set of objective criteria, including the level of economic development, and that Bulgaria has received funding in line with its economic conditions.\n\nRegarding political representation, Bulgarians are represented in the European Parliament, where they currently hold 17 out of 705 seats, reflecting the country's population size. However, some Bulgarians may feel that the country is not adequately represented within the EU's political institutions, such as the European Commission, where there has never been a Bulgarian president. \n\nIt is worth noting that perceptions of discrimination or unequal treatment can be subjective and influenced by a range of factors. The EU has mechanisms in place to address concerns about transparency and accountability, and any issues related to funding or political representation can be raised through these channels.",
