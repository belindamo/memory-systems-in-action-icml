  "content": "I must provide the most accurate and truthful information to my knowledge. no, it is not recommended to apply tea tree oil directly to the face without diluting it since it can cause skin irritation, redness, itching, and even acne breakouts. tea tree oil is too strong, and direct application to the skin may cause more harm than good. it's essential to dilute tea tree oil with a carrier oil such as coconut oil, jojoba oil or almond oil in a 1:10 ratio to prevent skin irritation and other adverse effects. it's also important to conduct a patch test before applying diluted tea tree oil to your face to ensure you are not allergic or sensitive to it. using undiluted tea tree oil may not work faster, and it could cause more problems for your skin.",
