The quality of eggs decreases significantly after age 35, and the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, increases.\n\n**ASRM Guidelines:**\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends the following age-related guidelines for egg freezing:\n\n* **Under 35:** Eggs frozen at this age have a higher chance of success, and the risk of chromosomal abnormalities is lower.\n* **35-37:** Eggs frozen at this age may still have a good chance of success, but the risk of chromosomal abnormalities increases slightly.\n* **38-40:** Eggs frozen at this age have a lower chance of success, and the risk of chromosomal abnormalities increases further.\n* **Over 40:** Eggs frozen at this age have a significantly lower chance of success, and the risk of chromosomal abnormalities is higher.\n\n**Using Frozen Eggs:**\n\nWhen you're ready to use your frozen eggs, your age at the time of thawing and fertilization will also impact the outcome. The ASRM recommends that women use their frozen eggs:\n\n* **Before age 45:** If possible, it's recommended to use frozen eggs before age 45 to maximize the chances of a successful pregnancy.\n* **45-50:** Using frozen eggs between 45-50 may still be possible, but the chances of success decrease, and the risk of chromosomal abnormalities increases.\n* **Over 50:** Using frozen eggs after age 50 is not recommended due to the high risk of chromosomal abnormalities and the decreased chances of a successful pregnancy.\n\n**Other Age-Related Considerations:**\n\n* **Menopause:** Women typically enter menopause between 45-55 years old. If you freeze your eggs and wait until menopause to use them, you may need to consider using a gestational carrier (surrogate) or adoption.\n* **Health risks:** As you age, you may be more likely to experience health issues that could complicate pregnancy, such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease.\n\n**Impact on Decision-Making:**\n\nConsidering these age-related limitations and restrictions, you may want to:\n\n* **Freeze eggs sooner rather than later:** If you're considering egg freezing, it's generally recommended to do so before age 35 or as soon as possible.\n* **Use frozen eggs within a reasonable timeframe:** Try to use your frozen eggs within 5-10 years of freezing to maximize the chances of success.\n* **Plan for alternative options:** Consider other family-building options, such as using a donor egg or adoption, if you're concerned about the age-related limitations of using your frozen eggs.\n\nDiscuss these age-related factors with your fertility specialist to determine the best course of action for your individual situation.",
