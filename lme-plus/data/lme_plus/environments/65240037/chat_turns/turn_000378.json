I've got a recipe that's sure to please:\n\n**Flaky Pastry Dough Recipe (P\u00e2te Bris\u00e9e)**\n\nThis recipe makes about 1 1/2 pounds of dough, enough for a 9-inch tart pan.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 1/4 cups (285g) all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup (225g) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes\n* 1/4 cup (60g) ice-cold water\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.\n2. Add the cubed butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some larger pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.\n3. Sprinkle the ice-cold water over the mixture, then use a fork to gently mix until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass.\n4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times until it becomes smooth and pliable.\n5. Form the dough into a flat disc, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.\n\nTips for a Flaky Crust:\n\n* Use cold ingredients: Cold butter and ice-cold water are essential for creating a flaky crust.\n* Don't overmix: Mix the dough just until it comes together in a shaggy mass. Overmixing can lead to a tough crust.\n* Rest the dough: Letting the dough rest in the refrigerator allows the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll out and reducing the risk of shrinkage.\n* Roll out gently: Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface, using gentle, even strokes. Avoid applying too much pressure, which can cause the dough to tear or become too thin.\n\n**Assembly and Baking:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. Roll out the chilled dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm).\n3. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, pressing it into the corners and up the sides of the pan.\n4. Trim the excess dough, leaving about 1/2 inch (1 cm) overhang.\n5. Crimp the edges to form a decorative border.\n6. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent it from bubbling up during baking.\n7. Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.\n8. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.\n9. Remove the parchment paper and pie weights or beans, and let the crust cool completely.\n10. Fill and bake according to your fruit tart recipe.\n\nThis pastry dough recipe should give you a beautiful, flaky crust for your fruit tart. Remember to handle the dough gently and don't overwork it, as this can lead to a tough crust. Good luck, and I hope your tart turns out amazing!",
