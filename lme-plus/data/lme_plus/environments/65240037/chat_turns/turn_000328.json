Anti-itch spray for Hammy the pig\n\nAnd, I've noted down the vaccination reminder for the horses. Can you please tell me the specific details about the vaccinations? For example, which horses need to be vaccinated, and when are they due?\n\nYou can also give me a rough estimate of the date or a specific timeframe (e.g., \"next week,\" \"in two months,\" etc.) when you'd like to schedule the vaccinations. I'll make sure to keep track of it for you!",
