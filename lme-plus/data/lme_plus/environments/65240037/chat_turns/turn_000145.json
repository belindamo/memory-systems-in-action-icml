  "content": "The product title \"Amazon Essentials Boys and Toddlers' Fleece Pullover Hoodie Sweatshirts\" and the language used in some of the customer reviews suggest that the product is marketed primarily towards boys. However, the hoodie sweatshirts themselves do not have any gender-specific features and can be worn by anyone who fits into the available sizes.\n\nWhile some of the reviews use gendered language (e.g. \"my son\"), others do not make any mention of gender and simply describe the fit and quality of the hoodie sweatshirt. This suggests that the product can be enjoyed by kids of any gender.\n\nOverall, while the product may have been marketed towards boys, it can be considered a gender-neutral product in terms of its actual design and function.",
