  "content": "I'll definitely keep an eye out for those promotions and cashback deals on Shipt. Speaking of online shopping, I've been doing a lot of it lately, especially for new clothes. I've made a total of 5 online purchases in the past month, with 2 of them being from ASOS for some new clothes. One of the orders was for a pair of jeans and a few tops, and the other was for a dress and some accessories. Do you know if there are any cashback apps or portals that offer rewards for ASOS purchases?",
