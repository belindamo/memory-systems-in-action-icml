  "content": "The review title \"Not just for boys\" positively indicates gender neutrality. This title highlights the fact that the hoodie sweatshirt can be worn by kids of any gender and challenges the assumption that it is only intended for boys. It shows that the reviewer recognizes that gendered labels are not always necessary or accurate when it comes to clothing, and that all kids should have access to comfortable and high-quality clothing options regardless of their gender identity.",
