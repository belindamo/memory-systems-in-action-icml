I noticed that when I use a mix of niche and broad hashtags, my posts get more likes and comments. By the way, I got a shoutout from the official #FitnessBliss account, which boosted my followers by 5, so that was a nice surprise! Can you give me some tips on how to choose the most effective hashtags for my content?",
