      "content": "Smocks and aprons can be a lifesaver when working with kids and art supplies.\n\nFor affordable options, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Dollar Stores**: Many dollar stores carry simple, lightweight aprons or smocks that can be perfect for a one-time event. You can find them in the arts and crafts or party supply section.\n2. **Discount Stores**: Stores like Target, Walmart, or Costco often carry affordable aprons or smocks in bulk. You can find them in the arts and crafts or school supply section.\n3. **Online Retailers**: Websites like Amazon, Oriental Trading Company, or Discount School Supply often carry a wide range of smocks and aprons in bulk at discounted prices.\n4. **Reuse and Repurpose**: Consider using old, oversized t-shirts or plastic tablecloths as makeshift smocks. You can also ask parents or volunteers to bring their own smocks or old clothes for the kids to wear.\n5. **Local Thrift Stores**: You can also try visiting local thrift stores or second-hand shops to find affordable aprons or smocks in bulk.\n\nWhen shopping, look for smocks or aprons made from easy-to-clean materials like plastic, vinyl, or polyester. You can also consider aprons with Velcro or snap closures, which are often easier for kids to put on and take off.\n\nFor a large group of kids, you may want to consider buying aprons in bulk. Here are some rough estimates of what you might expect to pay:\n\n* Individual aprons: $1-$5 each\n* Packs of 10-20 aprons: $10-$50\n* Bulk packs of 50-100 aprons: $50-$200\n\nRemember, you don't need to break the bank on fancy aprons. Simple, functional options will do the trick and help keep the kids' clothes clean!"
