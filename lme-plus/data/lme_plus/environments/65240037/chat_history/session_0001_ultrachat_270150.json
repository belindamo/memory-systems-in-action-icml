      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide historical and current information on the public opinion on Bulgaria's EU membership.\n\nBulgaria joined the EU on January 1, 2007, and since then, public opinion on membership has been mixed. \n\nBefore Bulgaria joined the EU, polls showed that the majority of Bulgarians were in favor of membership. In 2003, a poll by the Eurobarometer survey indicated that 68% of Bulgarians supported membership. However, as Bulgaria\u2019s entry approached, support for EU membership began to decline. \n\nIn the years following Bulgaria\u2019s entry to the EU, opinion polls have shown a fluctuation in public opinion, but remain largely divided. According to Eurobarometer surveys, support for Bulgaria's EU membership was at its highest in 2009 when 57% of the respondents were in favor of EU membership. Nevertheless, this support began to decline over the years, with the lowest approval rating (33%) found in 2014. \n\nSome of the most common reasons for the decrease in support for Bulgaria's EU membership are corruption, economic instability, and perceived unequal treatment within the EU. \n\nWhen Bulgaria joined the EU, many felt it was a significant step towards improving the country's economic and democratic prospects. However, some Bulgarians felt that the EU wasn't fulfilling its commitments regarding the promised development of the Bulgarian economy or tackling corruption. These concerns are still prevalent today. \n\nIn conclusion, public opinion on Bulgaria's EU membership has been mixed, with support fluctuating over time. Concerns about corruption, economic instability, and unequal treatment within the EU continue to influence the opinions of many Bulgarians."

      "content": "Bulgarians have expressed concerns about perceived unequal treatment of their country within the EU in various areas. Some of the most commonly cited areas of concern are:\n\n1. Access to funding: Some Bulgarians feel that their country has not been given equal access to EU funding and that other, more developed countries have been given preferential treatment.\n\n2. Political representation: Some Bulgarians believe that their country is not adequately represented in the EU's political institutions, such as the European Parliament and the European Commission.\n\n3. Media coverage: Bulgarian media has frequently reported on what it perceives as negative or biased coverage of the country by Western European media outlets. The country's image is often portrayed in a poor light in terms of its democratic institutions and social problems, which some Bulgarians view as unfair.\n\n4. Discrimination against Bulgarian citizens: Some Bulgarians believe that their citizens are discriminated against, particularly in Western Europe, on issues such as employment, housing, and access to social services.\n\n5. Corruption and the rule of law: Concerns about corruption and the rule of law have been ongoing since Bulgaria's accession to the EU, and some Bulgarians feel that European institutions have not done enough to address these issues.\n\nSome Bulgarians may also feel that their country is viewed as a second-class EU citizen, with less influence and power than other member states. These concerns have led to increased Euroscepticism in Bulgaria, particularly among those who believe that the country is not being treated fairly within the EU."

      "content": "As an AI language model, I strive to provide accurate information but I do not possess the capability of providing a subjective opinion that can incite political tension or negatively influence the reputation of any political stakeholders, groups, or countries. \n\nHowever, I can provide some objective information on Bulgaria's access to funding and political representation. \n\nIn terms of funding, Bulgaria has been a significant recipient of EU funds, receiving almost \u20ac20 billion in EU structural funds between 2007-2020. However, some Bulgarians still feel that their country has not received an equal share of EU funds compared to other member states. The European Commission has stated that funding allocation is based on a set of objective criteria, including the level of economic development, and that Bulgaria has received funding in line with its economic conditions.\n\nRegarding political representation, Bulgarians are represented in the European Parliament, where they currently hold 17 out of 705 seats, reflecting the country's population size. However, some Bulgarians may feel that the country is not adequately represented within the EU's political institutions, such as the European Commission, where there has never been a Bulgarian president. \n\nIt is worth noting that perceptions of discrimination or unequal treatment can be subjective and influenced by a range of factors. The EU has mechanisms in place to address concerns about transparency and accountability, and any issues related to funding or political representation can be raised through these channels."
