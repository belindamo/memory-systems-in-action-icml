      "content": "The product title \"Amazon Essentials Boys and Toddlers' Fleece Pullover Hoodie Sweatshirts\" and the language used in some of the customer reviews suggest that the product is marketed primarily towards boys. However, the hoodie sweatshirts themselves do not have any gender-specific features and can be worn by anyone who fits into the available sizes.\n\nWhile some of the reviews use gendered language (e.g. \"my son\"), others do not make any mention of gender and simply describe the fit and quality of the hoodie sweatshirt. This suggests that the product can be enjoyed by kids of any gender.\n\nOverall, while the product may have been marketed towards boys, it can be considered a gender-neutral product in terms of its actual design and function."

This title does not make any reference to gender and focuses solely on the quality and functionality of the hoodie sweatshirt.

      "content": "The review title \"Not just for boys\" positively indicates gender neutrality. This title highlights the fact that the hoodie sweatshirt can be worn by kids of any gender and challenges the assumption that it is only intended for boys. It shows that the reviewer recognizes that gendered labels are not always necessary or accurate when it comes to clothing, and that all kids should have access to comfortable and high-quality clothing options regardless of their gender identity."

      "content": "As previously mentioned, the title of the review that positively indicates gender neutrality is \"Not just for boys.\" Here's a quote from the review that supports this belief:\n\n\"This is a great product... I have a 10 year old boy and an eight year old girl who are nearly the same size... When they arrived the absolute only difference is that inside the hood around the neck the \u201cboys\u201d hoodie has blue stitching... but it kind of irritated me that the other was labeled for girls when there\u2019s nothing different about the two, except the cost.\"\n\nThis review title and quote show that the reviewer recognizes that the hoodie sweatshirt is not specific to one gender and that it is unfair to label similar products differently for boys and girls. The reviewer believes that all children, regardless of their gender, should have access to the same products at the same price point."
