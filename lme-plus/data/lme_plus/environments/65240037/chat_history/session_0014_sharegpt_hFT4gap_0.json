      "content": "Literature Review:\n\nElectronic Performance Support Systems (EPSS) are computer-based systems that provide on-the-job support to workers, enabling them to perform their tasks more efficiently and effectively. EPSS have the potential to significantly improve performance and productivity in a variety of organizational settings, including education and training. However, the success of EPSS implementation depends on the acceptance and use of these systems by the individuals who will be using them.\n\nA number of studies have examined factors that influence the acceptance and use of EPSS. According to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are key determinants of user acceptance (Davis, 1989). Davis et al. (1989) found that both of these factors were significantly related to user acceptance of computer technology. Similarly, Mathieson (1991) found that the TAM was a good predictor of user intentions to use technology.\n\nOther studies have examined additional factors that may influence the acceptance and use of EPSS. Ashraf et al. (2017) found that interfunctional communication was an important factor in the acceptance of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. Chao (2019) found that the behavioral intention to use mobile learning was influenced by factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence. Kwak et al. (2011) found that cost and employee satisfaction were important factors in the adoption of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Navimipour and Soltani (2016) found that cost, technology acceptance, and employee satisfaction all had an impact on the effectiveness of Electronic Customer Relationship Management (eCRM) systems.\n\nIn addition to these individual-level factors, organizational and contextual factors may also play a role in EPSS acceptance and use. Robey et al. (2000) found that organizational learning capacity was positively related to the adoption of complex technological innovations. Teo et al. (2006) found that attitude toward complex technological innovations was also an important predictor of adoption. Rajan and Baral (2015) found that the impact of ERP systems on end users was influenced by factors such as training, top management support, and compatibility with business processes.\n\nThere is also evidence that instructional designers play a critical role in the acceptance and use of EPSS. Boling et al. (2017) identified several core judgments that instructional designers make in practice, including judgments about the learner, the learning environment, and the learning objectives. Gal and Nachmias (2012) found that users' attitudes towards EPSS were an important factor in their implementation. Gal et al. (2017) demonstrated the effectiveness of a tablet-based EPSS for technicians' training in the Israeli Air Force. Klein and Kelly (2018) identified a set of competencies that are important for instructional designers to possess in order to effectively design and implement EPSS.\n\nIn conclusion, a number of individual, organizational, and contextual factors influence the acceptance and use of EPSS by instructional designers. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are key determinants of acceptance, but other factors such as interfunctional communication, cost, employee satisfaction, and training also play a role. The role of instructional designers in the design and implementation of EPSS is critical, and competencies such as knowledge of the learner, the learning environment, and the learning objectives are important for instructional designers to possess. Further research is needed to fully understand the factors that influence the acceptance and use of EPSS by instructional designers, and to identify best practices for the successful implementation of these systems."
