That's a great observation!\n\nFocusing on getting extra rest this week is an excellent idea, especially after feeling worn out from last week. Allow yourself to recharge and prioritize self-care activities, like your warm bath and gentle stretches, to help your body and mind recover.\n\nOnce you've had a chance to recharge, you can try gradually adjusting your wake-up time by 15-minute increments every few days. This will give your body time to adapt to the new wake-up time without feeling too abrupt.\n\nRemember, it's essential to listen to your body and be gentle with yourself during this process. If you find that you're still struggling to wake up or feeling exhausted, it might be better to reassess your approach and focus on finding ways to manage your energy levels during the day.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some additional tips to help you manage your energy levels during your meetings on Wednesdays:\n\n* **Take breaks**: Try to take short breaks during the meeting to stretch, grab a snack, or step outside for some fresh air.\n* **Prioritize self-care**: Schedule self-care activities, like your warm bath or gentle stretches, for the evening after your meeting to help you unwind.\n* **Re-evaluate your meeting schedule**: If possible, consider discussing with your team or manager to see if there's a way to adjust the meeting schedule or format to make it less draining for you.\n\nBy focusing on rest and recovery this week, and then gradually adjusting your wake-up time, you'll be better equipped to manage your energy levels and tackle your meetings with more confidence and focus.\n\nHow do you feel about trying these strategies, and is there anything else you'd like to add or discuss?",
