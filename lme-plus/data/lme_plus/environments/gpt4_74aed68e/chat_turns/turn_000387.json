Cochinita Pibil: A slow-roasted pork dish seasoned with achiote paste and sour orange juice, wrapped in banana leaves. 2. Chiles Rellenos: Stuffed poblano peppers filled with ground meat or cheese, and covered in a tomato-based sauce. 3. Sopa de Lima: A chicken soup flavored with lime juice and garnished with tortilla strips and avocado. 4. Papadzules: A dish featuring boiled or poached eggs wrapped in tortillas and topped with a pumpkin seed sauce. 5. Tamales: These are usually made with cornmeal and stuffed with a variety of fillings like meat, cheese, vegetables, and chilies before steaming. 6.
