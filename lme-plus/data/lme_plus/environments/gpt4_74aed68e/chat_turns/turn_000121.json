The idea is to allocate your most energetic days to tasks that require the most focus and energy, and save your lower-energy days for tasks that are more manageable.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following strategies to help you cope with your Wednesday meetings:\n\n* **Prepare ahead**: Make sure you're well-prepared for your Wednesday meetings by reviewing materials, preparing questions, and clarifying your goals beforehand.\n* **Take breaks**: Take short breaks during or after the meeting to stretch, grab a snack, or simply step away for a few minutes to recharge.\n* **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for self-care activities, like your warm bath and gentle stretches, to help you unwind and recover after the meeting.\n\nHow does this outline look to you? Are there any specific tasks or adjustments you'd like to make?",
