However, if you plan to use the bike-sharing program regularly, you might want to consider purchasing your own helmet. A good quality helmet can cost between $20 to $50.\n* **Bike Locks:** City Wheels provides built-in locks on their bikes, so you don't need to worry about renting or purchasing a separate lock. However, if you plan to use your own bike, you'll need to invest in a good quality lock, which can cost between $20 to $50.\n* **Other Accessories:** You might want to consider purchasing additional accessories, such as:\n\t+ A bike basket or bag to carry your gear: $10 to $30\n\t+ A water bottle holder: $5 to $10\n\t+ A bike light or reflectors for increased visibility: $10 to $20\n\n**Additional Fees:**\n\n* **Overtime Fees:** If you exceed the 30-minute ride time, you'll be charged an overtime fee of $2 per 30 minutes. However, as a monthly member, you get unlimited 30-minute rides, so this shouldn't be a concern.\n* **Lost or Damaged Bike Fees:** If you lose or damage a bike, you might be charged a fee, which can range from $50 to $200, depending on the severity of the damage.\n* **Late Return Fees:** If you return a bike late, you might be charged a late fee, which is typically $2 to $5 per hour.\n\n**Tips to Minimize Additional Costs:**\n\n* Make sure to return the bike on time to avoid late fees.\n* Take good care of the bike to avoid damage fees.\n* Consider purchasing your own helmet and accessories to avoid rental fees.\n* Plan your route and ride time to avoid overtime fees.\n\nOverall, the additional costs are relatively minimal, and you can minimize them by being mindful of the bike's condition, returning it on time, and planning your rides efficiently.\n\nNow that you're aware of the potential additional costs, are you ready to give the bike and train option a try for a week?",
