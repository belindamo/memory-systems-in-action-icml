We can schedule a weekly call to discuss our social media strategy, share our content plans, and brainstorm new ideas. This will help us stay organized and on track, and make sure our messaging is aligned.\n\nI'll also make sure to share my Instagram analytics with Emily, so we can see which posts are performing well and adjust our strategy accordingly. And, of course, we'll need to make sure we're both using the same hashtags and tagging each other in our posts to maximize our reach.\n\nBy working together and promoting each other's products, I'm confident we can drive sales and engagement for both of our businesses. And, who knows, we might even attract some new customers who are interested in both handmade soaps and jewelry!",
