  "content": "My local station is in the suburbs, and I commute to downtown. My door-to-door commute takes around 1 hour and 15 minutes, including the 10-15 minute walk to/from the train station. I usually drive to my local station and park my car. I'm open to considering alternative modes of transportation, especially if it can save me time and money. I'm flexible with my schedule, but I need to arrive at the office by 8:30 AM. As for my current commute cost, I've been tracking my expenses, and I've spent around $250 on train tickets and gas for my car over the past month.",
