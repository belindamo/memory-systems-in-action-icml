We've broken down the costs into:\n\n* Raw materials: the cost of the ingredients and components needed to make each product\n* Packaging: the cost of packaging materials, such as labels, bags, and jars\n* Other: any additional expenses related to producing each product, such as molds, utensils, or equipment\n\nWe've also added a \"Total\" row for each product to calculate the total cost of each item. Finally, we've added a \"Total Inventory and Supplies\" row to calculate the total cost of all inventory and supplies.\n\nYou can add or remove columns and rows as needed to track your specific expenses. For example, you might want to add a column to track the quantity of each item you're purchasing or producing.\n\nRemember to update your estimates and actual costs regularly as you prepare for the Summer Fest event. This will help you stay on top of your expenses and make informed decisions about your pricing and inventory.",
