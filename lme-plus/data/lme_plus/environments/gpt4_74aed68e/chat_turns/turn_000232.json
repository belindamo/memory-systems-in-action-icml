Try to simulate the exam setting as closely as possible when you practice, including timing yourself for different sections of the exam.\n\n2. Learn to skip difficult questions: Don't waste too much time on difficult questions. Learn to recognize when a question is too time-consuming and move on to the next one.\n\n3. Focus on accuracy: You may be tempted to race through questions, but accuracy is key to getting a higher score. Take the time to read each question carefully and understand what it is asking.\n\n4. Use your scratch paper: Use your scratch paper to make notes, draw diagrams or write down formulas that you may need to solve the problem. This can speed up your problem-solving process.\n\n5. Don't dwell on questions you don't know: If you get stuck on a question, don't spend too much time trying to solve it. Make an educated guess and move on.\n\n6. Don't waste time checking your answers: Instead of double-checking your answers, use that time to attempt more questions.\n\n7. Stay focused: Stay focused on the present question and try not to worry about the remaining questions. Avoid the temptation to rush or feel anxious.\n\nBy using these tips to improve time management, you should be able to complete the exam on time and achieve a higher score.",
