  "content": "Yes, here are some specific recommendations for practicing timed questions:\n\n1. Practice with official GMAT practice exams: GMAT practice exams are the best way to practice timed questions, as they replicate the actual exam conditions. Try to take practice exams in a test center with a proctor to simulate test-day conditions. 2. Use GMAT prep materials: Use official GMAT preparation materials, like the Official Guide for GMAT Review, which contains timed questions with explanations, and can help you to better understand how to manage your time on the exam. 3. Develop a timing strategy: In timed conditions, consider spending time in blocks for different sections of the exam; for example, you may allocate more time to the questions that require more thought or skills. You could also consider setting time limits for sections of the exam during your study sessions. 4. Use online resources: There are many online resources that provide timed practice GMAT questions or exams, including GMAT Club, Manhattan Prep, and Kaplan. 5. Use a timer: Use a timer or stopwatch to keep track of time when practicing GMAT questions, so you become accustomed to the pace of the exam. Remember, regular and consistent practice is key to success. By practicing timed questions regularly and simulating test-day conditions, you will develop the necessary skills to manage your time better and perform well on the GMAT.",
