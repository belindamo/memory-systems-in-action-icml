NGK is a reputable brand, and it's great to hear that it made a noticeable difference in your car's performance.\n\nNow, let's talk about suspension upgrades to improve your car's handling for the auto racing event. Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Coilovers:** Consider upgrading to adjustable coilovers, which will allow you to fine-tune the ride height, compression, and rebound to suit your driving style and the track conditions. This will provide better body control, reduced body roll, and improved handling.\n2. **Sway bars:** Stiffer sway bars (also known as anti-roll bars) can help reduce body roll and improve cornering stability. You can upgrade to thicker sway bars or adjust the existing ones to achieve better balance and responsiveness.\n3. **Bushings:** Worn-out bushings can cause sloppy handling and uneven tire wear. Inspect and replace any worn-out bushings with high-performance ones, such as polyurethane or spherical bearings, to improve the suspension's responsiveness and precision.\n4. **Springs:** Upgrading to stiffer springs can improve handling and reduce body roll. However, be cautious not to go too stiff, as this can compromise ride comfort and stability.\n5. **Camber and toe adjustments:** Make sure to adjust the camber and toe angles to optimize tire wear and handling. Negative camber can improve turn-in response, while toe adjustments can affect the car's stability and cornering ability.\n6. **Shock absorbers:** Upgrading to high-performance shock absorbers can improve the suspension's ability to absorb bumps and maintain contact with the road, resulting in better handling and stability.\n7. **Lowering springs or ride height adjustment:** Lowering the ride height can improve handling by reducing the center of gravity and improving aerodynamics. However, be mindful of the risks of scraping the underside of the car or compromising ground clearance.\n8. **Alignment:** Ensure that your car's alignment is properly set up for the track. A proper alignment will help maintain even tire wear, improve handling, and reduce the risk of understeer or oversteer.\n9. **Tire upgrades:** Don't forget to upgrade your tires to high-performance, track-specific tires. This will provide better grip, braking, and cornering ability.\n10. **Professional assistance:** If you're not experienced with suspension upgrades, consider consulting a professional mechanic or a reputable tuning shop to ensure that the upgrades are done correctly and safely.\n\nRemember to always follow proper safety protocols and guidelines when modifying your car for track use. Make sure to test your car thoroughly after each upgrade to ensure that it's handling as expected.\n\nBest of luck at the auto racing event!",
