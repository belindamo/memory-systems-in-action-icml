Since you've already experimented with chicken in your green curry, you'll find that it works beautifully in teriyaki as well.\n\n**Cooking chicken in teriyaki sauce:**\n\nWhen using chicken in this recipe, keep the following in mind:\n\n1. **Boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs**: You can use either breast or thigh meat, but breasts will cook faster and might become dry if overcooked. Thighs will remain juicier, but might take a bit longer to cook.\n2. **Cut into bite-sized pieces**: Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces or strips to ensure even cooking and to prevent undercooked or overcooked areas.\n3. **Adjust cooking time**: Chicken will cook faster than beef or pork, so adjust the grilling or pan-frying time accordingly. Typically, chicken will take 5-7 minutes to cook through, depending on the thickness of the pieces.\n4. **Grill or pan-fry**: You can grill or pan-fry the chicken, but grilling will give you those nice char marks and a slightly caramelized exterior. Pan-frying will result in a crispy exterior and a juicy interior.\n5. **Don't overcook**: Chicken can become dry quickly, so make sure to check its internal temperature (165\u00b0F / 74\u00b0C) and adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\n**Tips for cooking chicken in teriyaki sauce:**\n\n1. **Marinate the chicken**: Marinate the chicken in the teriyaki sauce for at least 30 minutes to an hour to help the flavors penetrate the meat.\n2. **Use a medium-high heat**: Grill or pan-fry the chicken over medium-high heat to achieve a nice sear and caramelization.\n3. **Glaze with teriyaki sauce**: During the last 2-3 minutes of cooking, brush the chicken with the teriyaki sauce to create a sticky, sweet, and savory glaze.\n4. **Let it rest**: Once cooked, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll end up with deliciously flavored and cooked chicken in your teriyaki dish. Enjoy!",
