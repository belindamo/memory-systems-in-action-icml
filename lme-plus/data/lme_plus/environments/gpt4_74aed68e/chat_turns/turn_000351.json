  "content": "Upgrading your brake pads is a great idea, and it's even better that you got a discount on them!\n\nRegarding brake fluid, it's a good idea to upgrade it when you install the new brake pads, especially if you're planning to track your car regularly. Here's why:\n\n1. **Compatibility**: New brake pads might require a specific type of brake fluid to function optimally. Check the brake pad manufacturer's recommendations to ensure the fluid you choose is compatible.\n2. **Moisture Absorption**: Brake fluid can absorb moisture from the air, which can lead to a decrease in boiling point and performance. If you've had the brake fluid in your car for a while, it might be nearing the end of its effective lifespan.\n3. **High-Temperature Performance**: If you're tracking your car, you'll be generating high temperatures during heavy braking. A high-performance brake fluid can handle these temperatures better, maintaining its viscosity and lubricity to ensure consistent braking performance.\n4. **Corrosion Protection**: New brake fluid can help protect your brake system's components from corrosion, which is especially important if you live in an area with high humidity or salty roads.\n\nWhen choosing a brake fluid, look for one that meets or exceeds the following criteria:\n\n* **DOT 4 or DOT 5.1 rating**: These ratings indicate the fluid's boiling point and performance under high temperatures.\n* **High wet boiling point (WBP)**: A higher WBP (e.g., 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C or higher) ensures the fluid can handle the heat generated during track driving.\n* **Low viscosity**: A lower viscosity fluid (e.g., 1.5-2.5 cSt) can improve pedal feel and responsiveness.\n* **Corrosion inhibitors**: Look for fluids with additives that protect against corrosion and oxidation.\n\nSome popular high-performance brake fluid brands include:\n\n* Castrol SRF\n* Motul RBF 660\n* AP Racing PRF 660\n* Brembo HTX\n\nRemember to always follow proper bleeding and flushing procedures when upgrading your brake fluid to ensure air is removed from the system and the new fluid is properly circulated.\n\nEnjoy your brake upgrade, and I hope you see improved performance on the track!",
