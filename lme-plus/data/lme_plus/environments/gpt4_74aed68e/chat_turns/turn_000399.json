You can also use a small cookie cutter to create star-shaped cookies.\n2. **Rocket's Rocket Fuel**: Mix blue Gatorade or blue Kool-Aid with some lemon-lime soda for a fizzy, colorful drink.

Add some edible gold dust or glitter to give it a cosmic sparkle.\n4. **Groot's Tree Bark**: Make some chocolate-dipped pretzels or pretzel rods and sprinkle with crushed Oreos or chocolate chips to resemble tree bark.\n5. **Alien Slime**: Create a green-colored snack by mixing together green Jell-O, whipped cream, and some green food coloring. Serve it in small cups or containers with a label that says \"Alien Slime.\"\n6. **Drax's Dragon Eggs**: Deviled eggs with a twist! Use black olives or pimentos to create \"dragon eyes\" on top of the eggs.\n7. **Nebula's Nebula Nachos**: Make a colorful nacho platter with blue and purple tortilla chips, cheese, and your favorite toppings. Use a cookie cutter to create star-shaped tortilla chips or use a star-shaped serving dish.\n8. **Mantis' Mind-Meld Morsels**: Bake some sugar cookies and add a few drops of peppermint extract to give them a refreshing twist. Decorate with blue and purple frosting to match Mantis' colors.\n\nThese snacks are sure to add an extra layer of fun to your \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movie night!
