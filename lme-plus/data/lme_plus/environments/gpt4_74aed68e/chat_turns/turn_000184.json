Since you've already included the silver jewelry, you might want to focus on items that complement the gourmet food items. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Gourmet food-themed accessory**: A tea infuser, a cheese knife, or a small cutting board can add a practical touch to the gift. ($5-$15)\n2. **Herbal or scented sachet**: A small herbal or scented sachet can complement the artisanal teas and create a soothing atmosphere. ($5-$10)\n3. **Food-themed notebook or journal**: A small notebook or journal with a food-themed cover can encourage your sister to write down recipes, notes, or inspiration. ($5-$10)\n4. **Tea-for-one set**: A small tea-for-one set, including a cup and saucer, can be a lovely addition to the gift. ($10-$20)\n\nHowever, if you want to include a non-food item, a candle or a book could work well. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Candle**: A small, gourmet-scented candle (e.g., vanilla, lavender, or citrus) can create a cozy atmosphere. ($10-$20)\n2. **Food-themed book**: A cookbook, a food memoir, or a book about tea or chocolate can be a thoughtful addition. ($10-$20)\n\nRemember to balance the items in the gift basket. You don't want to overwhelm your sister with too many items, but rather create a curated selection that shows you care.\n\nHere's a rough outline to consider:\n\n* 2-3 gourmet food items (artisanal teas, gourmet chocolates, infused oils)\n* 1-2 jewelry pieces (the silver necklace and earrings you've already purchased)\n* 1-2 additional items (from the suggestions above)\n\nKeep in mind that the most important thing is to show your sister you care and pay attention to her interests. The gift basket should reflect your thoughtfulness and appreciation for her.",
