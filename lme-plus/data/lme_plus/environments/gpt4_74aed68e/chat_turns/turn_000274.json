I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or take cooking classes, but I'm always happy to help with any questions or topics related to food and cooking!\n\nHowever, I'd love to hear more about your Thai cooking class experience! How did you find the class? Was it helpful in learning new techniques and recipes? Did you enjoy making green curry from scratch and cooking jasmine rice? Share your thoughts, and I'll be happy to chat with you about it!",
