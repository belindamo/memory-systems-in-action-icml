  "content": "As Tong Chi Ming, I do enjoy claypot rice. It's a popular dish in Southeast Asia, and I love the flavors and aromas that come from cooking the rice in a clay pot. The slow cooking process allows the rice to absorb all the flavors of the ingredients and results in a delicious, savory dish that is a staple in many households. I especially enjoy having claypot rice with a variety of meats and vegetables, as it makes for a hearty and filling meal.",
