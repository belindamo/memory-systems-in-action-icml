Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify your most energetic days**: Which days of the week do you usually feel more energized and focused? For you, it might not be Wednesday, considering your meeting left you drained.\n2. **Categorize tasks by energy level**: Divide your tasks into three categories:\n\t* **High-energy tasks**: These require intense focus, creativity, or physical energy. Examples might include complex problem-solving, writing reports, or attending meetings.\n\t* **Medium-energy tasks**: These need some focus and effort but are more manageable. Examples might include responding to emails, data entry, or routine administrative tasks.\n\t* **Low-energy tasks**: These can be done with minimal focus and energy. Examples might include organizing files, scheduling appointments, or simple research.\n3. **Schedule tasks accordingly**: Allocate your most energetic days to high-energy tasks, medium-energy days to medium-energy tasks, and low-energy days to low-energy tasks. Be realistic about your energy levels and don't overload yourself.\n4. **Consider your morning and afternoon**: If you're not a morning person, you might want to schedule low-energy tasks for the morning and save your most important tasks for when you're more alert. Alternatively, if you're more focused in the morning, tackle your high-energy tasks then.\n5. **Leave buffers and breaks**: Make sure to leave some buffer time between tasks for breaks, stretching, or simply relaxing. This will help you recharge and maintain productivity.\n\nLet's create a rough outline for your week. Which days do you usually feel more energized? Are there any specific tasks you need to tackle this week?\n\nRemember, prioritizing tasks based on energy levels is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Experiment and adjust as needed to find what works best for you.",
