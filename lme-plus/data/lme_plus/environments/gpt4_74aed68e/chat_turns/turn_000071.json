However, some experts predict that industries like Information technology, digital marketing, data analysis, renewable energy, and healthcare technology are likely to grow in the next decade. These industries have shown significant growth potential over the past years and are expected to continue to grow due to changing consumer behavior and the need for new technological solutions.
