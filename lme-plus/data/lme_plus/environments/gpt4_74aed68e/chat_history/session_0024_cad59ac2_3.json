It's always a crowd-pleaser!\n\nAs for complementary dishes, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Crudit\u00e9s**: A colorful platter of fresh veggies like carrots, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and bell peppers will provide a refreshing contrast to the rich, cheesy dip.\n2. **Pita chips or crackers**: Offer a crunchy base for scooping up that delicious dip. You could also consider baked crackers or crostini for a fancier touch.\n3. **Fresh fruit platter**: A light and fruity option to balance out the savory flavors. Consider a mix of grapes, strawberries, kiwi, and pineapple.\n4. **Mini quiches or savory tartlets**: Bite-sized quiches or tartlets filled with cheese, ham, or spinach would complement the dip nicely and provide a satisfying snack.\n5. **Meat and cheese board**: A selection of cured meats (e.g., prosciutto, salami), paired with crackers, garnishes (e.g., grapes, figs), and a few cheeses (e.g., cheddar, gouda), will offer a satisfying snack.\n\nRemember to consider your office party's theme, size, and any dietary restrictions when choosing your dishes.\n\nAnd, don't forget to send that birthday card to Laura!"
