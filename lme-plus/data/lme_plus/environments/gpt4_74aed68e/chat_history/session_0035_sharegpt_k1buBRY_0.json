Here's an example:\n\n\"Hey team, just wanted to let you know that when we release the new update for our iOS app, it might take up to 24 hours for all customers to see the update. This is because the app store needs time to process the release and make it available to all users. So, some customers might see the update right away, while others might not see it until a bit later. Just wanted to set expectations and avoid any confusion. Thanks!\""
