      "content": "Sure, I can offer a recommendation for an upcoming author exhibition or program that I think is worth attending based on the museum's calendar of events. One program that caught my attention is the Virtual Book Club: Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World, which is currently scheduled to take place on May 27th, 2021. In this program, the museum's curators and an expert in the field will discuss animal-shaped vessels from ancient civilizations, including Greece, Rome, and China, as featured in the museum's collection. The program will revolve around the book \"Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World: Feasting with Gods, Heroes, and Kings\" by the museum's curator, Joan R. Mertens. It promises to be an engaging and informative session, even for those who do not have any particular interest in ancient history or art."

      "content": "Certainly! Another event that might be of interest is the Author Talk: The World Between Empires - Art and Identity in the Ancient Middle East, scheduled for June 22, 2021. The author, Blair Fowlkes-Childs, will discuss her book, \"The World Between Empires,\" which explores the diverse cultural and artistic trends across Egypt, the Levant, and Mesopotamia during the period of the Roman and Parthian Empires. The talk will examine artwork, artifacts, and other visual culture documents produced under the impact of imperial power and exchange. This event could be fascinating for people who are interested in exploring the cultural and artistic landscape in the Middle East and beyond."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Certainly! One author program that might interest you is The Met Cloisters in Manhattan, which will be held on June 11, 2021. The event will focus on the incredible cross-cultural influences between Europe and the Islamic world during the medieval period. It will feature a talk by author Erica Hirshler and curators Maryan Ainsworth and Michael Mariano who will discuss how these influences inspired works of art in the Cloisters, such as the \"Unicorn in Captivity\" tapestry. This talk connects medieval art to more contemporary issues and should be compelling regardless of your interest in the specific period. Alternately, another upcoming program that might appeal to you is the Author Talk: The Obama Portraits by Ta\u00edna Caragol and Dorothy Moss on September 23, 2021. The talk will discuss the creation and significance of the official portraits of former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. This program has a more contemporary focus and should be a fascinating look at the intersection of politics and art."
