I've been using Telegram to chat with some friends who live abroad, and I've also been using Signal to communicate with a few friends who are more privacy-conscious. \n\nI've been trying to be more mindful of my social media use, setting limits on how much time I spend scrolling through my feeds. I've been using website blockers to help me stay focused, and I've been trying to engage more with others in a more meaningful way, rather than just liking and scrolling past posts.\n\nIt's been a bit of a challenge, but I feel like I'm making progress. Oh, and I did have a bit of a mishap on social media about two weeks ago - I accidentally posted a screenshot of a private conversation on Instagram, and it caused some drama with my friends. I ended up apologizing and deleting the post, but it was a good lesson in being more careful"

Accidentally posting a private conversation can be really embarrassing and stressful. But it's great that you took responsibility for the mistake, apologized, and deleted the post. That takes a lot of courage and maturity.\n\nIt's also a good reminder to always double-check before posting anything, especially if it involves private conversations or sensitive information. Maybe you can even take it as an opportunity to review your social media settings and make sure you're comfortable with the level of privacy and sharing that you have set up.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you're doing a great job of being mindful of your social media use and making intentional choices about how you want to engage with others online.
