      "content": "There is some overlap between a few of the research questions, but overall, they are distinct and cover different aspects of the topic of nativism and its representation in literature and culture. For example, questions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 16 are more focused on the historical, cultural, and literary aspects of nativism and its representation. Questions 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 15 are more focused on the social and political implications of nativist literature and its impact on public discourse, policy, and attitudes towards diversity and inclusion.\n\nWhile there may be some repetition in terms of the themes and concepts explored in these questions, each question approaches the topic from a different angle and provides a unique perspective on the subject matter."

Each question addresses a distinct aspect of the topic of nativism, from its historical and theoretical context to its relationship with other ideologies, literary genres, and forms of cultural expression. Each question also poses unique inquiries about the implications of nativism on public attitudes, policy, and social justice."
