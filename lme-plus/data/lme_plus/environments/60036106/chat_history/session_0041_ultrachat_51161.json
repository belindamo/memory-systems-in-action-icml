Some law schools, such as Northeastern University School of Law and University of Iowa College of Law, consider factors such as work experience and personal statement in addition to undergraduate GPA.\n\n2. Some business schools, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management and Duke University Fuqua School of Business, focus more on factors such as work experience, GMAT/GRE scores, and the applicant's overall profile rather than just GPA.\n\n3. Some public health programs, such as Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, prioritize experience and achievements in public health and related fields over undergraduate GPA.\n\n4. Some engineering programs, such as the University of California, Berkeley College of Engineering, place more emphasis on work experience, letters of recommendation, and personal statement.\n\nIt's important to note that while some programs may place less emphasis on undergraduate GPA, it's still a significant factor in admissions decisions for most graduate programs. Applicants should aim to have a strong overall application that showcases their strengths and achievements in other areas, in addition to their GPA."
