  "content": "You've got a great plan! Vista House and Multnomah Falls are definitely must-see attractions, and keeping an eye out for Wahkeena Falls and Horsetail Falls will add to the scenic beauty of your drive.\n\nFor lunch, I'd recommend stopping at Multnomah Falls Lodge. The lodge offers a restaurant with stunning views of the falls, and their menu features a variety of options, including Pacific Northwest cuisine and classic American fare. You can enjoy a leisurely lunch while taking in the breathtaking views of the falls. Plus, the lodge has a gift shop and a viewing area where you can relax and take in the scenery.\n\nThe food carts along the way are a great option for a quick snack or refueling, but if you're looking for a more substantial meal, the lodge is a better bet. Plus, you can take a break from driving and stretch your legs while you're there.\n\nIf you do decide to grab something from a food cart, you might want to consider stopping at Bridal Veil Lakes, which is a scenic spot with a food cart and picnic tables. It's a great place to take a break and enjoy the views of the lakes.\n\nOne more tip: Be prepared for crowds at Multnomah Falls, especially during peak season. You might want to plan your visit during the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the mid-day rush.\n\nOverall, your plan sounds great, and I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time exploring the Columbia River Gorge!",
