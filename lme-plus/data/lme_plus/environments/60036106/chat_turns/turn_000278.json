  "content": "Sure, I can offer a recommendation for an upcoming author exhibition or program that I think is worth attending based on the museum's calendar of events. One program that caught my attention is the Virtual Book Club: Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World, which is currently scheduled to take place on May 27th, 2021. In this program, the museum's curators and an expert in the field will discuss animal-shaped vessels from ancient civilizations, including Greece, Rome, and China, as featured in the museum's collection. The program will revolve around the book \"Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World: Feasting with Gods, Heroes, and Kings\" by the museum's curator, Joan R. Mertens. It promises to be an engaging and informative session, even for those who do not have any particular interest in ancient history or art.",
