Using website blockers and setting limits on your scrolling time can really help you stay focused and avoid mindless scrolling.\n\nIt's also fantastic that you're making an effort to engage more meaningfully with others on social media, rather than just liking and scrolling past posts. This can help you build more authentic connections with others and get more value out of your social media use.\n\nOops, sorry to hear about the mishap on Instagram, though! Accidentally posting a private conversation can be really embarrassing and stressful. But it's great that you took responsibility for the mistake, apologized, and deleted the post. That takes a lot of courage and maturity.\n\nIt's also a good reminder to always double-check before posting anything, especially if it involves private conversations or sensitive information. Maybe you can even take it as an opportunity to review your social media settings and make sure you're comfortable with the level of privacy and sharing that you have set up.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you're doing a great job of being mindful of your social media use and making intentional choices about how you want to engage with others online. Keep up the good work!\n\nDo you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss? I'm here to listen and help if I can!",
