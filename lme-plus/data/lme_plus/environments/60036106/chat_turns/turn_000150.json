  "content": "There is some overlap between a few of the research questions, but overall, they are distinct and cover different aspects of the topic of nativism and its representation in literature and culture. For example, questions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 16 are more focused on the historical, cultural, and literary aspects of nativism and its representation. Questions 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 15 are more focused on the social and political implications of nativist literature and its impact on public discourse, policy, and attitudes towards diversity and inclusion.\n\nWhile there may be some repetition in terms of the themes and concepts explored in these questions, each question approaches the topic from a different angle and provides a unique perspective on the subject matter.",
