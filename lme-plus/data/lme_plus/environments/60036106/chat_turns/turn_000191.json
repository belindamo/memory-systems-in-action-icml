  "content": "I've been having some issues with my phone's battery life lately. It's been draining faster than usual, especially when I'm using social media apps or watching videos. I've tried closing some background apps and adjusting the screen brightness, but it doesn't seem to make a huge difference. Can you help me troubleshoot the issue or suggest some ways to improve the battery life? By the way, I've been taking good care of my phone's screen - it still looks brand new, no scratches or cracks whatsoever, which is why I didn't bother getting a screen protector when I got my new case last week.",
