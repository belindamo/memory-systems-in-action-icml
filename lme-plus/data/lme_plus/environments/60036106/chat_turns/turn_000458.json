  "content": "According to Moravec's paradox, the parts of the mind that are most difficult to simulate with a computer are (c) perceptual systems including vision and locomotion, and (d) \"smart\" features of the body including complex organs and muscles. It suggests that tasks that are easy for humans, such as visual recognition or walking, are difficult for computers, while tasks that are difficult for humans, such as complex calculations or logical reasoning, are relatively easy for computers. This paradox highlights the difference in the types of processing that computers and humans excel at.",
