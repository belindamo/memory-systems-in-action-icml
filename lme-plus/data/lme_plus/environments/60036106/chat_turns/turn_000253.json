I'd be happy to help you with some delicious and easy-to-make recipe suggestions that are perfect for a casual gathering.\n\nBefore we dive into recipes, may I ask a few questions to help me narrow down some options?\n\n1. How many guests do you plan to invite, including Michael and Sarah?\n2. Are there any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free) you need to consider?\n3. What's your preferred cuisine or flavor profile (e.g., Italian, Mexican, comfort food, seafood)?\n4. How much time do you have available for preparation and cooking on the day of the dinner party?\n5.
