  "content": "That's fantastic! Taking a cooking class is a great way to learn new skills and gain confidence in the kitchen. It's even more exciting that you're already learning about Thai cuisine, which is so flavorful and diverse.\n\nWednesday evenings sound like a great way to unwind and explore your culinary creativity. What's been your favorite part of the class so far? Have you learned any new techniques or discovered any ingredients that you hadn't worked with before?\n\nAlso, how's your instructor? Are they providing good guidance and feedback on your cooking? A good cooking class can make all the difference in helping you develop your skills and build your confidence in the kitchen.\n\nFeel free to share more about your cooking class experience, and I'd be happy to chat with you about it!",
