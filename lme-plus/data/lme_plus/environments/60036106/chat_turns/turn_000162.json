  "content": "In the UK, local planning authorities are responsible for ensuring that any new developments are in keeping with the character, appearance, and history of a local area. In Fulham, any proposed developments must comply with the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham's planning policies and guidelines. These guidelines outline specific criteria for design, such as height, use of materials, and the proportion of built forms. Local resident groups, community organizations, and planning committees will also have a say in the decision-making process and can provide feedback on whether a proposed development is appropriate or not.\n\nThe local planning authority will assess the proposal against various criteria, such as design quality, its impact on the local environment, and its compatibility with the local context. Planning officers will also consider the historic significance of the site and any surrounding historical buildings. If the proposed development is deemed inappropriate or not in line with the planning policies and guidelines, it may be refused planning permission or require amendments before it can be approved.\n\nOverall, the planning process in Fulham is highly regulated to ensure that any new developments respect the traditional architecture and character of the area, whilst also allowing for modern design and innovation.",
