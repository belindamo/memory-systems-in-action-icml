In addition, the preservation of traditional architecture can contribute to a sense of continuity and connection to the past, which can be an important part of maintaining the identity of an area. At the same time, modern designs can still bring innovation and new life into the area by incorporating contemporary features and technologies, so long as they are respectful to and complement the existing traditional architecture. This approach can lead to an interesting juxtaposition between old and new, enriching the character of the area and creating a unique identity that reflects its rich history and evolving culture.",
