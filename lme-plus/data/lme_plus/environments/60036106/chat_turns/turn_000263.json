You can send them a casual message or give them a quick call to catch up and finalize the details.\n\nHere's a suggestion for a friendly invitation message:\n\n\"Hey Michael and Sarah! It's been way too long since we last caught up, and I'd love to have you both over for a dinner party at my place. I was thinking of hosting it on [Date and Time] and making some delicious lasagna, salad, and other goodies. Would you both be free to come? Let me know, and I'll send over all the details. Really looking forward to seeing you both again and hearing about what's new in your lives!\"\n\nFeel free to modify it to fit your tone and style, and don't forget to include all the important details, such as the date, time, location, and dress code (if applicable).\n\nOnce you've sent out the invitations, you can start preparing for the big day. Make sure to give yourself enough time to shop for ingredients, prep the dishes, and set the table. You might also want to consider creating a playlist or finding some background music to set the mood for the evening.\n\nYou're almost ready to host an unforgettable dinner party!",
