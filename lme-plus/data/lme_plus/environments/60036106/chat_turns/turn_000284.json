This exhibition features posters, banners, photographs, and other objects from the Occupy Wall Street protests that swept America in 2011. The exhibition highlights the creative strategies and visual culture of the movement, such as collective decision-making and social organization, as well as political comedy, improvisation, and music. Through the exhibition, visitors can experience the energy, activism, and historical significance of the movement through firsthand displays. The exhibition is scheduled to be held at the Met Cloisters starting September 18, 2021, and is accompanied by virtual events, such as a panel discussion, a book talk, and a performance series.",
