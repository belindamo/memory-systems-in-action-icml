  "content": "Abstract perceptual learning could refer to learning abstract representations of perceptual input that are not tied to specific sensory modalities. It involves the development of abstract representations of complex stimuli, such as shapes and patterns, that are not easily reducible to simple features. It may also involve learning to recognize and categorize abstract concepts, such as emotions or ideas, that are not directly tied to sensory input. This form of learning is often difficult to define and may overlap with other learning processes, such as statistical learning or conceptual learning.",
