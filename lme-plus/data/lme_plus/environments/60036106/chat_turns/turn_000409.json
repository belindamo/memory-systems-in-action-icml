That's a great way to reach a new audience.\n\nTo help you with popular hashtags in your niche, I'll need to know a bit more about your product or the industry you're in. Could you please share some details about your product or niche? For example:\n\n1. What type of product or service do you offer?\n2. Who is your target audience?\n3. What are the main keywords related to your product or service?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your niche, I can suggest some popular and relevant hashtags for you to use.\n\nAlso, kudos on collaborating with an influencer! That's a great way to tap into their audience and increase brand awareness. You might also consider engaging with their followers by responding to comments and direct messages to build relationships and encourage user-generated content.\n\nRemember to keep your hashtags relevant, and don't overdo it. Using 5-10 niche-specific hashtags per post is a good starting point. You can also experiment with different hashtags to find the ones that work best for your content.\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about your product or niche!",
