  "content": "The Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera exhibit at MoMA is a must-see for anyone interested in the art, culture, and history of Mexico. The exhibition, titled \"Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera: Mexican Modernism from the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection,\" is a comprehensive showcase of the works of these two iconic artists, as well as their contemporaries.\n\n**What to Expect:**\n\nThe exhibit features over 150 works of art, including paintings, drawings, prints, and photographs, as well as artifacts and personal items that provide insight into the lives and artistic practices of Frida and Diego. Here are some highlights:\n\n1. **Frida Kahlo's Paintings:** The exhibition includes some of Frida's most famous works, such as \"The Broken Column\" (1944), \"The Wounded Table\" (1940), and \"Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird\" (1940). You'll also see lesser-known pieces, like her early still-life paintings and portraits.\n2. **Diego Rivera's Murals:** Diego's large-scale murals are a hallmark of his style. The exhibit features several of his mural paintings, including \"Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Central\" (1947) and \"Man at the Crossroads\" (1934).\n3. **Photographs and Portraits:** The exhibition includes numerous photographs of Frida and Diego, taken by notable photographers like Tina Modotti, Edward Weston, and Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo. You'll also see portraits of the couple by other artists, such as Miguel Covarrubias and Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco.\n4. **Artifacts and Personal Items:** To provide context and insight into the artists' lives, the exhibit features personal items like Frida's jewelry, clothing, and makeup, as well as Diego's sketchbooks, letters, and other ephemera.\n5. **Works by Other Mexican Modernists:** The exhibition also showcases works by other prominent Mexican artists of the time, such as Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Mar\u00eda Izquierdo.\n\n**The Gelman Collection:**\n\nThe exhibition is drawn from the impressive collection of Jacques and Natasha Gelman, Mexican art patrons who were friends and supporters of Frida and Diego. The Gelmans amassed an extraordinary collection of Mexican modernist art, which they donated to MoMA in 1998.\n\n**Tips and Insights:**\n\n* The exhibition is organized chronologically, tracing the development of Frida and Diego's careers and their relationship.\n* Be sure to look for the interactive displays and digital components, which offer additional context and insights into the artworks.\n* Take your time to appreciate the intricate details and symbolism in Frida's paintings, which often reflect her experiences with physical pain, love, and Mexican culture.\n* Diego's murals are massive, so be prepared to be awestruck by their scale and complexity.\n\nThe exhibition runs until March 15th, so you have plenty of time to plan your visit. I hope you enjoy it!",
