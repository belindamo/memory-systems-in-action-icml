It sounds like you're having a great time in the cooking class, and that's exactly what it's all about - learning, experimenting, and having fun with food!\n\nIt's great that you're already planning to recreate the Thai curry recipe from last week. That's the best way to reinforce your learning and build your confidence in the kitchen. And who knows, you might even start experimenting with new ingredients or variations to make it your own!\n\nWhat did you think of the curry recipe you made in class? Was there anything that surprised you or challenged you in the cooking process? And are there any other dishes or cuisines you're looking forward to exploring in the future?\n\nKeep cooking and enjoying the process!",
