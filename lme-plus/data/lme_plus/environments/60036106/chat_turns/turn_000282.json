  "content": "Certainly! One author program that might interest you is The Met Cloisters in Manhattan, which will be held on June 11, 2021. The event will focus on the incredible cross-cultural influences between Europe and the Islamic world during the medieval period. It will feature a talk by author Erica Hirshler and curators Maryan Ainsworth and Michael Mariano who will discuss how these influences inspired works of art in the Cloisters, such as the \"Unicorn in Captivity\" tapestry. This talk connects medieval art to more contemporary issues and should be compelling regardless of your interest in the specific period. Alternately, another upcoming program that might appeal to you is the Author Talk: The Obama Portraits by Ta\u00edna Caragol and Dorothy Moss on September 23, 2021. The talk will discuss the creation and significance of the official portraits of former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. This program has a more contemporary focus and should be a fascinating look at the intersection of politics and art.",
