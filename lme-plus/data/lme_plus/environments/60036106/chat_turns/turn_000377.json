I've been using Telegram to chat with some friends who live abroad, and I've also been using Signal to communicate with a few friends who are more privacy-conscious. \n\nI've been trying to be more mindful of my social media use, setting limits on how much time I spend scrolling through my feeds. I've been using website blockers to help me stay focused, and I've been trying to engage more with others in a more meaningful way, rather than just liking and scrolling past posts.\n\nIt's been a bit of a challenge, but I feel like I'm making progress. Oh, and I did have a bit of a mishap on social media about two weeks ago - I accidentally posted a screenshot of a private conversation on Instagram, and it caused some drama with my friends. I ended up apologizing and deleting the post, but it was a good lesson in being more careful",
