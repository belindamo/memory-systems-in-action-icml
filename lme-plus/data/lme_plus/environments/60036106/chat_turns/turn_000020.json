  "content": "Summarize this text:\n\nSection 11 of this document outlines penalties for violating the regulations and orders issued under this Act. It is unlawful to violate, attempt to violate, conspire to violate, or cause a violation of any regulation or order issued under this Act. Civil penalties can be imposed on a person for each violation, including a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the value of the transaction that is the basis of the violation, whichever is greater. Criminal penalties can also be imposed, including fines of up to $1,000,000 and imprisonment for up to 20 years for individuals, as well as forfeiture of any property used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate the violation.\n\nSection 12 of the Act defines \"classified information\" and establishes the procedures for judicial review. Actions taken by the President and the Secretary under the Act are not subject to administrative or judicial review, except as provided in this section. An aggrieved person may file a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of the Secretary's or President's action. The court shall not disturb any action taken unless it is unconstitutional or in violation of a clear and mandatory statutory command. The court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under this Act against the United States or any executive department or agency, subject to review by the Supreme Court. The United States shall file an administrative record with the court containing information relied upon in taking the final action under the Act. The court shall review the record in camera and ex parte for sensitive security information, privileged law enforcement information, information obtained or derived from activities authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and information subject to privilege or protection under any other provision of law. Any information that is part of the administrative record filed ex parte and in camera shall be treated by the court consistent with the provisions of this section, and shall not be released to the petitioner or as part of the public record. A determination by the court shall be the exclusive judicial remedy for any claim against the United States, and nothing in this section limits, supersedes, or prevents the invocation of any privileges or defenses available at law or in equity to protect against the disclosure of information.\n\nSection 13 of the text outlines the relationship of the current Act to other laws. It specifies that nothing in the Act is meant to affect other laws, regulations, or authorities, except as expressly provided. The Act also provides that the President or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) can still exercise any authority under the Defense Production Act of 1950, and that the Secretary cannot review a transaction involving the acquisition of an information and communications technology product or service by a United States person if it is authorized under a United States government-industrial security program or for meeting a national security or law enforcement requirement.\n\nSection 14 of the act states that all administrative actions, including delegations, rules, regulations, orders, determinations, licenses made by the Secretary under Executive Order 13873 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act shall continue in effect according to their terms as if made under the authority of this Act until modified, superseded, set aside, or revoked under the authority of this Act, without regard to any restrictions or limitations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nThis section of the bill includes several miscellaneous provisions. It states that the Paperwork Reduction Act will not apply to any actions taken by the Secretary to implement the bill. The Secretary may appoint candidates directly to positions without regard to certain provisions of the U.S. Code. The functions exercised under the bill are not subject to certain sections of the U.S. Code, except for civil penalties imposed under section 9(b). Protected information in civil actions challenging actions or findings under the bill shall be submitted ex parte and in camera to the court and maintained under seal. The use of information provisions of certain sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 shall not apply in a civil action brought under this bill. Finally, the bill does not create a right to obtain access to information in the possession of the Federal Government or prohibit, mitigate, or take action against a covered transaction or interest. Any information submitted to the Federal Government in accordance with the bill is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThis document contains the text of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018. The act broadens the scope of transactions subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to include certain non-controlling investments and real estate transactions. The act also expands CFIUS's authority to review transactions that may present national security risks, and creates a new process for expediting review of certain transactions. The act includes provisions for judicial review and protection of sensitive information. Additionally, the act includes provisions on transition, relationship to other laws, miscellaneous provisions, severability, and authorization of appropriations.1 / 1",
