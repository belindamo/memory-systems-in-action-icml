Now, let's talk about arranging the strawberries and blueberries to make your tart visually stunning!\n\nHere are some tips to help you create a beautiful and Instagram-worthy fruit arrangement:\n\n1. **Create a pattern**: Arrange the fruits in a pattern, such as a concentric circle, a spiral, or a random scatter. This will add visual interest to your tart.\n2. **Vary the sizes**: Use a mix of large and small strawberries and blueberries to add depth and texture to your arrangement.\n3. **Alternate the fruits**: Alternate between strawberries and blueberries to create a visually appealing contrast between the red and blue colors.\n4. **Leave some space**: Don't overcrowd the tart. Leave some space between the fruits to create a clean and uncluttered look.\n5. **Create a centerpiece**: Use a large strawberry or a cluster of blueberries as a centerpiece to draw the eye to the middle of the tart.\n6. **Play with height**: Arrange some fruits slightly higher than others to create a sense of dimensionality.\n7. **Consider the shape**: Arrange the fruits to complement the shape of the tart. For example, if your tart is round, create a circular pattern.\n\nHere's a simple arrangement idea to get you started:\n\n* Place a large strawberry in the center of the tart as the centerpiece.\n* Arrange a circle of blueberries around the strawberry, leaving a small gap between each berry.\n* Place smaller strawberries around the blueberries, alternating with the direction of the blueberries.\n* Fill in any gaps with additional blueberries or strawberries, making sure to leave some space between each fruit.\n\nRemember, the key to a beautiful arrangement is to have fun and be creative! Don't stress too much about perfection \u2013 the imperfections will add character to your tart.\n\nOnce you've arranged the fruits, drizzle the powdered sugar glaze over the top, and your summer fruit tart is ready to impress!",
