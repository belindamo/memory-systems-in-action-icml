Choosing the right high-calorie feed can make a significant difference in his overall health and well-being.\n\nWhen selecting a high-calorie feed, you'll want to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Protein content:** Look for feeds with a minimum of 12% protein to support muscle growth and development.\n2. **Calorie density:** Opt for feeds with a high calorie density (e.g., 1.2-1.5 Mcal/lb) to ensure Max is getting the energy he needs.\n3. **Fat content:** Feeds with added fat sources like vegetable oils or flaxseed can provide extra calories and support skin and coat health.\n4. **Fiber content:** Adequate fiber is essential for digestive health, so choose a feed with a balanced fiber content (e.g., 10-15%).\n5. **Vitamin and mineral fortification:** Ensure the feed is fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin E, calcium, and phosphorus.\n\nSome popular high-calorie feed options to consider:\n\n1. **Sweet feed:** A sweet feed with added molasses can provide a quick source of energy and calories.\n2. **Grain-based feeds:** Feeds with a mix of grains like oats, corn, and barley can provide sustained energy and calories.\n3. **Fat-supplemented feeds:** Feeds with added fat sources like vegetable oils or flaxseed can provide extra calories and support skin and coat health.\n4. **Senior feeds:** If Max is an older horse, consider a senior feed specifically formulated to support his nutritional needs.\n\nAs for specific brands, here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Purina:** Purina offers a range of high-calorie feeds, including their Equine Senior and Ultium lines.\n2. **Nutrena:** Nutrena's SafeChoice line provides a balanced mix of protein, fat, and fiber to support weight gain.\n3. **Tribute:** Tribute's Equine Senior and Performance lines offer high-calorie options with added fat sources and vitamins.\n4. **Triple Crown:** Triple Crown's Senior and Performance feeds are formulated to provide sustained energy and calories.\n\nRemember to always consult with your veterinarian or equine nutritionist before making any changes to Max's diet. They can help you determine the best feed option based on his specific needs and health status.\n\nKeep in mind that it's essential to introduce new feeds gradually to prevent digestive upset. Start by mixing a small amount of the new feed with his current feed and gradually increase the proportion over 7-10 days.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",
