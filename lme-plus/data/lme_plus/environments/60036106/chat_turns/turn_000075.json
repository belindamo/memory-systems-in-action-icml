That's great!\n\nYes, it's essential to keep an eye on your plants' watering needs, especially during hot weather. Cucumbers need consistent moisture, especially when they're producing fruit. Daily watering might be necessary during extreme heatwaves, but make sure to check the soil moisture levels to avoid overwatering.\n\nHere are some additional tips to help your cucumber plants thrive:\n\n1. **Mulch around the base**: Mulching helps retain moisture, suppresses weeds, and regulates soil temperature. Organic mulch like straw, grass clippings, or wood chips work well.\n2. **Provide shade**: If possible, provide some afternoon shade for your cucumber plants, especially in warmer climates. This can help reduce stress and prevent scorching.\n3. **Keep the area weed-free**: Weeds compete with your cucumbers for water and nutrients. Regularly remove weeds by hand or with a hoe to prevent competition.\n4. **Fertilize regularly**: Feed your cucumbers with a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10 NPK) once a month. You can also side-dress with a high-phosphorus fertilizer (e.g., 10-20-10 NPK) to promote fruiting.\n5. **Monitor for pests and diseases**: Keep an eye out for common cucumber pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Regularly inspect your plants for signs of disease like powdery mildew, downy mildew, or bacterial wilt.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to enjoy a bountiful harvest of delicious cucumbers from your trellised plants!\n\nHow's your current cucumber crop doing? Are you expecting a good yield this season?",
