  "content": "Wahkeena Falls is a beautiful hike, and it's a great choice after visiting Vista House.\n\nThe Wahkeena Falls trail is a moderate 2.4-mile out-and-back hike that takes you to the base of the 242-foot Wahkeena Falls. The trail is well-maintained and has a moderate elevation gain of about 400 feet.\n\nFor a 1-2 hour hike, the Wahkeena Falls trail is a great fit. You can hike to the base of the falls and back in about 1-2 hours, depending on your pace and how much time you spend enjoying the views and taking photos.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a longer hike, you can continue on the Wahkeena Falls trail, which connects to the Larch Mountain trail. This will add another 2-3 miles to your hike, taking you to the top of Larch Mountain, which offers stunning views of the Columbia River Gorge.\n\nHere are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n* The trail can be steep and rocky in some areas, so make sure to wear sturdy hiking shoes and bring trekking poles if you need them.\n* The trail is shaded, but it can still get hot during the summer months, so bring plenty of water and snacks.\n* Be prepared for crowds, especially on weekends and during peak season.\n* Bring a camera to capture the stunning views of the falls and the gorge.\n\nOverall, the Wahkeena Falls trail is a great choice for a 1-2 hour hike, and it's a great way to experience the beauty of the Columbia River Gorge. Enjoy your hike!",
