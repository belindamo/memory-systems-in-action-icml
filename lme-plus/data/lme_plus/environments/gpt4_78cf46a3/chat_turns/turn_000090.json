That's a great goal to work towards.\n\nFinding the right running shoes can make a big difference in your comfort and performance. Since you'll be running on both trails and pavement, you'll want a pair that can handle varied terrain. Here are some tips to help you find a good pair:\n\n**Trail and Pavement Running Shoes: Key Features**\n\n1. **Versatility**: Look for shoes with a balance of cushioning, support, and traction to handle both trail and pavement.\n2. **Trail-specific features**: Consider shoes with aggressive tread patterns, more substantial lugs, and a more protective upper to handle trail obstacles like rocks, roots, and mud.\n3. **Pavement-friendly features**: A smoother, more responsive ride and a slightly more minimalist design will help on pavement.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on your requirements, here are some great options to consider:\n\n1. **Brooks Cascadia**: A popular choice for trail and road running, offering a balance of cushioning, support, and traction.\n2. **Salomon Speedcross**: A trail-focused shoe with aggressive tread and a comfortable, breathable upper. It can handle pavement, but may feel a bit more substantial.\n3. **Hoka One One Challenger**: A max cushioning shoe with a comfortable, smooth ride on both trail and pavement. It's a great option if you prefer a more cushioned feel.\n4. **New Balance Fresh Foam Hierro**: A versatile shoe with a balance of cushioning, support, and traction. It's suitable for both trail and pavement running.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n1. **Try before you buy**: Visit a specialty running store and try on several options to find the best fit.\n2. **Consider your foot type**: If you have flat feet, high arches, or other foot issues, look for shoes with additional support features.\n3. **Break them in**: Gradually introduce your new shoes into your training to prevent blisters and discomfort.\n4. **Replace them regularly**: Aim to replace your shoes every 300-500 miles or every 3-6 months to prevent wear and tear.\n\n**Good luck with your training!**\n\nRemember to start slowly, listen to your body, and incorporate rest days into your training plan. Waking up at 6 am every Saturday will take some getting used to, but the lake scenery will be a great motivator. Stay hydrated, fueled, and comfortable, and you'll be ready for that 10K charity run in no time!",
