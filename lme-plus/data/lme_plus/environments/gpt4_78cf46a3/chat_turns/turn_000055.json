Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Cortado**: A Spanish classic that's equal parts espresso and milk. You can use whole milk, half-and-half, or a non-dairy milk alternative. Add a pinch of salt to balance the flavors.\n2. **Caf\u00e9 au Lait**: A French-inspired drink made with brewed coffee and scalded milk (heated to just below boiling point). Use a 1:1 ratio of coffee to milk, and add a drizzle of honey if you prefer a touch of sweetness.\n3. **Gibraltar**: A variation of a cortado, but with a higher espresso-to-milk ratio (1:3). This drink is perfect for those who want a stronger coffee flavor. Top with a thin layer of foam, if desired.\n4. **Iced Coffee with Cold Brew**: Brew a batch of cold brew coffee and mix it with ice, milk (or a non-dairy alternative), and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. You can adjust the sweetness level to your taste by adding a small amount of sugar or honey.\n5. **Turkish Coffee**: A traditional method that involves finely grinding the coffee beans and brewing them in a small pot called an ibrik or cezve. Serve in small cups, and enjoy the rich, bold flavor without added sugar.\n6. **Coffee with Coconut Oil**: Add a spoonful of melted coconut oil to your brewed coffee for a creamy, dairy-free alternative. This combination also provides a boost of healthy fats to start your day.\n7. **Flat White**: A popular Australian drink made with espresso and microfoam (steamed milk that's been frothed to a silky texture). Use a 1:3 to 1:5 espresso-to-milk ratio, and enjoy the smooth, velvety texture.\n\nFeel free to experiment with these recipes and adjust the sweetness levels to your taste. You can always add a splash of honey, sugar, or syrup if you prefer a bit of sweetness. Happy brewing!",
