Here are some general tips that should work with your preferred detergent:\n\n1. **Pre-treat, pre-treat, pre-treat**: Before washing, apply a stain remover or a solution directly to the stain. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes to help loosen the stain.\n2. **Identify the stain**: Different stains require different treatments. Common culprits include:\n\t* Protein-based stains (blood, sweat, grass): Enzyme-based stain removers or cold water can help break them down.\n\t* Oil-based stains (grease, ink): Solvent-based stain removers or dish soap can help dissolve them.\n\t* Tannin-based stains (coffee, wine, berries): Acidic substances like white vinegar or lemon juice can help break them down.\n3. **Blot, don't rub**: Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove excess stain material. Avoid rubbing, which can push the stain deeper into the fabric.\n4. **Soak**: For tough stains, soak the garment in cold water with a laundry detergent specifically designed for tough stains or a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar.\n5. **Laundry boosters**: Consider adding a laundry booster like OxiClean or Shout to your wash cycle for an extra stain-fighting boost.\n6. **Hot water vs. cold water**: Use hot water for protein-based stains and cold water for oil-based stains.\n7. **Repeat if necessary**: If the stain persists after the first wash, repeat the pre-treatment and washing process until the stain is gone.\n\nSome popular stain-removing solutions you can try:\n\n* Baking soda and water: Make a paste and apply it to the stain. Let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour before washing.\n* Hydrogen peroxide: Apply it directly to the stain, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse and wash.\n* White vinegar: Mix equal parts water and white vinegar and apply it to the stain. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes before washing.\n\nRemember to always check the care label of your garment before attempting to remove a stain, and test any new stain removers or solutions on an inconspicuous area first.\n\nGood luck with your laundry, and I hope these tips help you tackle those tough stains!",
