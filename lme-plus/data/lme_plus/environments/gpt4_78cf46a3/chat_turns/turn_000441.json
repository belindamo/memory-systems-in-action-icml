  "content": "I really appreciate these suggestions. I've actually been seeing a therapist to deal with my grief, and it's been really helpful to talk through my emotions. It's good to remember to take things one day at a time and focus on the good memories I have of the people I've lost. My grandmother's funeral was a blur, but I remember feeling numb and trying to hold it together for my family's sake. It's been about three months now, and it still feels surreal. Do you have any advice on how to stay motivated and focused when you're feeling overwhelmed?",
