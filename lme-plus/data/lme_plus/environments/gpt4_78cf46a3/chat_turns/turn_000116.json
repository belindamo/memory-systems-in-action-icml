  "content": "The Greeks ultimately won the Trojan War by using the Trojan Horse, a wooden horse filled with Greek warriors, to invade and conquer the city of Troy. The Trojan Horse was left outside the gates of Troy as a supposed offering to the gods, and the Trojans brought it inside the city. That night, the Greek soldiers emerged from the horse and opened the gates of Troy, allowing the Greek army to enter and conquer the city. The Trojan War ended with the destruction of Troy and the death of many of the Trojan and Greek heroes who fought in the war.",
