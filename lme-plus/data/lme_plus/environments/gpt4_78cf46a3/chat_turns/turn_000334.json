  "content": "Yes, the enclosure movement had a significant impact on farmers and peasants who were forced to leave their land. They often struggled to find other work, as they were not trained for other professions. Many were forced to move to urban areas and become laborers, while others turned to cottage industries or tenant farming.\n\nTenant farming involved renting land from a landowner and paying rent in cash or in kind. However, the rent was often too high, and peasants struggled to make ends meet. In some cases, tenant farmers were subject to the whims of the landowners and had little control over their lives.\n\nThe enclosure movement also contributed to social unrest, as many people felt they were being unfairly treated. The Tudor government tried to address these concerns, but it was often difficult to find a balance between the interests of the landowners and the needs of the people.\n\nOverall, the enclosure movement had a significant impact on the lives of farmers and peasants, as they were forced to adapt to a changing economic and social landscape.",
