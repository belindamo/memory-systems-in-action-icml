It's great to hear that you're involved in promoting literacy and a love for reading among kids.\n\nI'd be happy to recommend some kids' books and authors that might be suitable for a reading event. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Classic authors:** Dr. Seuss, Roald Dahl, Judy Blume, and C.S. Lewis are always popular choices. Their books are timeless, fun, and engaging for kids of all ages.\n2. **Modern authors:** Some popular modern authors for kids include:\n\t* **Middle Grade:**Rick Riordan (Percy Jackson series), Neil Gaiman (The Graveyard Book), and Kate DiCamillo (The Tale of Despereaux).\n\t* **Picture Books:** Jon Klassen (I Want My Hat Back), Mac Barnett (Extra Yarn), and Christian Robinson (Last Stop on Market Street).\n3. **Diverse books:** Consider featuring books that showcase diverse characters, cultures, and experiences. Some examples include:\n\t* **The Skin You Live In** by Michael Tyler (a poetic exploration of self-acceptance and diversity)\n\t* **The Name Jar** by Yangsook Choi (a heartwarming story about a Korean-American girl finding her place)\n\t* **Wishtree** by Katherine Applegate (a novel about a tree that witnesses the changing tides of history and community)\n4. **Interactive books:** Choose books that encourage audience participation, such as:\n\t* **We Don't Eat Our Classmates** by Ryan T. Higgins (a humorous story about a young T-Rex learning to control his impulses)\n\t* **The Book with No Pictures** by B.J. Novak (a hilarious book that encourages kids to make silly sounds and participate in the storytelling process)\n\nRemember to consider the age range and interests of the kids attending the event when selecting books. You could also consider hosting a themed event, such as a costume party or a craft activity, to make the experience even more engaging and fun!\n\nI hope these suggestions help. Do you have any other questions or need more recommendations?",
