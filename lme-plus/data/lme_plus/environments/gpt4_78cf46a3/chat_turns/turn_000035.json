Use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter to ensure that it captures even the smallest particles. 2. Spot clean spills immediately: When spills happen, it's important to clean them up as soon as possible to prevent stains from setting in. Blot up the spill with a clean cloth and then use a solution of warm water and mild dish soap to clean the area. 3. Use baking soda: Sprinkle baking soda on your carpets and let it sit for a few hours before vacuuming. This can help absorb odors and freshen up your carpets. 4. Avoid wearing shoes inside: Shoes can track in dirt, oil and other particles that can get embedded in your carpet fibers. Encourage your family and guests to remove their shoes before entering your home. 5. Hire a professional: Consider hiring a professional carpet cleaner every six months to a year to deep clean your carpets and remove deep set dirt and stains. By following these tips, you can help keep your carpets clean and fresh for longer.",
