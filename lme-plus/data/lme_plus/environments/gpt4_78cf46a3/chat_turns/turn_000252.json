  "content": "Here is a revised functional specification for the Annotation screen:\n\nPurpose\n-------\n\nThe Annotation screen is a key component of the annotation tool, allowing users to view and annotate documents with labels. The purpose of the Annotation screen is to provide a user-friendly interface for taggers to classify and annotate documents, and for checkers to review and verify the annotations made by taggers.\n\nScope\n-----\n\nThe Annotation screen is designed to support the following actions:\n\n* Viewing a document: Tagger and Checker users can view a document in the Annotation screen.\n* Selecting a classification: Tagger users can select a classification for the document before starting the annotation task. The classification will determine the list of labels that are relevant to the document.\n* Annotating with labels: Tagger users can choose labels from the relevant list and place them on the document. They can adjust the position, size, and shape of the labels, and edit their name and description. Tagger users can also change the color of the labels.\n* Reviewing annotations: Checker users can view the labels that have been placed on the document by Tagger users. They can approve or reject each label, and modify the labels if necessary. Checker users can also add comments for each label.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nThe Annotation screen provides the following features:\n\n* Document view: The Annotation screen displays the document in a viewport, allowing users to view the document in its entirety or zoom in and out.\n* Classification selection: Tagger users can select a classification for the document from a list of options. The selected classification will determine the list of labels that are relevant to the document.\n* Label list: Tagger users can see the list of labels that are relevant to the selected classification. The label list includes the name and description of each label, as well as its color.\n* Annotation tools: Tagger users can use annotation tools (e.g. draw, text) to place labels on the document. They can adjust the position, size, and shape of the labels, and edit their name and description. Tagger users can also change the color of the labels.\n* Document outline: The Annotation screen displays the document outline (e.g. headings, subheadings), allowing users to jump to a specific page or heading in the document.\n* Navigation tools: The Annotation screen provides tools for navigating between pages in the document (e.g. page thumbnails, page search).\n* Annotation history: The Annotation screen displays the history of changes for each label on the document (e.g. who made the change, when the change was made).\n\nUser interface\n--------------\n\nThe Annotation screen includes the following UI elements:\n\n* Document viewport: Displays the document in a viewport, allowing users to view the document in its entirety or zoom in and out.\n* Classification selection: A dropdown menu that allows Tagger users to select a classification for the document.\n* Label list: A list of labels that are relevant to the selected classification. The label list includes the name and description of each label, as well as its color.\n* Annotation tools: Tools (e.g. draw, text) that allow Tagger users to place labels on the document.\n* Document outline: A list of headings and subheadings in the document, allowing users to jump to a specific page or heading.\n* Navigation tools: Tools (e.g. page thumbnails, page search) that allow",
