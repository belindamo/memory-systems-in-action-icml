  "content": "You're already ahead of the game! Heirloom tomatoes, basil, and marigolds are a great combination. Heirloom tomatoes will appreciate the company of basil, which will not only repel pests but also add flavor to your tomato dishes. Marigolds will help deter nematodes and attract beneficial insects, creating a healthy and balanced ecosystem.\n\nKeep an eye on your plants' progress, and make sure to provide them with the right amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients. Heirloom tomatoes can be a bit more finicky than hybrid varieties, but with proper care, they'll reward you with delicious and unique flavors.\n\nSome additional tips for your heirloom tomatoes:\n\n1. **Provide support:** Heirloom tomatoes can grow quite large, so make sure to provide them with a sturdy trellis or cage to keep them upright and encourage even growth.\n2. **Soil care:** Heirloom tomatoes love well-draining, rich soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Add compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and structure.\n3. **Water deeply:** Tomatoes need consistent moisture, especially when they're fruiting. Water them deeply once or twice a week, depending on weather conditions.\n4. ** Mulch around the plants:** Mulch helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Use organic mulch like straw, bark chips, or grass clippings around 2-3 inches thick.\n5. **Keep an eye out for pests:** Inspect your plants regularly for signs of pests like hornworms, aphids, or whiteflies. Use organic pest control methods whenever possible to maintain a balanced ecosystem.\n\nEnjoy watching your garden grow, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance!",
