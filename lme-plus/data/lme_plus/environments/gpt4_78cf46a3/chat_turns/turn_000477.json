  "content": "I think that's a great idea! Herbs like cilantro, mint, and parsley can add a fresh and bright flavor to stir-fries. I've used cilantro in some of my Mexican-inspired stir-fries with great results, and mint is a classic addition to many Southeast Asian dishes. Parsley is a bit more subtle, but it can add a nice depth to Mediterranean-style stir-fries.\n\nSpeaking of Mediterranean flavors, I've been wanting to try out some new recipes that incorporate ingredients like olives, artichoke hearts, and feta cheese. Do you have any favorite Mediterranean-inspired stir-fry recipes or tips for working with these ingredients?",
