  "content": "I think the Klimt prints will add a nice contrast to the calm, ocean-inspired vibe in my living room. The bold, vibrant colors and ornate patterns in the prints will create a nice visual interest and add some energy to the space. I'm planning to hang them in my office, which is a separate room, so I don't think they'll directly affect the atmosphere of my living room. But I do like the idea of creating a sense of continuity between the two spaces by incorporating some similar elements, like using a similar frame style or color palette. Do you have any tips on how to choose a color palette for a room, especially when working with art pieces that have strong colors like Klimt's?",
