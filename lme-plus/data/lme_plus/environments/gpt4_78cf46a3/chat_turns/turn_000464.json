  "content": "Collectives, also known as group licensing programs, can help athletic programs and college athletes maximize their earning potential through the use of NIL.\n\nA collective is a group of athletes who come together to collectively license their NIL rights to third parties, such as brands or marketing agencies. By pooling their NIL rights together, athletes can negotiate better deals and gain more leverage in the marketplace.\n\nAthletic programs can also use collectives to help their athletes navigate the complexities of NIL and protect their eligibility. By working with a collective, athletes can receive education and support on legal and financial matters, as well as assistance with negotiating and executing deals. This can help athletes avoid potential violations of NCAA rules and ensure that they are receiving fair compensation for their NIL rights.\n\nAdditionally, collectives can provide a centralized platform for brands and marketers to connect with college athletes, making it easier for both parties to navigate the complex and evolving NIL landscape. By working with a collective, athletic programs can provide their athletes with more opportunities to monetize their NIL, which can in turn help attract and retain top talent.\n\nOverall, collectives can help athletic programs and college athletes maximize their earning potential and navigate the new era of NIL in college sports.",
