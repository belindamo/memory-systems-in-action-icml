Wukong and Macaque had led their troops in taking out the remaining spider demons, with Ao Lie and Bai Long Ma working alongside them.\n\nAs the fighting began to die down, messages started pouring in from the other rebel cells across the land, reporting that the demons in their respective cities were being taken out as well. The news was spreading like wildfire - the fight for freedom had been won.\n\nThe rebels regrouped in the city square, where Wukong stood atop a makeshift platform, addressing the gathered citizens and rebels.\n\n\"Today, we have shown that the spider demons can be defeated!\" he announced, his voice ringing with pride. \"With the help of our allies across the land, we have taken down Spider Queen and her minions. But the fight is not yet over. We must continue to work together to ensure that the demons never regain their grip on our land.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and applause, with some even hoisting the monkeys on their shoulders in celebration. The sense of unity and purpose was palpable.\n\nAo Lie and Bai Long Ma stood together, smiling at the scene before them. \"We did it,\" Ao Lie said, still a bit in shock from the events of the day.\n\nBai Long Ma nodded in agreement. \"And we'll continue to do it,\" he said, determination shining in his eyes. \"For as long as it takes.\"",
