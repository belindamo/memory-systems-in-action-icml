  "content": "It sounds like you have a beautiful and eclectic space. Mixing modern and traditional elements can create a unique and interesting aesthetic. For your Klimt prints, you might consider a frame that bridges both styles. Here are a few ideas:\n\n* A modern frame with a subtle ornamentation, such as a thin gold or silver leaf border, to nod to Klimt's ornate style while still feeling contemporary.\n* A wooden frame with a clean, minimalist profile, but with a subtle distressing or worn finish to add some traditional charm.\n* A frame with a bold, geometric shape, such as a hexagon or octagon, to add some modern flair while still complementing Klimt's intricate patterns.\n\nRemember to consider the colors and tones in the prints, as well as the overall mood and atmosphere you want to create in your office. You might also think about the style of the furniture and decor in the room to ensure the frames feel cohesive with the space.\n\nIt's great that you're enjoying your new \"Sunset Over the Ocean\" painting! Local artists can bring such a unique perspective and energy to their work. The ocean theme is so calming and evocative \u2013 I can see why it would be a great addition to your living room. Have you thought about grouping it with other ocean-inspired pieces, such as shells, driftwood, or nautical-themed decor, to create a cohesive coastal vibe?\n\nHow do you think the Klimt prints will complement the ocean-inspired painting, and vice versa? Will you be creating a sense of continuity between the two spaces, or do you want to create a distinct atmosphere in each room?",
