By the way, I've been pretty active in the literary scene lately, attending a lot of book readings and events. Speaking of which, I recently participated in an online book club discussion on Facebook Live, where we discussed \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah. It was a great discussion, and I was happy to revisit the characters and themes with other readers. Do you think any of these books you've recommended would be a good fit for a book club discussion?",
