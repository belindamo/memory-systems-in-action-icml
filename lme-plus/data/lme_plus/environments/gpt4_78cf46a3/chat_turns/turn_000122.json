  "content": "I love the idea of incorporating the symbolism of the Tarot, with Somer's little white dog representing the Fool card. Your idea makes perfect sense, and it adds a charming touch to the opening scene. Here's a suggestion for how you can develop this idea further:\n\nAs Somer rushes through the central square, her little white dog, sensing her excitement and nervous energy, slips its leash and dashes after a native magical creature that's caught its eye. Somer, torn between delivering her application and catching her dog, decides she must first retrieve her pet to avoid losing it in the bustling square.\n\nAs she chases after her dog, Somer bumps into a kind stranger, who notices her distress and offers to help. Together, they manage to corner the magical creature and the dog in an alley or a small garden, and Somer scoops up her pet while the stranger keeps the magical creature at bay. Grateful for the assistance, Somer thanks the stranger, who wishes her luck on her application and reminds her of the importance of trusting in the journey ahead.\n\nAfter their encounter, Somer continues her mission to deliver her application, now more determined and focused than ever. This brief adventure with her dog not only showcases her priorities and resourcefulness but also allows the reader to experience the rich environment of the central square and the magical elements native to Narcissus.\n\nBy fleshing out this opening scene with specific details, you create an engaging and endearing introduction to Somer and her world. The little white dog adds a delightful touch of whimsy and connects to the Tarot symbolism, further enriching your story. Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you need more guidance!",
