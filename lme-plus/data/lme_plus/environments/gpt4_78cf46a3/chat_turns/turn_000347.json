He watched as people danced, sang and feasted, reveling in their newfound freedom. Suddenly, he felt a hand on his shoulder.\n\nMacaque had approached him quietly and stood next to him, looking down at the corpse. \"It's over,\" he said softly, breaking the silence.\n\nAo Lie nodded slowly. \"I know. It's just... hard to believe that it's all finally over.\"\n\nMacaque sighed. \"It was a long and difficult journey, but we made it through. And we have you to thank for it,\" he said, clapping a hand on Ao Lie's back.\n\nAo Lie looked up at him in surprise. \"Me? I didn't do much. It was all of you who fought so hard to defeat Spider Queen.\"\n\nMacaque shook his head. \"You may not realize it, but your actions were critical to our victory. Without you, we might not have been able to defeat her. You threw that peppermint oil right into her face, giving us the opening we needed to take her down.\"\n\nAo Lie looked down at his feet, feeling a sense of shame. \"I was just lucky, that's all.\"\n\nMacaque chuckled. \"Luck had nothing to do with it. You were brave and resourceful, and you risked your life to help us. That takes real courage.\"\n\nAo Lie looked up at Macaque, surprised by his kind words. \"Thank you. That means a lot to me.\"\n\nMacaque smiled. \"You're one of us now, Ao Lie. A hero of the rebellion. And we'll never forget what you did for us.\"\n\nAo Lie smiled back, feeling a sense of pride and belonging. \"Thank you, Macaque. I'm glad I could help.\"\n\nThey stood together in silence for a few moments, watching the celebration continue around them. The sun was starting to set, casting a warm glow over the city.\n\nMacaque turned to Ao Lie. \"Come on, let's go join the others. It's time to celebrate our victory together.\"\n\nAo Lie nodded, grateful for Macaque's company. They walked off towards the celebration, leaving Spider Queen's corpse behind them.",
