When working with art pieces that have strong colors like Klimt's, here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Start with the artwork**: Take a closer look at the dominant colors in the Klimt prints and your \"Sunset Over the Ocean\" painting. Identify the colors that stand out to you and use those as a starting point for your palette.\n2. **Identify the mood and atmosphere**: Think about the mood and atmosphere you want to create in each room. Do you want your office to feel energized and creative, or calm and focused? This will help you determine whether to emphasize warm, cool, or neutral tones.\n3. **Consider the color wheel**: Use the color wheel to find harmonious color combinations. Analogous colors (next to each other on the wheel) can create a cohesive look, while complementary colors (opposite each other) can add contrast and visual interest.\n4. **Limit your palette**: Too many colors can create visual overload. Try to limit your palette to 3-5 main colors, with 1-2 accent colors. This will help create a sense of unity and make it easier to choose furniture, decor, and accessories.\n5. **Test and adjust**: Use paint swatches, fabric scraps, or online color picker tools to test your color palette. See how the colors look together and adjust as needed.\n6. **Don't forget about neutrals**: Neutral colors like beige, gray, or white can provide a calm background for your bold, colorful art pieces. They can also help to balance out the space and create a sense of harmony.\n7. **Consider the lighting**: Think about the lighting in each room and how it will affect the colors. Natural light can bring out different tones and hues, while artificial light can change the color temperature.\n\nFor your office, you might consider a palette that incorporates some of the bold, vibrant colors from the Klimt prints, such as:\n\n* Warm golden yellows and oranges\n* Deep, rich blues and greens\n* Rich reds and burgundies\n* Creamy whites and beiges to provide contrast and balance\n\nFor your living room, you might focus on a palette that complements the calming, ocean-inspired vibe, such as:\n\n* Soothing blues and greens\n* Soft, muted neutrals like beige or gray\n* Warm, natural tones like driftwood or sandy beige\n* Accents of coral or turquoise to add a pop of color\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and experiment with different color combinations until you find a palette that feels cohesive and inspiring to you!",
