For oil stains: Sprinkle baking soda, cornstarch or talcum powder over the stain and let it sit for a few hours to absorb the oil. Once it's absorbed, brush off the powder and rinse with water. If the stain is still visible, apply a small amount of dish soap to the affected area and wash as usual. 2. For wine stains: Blot up as much of the stain as possible with a paper towel. If you have white wine, pour it over the stain and blot again. Then, sprinkle salt on the stain and let it absorb the liquid. After that, rinse with cold water and apply a small amount of dish soap if necessary. 3. For urine stains: Mix equal parts water and vinegar in a spray bottle and spray the affected area. Let it sit for a few minutes and then blot with a clean cloth. 4. For bloodstains: Soak the affected area in cold water for a few hours. If the stain is still visible, apply a paste made from baking soda and water and let it sit for a few hours. Once it's dry, brush off the paste and wash as usual. It's important to avoid using hot water or bleach on tough stains as they can set the stain permanently. With these tips, you should be able to remove most tough stains from your home.",
