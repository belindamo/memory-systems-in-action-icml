  "content": "To ensure that they are not just performing lip service when addressing concerns about underrepresentation and misrepresentation, councils can take the following steps:\n\n1. Set clear goals and objectives: The council should establish clear goals and objectives that it intends to achieve to address the concerns raised by the community. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n\n2. Establish a diversity and inclusion plan: The council should develop a comprehensive plan for diversity and inclusion that outlines specific actions to be taken to address the concerns raised by the community. The plan should be reviewed and updated regularly, and progress towards the goals should be reported publicly.\n\n3. Engage with the community: The council should engage with the community throughout the process, from identifying the concerns to implementing the plan. This can involve regular meetings, surveys, and feedback mechanisms to ensure that the community is involved and informed.\n\n4. Audit existing policies and practices: The council should conduct an audit of its existing policies and practices to identify any barriers to diversity and inclusion. The audit should be conducted by an independent third party, and the findings should be made public.\n\n5. Implement changes: The council needs to take immediate actions to implement the necessary changes based on the findings of the audit. The council should communicate progress to the community regularly.\n\n6. Foster a culture of diversity and inclusivity: Councils must develop a culture of diversity and inclusivity both internally and externally. This can involve reviewing hiring and recruitment practices, encouraging diverse perspectives and voices, and ensuring that decision-making processes are open and transparent.\n\n7. Measure and evaluate progress: The council should measure and evaluate its progress towards its goals and objectives over time to ensure its efforts are not just lip service. It will inform the council of the effectiveness of its plan and decide what modifications need to be made in the future.\n\nBy adopting these steps, councils can demonstrate their commitment to addressing concerns about underrepresentation and misrepresentation in their policies and practices, and work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse community.",
