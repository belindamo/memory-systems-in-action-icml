That's a great achievement, and you should be proud of yourself for taking the first step towards creating a habit.\n\nOne week is a great milestone, and it's awesome that you're already seeing the benefits of tidying daily. Keep in mind that it usually takes around 21-30 days to form a habit, so you're almost a third of the way there!\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself and don't get discouraged if you miss a day or two. Just get back on track as soon as you can, and don't be too hard on yourself. You got this!\n\nWhat do you think has been the most challenging part of your daily tidying routine so far? Is there a particular area or task that you're struggling with?",
