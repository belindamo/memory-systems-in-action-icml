Some laundry detergents are specifically designed to tackle tough stains, while others may not be as effective.\n\nSince you're loyal to your particular brand of laundry detergent, it's great that you're hoping it will work well with the enzyme-based stain remover. The good news is that many laundry detergents are designed to work well with stain removers, and the combination of the two can be very effective.\n\nHere are a few factors to consider when it comes to your laundry detergent and its ability to remove tough stains:\n\n1. **Enzyme content**: Look for laundry detergents that contain enzymes, which are proteins that break down protein-based stains like grass, blood, and sweat. If your detergent contains enzymes, it's more likely to work well with an enzyme-based stain remover.\n2. **Surfactant level**: Surfactants are the primary cleaning agents in laundry detergent. A detergent with a higher surfactant level may be more effective at removing tough stains.\n3. **pH level**: The pH level of your detergent can affect its ability to remove stains. A detergent with a pH level close to neutral (around 7) may be more effective at removing stains than one with a high or low pH level.\n\nIf you're unsure about your laundry detergent's stain-removing abilities, you can always check the label or manufacturer's website for information on its stain-fighting capabilities. You may also want to consider looking for detergents that are specifically designed to remove tough stains, such as sports or outdoor detergents.\n\nIn your case, since you're already using a detergent you like, it's worth trying it with the enzyme-based stain remover. If you're not satisfied with the results, you could consider switching to a detergent that's specifically designed for tough stain removal.\n\nRemember, the key to removing tough stains is to act quickly, blot instead of rub, and use the right combination of stain remover and laundry detergent. Good luck, and I hope your son's soccer uniform comes out looking like new!",
