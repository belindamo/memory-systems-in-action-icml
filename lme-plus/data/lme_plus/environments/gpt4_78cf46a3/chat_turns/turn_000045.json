Based on your budget of $10,000, you can expect to allocate funds as follows:\n\n* Hardscaping (patio, walkways, etc.): 40-50%\n* Plantings and landscaping: 30-40%\n* Decorative elements (lighting, furniture, etc.): 10-20%\n* Miscellaneous (design, permits, etc.): 10%\n\nFeel free to mix and match elements from each concept or add your own ideas to create a unique design that suits your taste and lifestyle.",
