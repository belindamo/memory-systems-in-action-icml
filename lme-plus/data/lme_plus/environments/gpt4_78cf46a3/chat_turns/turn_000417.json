However, opinions about the game's current state vary depending on individual experiences and expectations.\n\nPatch 1.5 was a major milestone in the game's development, and it addressed many of the critical issues that plagued the game at launch. The patch brought notable improvements to performance, quest stability, and overall gameplay.\n\nThat being said, some players still report encountering occasional bugs, glitches, or performance issues, especially on lower-end hardware. The game's optimization is still not perfect, and some players may experience framerate drops or stuttering in certain areas.\n\nIf you're considering picking up the game again, I'd recommend doing some research and reading recent reviews or feedback from players who have played the game post-patch 1.5. This will give you a better understanding of the game's current state and help you decide if it's worth diving back in.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider the following:\n\n1. CD Projekt RED is still actively supporting the game and releasing new patches and content.\n2. The game's core story, characters, and world are still widely praised, and many players have reported enjoying the game despite its technical issues.\n3. If you're playing on a high-end PC or a next-gen console, you may have a smoother experience than those playing on lower-end hardware.\n\nUltimately, whether or not Cyberpunk 2077 is worth picking up again depends on your personal tolerance for potential technical issues and your willingness to overlook some of the remaining flaws in favor of the game's engaging story and world.\n\nIf you do decide to jump back in, I hope you'll have a better experience this time around!",
