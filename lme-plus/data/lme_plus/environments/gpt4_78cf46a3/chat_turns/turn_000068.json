The ceremony is overseen by the tribe's shamans, who perform elaborate ceremonies and blessings to ensure the couple's happiness and success.\n\nThe ceremony typically takes place in a specially designated area of the camp, which is adorned with elaborate decorations and colorful textiles. The couple is dressed in their finest clothes, which are often made from the hides of the mammoths, adorned with intricate designs and patterns.\n\nThe ceremony begins with the couple exchanging vows and making promises to one another. They are then presented with gifts from their families and friends, which are often handmade items such as clothing, tools, or other practical items that will be useful in their new life together.\n\nNext, the shamans perform a series of blessings and rituals to invoke the spirits and ensure the couple's happiness and success. This may involve the burning of sacred herbs, the recitation of prayers and incantations, and the playing of traditional instruments.\n\nThe final act of the ceremony involves the couple drinking from a shared vessel, which is filled with a special elixir made from the sacred plants of the high plateaus. This is a symbol of their union and their commitment to one another, and is believed to imbue the couple with good fortune and fertility.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the couple and their families gather for a feast and celebration, which may last for several days. This is a time for the couple to receive gifts and well-wishes from their friends and loved ones, and to enjoy the company of those closest to them.\n\nOverall, the marriage ceremony of the Mammoth Tribe is a beautiful and meaningful celebration of love and commitment. It is deeply rooted in the tribe's spiritual beliefs and cultural traditions, and serves as an important rite of passage for the couple and their families.",
