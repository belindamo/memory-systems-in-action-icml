Since you're loyal to your preferred brand of laundry detergent, it's likely that it will work well with the enzyme-based stain remover.\n\nRemember to follow the steps I outlined earlier, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or need more guidance. Keep in mind that pre-treating with your laundry detergent may help loosen the stain, but the enzyme-based stain remover will still do the heavy lifting to break down the grass stain.\n\nHere are a few additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Make sure to rinse the garment thoroughly after pre-treating with detergent to remove any excess detergent that might interfere with the stain remover.\n* Apply the enzyme-based stain remover according to the product's instructions, and let it sit for the recommended time before washing.\n* If the stain is particularly stubborn, you may need to repeat the process a few times before it's completely gone.\n\nBy combining your trusted laundry detergent with the enzyme-based stain remover, you may be able to create a powerful stain-fighting duo that will help remove the grass stain from your son's soccer uniform.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you'll be thrilled with the results!",
