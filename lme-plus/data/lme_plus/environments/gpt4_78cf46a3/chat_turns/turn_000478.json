Olives, artichoke hearts, and feta cheese are all fantastic ingredients to work with, and I've got some tips and recipes to share with you.\n\n**Olives:**\n\n* Use a mix of green and black olives for a nice contrast in flavor and texture.\n* Slice or pit olives and add them towards the end of the stir-fry to preserve their brininess.\n* Pair olives with ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes, capers, and lemon for a classic Mediterranean flavor profile.\n\n**Artichoke Hearts:**\n\n* Canned or marinated artichoke hearts work well in stir-fries. Look for ones that are packed in water or olive oil for the best flavor.\n* Chop artichoke hearts into quarters or slices to distribute their flavor and texture throughout the dish.\n* Artichoke hearts pair well with ingredients like spinach, feta cheese, and lemon for a Greek-inspired flavor profile.\n\n**Feta Cheese:**\n\n* Crumbling feta into small pieces helps it melt and distribute its salty flavor throughout the dish.\n* Pair feta with ingredients like kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and fresh parsley for a classic Greek flavor profile.\n* Feta can be quite salty, so balance its flavor with ingredients like lemon juice or herbs like parsley or dill.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Mediterranean Stir-Fry with Olives, Artichoke Hearts, and Feta**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 cup mixed vegetables (bell peppers, onions, zucchini, etc.)\n* 1/2 cup pitted and sliced olives\n* 1/2 cup canned or marinated artichoke hearts, chopped\n* 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon lemon juice\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
