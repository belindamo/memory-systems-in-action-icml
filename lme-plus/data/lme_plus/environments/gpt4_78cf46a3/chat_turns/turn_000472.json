Look for canned jackfruit in brine or use fresh jackfruit and cook it until tender.\n6. **Vegan meat alternatives**: Some popular options include vegan chicken strips, beef strips, or meatballs made from plant-based ingredients like pea protein, soy protein, or mushroom-based proteins.\n7. **Chickpeas**: Like edamame, chickpeas can be added to stir-fries for a protein-rich and fiber-rich snack or meal.\n8. **Vegan sausages**: Many vegan sausages can be sliced and added to stir-fries for a meaty flavor and texture.\n\nWhen working with new protein sources, keep the following tips in mind:\n\n* **Marinate or season**: Marinate or season your protein of choice to enhance flavor and texture.\n* **Adjust cooking time**: Different proteins have different cooking times, so adjust the stir-fry cooking time accordingly.\n* **Texture and flavor**: Balance the texture and flavor of your protein with the other ingredients in your stir-fry.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different combinations of protein sources and vegetables to create unique and delicious stir-fries!\n\nWhat's your go-to stir-fry vegetable combination?
