Since you mentioned you have a yoga class on March 15th, I'll assume that's a weekend morning class. Here's a blank template to get us started:\n\n**Week 1 (March 13-19)**\n\n* Saturday, March 15: Yoga (morning)\n* [Add other classes/workouts for the week]\n\n**Week 2 (March 20-26)**\n\n* [Add classes/workouts for the week]\n\n**Week 3 (March 27-April 2)**\n\n* [Add classes/workouts for the week]\n\n**Week 4 (April 3-9)**\n\n* [Add classes/workouts for the week]\n\nNow, let's fill in some classes for each week.
