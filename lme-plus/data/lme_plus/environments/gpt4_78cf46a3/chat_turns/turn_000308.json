  "content": "I apologize, but I've searched extensively and couldn't find any information about Emily J. Miller or her novel \"The Whispering Walls\". It's possible that it's a very new or unknown author, or maybe it's a local or self-published book that hasn't gained much online presence yet.\n\nHowever, I'm still happy to help you find a book with a similar atmosphere and immersive world-building. Can you tell me more about the atmosphere of \"The Whispering Walls\"? Was it dark and mysterious, light and whimsical, or something else? Were there any specific elements that drew you in, such as magical realism, historical settings, or mythical creatures?\n\nAlso, are you open to trying out debut authors or do you prefer established authors? Are there any particular age ranges or audiences you're interested in (e.g. adult, young adult, middle grade)?\n\nLet me try to suggest a few books that might fit the vibe you're looking for:\n\n* \"The Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern (magical realism, whimsical atmosphere)\n* \"The Bear and the Nightingale\" by Katherine Arden (atmospheric, lyrical writing, fantasy elements)\n* \"The City of Brass\" by S.A. Chakraborty (immersive world-building, fantasy, Middle Eastern-inspired setting)\n* \"The Golem and the Jinni\" by Helene Wecker (historical fantasy, atmospheric, mythological creatures)\n\nLet me know if any of these resonate with you, or if you'd like more suggestions!",
