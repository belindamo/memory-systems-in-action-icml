  "content": "I love trying new vegetables in my stir-fries! Bok choy and snow peas sound like great additions - I've had them in stir-fries before and they add a nice crunch and sweetness. I've also been meaning to try out Thai basil, as I've heard it pairs really well with the savory flavors of soy sauce and tamari. Do you have any tips on how to prepare Thai basil for stir-fries, or any favorite recipes that feature it?",
