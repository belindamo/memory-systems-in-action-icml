Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation, and I don't retain any information from previous chats.\n\nHowever, I'm happy to help you reflect on when you started your daily tidying routine! Take a moment to think back... Was it a New Year's resolution? Did you start after a big move or a decluttering project? Maybe you read a book or article that inspired you to create a tidying habit?\n\nReflecting on how you started your daily tidying routine can help you appreciate how far you've come and motivate you to continue your progress. Keep up the good work, and remember that every small step towards a tidier space is a step in the right direction!",
