That's a great accomplishment!\n\nAs for playing through the entire series in one go or taking breaks in between each game, it ultimately depends on your personal preferences and playstyle. Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Playing through the entire series in one go:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Immersion: Playing through the series in one go can help you stay immersed in the world and story of Dark Souls.\n* Momentum: You'll maintain momentum and momentum is key in Dark Souls. You'll be more familiar with the gameplay mechanics, and you'll be able to tackle the challenges ahead with more confidence.\n* Continuity: Playing through the series in one go can help you appreciate the connections and nods between the games more easily.\n\nCons:\n\n* Burnout: Playing through the entire series in one go can be exhausting, both mentally and emotionally. Dark Souls is a challenging series, and playing through it non-stop can lead to burnout.\n* Lack of perspective: Without taking breaks, you might not have time to reflect on your experience, and you might not appreciate the individual games as much.\n\n**Taking breaks in between each game:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Reflection: Taking breaks can give you time to reflect on your experience, and you might appreciate the individual games more.\n* Fresh perspective: Taking breaks can help you approach each game with a fresh perspective, and you might notice things you wouldn't have noticed otherwise.\n* Avoiding burnout: Breaking up your playthrough can help you avoid burnout and maintain your enthusiasm for the series.\n\nCons:\n\n* Rustiness: Taking breaks can make you rusty, and you might need to relearn some of the mechanics and strategies you developed earlier.\n* Disconnection: Taking breaks can disrupt your connection to the world and story of Dark Souls, making it harder to get back into the game.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide how you want to approach playing through the Dark Souls series. If you're someone who enjoys binge-playing games, playing through the entire series in one go might be the way to go. However, if you're someone who prefers to take your time and reflect on your experience, taking breaks in between each game might be the better approach.\n\nSince you've already made progress in Dark Souls 3, you might consider taking a break before moving on to the next game in the series. This will give you time to reflect on your experience, recharge, and approach the next game with a fresh perspective.",
