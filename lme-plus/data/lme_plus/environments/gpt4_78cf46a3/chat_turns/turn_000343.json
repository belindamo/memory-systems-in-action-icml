The rebellion had won and the city was finally free.\n\nAs the day progressed, a massive celebration was organized to commemorate their victory. The city center was filled with citizens, rebels, and former prisoners who had been freed from the spider demons' grip. A stage had been erected, and the leaders of the rebellion were brought up to thunderous applause.\n\nWukong, Macaque, and Bai Long Ma stood at the forefront, beaming with pride. They raised their arms to quiet the crowd and stepped aside to make way for a smaller figure. Ao Lie was pulled onto the stage with them, looking bewildered and overwhelmed.\n\n\"These brave warriors,\" Wukong shouted, gesturing to the other leaders beside him, \"have fought long and hard to take down the Spider Queen and her minions. But today, we are here to honor a special member of our team. A young man who, through his bravery and quick thinking, gave us the opening we needed to win.\"\n\nThe crowd cheered, and Wukong turned to Ao Lie. \"Ao Lie, step forward,\" he said, his voice ringing out across the square.\n\nAo Lie stepped forward nervously, his heart pounding in his chest. He looked out at the sea of faces before him and felt a wave of emotion wash over him.\n\n\"Ao Lie,\" Macaque called out, \"you picked up that vial of peppermint oil and threw it right into Spider Queen's face. You gave us the chance we needed to defeat her once and for all.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers, and Ao Lie felt his face flush with pride.\n\n\"You are a true hero,\" Bai Long Ma added, a smile spreading across his face.\n\nAo Lie looked out at the crowd once more and felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before. He had always felt like an outsider, but here, among these people, he felt like he belonged.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Thank you for giving me a chance to be a part of something bigger than myself.\"\n\nThe crowd cheered once more, and Ao Lie felt like he could conquer the world. The fight for freedom had been won, and he had played a small but important role in it.",
