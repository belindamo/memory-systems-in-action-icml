Saren was born into the tribe's hunting caste and has been hunting since she was a child. Her father, who was also a renowned hunter in the tribe, recognized her natural talents and began training her from a young age.\n\nSaren's training included both physical and spiritual elements, as she was taught how to track animals and use weapons, as well as how to communicate with animal spirits and other supernatural forces that were believed to be essential to successful hunting.\n\nAs Saren grew older, she quickly became known as one of the tribe's most skilled hunters, and her reputation spread beyond the tribe's borders.
