  "content": "Mercury's atmosphere is virtually non-existent because it has a weak gravitational field and is close to the Sun. Mercury's close proximity to the Sun means that it experiences intense solar winds that strip away any atmosphere that may have formed. Additionally, Mercury's small size and weak gravitational field cannot hold onto an atmosphere like the larger planets in our solar system. The surface of Mercury is also constantly bombarded with high energy particles from the Sun, which would quickly strip away any atmosphere.",
