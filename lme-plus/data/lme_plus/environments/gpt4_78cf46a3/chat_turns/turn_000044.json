  "content": "My backyard is about 1/4 acre, and the adjacent strip of land is pretty narrow, only about 10 feet wide. The yard is roughly rectangular, and my house is more of a modern style. We live in a sunny climate, and there's a large tree in the corner of the yard that I'd like to keep. I'm thinking of using the patio and garden for relaxation and entertaining, and I'm open to various design styles. My budget is around $10,000.",
