  "content": "Concept 2: Tree-Centered Haven is a beautiful design that highlights the existing tree while creating a serene and inviting atmosphere.\n\nFor the linear garden in the 10-foot wide strip of land, you'll want plants that are drought-tolerant, low-maintenance, and can thrive in full sun. Here are some suggestions:\n\n**Ground Covers:**\n\n1. **Creeping Thyme** (Thymus serpyllum): A low-growing, spreading ground cover that can handle foot traffic and requires minimal maintenance.\n2. **Dymondia margaretae** (Silver Carpet): A low-water, fast-spreading ground cover with a silvery-gray color that complements the modern style of your home.\n\n**Drought-Tolerant Perennials:**\n\n1. **Succulents** (e.g., Echeveria, Sedum, Aloe): These come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, and are perfect for hot, sunny spots.\n2. **Yarrow** (Achillea millefolium): A low-maintenance perennial with fern-like foliage and white or yellow flowers that attract pollinators.\n3. **Lavender** (Lavandula spp.): A fragrant, low-water shrub that's perfect for hot, dry spots and attracts pollinators.\n4. **Texas Sage** (Leucophyllum frutescens): A drought-tolerant shrub with beautiful silvery-gray foliage and purple flowers in the summer.\n\n**Ornamental Grasses:**\n\n1. **Blue Oat Grass** (Helictotrichon sempervirens): A low-maintenance, clumping grass with a silvery-blue color that adds texture and movement to the garden.\n2. **Pampas Grass** (Cortaderia selloana): A showy, drought-tolerant grass with feathery plumes that add drama to the garden.\n\n**Tips for Low-Maintenance:**\n\n1. **Mulch**: Use a thick layer of organic mulch (e.g., wood chips, gravel) to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.\n2. **Water Efficiently**: Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth and make them more resistant to drought.\n3. **Prune Regularly**: Prune plants regularly to maintain shape, promote healthy growth, and encourage blooming.\n4. **Choose Healthy Plants**: Select plants that are well-suited to your climate and soil type to minimize maintenance and ensure success.\n\nRemember to consider factors like soil type, mature plant size, and growth habits when selecting plants for your linear garden. You may also want to consult with a local nursery or landscaper to ensure the best plant choices for your specific region.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Would you like more information on any of these plants or would you like me to suggest more options?",
