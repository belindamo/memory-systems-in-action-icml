This is important for building trust and showing that the council is committed to addressing the issue.\n\n2. Consult with the community: The council should consult with the affected community to understand their concerns and experiences. This can involve holding community meetings, surveys, or other forms of engagement.\n\n3. Review policies and practices: The council should review its policies and practices to identify any barriers to representation and inclusion. This can involve looking at hiring practices, recruitment policies, and representation in decision-making bodies.\n\n4. Take action: Based on the feedback and review, the council should take action to address any issues identified. This can include setting targets for representation, changing policies, and increasing community engagement.\n\n5.
