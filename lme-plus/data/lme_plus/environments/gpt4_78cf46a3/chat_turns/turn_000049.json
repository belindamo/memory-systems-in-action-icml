  "content": "Succulents and drought-tolerant perennials are perfect for a low-maintenance garden.\n\n**Succulent Care:**\n\n1. **Watering**: Water sparingly, allowing soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is the most common cause of death in succulents. Watering once a week is a good rule of thumb, but this may vary depending on weather conditions.\n2. **Soil**: Use a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for cacti and succulents.\n3. **Sunlight**: Most succulents need full sun to partial shade. Be careful not to expose them to direct sunlight during the hottest part of the day, as this can cause burning.\n4. **Fertilization**: Feed succulents during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n5. **Pruning**: Remove dead or damaged leaves to maintain appearance and encourage healthy growth.\n6. **Pest control**: Check for pests like mealybugs, spider mites, and scale regularly. Isolate infected plants, and treat with insecticidal soap or neem oil.\n\n**Drought-Tolerant Perennial Care:**\n\n1. **Watering**: Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth. Aim for about 1 inch of water per week, either from rain or irrigation.\n2. **Soil**: Use a well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.\n3. **Sunlight**: Most drought-tolerant perennials need full sun to partial shade.\n4. **Fertilization**: Feed perennials during the growing season with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer.\n5. **Pruning**: Prune perennials regularly to maintain shape, promote healthy growth, and encourage blooming. Cut back dead foliage in the fall to prepare for winter.\n6. **Pest control**: Keep an eye out for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Use organic or integrated pest management methods whenever possible.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n1. **Mulch**: Mulch around plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.\n2. **Monitor weather**: Adjust watering and fertilization schedules based on weather conditions. During extreme heat or drought, reduce watering and fertilization.\n3. **Keep an eye out for disease**: Inspect plants regularly for signs of disease like black spots, powdery mildew, or root rot. Treat promptly if you notice any issues.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving, low-maintenance garden. Remember, it's all about finding the right balance for your plants.\n\nAs for the ornamental grasses, you can still incorporate them into your design, even in a narrow strip of land. Consider using compact or dwarf varieties that won't outgrow the space. Some options include:\n\n* **Blue Oat Grass** (Helictotrichon sempervirens 'Sapphire'): A compact, blue-gray grass that grows to about 2-3 feet tall.\n* **Feather Reed Grass** (Calamagrostis x acutiflora 'Karl Foerster'): A compact, clumping grass that grows to about 2-3 feet tall.\n* **Prairie Brome** (Bromus arvensis): A low-growing, clumping grass that grows to about 1-2 feet tall.\n\nKeep in mind that ornamental grasses may require more maintenance than succulents and drought-tolerant perennials, as they need regular pruning to maintain their shape and prevent them from becoming too dense.\n\nHow's that? Do you have any more questions about caring for succulents and drought-tolerant perennials?",
