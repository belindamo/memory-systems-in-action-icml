  "content": "Wereldfeest is a popular event and usually draws large crowds throughout the day. However, arriving earlier can help you beat the crowds and experience the event at a more relaxed pace. The festival usually opens in the late morning, and people start showing up as the day goes on. So, here are some recommendations on when you can arrive to avoid the crowd to some extent:\n\n1. Arrive early in the morning - It's best to arrive as soon as the festival opens so that you can experience most of the performances and food booths before the crowds start getting bigger. 2. Lunchtime - If you're not an early bird, arriving at the festival during lunchtime could work since some people might be taking a break or having lunch, which might reduce the crowd. 3. On a weekday - The event runs over the weekend, but if you can make it on a weekday, that could be less crowded since people are typically at work during the day. However, it's important to note that the festival has something to offer for everyone and you can still have a wonderful time even amidst the crowd. Choosing the right time to visit ultimately depends on your preference, schedule, and flexibility.",
