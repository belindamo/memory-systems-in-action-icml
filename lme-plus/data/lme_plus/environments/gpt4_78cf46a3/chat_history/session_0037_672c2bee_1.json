Are there any specific days or time slots you prefer for your workouts?\n4. Do you have any other scheduled classes or workouts already planned for the next month?\n5. Are there any specific goals or areas of focus you'd like to prioritize in your fitness routine (e.g., building strength, increasing flexibility, improving cardiovascular health, etc.)?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your schedule and preferences, I can help you plan out your fitness schedule for the next month!"
