Wukong and Macaque had led their troops in taking out the remaining spider demons, with Ao Lie and Bai Long Ma working alongside them.\n\nAs the fighting began to die down, messages started pouring in from the other rebel cells across the land, reporting that the demons in their respective cities were being taken out as well. The news was spreading like wildfire - the fight for freedom had been won.\n\nThe rebels regrouped in the city square, where Wukong stood atop a makeshift platform, addressing the gathered citizens and rebels.\n\n\"Today, we have shown that the spider demons can be defeated!\" he announced, his voice ringing with pride. \"With the help of our allies across the land, we have taken down Spider Queen and her minions. But the fight is not yet over. We must continue to work together to ensure that the demons never regain their grip on our land.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and applause, with some even hoisting the monkeys on their shoulders in celebration. The sense of unity and purpose was palpable.\n\nAo Lie and Bai Long Ma stood together, smiling at the scene before them. \"We did it,\" Ao Lie said, still a bit in shock from the events of the day.\n\nBai Long Ma nodded in agreement. \"And we'll continue to do it,\" he said, determination shining in his eyes. \"For as long as it takes.\""

Wukong, Macaque, Bai Long Ma, and other leaders of the rebellion are celebrated by the crowd. They pull Ao Lie onstage with them and proclaim he's the one that allowed Spider Queen to pick him up and then threw peppermint oil right into her face, giving the rebels the opening they needed to defeat her. Ao Lie feels overwhelmed as the crowd cheers for him too. Let's write that scene with details and dialogue."

      "content": "The sun rose on Megapolis, casting a golden light over the city. The air was thick with excitement and anticipation. The rebellion had won and the city was finally free.\n\nAs the day progressed, a massive celebration was organized to commemorate their victory. The city center was filled with citizens, rebels, and former prisoners who had been freed from the spider demons' grip. A stage had been erected, and the leaders of the rebellion were brought up to thunderous applause.\n\nWukong, Macaque, and Bai Long Ma stood at the forefront, beaming with pride. They raised their arms to quiet the crowd and stepped aside to make way for a smaller figure. Ao Lie was pulled onto the stage with them, looking bewildered and overwhelmed.\n\n\"These brave warriors,\" Wukong shouted, gesturing to the other leaders beside him, \"have fought long and hard to take down the Spider Queen and her minions. But today, we are here to honor a special member of our team. A young man who, through his bravery and quick thinking, gave us the opening we needed to win.\"\n\nThe crowd cheered, and Wukong turned to Ao Lie. \"Ao Lie, step forward,\" he said, his voice ringing out across the square.\n\nAo Lie stepped forward nervously, his heart pounding in his chest. He looked out at the sea of faces before him and felt a wave of emotion wash over him.\n\n\"Ao Lie,\" Macaque called out, \"you picked up that vial of peppermint oil and threw it right into Spider Queen's face. You gave us the chance we needed to defeat her once and for all.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers, and Ao Lie felt his face flush with pride.\n\n\"You are a true hero,\" Bai Long Ma added, a smile spreading across his face.\n\nAo Lie looked out at the crowd once more and felt a sense of belonging he had never experienced before. He had always felt like an outsider, but here, among these people, he felt like he belonged.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Thank you for giving me a chance to be a part of something bigger than myself.\"\n\nThe crowd cheered once more, and Ao Lie felt like he could conquer the world. The fight for freedom had been won, and he had played a small but important role in it."

      "content": "The sun rises on a brand new day, one that brings with it a sense of hope and freedom that Megapolis has not felt in a long time. The streets are packed with cheering citizens, and the sounds of music and laughter fill the air.\n\nOn the main stage in the city center, Wukong, Macaque, Bai Long Ma, and the other leaders of the rebellion stand tall, their faces beaming with pride and joy. They are surrounded by a sea of people, all eager to show their appreciation for the ones who have saved them from the spider demons' tyranny.\n\nSuddenly, the crowd parts as Ao Lie is brought forward by some of the other rebels. He looks nervous and unsure as he stands before the cheering masses. Wukong takes the microphone and addresses the crowd.\n\n\"My fellow citizens of Megapolis, today we celebrate our victory over the spider demons. But this victory would not have been possible without the bravery of one young man. This is Ao Lie, the one who gave us the opening we needed to defeat Spider Queen. He is a hero among heroes, and we are proud to stand beside him today.\"\n\nThe crowd erupts into a deafening roar of applause and cheers, and Ao Lie feels his knees begin to buckle. Wukong puts an arm around his shoulder and guides him to the center of the stage, where the other rebels join him.\n\nBai Long Ma steps forward, grinning from ear to ear. \"You know, I still don't know which one of you is the real Bai Long Ma,\" he jokes, causing the crowd to laugh.\n\nMacaque nudges Ao Lie and whispers, \"They're celebrating you now. You're a part of something bigger than yourself.\"\n\nAo Lie can hardly believe what is happening. He looks out at the sea of faces before him, and for the first time in his life, he feels like he belongs. The rebels have become his family, and the people of Megapolis are his kin.\n\nThe celebration lasts long into the night, and as the stars twinkle in the sky, the people of Megapolis dance and sing and revel in their newfound freedom. And Ao Lie, the boy who once thought he was nothing, knows that he will never forget this moment, that he will carry it with him always."

He watched as people danced, sang and feasted, reveling in their newfound freedom. Suddenly, he felt a hand on his shoulder.\n\nMacaque had approached him quietly and stood next to him, looking down at the corpse. \"It's over,\" he said softly, breaking the silence.\n\nAo Lie nodded slowly. \"I know. It's just... hard to believe that it's all finally over.\"\n\nMacaque sighed. \"It was a long and difficult journey, but we made it through. And we have you to thank for it,\" he said, clapping a hand on Ao Lie's back.\n\nAo Lie looked up at him in surprise. \"Me? I didn't do much. It was all of you who fought so hard to defeat Spider Queen.\"\n\nMacaque shook his head. \"You may not realize it, but your actions were critical to our victory. Without you, we might not have been able to defeat her. You threw that peppermint oil right into her face, giving us the opening we needed to take her down.\"\n\nAo Lie looked down at his feet, feeling a sense of shame. \"I was just lucky, that's all.\"\n\nMacaque chuckled. \"Luck had nothing to do with it. You were brave and resourceful, and you risked your life to help us. That takes real courage.\"\n\nAo Lie looked up at Macaque, surprised by his kind words. \"Thank you. That means a lot to me.\"\n\nMacaque smiled. \"You're one of us now, Ao Lie. A hero of the rebellion. And we'll never forget what you did for us.\"\n\nAo Lie smiled back, feeling a sense of pride and belonging. \"Thank you, Macaque. I'm glad I could help.\"\n\nThey stood together in silence for a few moments, watching the celebration continue around them. The sun was starting to set, casting a warm glow over the city.\n\nMacaque turned to Ao Lie. \"Come on, let's go join the others. It's time to celebrate our victory together.\"\n\nAo Lie nodded, grateful for Macaque's company. They walked off towards the celebration, leaving Spider Queen's corpse behind them."
