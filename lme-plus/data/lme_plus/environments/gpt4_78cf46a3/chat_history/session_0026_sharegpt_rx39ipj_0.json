I wasn't feeling well earlier, but then I suddenly started feeling better and my other friend invited me to the movie last minute. I should have called you to let you know, I'm really sorry about that.\" This explanation attempts to justify Mark's actions and alleviate any tension, but it's still up to Matt to decide if he accepts the excuse or not."

Here's a possible breakdown of how each person might feel:\n\n1. Matt: He might feel like he should be one of the three to go, as he was the one who initially had plans with Mark. Matt could also feel more inclined to include Joe, who wasn't involved in the lie and helped mediate the situation.\n2. Mark: Mark might feel like he should go, especially since he was initially involved in making plans with Matt. To make up for his previous actions, he might suggest that Matt chooses the third person to join them.\n3. The other friend: This friend may feel guilty for lying or causing tension between Matt and Mark. They might volunteer to sit out the escape room as a way to atone for their actions and allow Matt, Mark, and Joe to spend time together.\n4. Joe: As a neutral party who helped mediate the situation, Joe might feel like it's not his place to decide who should go. He could suggest that the group come to a consensus or find an activity that can accommodate everyone.\n\nIn this scenario, the friends need to communicate and consider each other's feelings to decide who should participate in the escape room. They might also look for alternative activities that can include all four friends to maintain a balanced and inclusive dynamic."

Random act of vandalism: Mark might initially assume that an unknown person randomly targeted his car for vandalism, as this is a common occurrence in some areas.\n2. Accident: Mark could consider the possibility that someone accidentally scratched his car while parking or passing by, and the responsible party either didn't notice or didn't leave a note.\n3. The other friend: Mark might suspect that the other friend, who left the group earlier, is responsible for the damage, especially if he is aware of any lingering tension, anger, or jealousy from that friend.\n\nIn any case, Mark will likely feel upset, frustrated, and possibly violated by the damage to his car. He may decide to investigate further to determine who is responsible, report the incident to the authorities, or discuss the situation with his friends to see if they have any information."
