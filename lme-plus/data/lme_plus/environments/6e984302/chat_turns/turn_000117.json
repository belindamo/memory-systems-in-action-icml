However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't provide you with specific recommendations for watchmakers in your area.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to find a reputable watchmaker who specializes in vintage Omega watches:\n\n1. **Omega Authorized Dealers**: Reach out to Omega's official website or contact an Omega authorized dealer in your area. They may have a list of recommended watchmakers or be able to perform the servicing themselves.\n2. **Professional Associations**: Look for watchmakers who are members of professional associations like the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute (AWCI) or the British Horological Institute (BHI). These organizations have directories of members who specialize in watch repair and restoration.\n3. **Online Forums and Communities**: Join online forums like Watchuseek, Timekeeper's Forums, or Reddit's Watch Collectors community. These platforms are great resources for connecting with other collectors and watch enthusiasts who may be able to recommend watchmakers in your area.\n4. **Local Watch Collector Groups**: Search for local watch collector groups or clubs in your area. These groups often have members who are knowledgeable about watch repair and can provide recommendations.\n5. **Word of Mouth**: Ask fellow collectors, friends, or family members who share your passion for watches if they know of any reputable watchmakers in your area.\n6. **Online Search**: Conduct a targeted online search using keywords like \"vintage Omega watch repair\" or \" Omega watchmaker [your city/state]\" to find watchmakers in your area who specialize in Omega watches.\n\nWhen researching watchmakers, make sure to:\n\n* Check their credentials, experience, and certifications\n* Read reviews and ask for references\n* Ask about their experience with vintage Omega watches and your specific model\n* Get a clear estimate of the work, including costs and turnaround time\n* Ensure they use genuine Omega parts or equivalent alternatives\n\nRemember to always prioritize the safety and security of your watch, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if you're unsure about a particular watchmaker.",
