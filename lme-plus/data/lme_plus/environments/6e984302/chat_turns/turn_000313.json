  "content": "Yes, acoustic detections can also provide information on the location of a vessel in the water. By analyzing the sound waves that are emitted by a vessel and received by underwater hydrophones, it is possible to determine the distance and direction of the vessel.\n\nAcoustic localization techniques, such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Phase Difference of Arrival (PDOA), can be used to triangulate the position of a vessel based on the time delay or phase shift of the sound wave at different hydrophone locations. These techniques are commonly used in passive sonar systems to locate and track vessels without emitting any sound signals that could reveal their presence.\n\nIn addition to localization, acoustic detections can also provide information on the speed and direction of a vessel based on changes in its sound signature over time. This information can be used to predict the vessel's trajectory and to manage marine traffic to prevent collisions and ensure safety.",
