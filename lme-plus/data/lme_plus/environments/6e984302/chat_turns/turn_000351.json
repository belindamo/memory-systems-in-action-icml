  "content": "The Maasai people traditionally learn their dances and music from an early age as they grow up within the community. They are taught by older members of the tribe and are also exposed to the music and dance during communal ceremonies and festivals. \n\nThe young boys are taught how to perform the \"Aduma\" dance by older members of the community, who start teaching them the complex jumps and movements at a young age. The training process involves learning the different rhythms and chants used in the dance, as well as perfecting the technique of jumping in a rhythmic manner.\n\nSimilarly, the girls learn traditional songs and dances from the older women in the community while performing duties such as herding and cooking. \n\nThe learning process is usually informal and occurs through observation and participation in communal events. This method of learning is vital in preserving the Maasai cultural heritage and ensuring that younger generations learn and pass on these traditional practices.",
