  "content": "I'm thinking of creating a sculpture that incorporates found objects and natural materials like driftwood and seashells to give it an eco-friendly theme. Do you know of any tips on how to combine these elements in a cohesive way, and how to balance the different textures and colors of these materials? By the way, I've been taking sculpting classes at a local art studio for about 6 weeks now, and I'm really enjoying the process of learning and experimenting with different materials and techniques.",
