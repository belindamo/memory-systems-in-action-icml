Tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots are all wonderful choices for a beginner's garden, and adding herbs like basil, mint, and parsley is a fantastic way to add flavor and fragrance to your cooking.\n\nAdjusting your watering schedule is a crucial part of gardening, and it's great that you've figured it out. Tomatoes, in particular, need consistent moisture, especially when they're producing fruit. Cucumbers and carrots are also sensitive to moisture levels, so it's essential to keep an eye on the soil.\n\nUsing herbs like basil, mint, and parsley is a great way to add freshness and flavor to your cooking. Basil is a natural pest repellent, too, and can help keep pests away from your tomatoes. Mint is known to repel aphids and other pests, while parsley is said to improve the growth and health of nearby plants.\n\nSince you're growing tomatoes, you might want to keep an eye out for common tomato pests like hornworms, aphids, and whiteflies. Regularly inspect your plants, and use your neem oil and soap solution as needed. You can also try adding some tomato-specific companion plants like marigolds, which are said to repel nematodes and other pests that target tomatoes.\n\nFor your cucumbers, keep an eye out for pests like aphids, spider mites, and powdery mildew. Cucumbers are also prone to fungal diseases, so make sure to provide good air circulation and remove any infected leaves or stems.\n\nCarrots are relatively low-maintenance, but they can be susceptible to pests like carrot rust flies and slugs. Use your diatomaceous earth or neem cake to control these pests, and make sure to thin your carrot seedlings to prevent overcrowding.\n\nRemember to keep your garden well-weeded, as weeds can compete with your plants for water and nutrients. Mulching can also help retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.\n\nWhat's been the most rewarding part of gardening for you so far? Is there anything you're looking forward to harvesting or trying in your garden?",
