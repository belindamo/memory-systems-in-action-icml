  "content": "The hybrid battery warranty is a critical aspect of owning a hybrid vehicle, and Toyota's warranty is one of the most comprehensive in the industry.\n\n**Toyota's Hybrid Battery Warranty:**\n\n* Coverage: 10 years or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first\n* Warranty period starts from the vehicle's in-service date\n* Covers the hybrid battery pack, including the battery cells, control module, and electrical connections\n* Warranty is valid for the original owner and subsequent owners (transferable)\n\nToyota's hybrid battery warranty is designed to provide peace of mind for hybrid vehicle owners. The warranty ensures that the hybrid battery pack will retain at least 70% of its original capacity during the warranty period. If the battery pack's capacity falls below 70%, Toyota will repair or replace it free of charge.\n\n**Transferability:**\n\nYes, the hybrid battery warranty is transferable to subsequent owners. When you sell your Corolla Hybrid, the remaining warranty period and coverage will be transferred to the new owner. This can be a significant selling point, as it provides added value and reassurance to potential buyers.\n\nTo transfer the warranty, the new owner will need to provide proof of ownership and the vehicle's maintenance history. Toyota will then update their records to reflect the new owner's information.\n\n**Warranty Conditions:**\n\nTo maintain the hybrid battery warranty, you'll need to follow Toyota's recommended maintenance schedule and adhere to certain conditions, such as:\n\n* Regularly charging the battery pack according to Toyota's guidelines\n* Avoiding extreme temperatures, deep discharging, or overcharging the battery\n* Not modifying the vehicle's electrical system or battery pack\n\nIf you have any concerns about the hybrid battery warranty or its transferability, I recommend consulting with a Toyota dealership or certified mechanic. They can provide more detailed information and address any questions you may have.",
