  "content": "There has been some progress towards narrowing the wealth gap between Black and white residents in Atlanta, but it is important to note that this is a long-term goal that will require sustained effort over time.\n\nSome of the measurable progress that has been made include:\n\n1. Increase in affordable housing: Since the implementation of affordable housing initiatives, the city of Atlanta has seen an increase in the number of affordable housing units available. In 2019 alone, over 1,000 new affordable housing units were created.\n\n2. Job creation: Invest Atlanta's economic development programs have helped to create new job opportunities, particularly in underserved communities. In 2020, Invest Atlanta approved over $1 billion in project investments and helped to create over 600 jobs in the city.\n\n3. Financial coaching: The Atlanta Wealth Building Initiative has provided financial coaching to over 1,500 families since its inception, helping them to increase their savings and build wealth over time.\n\nWhile progress has been made, there is much more work to be done to address the wealth gap between Black and white residents in Atlanta. The city and its partners will need to continue to invest in initiatives and policies that help to create opportunity and address systemic inequalities in order to make meaningful progress towards equity.",
