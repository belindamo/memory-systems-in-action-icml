  "content": "Acoustic detections can be used to differentiate between different types of vessels based on their sound signature or acoustic profile. Each type of vessel emits a unique sound signature based on its size, shape, and propulsion system. This signature can be captured by underwater hydrophones and analyzed to determine the type of vessel that is emitting the sound.\n\nFor example, submarines make distinct sounds that can be differentiated from surface vessels. Similarly, different types of surface vessels, such as cargo ships, fishing boats, and military vessels, emit different sound signatures that can be recognized using acoustic analysis. This information can be used by maritime surveillance systems to track and identify vessels, monitor maritime traffic, and detect potential threats.",
