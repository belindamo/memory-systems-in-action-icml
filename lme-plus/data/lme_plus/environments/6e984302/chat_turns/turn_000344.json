  "content": "I'm actually thinking of growing some sunflowers, zinnias, and maybe some bell peppers or eggplants. I've always loved the way sunflowers look, and I've heard they're great for attracting beneficial insects. Zinnias are also supposed to be easy to grow and add a pop of color to the garden. As for bell peppers and eggplants, I've always enjoyed them in my cooking, and I'd love to have a steady supply right in my backyard.",
