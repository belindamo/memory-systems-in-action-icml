It's like a \"crafting circle of life\" \u2013 you're decluttering, making space, and using the proceeds to create a more organized and functional space.\n\nStorage bins and containers can make a huge difference in keeping your supplies tidy and easily accessible. Just make sure to choose bins and containers that fit your specific needs and the types of supplies you're storing. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Size:** Select bins and containers that are the right size for the items you're storing. You don't want them to be too small or too large, as this can lead to wasted space or difficulty finding what you need.\n2. **Material:** Think about the material of the bins and containers. Clear plastic or transparent bins can be great for seeing what's inside, while fabric or canvas bins might be better for storing items like yarn, fabric, or threads.\n3. **Stackability:** Choose bins and containers that can be stacked to maximize your vertical space and keep your floor clear.\n4. **Labeling:** Consider bins and containers with built-in labels or label holders, or be prepared to add your own labels to ensure you can easily identify what's inside.\n5. **Adaptability:** Select bins and containers that can be used for multiple types of supplies or projects. This will give you flexibility as your crafting interests and projects evolve.\n\nBy investing in storage bins and containers, you'll be creating a more organized, efficient, and enjoyable crafting space. It's a great way to celebrate your success in decluttering and selling your yarn stash, and it will help you stay motivated to continue organizing and creating!\n\nHow's your yarn stash sale going, by the way? Did you use any platforms like Ravelry, eBay, or Facebook Marketplace to sell your yarn?",
