Using burlap or canvas as a table runner will add a wonderful texture to your display, and the natural, earthy tone will complement the wooden crates and flowers perfectly. The rustic, organic feel of burlap or canvas will also tie in nicely with the homemade, artisanal aspect of your candles.\n\nAdding pinecones or pebbles to the display is a great idea, too! The natural elements will add a sense of whimsy and playfulness to your display, and the varying textures will create visual interest. Pinecones, in particular, will add a lovely autumnal touch, which will complement the warm, cozy feel of your candles.\n\nI can totally see it now: the wooden crates as a backdrop, the burlap or canvas table runner, the flowers or plants adding a pop of color, and the pinecones or pebbles adding a touch of whimsy. It's going to be a stunning display!\n\nAnd wow, congratulations to Emma on selling out of her heirloom tomatoes by 11 am! That's impressive, especially considering the early setup time. It's clear that her hard work and dedication to her craft are paying off. I'm sure her customers appreciate the love and care she puts into growing those delicious tomatoes.\n\nRemember, the key to a successful display is to create a cohesive look that tells a story and showcases your products in the best possible light. It sounds like you're well on your way to creating a beautiful, inviting display that will draw customers in and make them want to linger. Good luck with your sale, and I hope you have a fantastic time at the Summer Kick-Off Market!",
