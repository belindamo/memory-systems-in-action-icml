It depends on your budget and the overall presentation you want to make. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros of a gift box or case:**\n\n* Adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to the gift\n* Helps keep the pens organized and protected\n* Can be reused for storing other small items\n\n**Cons of a gift box or case:**\n\n* Adds to the overall cost of the gift\n* Might make the gift feel more expensive than you intended\n* Could be seen as unnecessary or extravagant\n\nIf you do decide to get a gift box or case, look for something simple and understated. A small, velvet-lined box or a compact pen case with a magnetic closure would be a nice addition. You can find these types of accessories at office supply stores or online.\n\nIf you're on a tighter budget, you could consider a simple gift wrap or a small gift bag instead. This will still add a touch of thoughtfulness to the gift without breaking the bank.\n\nUltimately, the pens themselves are the main gift, and Rachel will likely appreciate the thought and effort you put into selecting a nice set. The gift box or case is just a nice bonus.",
