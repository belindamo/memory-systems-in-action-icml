  "content": "I'm looking to learn more about mindfulness and meditation. I've been practicing meditation consistently for 2 months now, and I've noticed it's helped me become more present in my daily life. I had a profound conversation with my grandma about her near-death experience a few weeks ago, and it's made me think a lot about the fragility of life and my own beliefs about the afterlife. Do you have any resources or tips on how to deepen my meditation practice and explore these existential questions?",
