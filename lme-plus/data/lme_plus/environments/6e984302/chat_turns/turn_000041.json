Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide specific recommendations for shops or mechanics in your area.\n\nHowever, I can offer some suggestions to help you find a reliable mechanic or shop:\n\n1. **Ask around**: Ask friends, family, coworkers, or neighbors who have similar vehicles for recommendations. They can provide valuable insights and referrals.\n2. **Online reviews**: Check online review platforms like Yelp, Google Reviews, or Facebook Reviews to find highly-rated mechanics or shops in your area. Pay attention to the overall rating and read the reviews to get a sense of their reputation.\n3. **Check certifications**: Look for mechanics or shops that are certified by organizations like the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) or the Automotive Service Association (ASA). These certifications indicate that the mechanic or shop has met certain standards for training and expertise.\n4. **Check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB)**: The BBB can provide information on complaints filed against a business and how they were resolved.\n5. **Check with your local consumer protection agency**: Your state or local government may have a consumer protection agency that can provide information on complaints filed against a business.\n\nWhen researching mechanics or shops, make sure to ask questions like:\n\n* What experience do they have with your make and model of vehicle?\n* What kind of warranty or guarantee do they offer on their work?\n* Can they provide a detailed estimate and explanation of the repairs?\n* Do they have any certifications or specialized training in fuel injector repairs?\n\nBy doing your research and asking the right questions, you can find a reliable mechanic or shop to provide a second opinion and help you get your truck back on the road.",
