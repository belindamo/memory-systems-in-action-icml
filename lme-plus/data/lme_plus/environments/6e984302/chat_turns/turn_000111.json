  "content": "Korean chili flakes, also known as **gochugaru**, and regular chili powder are both spicy seasonings, but they have distinct differences in terms of flavor, heat level, and texture.\n\n**Korean Chili Flakes (Gochugaru):**\n\n1. **Flavor:** Gochugaru has a more complex, slightly sweet, and smoky flavor profile compared to regular chili powder.\n2. **Heat level:** Gochugaru is generally hotter than regular chili powder, with a Scoville heat unit (SHU) rating of 10,000-20,000. This is because gochugaru is made from a specific type of Korean chili pepper called **gochugaru pepper**.\n3. **Texture:** Gochugaru is typically coarser and more granular than regular chili powder, which can be finer and more powdery.\n4. **Production:** Gochugaru is usually made by drying and crushing gochugaru peppers, whereas regular chili powder is often a blend of various chili peppers and spices.\n\n**Regular Chili Powder:**\n\n1. **Flavor:** Regular chili powder has a more generic, fiery flavor profile that's often associated with Mexican or Southwestern cuisine.\n2. **Heat level:** The heat level of regular chili powder can vary depending on the type and brand, but it's generally milder than gochugaru, with an SHU rating of 1,000-5,000.\n3. **Texture:** Regular chili powder is often finer and more powdery than gochugaru.\n4. **Production:** Regular chili powder is typically a blend of various chili peppers, spices, and sometimes other ingredients like garlic, cumin, or oregano.\n\n**When to use each:**\n\n* Use gochugaru for authentic Korean dishes like kimchi, bibimbap, or bulgogi, where you want a bold, spicy flavor.\n* Use regular chili powder for Mexican, Southwestern, or other dishes where a milder, more generic heat is desired.\n\nIn summary, while both gochugaru and regular chili powder add heat and flavor to dishes, gochugaru is a more potent, complex, and traditional Korean spice with a distinct flavor profile. If you're looking to make authentic Korean dishes or want a bolder, spicier flavor, gochugaru is the better choice.\n\nDo you have any other questions about Korean chili flakes or chili powder?",
