It's amazing how easily things can get lost or forgotten when they're not organized, isn't it?\n\nIt's great that you're motivated to tackle those half-finished projects, including the quilt for your mom. Finishing that quilt can be a great way to get a sense of accomplishment and momentum going. Plus, I'm sure your mom will appreciate the finished quilt whenever you finally get it to her!\n\nWhen you're organizing your fabric scraps, you might consider sorting them by color, type (e.g., cotton, fleece, felt), or project type (e.g., quilting, sewing, appliqu\u00e9). This can make it easier to find the perfect fabric for your current project or inspire new ideas.\n\nRemember, organizing your craft room is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Start with the areas or categories that bother you the most, and work your way through them. You got this!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your organizing and crafting adventures!",
