Here are some practices and exercises to support your exploration:\n\n**Meditation Practices:**\n\n1. **Impermanence Meditation**: Sit in stillness, focus on your breath, and reflect on the impermanence of your own life. Imagine yourself at different stages of life, from birth to old age, and acknowledge the impermanence of each stage. Gradually expand your awareness to include the impermanence of all phenomena, including relationships, possessions, and the world around you.\n2. **Body Scan with Impermanence**: Lie down or sit comfortably, and bring your attention to different parts of your body. Reflect on the impermanence of each body part, acknowledging that they are subject to change, decay, and eventual dissolution. This practice can help you cultivate a sense of detachment and appreciation for the present moment.\n3. **Loving-Kindness with Impermanence**: Focus on sending loving-kindness to yourself and others, while acknowledging the impermanence of all beings. Repeat phrases like \"May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be at peace, and may I be aware of the impermanence of all things.\"\n\n**Contemplation Exercises:**\n\n1. **Reflection on the Five Reminders**: Contemplate the Five Reminders, also known as the Five Reflections, which are:\n\t* I am subject to old age.\n\t* I am subject to illness.\n\t* I am subject to death.\n\t* I will be separated from all that is dear to me.\n\t* I am the owner of my actions, and I will inherit the consequences of my actions.\n2. **Impermanence in Daily Activities**: Engage in daily activities like eating, walking, or showering while reflecting on the impermanence of each experience. For example, acknowledge that the food you eat will eventually be digested and eliminated, or that the water you use will eventually flow away.\n3. **Gratitude and Impermanence**: Reflect on the things you're grateful for, such as your relationships, health, or possessions. Then, acknowledge the impermanence of each thing, recognizing that they can change or be taken away at any moment. This practice can help you cultivate a sense of appreciation and detachment.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Incorporate Impermanence into Your Daily Routine**: Set aside time each day to reflect on impermanence, even if it's just for a few minutes. This can help you integrate the concept into your daily life.\n2. **Use Reminders**: Place reminders throughout your day, such as sticky notes or phone notifications, to reflect on impermanence and cultivate mindfulness.\n3. **Discuss with Your Grandma**: Share your reflections and insights with your grandma, and ask her to share her own perspectives on impermanence and her near-death experience. This can help you deepen your understanding and connection with her.\n\nRemember, the key to integrating impermanence into your daily life is to approach it with an open and non-judgmental mind. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you explore this profound concept.",
