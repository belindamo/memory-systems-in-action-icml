  "content": "Sure, here are some things you should focus on for the skills test:\n\n1. Pre-trip inspection: The pre-trip inspection is a critical part of the test, as you'll have to identify any potential safety hazards or mechanical defects on the vehicle. Make sure you're familiar with the vehicle and can identify any faults that you're expected to correct. 2. Basic control skills: The basic control skills test may involve performing maneuvers such as straight-line backing, offset backing, and parallel parking. Practice these maneuvers until you can perform them confidently and accurately. 3. On-road driving: The on-road driving test will assess your ability to safely drive a commercial vehicle in different driving conditions such as highways, rural roads, and urban areas. Make sure you know the basics of driving such as using mirrors, signaling, lane control, and safe braking. 4. Communication with the examiner: During the skills test, you'll be expected to communicate effectively with the examiner. This includes actively listening to instructions, asking any clarifying questions, and providing feedback on any issues that arise. 5. Maintain calmness: Finally, try to stay calm and focused during the skills test. Nervousness can cause you to make mistakes or forget important information. Practice visualization or deep breathing techniques that can help you remain calm and composed during the test.",
