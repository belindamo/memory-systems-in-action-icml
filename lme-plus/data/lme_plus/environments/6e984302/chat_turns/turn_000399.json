  "content": "Adding sesame seeds during the mixing phase will distribute them evenly throughout the dough, and using an egg wash will help them stick to the bread nicely.\n\nFor baking, the temperature and time will depend on the size and shape of your bread, as well as your personal preference for crust color and crispiness. Here are some general guidelines for baking a Classic Sourdough with sesame seeds:\n\n**Temperature:**\n\n* Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) with a baking stone or baking steel inside, if you have one. If not, a regular oven will work just fine.\n\n**Baking time:**\n\n* For a smaller loaf (around 1-2 pounds), bake for 25-30 minutes.\n* For a medium-sized loaf (around 2-3 pounds), bake for 35-40 minutes.\n* For a larger loaf (around 3-4 pounds), bake for 45-50 minutes.\n\n**Internal temperature:**\n\n* Use a thermometer to check the internal temperature of the bread. It should reach 205\u00b0F (96\u00b0C) to 210\u00b0F (99\u00b0C) for a fully baked loaf.\n\n**Visual cues:**\n\n* The bread should be golden brown, with a crispy crust and a nice sheen.\n* The sesame seeds should be toasted and fragrant.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a steamy oven to create a crispy crust. You can achieve this by placing a pan of water in the oven or using a steam injector.\n* Rotate the bread halfway through the baking time to ensure even browning.\n* Keep an eye on the bread during the last 10-15 minutes of baking, as it can quickly go from perfectly baked to burnt.\n\nRemember, every oven is different, so it's essential to monitor your bread's progress and adjust the baking time and temperature as needed. Happy baking!",
