Here are some ways companies can address this issue and ensure that their remote workers are feeling connected:\n\n1. Foster Virtual Team Cohesion: Companies can foster virtual team cohesion by providing opportunities for remote workers to connect with each other and their in-office colleagues. For example, virtual team-building activities, virtual happy hours, and peer-to-peer recognition programs can help to build a sense of community.\n\n2. Encourage Video Conferencing: Video conferencing technology can help remote workers feel more connected, and the face-to-face interaction can help to build trust and rapport among team members.\n\n3. Provide Opportunities for Professional Development: Companies can provide opportunities for remote workers to develop professionally by offering online training, leadership coaching, and learning and development programs.\n\n4. Be Sensitive to Time Zones: Remote workers are often working across different time zones, so companies should be sensitive to this and adjust work schedules as necessary to ensure all team members have an opportunity to connect.\n\n5. Emphasize Communication: Communication is crucial for remote workers, and companies should emphasize communication protocols and standards to ensure that everyone is on the same page and connected.\n\n6. Encourage Employee Feedback: Companies should encourage remote workers to provide feedback on their experience, including ways to improve connectivity and collaboration.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, companies can ensure that their remote workers are connected, have a sense of community, and are engaged in their work.",
