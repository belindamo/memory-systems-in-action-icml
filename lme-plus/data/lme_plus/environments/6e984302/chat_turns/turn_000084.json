  "content": "Yeah, the yarn stash sale has been going well. I used a combination of online marketplaces and social media to sell some of my rare and exotic yarns. I was surprised by how much money I made from selling some of those yarns. I'm thinking of using that money to buy some new craft books and patterns, including a book on macrame that I've been wanting to try out. Speaking of patterns, do you have any recommendations for macrame books or online resources?",
