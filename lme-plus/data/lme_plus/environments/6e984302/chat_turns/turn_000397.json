Here are some tips on how to incorporate sesame seeds into your Classic Sourdough recipe and get them to stick to the bread:\n\n**Incorporating sesame seeds into the dough:**\n\n1. **Add sesame seeds during the mixing phase**: Mix the sesame seeds into the dough during the initial mixing phase, when you're combining the flour, water, salt, and starter. This will distribute the seeds evenly throughout the dough.\n2. **Use a smaller amount**: Start with a smaller amount of sesame seeds, about 1-2 tablespoons, and adjust to taste. You can always add more seeds, but it's harder to remove excess seeds from the dough.\n3. **Choose the right type of sesame seeds**: Use unhulled sesame seeds for a nuttier flavor and a slightly crunchier texture. Hulled sesame seeds will provide a milder flavor and a softer texture.\n\n**Getting sesame seeds to stick to the bread:**\n\n1. **Use an egg wash**: Brush the top of the bread with an egg wash (beaten egg mixed with a little water) before adding the sesame seeds. This will help the seeds stick to the bread.\n2. **Use a water-based gel or glaze**: Mix a small amount of water with a little flour or cornstarch to create a gel-like consistency. Brush this mixture onto the bread before adding the sesame seeds. This will help the seeds stick and create a nice, even coating.\n3. **Add sesame seeds during the proofing phase**: Sprinkle the sesame seeds onto the bread during the proofing phase, when the dough is already shaped and rising. This will allow the seeds to stick to the bread as it rises.\n4. **Use a gentle hand**: When adding sesame seeds to the bread, use a gentle hand to avoid pressing them too deeply into the dough. You want the seeds to stick to the surface, not sink into the bread.\n5. **Bake with steam**: Baking with steam will help create a crispy crust and make the sesame seeds stick to the bread better. You can create steam by placing a pan of water in the oven or using a steam injector.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to incorporate sesame seeds into your Classic Sourdough recipe and get them to stick beautifully to the bread. Happy baking!",
