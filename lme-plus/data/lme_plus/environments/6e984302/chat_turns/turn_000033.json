Sorry to hear you're experiencing problems again, but it's great that you've already replaced the oxygen sensor recently.\n\nTo help me better understand what's going on, can you please provide more details about the issues you're experiencing? For example:\n\n1. What symptoms are you noticing? (e.g., reduced power, stalling, rough idling, strange noises, warning lights on the dashboard, etc.)\n2. When did the problems start? Was it sudden or did they develop over time?\n3. Are the issues consistent or intermittent?\n4. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make the problem worse or better? (e.g., cold starts, acceleration, braking, etc.)\n5. Have you checked the dashboard warning lights or the OBD-II trouble codes recently?\n\nThe more information you can provide, the better I'll be able to help you narrow down the possible causes and potentially identify the root of the problem.",
