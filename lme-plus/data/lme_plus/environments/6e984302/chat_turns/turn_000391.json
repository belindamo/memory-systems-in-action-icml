Here are some tips to help you store your sourdough starter:\n\n**Short-term storage (up to 1 week):**\n\n1. **Room temperature**: Store the starter in a clean glass or ceramic container with a wide mouth, covered with a cloth or plastic wrap, at room temperature (around 75\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F or 24\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C).\n2. **Feed it regularly**: Feed your starter once a day with flour and water to keep it active and healthy.\n\n**Long-term storage (1 week to several months):**\n\n1. **Refrigerate it**: Place the starter in an airtight container, such as a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid, and store it in the refrigerator at a consistent temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C).\n2. **Slow down the fermentation**: Before refrigerating, feed your starter with a smaller amount of flour and water to slow down the fermentation process. This will help reduce the starter's activity and prevent over-fermentation.\n3. **Check on it every 7-10 days**: Take the starter out of the fridge, feed it, and let it rest at room temperature for a few hours before returning it to the fridge. This will help maintain its health and prevent it from becoming too dormant.\n\n**Freezing (for longer-term storage):**\n\n1. **Prepare the starter**: Before freezing, feed your starter with a small amount of flour and water, and let it rest at room temperature for a few hours. This will help the starter become more active and resilient to freezing.\n2. **Transfer to an airtight container**: Place the starter in an airtight container or freezer bag, making sure to remove as much air as possible before sealing.\n3. **Label and date**: Label the container with the date and contents, and store it in the freezer at 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or below.\n4. **Thaw and revive**: When you're ready to use your starter again, thaw it in the refrigerator or at room temperature, and feed it once it's thawed and active.\n\n**Tips and considerations:**\n\n* Always use a clean and sanitized container and utensils when handling your sourdough starter.\n* Keep your starter away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and strong-smelling foods, as these can affect its health and flavor.\n* If you plan to store your starter for an extended period, it's a good idea to create a backup starter in case the original one becomes contaminated or dies.\n* Before using a stored starter, always feed it and observe its activity to ensure it's healthy and active.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to maintain a healthy, thriving sourdough starter that will provide you with delicious bread and baked goods for months to come!",
