  "content": "Thank you for providing more context.\n\nIf the dealer has already ruled out the oxygen sensor and is pointing to a fuel injector issue, that's a good starting point. Fuel injector problems can be a bit more complex, but I'll try to break it down for you.\n\n**Possible causes of fuel injector issues:**\n\n1. **Clogged fuel injectors**: Fuel injectors can become clogged over time due to fuel contaminants, debris, or worn-out fuel filters. This can restrict fuel flow, causing poor engine performance and triggering the check engine light.\n2. **Faulty fuel injector**: A faulty fuel injector might not be spraying fuel properly, leading to engine misfires, poor performance, and decreased fuel efficiency.\n3. **Fuel injector electrical issues**: Problems with the fuel injector's electrical circuit, such as a faulty wiring harness or corroded connections, can prevent the injector from functioning correctly.\n4. **Fuel pressure issues**: Low fuel pressure can cause fuel injectors to malfunction, leading to poor engine performance and decreased power.\n\n**How long it might take to fix:**\n\nThe repair time will depend on the specific issue and the dealer's workload. However, here are some general estimates:\n\n1. **Clogged fuel injectors**: Cleaning or replacing fuel injectors can take a few hours to a day, depending on the complexity of the job.\n2. **Faulty fuel injector**: Replacing a single fuel injector can take around 1-2 hours, while replacing multiple injectors might take longer.\n3. **Fuel injector electrical issues**: Diagnosing and repairing electrical issues can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more, depending on the complexity of the problem.\n4. **Fuel pressure issues**: Diagnosing and repairing fuel pressure issues can take longer, potentially up to several days, as it may involve replacing fuel pumps, fuel filters, or other components.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual repair time may vary depending on your truck's make, model, and the dealer's workload.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n1. Ask the dealer to provide more details about the specific issue they've found and the recommended repair.\n2. Inquire about the estimated repair time and cost.\n3. Consider asking if they can provide a loaner vehicle or rental car while your truck is being repaired.\n\nI hope this helps you better understand the situation. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!",
