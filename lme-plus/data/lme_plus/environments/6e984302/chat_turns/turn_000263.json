You can block specific social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, or block entire categories like \"Social Media\" or \"Entertainment\".\n3. **Customizable block lists**: You can create custom block lists to fit your needs. For example, you can create a list of distracting websites, apps, or entire categories to block during your peak productivity hours.\n4. **Scheduling blocks**: You can schedule blocks in advance to coincide with your peak productivity hours, meetings, or focus times. Freedom offers a flexible scheduling system that allows you to set custom block times, including recurring blocks.\n5. **Blocking modes**: Freedom offers different blocking modes, including:\n\t* **Block**: Completely blocks access to the specified apps, websites, or categories.\n\t* **Lockdown**: Blocks access to all distracting apps, websites, and categories, except for those you've whitelisted.\n\t* **Focus**: Blocks access to all distracting apps, websites, and categories, but allows access to specific whitelisted apps and websites.\n6. **Blocking technology**: Freedom uses a combination of technologies to block access to distracting apps and websites, including:\n\t* DNS blocking: Freedom modifies your device's DNS settings to block access to distracting websites.\n\t* App blocking: Freedom blocks access to distracting apps on your device.\n\t* Browser extensions: Freedom offers browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to block access to distracting websites.\n\n**How Freedom blocks social media apps on your devices:**\n\n1. **Computer**: Freedom installs a small application on your computer that blocks access to distracting apps and websites.\n2. **Mobile devices**: Freedom offers mobile apps for iOS and Android that block access to distracting apps and websites on your mobile devices.\n3. **Browser extensions**: Freedom's browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari block access to distracting websites on your computer.\n\nWhen you set a block in Freedom, it will block access to the specified apps, websites, or categories across all your devices.
