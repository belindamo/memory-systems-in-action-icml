  "content": "Yes, there are some limitations to using acoustic detections in maritime surveillance. One major limitation is the effect of environmental factors on sound propagation underwater. The speed and direction of sound can be affected by variables such as temperature, salinity, and depth of water, which can cause sound signals to become distorted or attenuated.\n\nAnother limitation is the presence of background noise, which can make it difficult to differentiate between the sound signatures of different vessels. Underwater ambient noise can come from natural sources such as wind, waves, and marine life, as well as from human-made sources such as shipping traffic and oil drilling activities.\n\nFurthermore, using acoustic detections alone may not provide a comprehensive picture of maritime activity in a given area. Other surveillance methods, such as radar and satellite imaging, may be needed to supplement acoustic detections and provide a more complete understanding of maritime traffic and potential threats.\n\nOverall, while acoustic detections are a powerful tool for maritime surveillance, they must be used in conjunction with other advanced technologies and careful analysis to ensure accurate and reliable results.",
