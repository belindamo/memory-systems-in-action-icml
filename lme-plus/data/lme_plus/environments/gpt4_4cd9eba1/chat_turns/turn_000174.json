That's definitely an advantage of traveling solo! On the other hand, your family trip to Hawaii was likely more focused on spending quality time with your loved ones and creating shared memories.\n\nFor your Europe trip, you might consider a mix of both styles. You could plan some solo days to explore on your own, and then meet up with friends or family for other activities. Alternatively, you could plan a group trip with like-minded travelers or join a guided tour.\n\nWhich of these options appeals to you, or do you have other ideas in mind?",
