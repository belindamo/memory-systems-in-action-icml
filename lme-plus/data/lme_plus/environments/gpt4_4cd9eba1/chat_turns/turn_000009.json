I'm happy to help you improve your skills.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're taking feedback from the organizers at the Drift Jam event seriously and looking to improve. That's the right attitude to have when developing your skills.\n\nThrottle control and braking points are crucial aspects of drifting, and mastering them will take time and practice. Here are some tips that might help you improve:\n\n**Throttle Control:**\n\n1. **Smooth inputs:** Focus on making smooth, gradual throttle inputs. Avoid sudden, abrupt acceleration, as this can upset the car's balance and make it difficult to control.\n2. **Feeling the grip:** Pay attention to how the car's tires are gripping the surface. As you accelerate, feel for the point where the tires start to lose grip and the rear begins to swing out. This is when you need to adjust your throttle input to maintain control.\n3. **Throttle modulation:** Practice modulating your throttle input to control the angle of your drift. This means feathering the throttle to maintain a consistent speed and angle of drift.\n4. **Use the correct gear:** Make sure you're in the correct gear for the speed and angle of your drift. This will help you maintain control and avoid wheelspin or bogging down.\n\n**Braking Points:**\n\n1. **Look where you want to go:** Focus on the direction you want to drift, and look at the point where you want to initiate the drift. This will help you judge your braking points and entry speed.\n2. **Brake before the turn:** Brake before you enter the turn to slow down and transfer weight to the front tires. This will help you initiate the drift more smoothly.\n3. **Gradual braking:** Use gentle, gradual braking to slow down, rather than slamming on the brakes. This will help you maintain control and avoid upsetting the car's balance.\n4. **Feel the weight transfer:** Pay attention to how the car's weight shifts during braking and acceleration. This will help you adjust your braking points and throttle input.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Practice, practice, practice:** The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with your car's behavior and the better you'll develop your skills.\n2. **Start slow:** Don't try to drift at high speeds until you're comfortable with the basics. Start with lower speeds and gradually increase as you build confidence.\n3. **Focus on your inputs:** Concentrate on your throttle, brake, and steering inputs, and try to make smooth, deliberate movements.\n4. **Watch and learn from others:** Observe other drifters, either in person or through videos, and pay attention to their techniques. You can learn a lot from others and incorporate their strategies into your own driving.\n\nRemember, improving your drifting skills takes time, patience, and practice. Don't get discouraged if you don't see improvement right away. Keep working at it, and you'll eventually see progress.\n\nI hope these tips help you improve your drifting skills!
