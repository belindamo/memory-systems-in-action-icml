  "content": "Diced jalape\u00f1os can add a nice spicy kick to your frittatas. The number of jalape\u00f1os to use depends on your personal tolerance for heat and the desired level of spiciness. Here's a general guideline:\n\n**For 6 eggs, you can use:**\n\n* 1-2 diced jalape\u00f1os for a mild to moderate heat level (about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of heat)\n* 2-3 diced jalape\u00f1os for a medium to hot heat level (about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon of heat)\n* 4 or more diced jalape\u00f1os for an extremely hot heat level (about 1 teaspoon or more of heat)\n\nRemember, the heat level of jalape\u00f1os can vary depending on factors like the pepper's ripeness, preparation, and individual tolerance. If you're new to using jalape\u00f1os or prefer a milder flavor, start with 1 diced jalape\u00f1o and adjust to taste.\n\n**Tips for working with jalape\u00f1os:**\n\n* Use gloves when handling jalape\u00f1os to avoid irritating your skin and eyes.\n* Remove the seeds and membranes from the jalape\u00f1os, as they contain most of the heat. This will help distribute the heat more evenly throughout the frittata.\n* Chop the jalape\u00f1os finely to ensure they're evenly distributed throughout the egg mixture.\n* If you're concerned about the heat level, you can always add more jalape\u00f1os, but it's harder to remove the heat once it's added.\n\nNow, go ahead and add those jalape\u00f1os to your frittatas!",
