  "content": "Both Japan and South Korea have different power outlets and voltage requirements, so it's essential to bring the right adapters and converters to keep your devices charged and powered up.\n\n**Japan:**\n\n* **Power outlets:** Type A (same as the US)\n* **Voltage:** 100V, 50Hz\n* **Frequency:** 50Hz\n\nYou won't need a voltage converter for Japan, but you might need a physical adapter to fit your device's plug into the Japanese outlet.\n\n**South Korea:**\n\n* **Power outlets:** Type C, D, E, F, G, H (similar to those in Europe)\n* **Voltage:** 220V, 60Hz\n* **Frequency:** 60Hz\n\nYou'll need a travel adapter that can accommodate South Korea's different outlet types. Additionally, if your device isn't compatible with 220V, you might need a voltage converter.\n\n**Adapter and converter recommendations:**\n\n1. **Universal travel adapter:** Invest in a high-quality, universal travel adapter that can fit multiple outlet types, including those in Japan and South Korea. Look for one with surge protection and built-in USB ports for charging multiple devices at once.\n2. **Voltage converter:** If your device isn't compatible with 220V, consider bringing a voltage converter. There are different types of converters, so make sure to choose one that suits your device's power requirements.\n3. **Power bank:** A portable power bank can be a lifesaver during long flights or when you don't have access to a power outlet. Look for one with a high capacity (mAh) rating and multiple USB ports.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Check your device's compatibility:** Before buying an adapter or converter, check your device's documentation to ensure it can handle the voltage and frequency requirements of Japan and South Korea.\n2. **Pack spare cables and adapters:** Bring spare cables and adapters in case you lose or damage them during your trip.\n3. **Consider a travel-friendly power strip:** If you have multiple devices to charge at once, consider bringing a travel-friendly power strip that can accommodate multiple plugs and has built-in surge protection.\n\nBy bringing the right adapters and converters, you'll be able to keep your devices charged and powered up throughout your trip to Tokyo and Seoul. Happy travels!",
