  "content": "**Accommodations:**\nThe workshop fee does not include accommodations, so you'll need to arrange your own lodging in Asheville, North Carolina. However, Tony Sweet, the workshop leader, has negotiated a special rate with a local hotel, which is conveniently located near the workshop meeting points.\n\nThe recommended hotel is the **Hotel Indigo Asheville**, which offers a discounted rate of $129 per night (plus tax) for workshop participants. This rate includes a comfortable room, free Wi-Fi, and a hot breakfast buffet. To book your room, simply call the hotel directly and mention the \"Tony Sweet Photography Workshop\" to receive the discounted rate.\n\n**Meals:**\nMeals are not included in the workshop fee, but there are plenty of dining options in Asheville, known for its vibrant food scene. You can explore the local restaurants, cafes, and breweries, or grab something quick and easy at a nearby market.\n\nHowever, Tony has planned a few group meals and social events during the workshop, which are optional but highly encouraged. These events provide a great opportunity to connect with fellow participants, ask questions, and share your experiences. The cost of these meals is not included in the workshop fee, but they're usually around $20-$30 per person.\n\n**Other Logistics:**\n\n* Transportation: You'll need a car to get around Asheville and to the workshop locations. If you're flying in, you can rent a car at the Asheville Regional Airport.\n* Parking: Parking is available at the hotel and at the workshop meeting points.\n* Physical Demands: The workshop will involve some moderate hiking and walking, so be prepared with comfortable shoes and clothing.\n\nBy arranging your own accommodations and meals, you have the flexibility to choose options that fit your budget and preferences. If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
