However, I can offer some general information on possible measures that might have been taken:\n\n1. The Scottish government has set up a Coronavirus Business Support Fund, which provides financial help to small and medium-sized businesses affected by COVID-19. The fund includes two grant schemes: the Small Business Grant Fund and the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund.\n\n2. The Perth and Kinross Council may have also implemented their own grants or loans to support local businesses during the pandemic. \n\n3. The Council may have also provided Business Rates Relief for eligible businesses.\n\n4. Additionally, some measures to support businesses may have been focused on sectors that are particularly hard-hit by the pandemic such as tourism, hospitality, and retail.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific measures taken by local authorities can differ depending on the available resources, local regulations, and the extent of the pandemic's economic impact on the region.",
