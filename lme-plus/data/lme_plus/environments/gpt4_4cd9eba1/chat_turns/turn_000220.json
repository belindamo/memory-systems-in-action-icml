  "content": "Perth and Kinross Council has implemented a number of measures to support business tenants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the provision of rent relief. The Council has a Business Rental Relief fund that aims to be flexible and responsive to assist businesses by helping with rent and bills.\n\nThe Business Rental Relief fund aims to provide support to all types of businesses in financial difficulties due to the pandemic. The Council may consider providing rent reductions or deferrals to eligible small and medium-sized businesses. The scheme is expected to be available to businesses that do not qualify for other Scottish Government funding initiatives.\n\nIt is worth noting that the details of such schemes can change over time, and that different local authorities may have different programs designed to support small and medium-sized businesses affected by the pandemic. Therefore, it is advisable to contact the relevant local authority or professional advisor for the latest information.",
