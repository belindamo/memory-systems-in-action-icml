It's important for artists to strike a balance between experimentation and maintaining the authenticity and emotional impact of their music.\n\nUsing unconventional techniques solely for shock value or to stand out from the crowd can easily come off as gimmicky and insincere. However, when these techniques are used to enhance the emotional or musical impact of the music in a genuine way, they can elevate the overall product and make it truly unique and memorable.\n\nUltimately, the use of unconventional techniques should come from an authentic place of creativity and should serve as a way to push the boundaries of what is possible within the context of the music. It's up to the artist to determine where that line is and whether or not to cross it.",
