  "content": "A ratchet is a mechanism in an investment deal that provides the investor with a certain minimum return or \"floor\" for their investment. In other words, it is a type of performance-based structure that protects the investor's downside by guaranteeing a minimum return if certain performance targets are not met. This mechanism is usually applied in the context of private equity or venture capital investments and is used to incentivize the management team to drive growth and achieve certain performance goals. The strengths of a ratchet structure include providing a certain level of certainty for the investor, while the weaknesses include potentially inhibiting the management team's ability to take calculated risks and potentially driving an undue focus on achieving specific metrics rather than overall business success.",
