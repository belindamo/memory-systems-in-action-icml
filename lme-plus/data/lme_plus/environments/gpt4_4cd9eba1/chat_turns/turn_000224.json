  "content": "Perth and Kinross Council, in addition to the Scottish government, have implemented a range of financial assistance programs to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. While programs can change over time, examples of recent programs would include:\n\n1. The Business Restart Grant: In partnership with the Scottish Government, Perth and Kinross Council has created the Business Restart Grant program to support eligible businesses in reopening safely following the pandemic. The grant is designed to aid businesses with the costs of reopening and adapting their operations to comply with COVID-19 regulations.\n\n2. Local Discretionary Fund: Perth and Kinross Council has created a Local Discretionary Fund (LDF) aimed at helping businesses that have been impacted by the pandemic but may not have qualified for other government support. The program aims to offer financial aid to businesses that are not eligible for other support schemes or have high ongoing fixed property costs, and must be claimed before the deadline provided.\n\n3. Community Response Fund: To support communities that have been severely impacted by the pandemic, Perth and Kinross Council has initiated the Community Response Fund. The program provides small grants to community groups and non-profit organizations, enabling them to carry out their essential work in the local community.\n\n4. Council Tax Relief: The Council has provided council tax relief for residential and commercial properties for specified periods.\n\nIt is important to note that while the government provides overarching support for businesses, local authorities can offer specific bespoke services relative to the area's context that aim to provide additional support for businesses that may not meet the requirements of the Government programs. The specific measures and eligibility criteria for these programs may change over time, so it's advisable to contact the relevant authority to access the latest information.",
