The toasted coconut flakes and chopped macadamia nuts will add a wonderful tropical flavor and texture to the fruit salad.\n\nFor a light and refreshing dressing, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n**Simple Syrups and Dressings**\n\n1. **Lime-Honey Syrup**: Mix together 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lime juice, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 tablespoon of water. This syrup is a classic combination that pairs perfectly with tropical fruits.\n2. **Coconut Lime Dressing**: Combine 2 tablespoons of coconut cream, 1 tablespoon of freshly squeezed lime juice, and 1 tablespoon of honey. This dressing is creamy and refreshing, with a subtle coconut flavor.\n3. **Ginger-Lime Syrup**: Mix together 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lime juice, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 teaspoon of grated ginger. This syrup adds a nice spicy kick to the fruit salad.\n4. **Sparkling Lime Juice**: If you want something even simpler, you can just drizzle some sparkling lime juice over the fruit salad. This adds a nice fizz and a burst of citrus flavor.\n\n**Tips for Using the Syrup or Dressing**\n\n1. **Drizzle just before serving**: Drizzle the syrup or dressing over the fruit salad just before serving to preserve the freshness and texture of the fruit.\n2. **Use a light hand**: Start with a small amount of syrup or dressing and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess syrup or dressing.\n3. **Mix and match**: Feel free to experiment with different combinations of syrups and dressings to create your own unique flavor profile.\n\nThese syrups and dressings are all light and refreshing, and they'll complement the tropical flavors of the fruit salad without overpowering them.
