However, I can offer some general information on possible job fairs and training programs that may have been implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n1. Job fairs: Perth and Kinross authorities may have hosted job fairs to connect job seekers with local employers who are still hiring during the pandemic. The job fairs are likely to be based in areas where jobs are plentiful or where the employers have job vacancies open.\n\n2. Employment furlough and training programs: Perth and Kinross authorities may have partnered with local employers, trade associations, and training institutes to create employment furlough and training programs that help former employees in industries hit hardest by the pandemic re-skill and become employable in the sectors that are currently hiring.\n\n3. Digital literacy programs: Local authorities may have launched digital literacy training programs to help train people for new, technology-driven jobs and provide basic training for digital literacy.\n\n4. Youth employment programs: Certain Digital & youth employment initiatives that focus on apprenticeships, training, and other support for young people may also be available.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific measures taken by local authorities can differ depending on the available resources, local regulations, and the extent of the pandemic's economic and social impact on the region.",
