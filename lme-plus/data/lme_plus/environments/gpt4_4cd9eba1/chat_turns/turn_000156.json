  "content": "Yes, there is growing evidence that hands-on learning can improve students' performance on standardized tests, despite not always being applicable to standardized test formats. \n\nHands-on learning provides students with practical, real-world experience and a chance to apply the concepts they have learned in class. When students see the relevance of what they are learning, they are more likely to engage with the material and retain it long-term. \n\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the largest standardized test in the United States, has incorporated hands-on tasks in their math and science assessments since 2005. These tasks require students to demonstrate their understanding of math and science concepts through practical applications.\n\nResearch has shown that students who engage in hands-on learning tend to outperform their peers who are taught using traditional lecture-based methods on standardized tests. A study by the Smithsonian Science Education Center found that hands-on science instruction led to a 44% increase in student performance on science exams. Additionally, an analysis by the National Science Foundation found that students who engaged in more physical science activities were more likely to increase their scores on standardized tests.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating hands-on learning into the curriculum has the potential to improve students' performance on standardized tests. This is because hands-on learning encourages deeper engagement and understanding of concepts, which can help students better retain information and apply it to a variety of different contexts, including test-taking scenarios.",
