  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the latest information regarding how Perth and Kinross Council has specifically worked with local businesses to promote buy-local campaigns. However, I can provide some general examples of ways that local authorities in other regions have promoted such campaigns:\n\n1. Creating a Buy-Local Directory: Local authorities can create a directory of local businesses that residents can refer to when shopping for goods and services. The directory will make it easy for local customers to find and shop with local businesses.\n\n2. Social media campaigns: Local authorities can create social media campaigns with the help of local influencers and chamber of commerce to promote locally owned businesses. The authority will leverage their local connections to reach out to the community and encourage them to shop locally instead of looking to big brands.\n\n3. Coupons: Another potential strategy local authorities or advocacy groups can adopt to encourage local spending is distributing coupons, discount vouchers, or other promotional materials to help drive traffic and sales to locally owned businesses\n\n4. Festivals and Fairs: Local authorities may hold seasonal festivals, fairs, or markets that showcase the goods and services of local businesses. This theme runs along the same lines as farmers\u2019 markets and is helpful in promoting the local produce, local crafts, and what the community has to offer.\n\n5. Collaborations: The authorities can partner with local businesses, entrepreneurs, and trade associations to offer special deals, promotions, and loyalty programs for local customers.\n\nThe Council may have adopted some of these strategies, or other tailored programs tailored to beget shopping locally and support local businesses.",
