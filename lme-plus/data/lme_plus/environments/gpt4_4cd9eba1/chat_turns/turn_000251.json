  "content": "Yes, many other presidents have also had a passion for the outdoors. For example, Theodore Roosevelt was a well-known outdoorsman and conservationist who created the national park system and established 150 national forests, 51 federal bird reserves, 4 national game preserves, and 18 national monuments. Jimmy Carter was also an avid outdoorsman and fly fisherman who championed conservation measures and designated millions of acres of land for preservation. Bill Clinton was a runner and often went for jogs outdoors, and he created numerous national monuments during his presidency. George W. Bush was known for his love of fishing and ranching, and he signed several conservation bills. Barack Obama enjoyed hiking and basketball, and he designated several new national monuments and expanded protected areas during his presidency. These are just a few examples of presidents who showed a passion for the outdoors, and there are surely many others throughout American history.",
