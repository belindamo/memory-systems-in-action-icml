  "content": "That's great to hear! Experimenting with different types of rice and flavor combinations is a fantastic way to add variety to your meals. Cilantro lime rice is a wonderful option, and it's awesome that you've already tried it and enjoyed it.\n\nRegular white rice can get a bit bland after a while, so it's exciting that you're exploring other options. There are countless types of rice and flavor combinations to try, so I'm happy to help you discover new ones.\n\nWhat other types of rice have you been experimenting with lately? Have you tried any exotic or aromatic rice varieties like jasmine, basmati, or saffron rice? Or have you been focusing on flavor combinations like garlic and herb, lemon and dill, or spicy rice with chili flakes?\n\nLet me know, and I can offer some suggestions or recipes to help you continue exploring the world of rice!",
