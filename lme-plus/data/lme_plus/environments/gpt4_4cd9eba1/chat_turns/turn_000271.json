The Polynesian people were master tattooists, and their tattoos had deep meanings and symbolism.\n\nThe traditional tattooing process was a slow and painful ritual that was performed by skilled tattoo artists known as tufuga ta tatau. They used various tools and instruments such as shark teeth, bones, and needles to apply the ink onto the skin.\n\nThe tattoos were mostly applied to the men and women's body parts, such as the arms, legs, chest, back, and face. They were also used to depict the person's specific identity, including their social status, heritage, bravery, and achievements.\n\nThe Polynesian tattoos were made of black ink, and the designs were intricate and elaborate. The tattoos would take weeks or even months to complete, and during this time, the person would have to follow strict dietary and behavioral restrictions.\n\nThe traditional tattooing practices of the Polynesian people are still respected and recognized today, and their tattoos continue to inspire modern tattoo artists and enthusiasts worldwide.",
