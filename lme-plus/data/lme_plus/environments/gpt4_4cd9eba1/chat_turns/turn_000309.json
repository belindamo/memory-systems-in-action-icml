They can provide a nice texture contrast and add some extra nutrition to the dish. Here are some options that pair well with the Tropical Trio:\n\n**Nut and Seed Options**\n\n1. **Chopped Macadamia Nuts**: These nuts are native to Hawaii and pair perfectly with the tropical flavors of mango and pineapple.\n2. **Toasted Coconut Flakes**: Add a sprinkle of toasted coconut flakes to give the fruit salad a tropical and creamy flavor.\n3. **Chia Seeds**: These tiny seeds are packed with omega-3s and fiber, and they add a nice crunch to the salad.\n4. **Pecans or Walnuts**: If you want a more traditional nut flavor, pecans or walnuts can provide a nice contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.\n5. **Pumpkin Seeds**: These seeds have a nutty flavor and a nice crunch, and they're rich in magnesium and protein.\n\n**Tips for Adding Nuts or Seeds**\n\n1. **Chop the nuts or seeds**: Chop the nuts or seeds into small pieces so they're evenly distributed throughout the fruit salad.\n2. **Toast the nuts or seeds**: Toasting the nuts or seeds can bring out their flavor and texture. Simply spread them on a baking sheet and bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for 5-10 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned.\n3. **Add them just before serving**: Add the nuts or seeds to the fruit salad just before serving to preserve their texture and flavor.\n\nRemember, you can always adjust the amount of nuts or seeds to your taste. Start with a small amount and add more if you prefer a stronger crunch.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your mom will love the Tropical Trio fruit salad with a crunchy twist!",
