I was thinking of making your chocolate avocado mousse, since I've already mastered the recipe and it's always a hit. I was also thinking of making a vegan banana bread, since I've been perfecting the recipe lately and it's turned out really well. Do you have any other ideas for desserts that would complement these two well?",
