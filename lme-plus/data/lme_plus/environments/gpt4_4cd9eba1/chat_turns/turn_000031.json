Aim for whole foods: Look for snacks that are made from whole ingredients, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. 2. Look for protein and fiber: Snacks that are high in protein and fiber can help keep you feeling full and satisfied, and can also help regulate blood sugar levels. Examples include Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, hummus, and raw vegetables. 3. Avoid added sugars and artificial ingredients: When choosing snacks, avoid those that are high in added sugars and other artificial ingredients, as these can contribute to inflammation and a variety of health problems. 4. Plan ahead: To avoid reaching for less healthy snack options, plan out your snacks for the week ahead of time and shop for the ingredients you'll need. 5. Get creative: There are plenty of healthy snack options that are both tasty and satisfying. Some examples include roasted chickpeas, homemade trail mix, apple slices with peanut butter, and air-popped popcorn. Remember, the key is to focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods that are satisfying and will keep you energized throughout the day. With a little planning and creativity, you can find plenty of delicious and healthy snack options.",
