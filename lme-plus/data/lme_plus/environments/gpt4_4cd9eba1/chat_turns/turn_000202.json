  "content": "The best times to visit the Acropolis, for the most spectacular views and a pleasant experience, are early in the morning just after opening or late in the afternoon before closing, especially during the summer months. At these times, the sun is not as strong, and the temperatures are cooler, making the climb more comfortable. The morning hours also bring fewer tourists, which means fewer crowds and a more tranquil atmosphere. If you plan to visit during the summer months, it's recommended that you avoid the midday heat by scheduling your visit to the late afternoon or early morning. This will help you enjoy the panoramic view of Athens while avoiding the heat and crowds.",
