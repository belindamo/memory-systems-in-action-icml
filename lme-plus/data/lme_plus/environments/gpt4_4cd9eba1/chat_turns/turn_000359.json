  "content": "That's a great approach! Starting with 1 diced jalape\u00f1o will give your frittata a nice kick without overpowering the other flavors. You can always adjust the heat level to your taste in future batches, and it's better to start with a smaller amount and add more heat than to add too much and overwhelm the dish.\n\nRemember, the heat level of jalape\u00f1os can vary depending on factors like the pepper's ripeness, preparation, and individual tolerance, so it's always a good idea to taste as you go and adjust the seasoning to your liking.\n\nI'm glad I could help, and I hope your frittata turns out delicious and flavorful! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Happy cooking!",
