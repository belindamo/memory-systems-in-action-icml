  "content": "Yes, recording conversations or sounds on handheld recording devices or smartphones is actually a common technique used by many musicians in their creative process. Some artists use these recordings as samples or inspiration, while others incorporate them directly into their music.\n\nFor example, Kendrick Lamar's critically acclaimed album, \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" features several snippets of conversations and interviews with various people throughout the album, including a conversation with Tupac Shakur's voice. The conversations help to contextualize the themes explored in the album and give them a more personal touch.\n\nAnother example is Bon Iver's album \"22, A Million,\" that incorporates voice memo recordings and field recordings into the music. Justin Vernon, the lead singer and songwriter, recorded the sounds himself while travelling to various locations to gather inspiration for the album.\n\nIn summary, it's become quite common for artists to integrate recorded conversations or other sounds captured on their smartphones or other portable recording devices in the creative process.",
