Here are some key factors to consider when evaluating travel insurance options:\n\n1. **Coverage**: Review the policy's coverage for:\n\t* Trip cancellations (e.g., due to natural disasters, illness, or travel bans)\n\t* Trip interruptions (e.g., unexpected events that force you to cut your trip short)\n\t* Medical emergencies (e.g., hospital stays, doctor visits, and medical evacuations)\n\t* Baggage loss or damage\n\t* Travel delays\n\t* Adventure activities (if you plan to engage in sports like skiing, hiking, or diving)\n2. **Policy limits**: Check the maximum amount the insurer will pay for each type of claim. Ensure the limits are sufficient to cover your trip costs and potential medical expenses.\n3. **Deductible**: Find out how much you'll need to pay out-of-pocket before the insurance coverage kicks in.\n4. **Pre-existing conditions**: If you have a pre-existing medical condition, check if the policy covers it. Some policies may not cover pre-existing conditions or may require additional premiums.\n5. **Provider network**: Look for a provider with a strong network of medical facilities and assistance services in Japan, in case you need help while traveling.\n6. **24/7 customer support**: Ensure the insurer offers round-the-clock customer support, including phone, email, and online chat support.\n7. **Policy flexibility**: Check if the policy allows you to customize coverage options or add riders for specific activities (e.g., adventure sports).\n8. **Reviews and ratings**: Research the insurer's reputation by reading reviews from other customers, checking ratings from independent agencies like A.M. Best or Standard & Poor's, and reviewing their complaint resolution process.\n9. **Cost**: Compare prices from different providers to ensure you're getting the best value for your money.\n10. **Policy duration**: Make sure the policy covers your entire trip, including any extensions or changes to your travel plans.\n11. **Cancel-for-any-reason (CFAR) option**: Some policies offer CFAR, which allows you to cancel your trip for any reason, not just those listed in the policy.\n\nBased on your quote from Allianz Travel Insurance, you may want to ask the following questions:\n\n* What is the policy limit for trip cancellations and interruptions?\n* Are there any deductibles or copays for medical expenses?\n* Does the policy cover pre-existing conditions, and if so, under what circumstances?\n* What kind of 24/7 customer support is available?\n* Are there any exclusions or limitations for adventure activities or high-risk sports?\n\nBy carefully evaluating these factors, you can choose a travel insurance provider that meets your needs and provides adequate coverage for your trip to Tokyo.",
