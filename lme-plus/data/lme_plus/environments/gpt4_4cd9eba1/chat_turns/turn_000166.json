If you prefer a stronger lime flavor, add more juice.\n* For a more aromatic rice, add 1-2 tablespoons of grated ginger or 1 teaspoon of grated lime zest to the rice while it's cooking.\n* You can also add some toasted sesame oil or chopped toasted sesame seeds to the rice for added depth of flavor and texture.\n\nThis cilantro lime rice is a refreshing and flavorful side dish that will pair beautifully with the Korean-Style BBQ Beef Stir-Fry.
