Here are some spicy ingredients you can add to give your frittatas a boost:\n\n1. **Diced Jalape\u00f1os or Serrano Peppers**: These peppers pack a moderate level of heat. Use 1-2 diced peppers per 6-8 eggs, depending on your desired level of spiciness.\n2. **Hot Sauce**: Add a few dashes of hot sauce, such as Tabasco, Frank's RedHot, or Sriracha, to the egg mixture. Start with 1-2 teaspoons and adjust to taste.\n3. **Diced Green Chilies**: These mild to medium-hot chilies are commonly used in Southwestern cuisine. Add 1-2 diced chilies per 6-8 eggs.\n4. **Cayenne Pepper or Red Pepper Flakes**: Sprinkle a pinch (about 1/4 teaspoon) of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes into the egg mixture for an intense heat.\n5. **Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce**: These smoked jalape\u00f1os add a deep, smoky heat. Use 1-2 peppers, diced, per 6-8 eggs.\n6. **Ancho or Guajillo Chili Powder**: These mild to medium-hot chili powders can add depth and warmth to your frittatas. Use 1/2 to 1 teaspoon per 6-8 eggs.\n7. **Spicy Sausage**: Use spicy sausage, such as chorizo or andouille, in place of regular sausage for an added kick.\n8. **Harissa**: This North African chili paste adds a spicy, slightly smoky flavor. Use 1-2 teaspoons per 6-8 eggs.\n\nRemember, when working with spicy ingredients, it's better to start with a small amount and adjust to taste. You can always add more heat, but it's harder to remove it once it's added.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* If you're using a spicy ingredient for the first time, start with a small amount and taste as you go to ensure the heat level is to your liking.\n* Balance the heat with other flavors, like cheese, herbs, or veggies, to avoid overwhelming the dish.\n* If you're concerned about the heat level, you can always serve the frittatas with a dollop of sour cream, yogurt, or salsa to help cool them down.\n\nNow, go ahead and add some heat to your frittatas!",
