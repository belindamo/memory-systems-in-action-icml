  "content": "I've been trying out jasmine rice and basmati rice recently, and I really like the nutty flavor they add to my dishes. I've also been experimenting with flavored rice like garlic and herb, which is a nice change of pace from plain white rice. Since I've been trying to cook at home more frequently over the past two months, I've been looking for ways to mix things up and try new recipes. Do you have any suggestions for other flavored rice recipes or types of rice I should try?",
