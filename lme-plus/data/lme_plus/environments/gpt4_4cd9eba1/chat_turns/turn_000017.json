Here's why:\n\n1. **Understanding the tires' limits:** Before you start drifting, it's essential to understand the tires' grip and handling limits at high speeds. This will help you develop a sense of trust in the tires and the car, which is crucial for confident drifting.\n2. **Building a baseline:** By focusing on high-speed cornering, you'll establish a baseline for the tires' performance and get a sense of how they behave in different corners and conditions. This will help you identify areas for improvement and track your progress over time.\n3. **Developing car control:** High-speed cornering will help you develop your car control skills, which are essential for drifting. You'll learn how to adjust your speed, braking, and steering inputs to maintain control and stability.\n4. **Reducing risk:** By focusing on high-speed cornering first, you'll reduce the risk of losing control or spinning out when you start drifting. This will help you build confidence and reduce the risk of damaging your car or tires.\n\nOnce you have a good understanding of the tires' grip and handling, you can start practicing your drifting skills. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Start with slow, gradual drifts:** Begin with slow, gradual drifts and gradually increase your speed and angle as you become more comfortable.\n* **Focus on smooth inputs:** Smooth, gradual inputs will help you maintain control and stability while drifting.\n* **Use the correct gear:** Make sure you're in the correct gear for the speed and angle of your drift.\n* **Look where you want to go:** Keep your eyes focused on the direction you want to drift, and use your peripheral vision to monitor the car's position and speed.\n\nRemember to always prioritize safety, and make sure you're comfortable with the track and the car before pushing the limits. It's also a good idea to have a spotter or instructor with you to provide feedback and guidance.\n\nHave fun at the track, and I hope you get a better feel for your new tires and improve your drifting skills!",
