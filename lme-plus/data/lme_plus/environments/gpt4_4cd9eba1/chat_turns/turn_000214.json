However, I can provide you with some general measures that local authorities around the world have taken to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19, which might be similar to what the authorities in Perth and Kinross have taken:\n\n1. Providing financial assistance to small and medium-sized businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\n2. Offering tax relief or deferral to local businesses that are struggling.\n\n3. Creating local economic recovery plans to support the revival of the region's economy.\n\n4. Implementing measures to encourage local spending, like promoting buy-local campaigns.\n\n5. Developing partnerships with local stakeholders (such as business associations or labor unions) to enhance the efficacy of public policy interventions.\n\n6. Launching training and employment initiatives for people who have lost their jobs during the pandemic.\n\n7. Supporting the digitalization of businesses to help them adapt to the new normal.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the specific measures taken by local authorities can vary depending on local circumstances and resources.",
