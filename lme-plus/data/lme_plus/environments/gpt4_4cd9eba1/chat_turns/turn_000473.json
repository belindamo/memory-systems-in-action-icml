  "content": "The potential market for YardShare would depend on various factors, such as the target geography, the pricing strategy, and the marketing efforts. However, if we consider the global market for short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, which has experienced significant growth in recent years, it's clear that there is a large demand for alternative accommodations beyond traditional hotels. With YardShare's focus on providing private outdoor spaces in urban areas, it could potentially tap into a niche market that is currently underserved.\n\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend of people seeking outdoor spaces and private accommodations, which could further increase the demand for YardShare's services. According to a survey conducted by Airbnb, over half of their respondents (54%) preferred staying in a vacation rental because of the ability to socially distance. This trend could translate to increased demand for private outdoor spaces, which YardShare could capitalize on.\n\nOverall, the potential market for YardShare is significant and could attract a wide range of customers who are looking for unique and affordable outdoor experiences in urban areas.",
