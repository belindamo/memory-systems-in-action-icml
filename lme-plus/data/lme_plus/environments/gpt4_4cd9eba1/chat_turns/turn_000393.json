Your chocolate avocado mousse and vegan banana bread are both excellent choices. Here are some dessert ideas that would complement them well:\n\n1. **Fresh Fruit Salad**: A light and refreshing dessert that cuts the richness of the chocolate mousse and banana bread. You can use seasonal fruits like strawberries, blueberries, grapes, and pineapple, and add a splash of lemon juice and a bit of maple syrup for flavor.\n2. **Coconut Lime Macaroons**: These chewy cookies are a great contrast to the creamy mousse and dense banana bread. You can flavor them with coconut flakes, lime zest, and a hint of vanilla for a tropical twist.\n3. **Roasted Fruit Crisp**: A warm and comforting dessert that pairs perfectly with the cool and creamy mousse. Roast a mix of fruits like apples, pears, and berries with a hint of cinnamon and a drizzle of maple syrup, then top with a crunchy oat and nut mixture.\n4. **Pistachio Rosewater Panna Cotta**: This creamy and exotic dessert will add a luxurious touch to your spread. Use a non-dairy milk and a vegan cream substitute to make the panna cotta, and flavor it with pistachio and rosewater for a unique taste.\n5. **Chocolate-Dipped Fresh Fruit**: Skewer fresh fruits like strawberries, bananas, or grapes and dip them in melted vegan chocolate for a sweet and indulgent treat. This is a great way to offer a lighter dessert option that's still satisfying.\n6. **Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies**: A classic dessert that's easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. Use a vegan chocolate chip substitute and a non-dairy milk to make these chewy treats.\n\nThese desserts offer a variety of textures, flavors, and temperatures to complement your chocolate avocado mousse and vegan banana bread. You can choose one or two to add to your spread, depending on your time and preferences. Good luck with your dinner party, and I hope your guests enjoy the delicious desserts!",
