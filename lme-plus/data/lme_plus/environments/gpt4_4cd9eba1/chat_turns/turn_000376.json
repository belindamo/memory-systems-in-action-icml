  "content": "I'm looking for some book recommendations. I've been into fiction lately, especially novels that explore complex themes. I just finished a 416-page novel, but before that, I read \"The Power\" by Naomi Alderman in December, which had 341 pages and took me around 5 weeks to finish. I'm interested in books with similar page lengths and depth.",
