These certifications can help give you some assurance that the foods you purchase are free from harmful additives and have been produced in a way that meets certain safety and quality standards. Additionally, it's important to read and understand ingredient labels and to research any additives or preservatives that you're unsure about to determine if they're generally considered safe. Finally, if you have any concerns about the safety of a particular product, you can contact the manufacturer or the FDA directly to ask questions or seek clarification."
