By the way, last month I took a cooking class that focused on vegan desserts and learned how to make a mean chocolate avocado mousse, which has been a hit with my friends and family."

Do you have any tips on how to get the texture just right? I think I need to add more coconut flakes to give them a better texture."

      "content": "Energy balls are a fantastic snack option, and making them at home allows you to customize the ingredients to your taste preferences.\n\nGetting the texture just right can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you achieve the perfect bite:\n\n1. **Coconut flakes:** Yes, adding more coconut flakes can definitely help with texture. Coconut flakes can absorb excess moisture and help bind the ingredients together. Start by adding an extra tablespoon or two and see how it affects the mixture.\n2. **Oat ratio:** Make sure you're using the right ratio of oats to other ingredients. A general rule of thumb is to use 2 parts oats to 1 part nut butter or seed butter. If your mixture is too sticky, add more oats. If it's too dry, add more nut butter.\n3. **Nut butter consistency:** The consistency of your nut butter can affect the overall texture of the energy balls. If your nut butter is too runny, it can make the mixture too sticky. Try using a thicker, creamier nut butter or refrigerating it for about 10 minutes to firm it up before mixing.\n4. **Chia seeds:** Adding chia seeds can help absorb excess moisture and create a better texture. Start with a small amount (about 1 tablespoon) and see how it affects the mixture.\n5. **Honey or maple syrup:** If you're using a liquid sweetener like honey or maple syrup, use it sparingly. These sweeteners can make the mixture too sticky. Try using a small amount or substituting with a dry sweetener like dates or coconut sugar.\n6. **Mixing:** Make sure to mix the ingredients thoroughly until they're well combined. If the mixture is too crumbly, try mixing it for a few more minutes until it comes together.\n7. **Chilling:** Chilling the mixture in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes can help the ingredients set and create a better texture.\n8. **Rolling technique:** When rolling the energy balls, make sure to press the mixture together firmly to help it hold its shape. You can also try rolling them between your hands to create a more uniform shape.\n\nSome other ingredients you can experiment with to change the texture include:\n\n* Shredded coconut (in addition to coconut flakes)\n* Puffed rice or puffed wheat\n* Crushed nuts or seeds (like almonds or pumpkin seeds)\n* Cacao nibs or chocolate chips (for a treat)\n\nRemember, the key to achieving the perfect texture is to experiment and find the right balance of ingredients for your taste preferences. Don't be afraid to try new combinations and adjust the recipe to your liking!"
