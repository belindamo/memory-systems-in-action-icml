Make sure your goals are specific, measurable, and achievable, so you can track your progress and stay motivated.\n3. **Create a schedule and stick to it**: Plan out your workouts and schedule them in your calendar. Treat them as non-negotiable appointments, and try to exercise at the same time every day or week.\n4. **Vary your routine**: Mix up your exercise routine to avoid boredom and prevent plateaus. Try new workouts, join a fitness class, or workout with a friend to keep things interesting.\n5. **Track your progress**: Keep a workout log or use a fitness tracker to track your progress.
