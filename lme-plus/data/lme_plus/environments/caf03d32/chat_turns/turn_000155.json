Remember to observe her behavior closely and adjust the game according to her reactions.\n\nPlacing the freeze-dried chicken strips in plain sight is a great way to introduce her to the game. Watch for signs of interest, such as:\n\n* Sniffing or investigating the treats\n* Pawing or batting at the treats\n* Eating the treats quickly or eagerly\n* Searching for more treats after finishing the initial ones\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, it's a good indication that Luna is engaged and ready for the next step. You can then start hiding the treats in easy-to-find locations, as we discussed earlier.\n\nRemember to be patient and go at Luna's pace. Some cats may take a little time to adjust to the new game, while others may catch on quickly. The key is to make it fun and challenging, but not frustrating.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot or provide additional tips to make the game more enjoyable for Luna.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you both have a purrfect time playing the food hunting game!",
