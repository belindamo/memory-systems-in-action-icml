Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Cascara Latte Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 teaspoon of cascara powder (or 2-3 whole dried cascara cherries)\n* 1 cup of hot water (around 200\u00b0F to 205\u00b0F)\n* 3-4 oz of milk (dairy or non-dairy, such as almond or oat milk)\n* Optional: sweetener (e.g., honey, sugar, or syrup), spices (e.g., cinnamon, nutmeg)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Steep the cascara**: If using whole dried cascara cherries, steep 2-3 cherries in 1 cup of hot water for 5-7 minutes. If using cascara powder, simply add 1 teaspoon to the hot water and stir.\n2. **Strain the mixture**: If using whole cherries, remove them from the liquid by straining it through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth. If using powder, you can skip this step.\n3. **Prepare the milk**: Heat the milk to a simmer or use a milk frother to create a creamy foam.\n4. **Combine the cascara and milk**: Pour the strained cascara liquid into a large cup. Add the heated milk and hold back the foam with a spoon.\n5. **Top with foam and customize**: Top the drink with the reserved milk foam. You can add a drizzle of honey, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or a pinch of nutmeg to taste.\n\n**Tips and Variations**\n\n* Use a high-quality cascara powder or fresh cascara cherries for the best flavor.\n* Adjust the steeping time to your liking, but be careful not to over-steep, which can make the drink bitter.\n* Experiment with different milks and flavorings, such as vanilla or hazelnut, to change up the flavor profile.\n* Add a shot of espresso or a teaspoon of instant coffee to create a \"dirty\" cascara latte with a caffeine boost.\n* Try using cascara in cold brew form by steeping it in cold water for 8-12 hours and then mixing it with milk and ice.\n\nEnjoy your delicious and unique cascara latte!",
