I want to use humor to tackle relatable topics, like the struggles of being an accountant and trying to make it in the comedy world. I think using storytelling techniques and anecdotes will help make my content more engaging and memorable.\n\nI'm aiming for a tone that's witty, sarcastic, and slightly self-deprecating. I want my readers to feel like they're getting a glimpse into my life as a comedian and accountant, and that they can relate to my struggles and triumphs. I'm excited to start writing and refining my tone, and I appreciate your guidance and feedback!",
