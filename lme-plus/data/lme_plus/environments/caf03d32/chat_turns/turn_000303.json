  "content": "What a fantastic idea! Creating a separate list for \"Design Decisions\" is a great way to track your design process and decisions. This list can serve as a design journal or a decision log, helping you:\n\n1. **Document your design process**: By tracking your design decisions, you'll have a clear record of your thought process, which can be useful for future reference or when iterating on your design.\n2. **Justify design choices**: Writing down your design rationales can help you articulate your design decisions and provide a clear explanation for your choices.\n3. **Reflect on your design process**: Reviewing your design decisions can help you identify patterns, areas for improvement, and opportunities for growth as a designer.\n4. **Communicate with stakeholders**: A design decision log can be a valuable resource when communicating with clients, team members, or stakeholders about your design choices.\n5. **Improve design consistency**: By tracking your design decisions, you can ensure consistency across your design elements, such as typography, color schemes, and layout.\n\nIn your \"Design Decisions\" list, you can create cards for each design decision, including:\n\n* **Decision**: A brief description of the design decision (e.g., \"Use a sans-serif font for body text\").\n* **Rationale**: An explanation for the design decision (e.g., \"Sans-serif fonts are more legible on digital screens, and this font choice aligns with the brand's modern aesthetic\").\n* **Date**: The date the decision was made.\n* **Attachments**: Any relevant files, such as design files, research documents, or inspiration images that influenced the design decision.\n\nBy incorporating this list into your Trello board, you'll have a comprehensive design management system that not only tracks your tasks and assets but also documents your design process and decisions.\n\nGreat thinking, and I'm excited to see how this setup will help you streamline your design workflow and decision-making process!",
