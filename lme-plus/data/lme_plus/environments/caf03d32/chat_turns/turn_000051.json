  "content": "To expand the architecture to include a deep learning system, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, you need to define the input and output of the deep learning model. The input could be a combination of the users' opinions, market data, and any other relevant information that can be used to predict the future trend of the currency. The output could be a prediction of the future trend, represented as a probability distribution over different possible outcomes.\n2. Next, you need to choose a deep learning framework and design the architecture of the model. There are many deep learning frameworks available for Python, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. You can choose one that best fits your needs and design a model architecture that takes the input and produces the output.\n3. You can then train the model using a dataset of past market data and users' opinions, and tune the hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.\n4. Once the model is trained, you can integrate it into the web application by adding a new endpoint to the backend that accepts the input and returns the output of the model. The model's output can then be used in conjunction with the users' opinions to make trading decisions.\n5. You can also set up a system for periodically retraining the model using the latest data to improve its accuracy over time. This could be implemented using a scheduled task or a message queue such as Celery.\n\nOverall, the architecture of the expanded application should be designed to handle the following high-level workflow:\n\n1. Users sign up and log in to the application.\n2. Users provide their opinions on the future trend of the currency they want to trade.\n3. The deep learning model processes the users' opinions and other relevant information to make a prediction of the future trend.\n4. The application uses the users' opinions and the model's prediction to make trades on a cryptocurrency exchange.\n5. The application generates revenue from the trades and pays out a percentage to the users who provided their opinions.\n6. The model is periodically retrained using the latest data to improve its accuracy.",
