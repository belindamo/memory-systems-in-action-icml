Here's a suggested ratio and some additional ingredients to enhance the flavor and nutritional value:\n\n**Guava Oatmeal Recipe:**\n\n* 1/2 cup rolled oats\n* 1/4 cup diced fresh guava (about 1-2 guavas, depending on size)\n* 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk or other non-dairy milk\n* 1 tablespoon chia seeds\n* 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional)\n* Pinch of salt\n* Toppings (choose one or more): sliced banana, chopped nuts (walnuts, almonds), shredded coconut, cinnamon, or a sprinkle of protein powder\n\n**Ratio:** Start with 1 part guava to 2 parts oatmeal. You can adjust to your taste, but this ratio will give you a good balance of flavors and textures.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use fresh guava for the best flavor and texture. If you can't find fresh guava, frozen or canned guava can work as well.\n* Add a scoop of your favorite protein powder to boost the protein content even more.\n* Mix in some chopped nuts or seeds, like walnuts, almonds, or chia seeds, for added crunch and nutrition.\n* Swap the almond milk for coconut milk or another non-dairy milk to change up the flavor and creaminess.\n* Add a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg to give the oatmeal a warm, spicy flavor.\n* If you prefer a sweeter oatmeal, add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup. You can also use dates or date syrup for a natural sweetener.\n* Experiment with different types of oats, like steel-cut oats or instant oats, to change the texture and cooking time.\n\n**Nutritional Benefits:**\n\n* 1 cup cooked oatmeal: 6 grams protein, 4 grams fiber\n* 1/2 cup diced guava: 2 grams protein, 4 grams fiber\n* 1 tablespoon chia seeds: 2 grams protein, 4 grams fiber\n* 1 tablespoon almond milk: 1 gram protein, 0 grams fiber\n\nThis recipe combines the complex carbohydrates from oats with the protein and fiber from guava and chia seeds, making it a nutrient-dense breakfast option. The unsweetened almond milk adds creaminess without excess sugar. Enjoy your delicious and healthy guava oatmeal!",
