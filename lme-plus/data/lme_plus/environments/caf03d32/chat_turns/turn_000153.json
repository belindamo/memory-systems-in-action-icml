  "content": "Freeze-dried chicken strips are an excellent choice for food hunting. They're not only high-value and low-calorie but also packed with protein and flavor.\n\nI recommend starting with a few strips and observing Luna's reaction before hiding a bunch around the house. Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Introduction phase**: Begin by offering Luna 2-3 freeze-dried chicken strips in plain sight, such as on a plate or on the floor. This will allow her to familiarize herself with the new treat and associate it with the game.\n2. **Initial hiding**: Once Luna is comfortable with the treats, start hiding 2-3 strips in easy-to-find locations, such as on a chair, table, or near her favorite sleeping spot. This will help her understand that the treats are hidden and encourage her to search.\n3. **Gradual increase**: As Luna becomes more confident and engaged, you can gradually increase the number of hidden treats (4-6 strips) and move them to more challenging locations, such as under a rug, behind a curtain, or on a cat tower.\n4. **Observe and adjust**: Monitor Luna's behavior and adjust the number and difficulty of hidden treats based on her reaction. If she seems overwhelmed or uninterested, reduce the number of treats or make them easier to find.\n\nRemember, the goal is to encourage Luna to search and hunt, not to create frustration or anxiety. By starting with a few strips and gradually increasing the challenge, you'll help her build confidence and develop problem-solving skills.\n\nTips for hiding the freeze-dried chicken strips:\n\n* Place them in plain sight initially, then gradually move to more hidden locations.\n* Use your fingers or a utensil to spread a small amount of the strip's aroma on the surface where you're hiding it, making it easier for Luna to follow the scent.\n* Consider hiding the strips in areas with a strong catnip scent or near a familiar toy to make the experience more enjoyable and engaging.\n\nBy following this approach, you'll be able to gauge Luna's interest and adjust the game to her individual needs and preferences. Good luck, and have fun watching her enjoy this new activity!",
