  "content": "The mock census dataset you will be given contains randomly generate data using the Faker package in Python. It has\nbeen generated in a similar manner to (and designed to directly emulate the format of) the 1881 census of the\nUK wherein only a few questions were asked of the population. The fields recorded are as follows:\n1. Street Number (this is set to \u201c1\u201d if it is a unique dwelling);\n2. Street Name;\n3. First Name of occupant;\n4. Surname of occupant;\n5. Age of occupant;\n6. Relationship to the \u201cHead\u201d of the household (anyone aged over 18 can be a \u201cHead\u201d \u2013 they are simply\nthe person who had the responsibility to fill in the census details);\n7. Marital status (one of: Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed, or \u201cNA\u201d in the case of minors);\n8. Gender (one of: Male, Female; note that other responses were not implemented in 1881);\n9. Occupation (this field was implemented in a modern style, rather than typical 1881 occupations);\n10. Infirmity (we have implemented a limited set of infirmities following the style of 1881);\n11. Religion (we have implemented a set of real-world religions).\n\nThe first task you will have to do is to clean this dataset. As you will rapidly discover, there are missing entries,\nand, candidly, some responses from the population are outright lies. Part of the grading for the assignment will\nassess these details.\nThe town from the census is a modestly sized one sandwiched between two much larger cities that it\nis connected to by motorways. The town does not have a university, but students do live in the town and\ncommute to the nearby cities. Once you have a cleaned dataset to analyse, your task is to decide the following:\n(a) What should be built on an unoccupied plot of land that the local government wishes to\ndevelop? Your choices are:\n(i) High-density housing. This should be built if the population is significantly expanding.\n(ii) Low-density housing. This should be built if the population is \u201caffluent\u201d and there is\ndemand for large family housing.\n(iii) Train station. There are potentially a lot of commuters in the town and building a train\nstation could take pressure off the roads. But how will you identify commuters?\n(iv) Religious building. There is already one place of worship for Catholics in the town. Is\nthere demand for a second Church (if so, which denomination?), or for a different religious building?\n(v) Emergency medical building. Not a full hospital, but a minor injuries centre. This should\nbe built if there are many injuries or future pregnancies likely in the population.\n(vi) Something else?\nWhichever you choose, you must justify it from the data provided to you and argue it is a priority\nagainst other choices.\nThe following is the dataset:\nHouse Number,Street,First Name,Surname,Age,Relationship to Head of House,Marital Status,Gender,Occupation,Infirmity,Religion\n1,Kaur Drive,Douglas,Adams,77,Head,Widowed,Male,Retired Museum education officer,None,Christian\n2,Kaur Drive,Hollie,West,79,Head,Single,Female,Retired Dealer,None,Christian\n3,Kaur Drive,Joseph,Hall,55,Head,Single,Male,Fast food restaurant manager,None,Christian\n4,Kaur Drive,Gregory,Cox,35,Head,Single,Male,Housing manager/officer,None,None\n5,Kaur Drive,Lydia,Jones,42,Head,Single,Female,Unemployed,None,Catholic\n5,Kaur Drive,Francis,Jones,3,Son,NA,Male,Child,None,NA\n6,Kaur Drive,Diana,Martin,80,Head,Widowed,Female,Retired Accounting technician,None,Christian\n6,Kaur Drive,Ruth,Godfrey,12,Granddaughter,NA,Female,Student,None,NA\n7,Kaur Drive,Glenn,Turner,76,Head,Widowed,Male,\"Retired Designer, textile\",None,None\n8,Kaur Drive,Suzanne,Jones,46,Head,Single,Female,\"Therapist, occupational\",None,None\n9,Kaur Drive,Kayleigh,Dean,27,Head,Single,Female,Immunologist,None,None\n9,Kaur Drive,Samantha,Sheppard-Dean,2,Daughter,NA,Female,Child,None,NA\n10,Kaur Drive,Ellie,Hyde,54,Head,Widowed,Female,Occupational hygienist,None,Methodist\n11,Kaur Drive,Mohammad,Wilkinson,35,Head,Single,Male,Careers adviser,None,Methodist\n11,Kaur Drive,Billy,Wilkinson,3,Son,NA,Male,Child,None,NA\n11,Kaur Drive,Mathew,Wilkinson,1,Son,NA,Male,Child,None,NA\n12,Kaur Drive,Melanie,Stewart,70,Head,Married,Female,Retired Radio broadcast assistant,Disabled,Christian\n12,Kaur Drive,Brian,Stewart,72,Husband,Married,Male,\"Retired Radiographer, diagnostic\",None,None\n13,Kaur Drive,Sarah,Robertson,34,Head,Single,Female,Unemployed,None,Muslim\n13,Kaur Drive,Shannon,Robertson,12,Daughter,NA,Female,Student,None,NA\n14,Kaur Drive,Conor,Akhtar,68,Head,Single,Male,Retired Translator,None,None\n15,Kaur Drive,Fiona,Walker,35,Head,Single,Female,\"Scientist, clinical (histocompatibility and immunogenetics)\",None,Christian\n16,Kaur Drive,Kirsty,Davies,40,Head,Divorced,Female,\"Psychologist, prison and probation services\",None,Methodist\n1,Lime Road,Adam,Hayes,37,Head,Divorced,Male,Advice worker,None,None\n2,Lime Road,Hugh,Roberts,80,Head,Divorced,Male,\"Retired Radiographer, therapeutic\",None,Christian\n3,Lime Road,Scott,Ali-Morris,48,Head,Married,Male,Hydrogeologist,None,Christian\n3,Lime Road,Maureen,Ali-Morris,38,Wife,Married,Female,Research scientist (maths),None,Christian\n3,Lime Road,Dylan,Ali-Morris,8,Son,NA,Male,Student,None,NA\n4,Lime Road,Jonathan,Lewis,75,Head,Widowed,Male,\"Retired Surveyor, insurance\",None,None\n5,Lime Road,Donald,Saunders,67,Head,Widowed,Male,Market researcher,None,Christian\n6,Lime Road,Joel,Ahmed,89,Head,Married,Male,\"Retired Nurse, learning disability\",None,Christian\n6,Lime Road,Claire,Ahmed,88,Wife,Married,Female,Retired Marketing executive,None,Christian\n7,Lime Road,Michelle,Jones,64,Head,Divorced,Female,\"Production designer, theatre/television/film\",None,Christian\n7,Lime Road,Stephen,Jones,0,Grandson,NA,Male,Child,None,NA\n8,Lime Road,Garry,Browne,49,Head,Single,Male,Unemployed,None,None\n9,Lime Road,Kimberley,Kaur,22,Head,Divorced,Female,University Student,None,None\n10,Lime Road,Nicole,Davies,35,Head,Married,Female,Unemployed,None,Catholic\n10,Lime Road,Hugh,Davies,37,Husband,Married,Male,\"Buyer, retail\",None,Catholic\n10,Lime Road,Kirsty,Davies,8,Daughter,NA,Female,Student,None,NA\n11,Lime Road,Dorothy,Chapman,59,Head,Single,Female,\"Production designer, theatre/television/film\",None,None\n12,Lime Road,Amanda,Barnes,36,Head,Single,Female,Surgeon,None,Christian\n13,Lime Road,Amelia,Parkin,44,Head,Single,Female,Unemployed,None,None\n14,Lime Road,Sarah,Taylor,60,Head,Divorced,Female,Unemployed,None,None\n14,Lime Road,Annette,Taylor,11,Granddaughter,NA,Female,Student,None,NA\n15,Lime Road,Valerie,James,23,Head,Divorced,Female,Podiatrist,None,None\n16,Lime Road,June,Saunders,68,Head,Widowed,Female,\"Retired Surveyor, building control\",None,Christian",
