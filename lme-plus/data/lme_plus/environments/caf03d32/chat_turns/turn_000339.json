Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Half-Caf, Half-Decaf**: Mix half regular coffee with half decaf coffee beans for a balanced blend. This way, you'll still get some caffeine, but less than a full cup.\n2. **Cascara Latte**: Use cascara, the dried fruit of the coffee cherry, to make a tea-like drink. It has a fruity flavor and only 1-2% of the caffeine found in coffee. Add milk and a sweetener of your choice.\n3. **Cold Brew with Chicory**: Chicory root has a natural, earthy flavor and is naturally caffeine-free. Mix it with cold brew coffee for a low-caffeine, smooth drink.\n4. **Mocha with Coconut Oil and Cacao**: Add a spoonful of coconut oil and a sprinkle of cacao powder to your coffee for a creamy, chocolatey flavor. The healthy fats in coconut oil can help slow down caffeine absorption.\n5. **Golden Latte**: Inspired by turmeric lattes, this drink combines coffee with turmeric, ginger, and coconut milk. The spices can help reduce caffeine's stimulating effects.\n6. **Coffee with Ginseng and Honey**: Add a pinch of ginseng powder and a drizzle of honey to your coffee. Ginseng is believed to help balance caffeine's effects, while honey provides a natural energy boost.\n7. **Low-Caffeine Coffee Blends**: Look for coffee beans that are naturally lower in caffeine, such as Arabica or Liberica. You can also try blends specifically labeled as \"low-caffeine\" or \"half-caf.\"\n8. **Coffee with Oat Milk and Cinnamon**: This creamy, sweet drink combines coffee with oat milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Oat milk is naturally low in caffeine, and cinnamon can help slow down caffeine absorption.\n9. **Yerba Mate Latte**: Yerba mate is a South American herbal tea that has a slightly earthy, coffee-like flavor. It contains less caffeine than coffee and can be enjoyed as a latte with milk and honey.\n10. **Coffee with Coconut Water and Lime**: Add a splash of coconut water and a squeeze of lime juice to your coffee for a refreshing, low-caffeine pick-me-up.\n\nRemember, you can always adjust the amount of coffee, sweeteners, and creamers to your taste preferences. Experiment with these recipes to find the perfect balance of flavor and caffeine for your morning routine.",
