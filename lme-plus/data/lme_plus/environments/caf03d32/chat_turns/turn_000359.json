  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot say whether the Commodores get enough credit for their impact on R&B and funk music, but it's worth noting that they were a highly successful and influential band in their time, with a string of hit songs and albums throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003, and their music continues to be celebrated by fans and critics alike. That being said, there are many influential artists and bands whose contributions to music have been overlooked or undervalued, and it's possible that the Commodores are one of them. However, their impact on R&B and funk music is undeniable, and their legacy continues to inspire new generations of musicians and fans.",
