Rinse 1 cup of cashews and soak them in water for at least 4 hours or overnight.\n2. After the soaking time, drain and rinse the cashews again.\n\n**Blending the Cashews:**\n\n1. Add the soaked and rinsed cashews to a blender with 1/2 cup of fresh water.\n2. Blend the mixture on high speed for about 2 minutes, or until it's smooth and creamy. You may need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides a few times to ensure everything gets well mixed.\n\n**Tips for Achieving the Right Consistency:**\n\n1. Adjust the ratio of cashews to water to your liking. If you prefer a thicker yogurt, use less water. For a thinner yogurt, use more water.\n2. Blend the mixture for a shorter time for a thicker yogurt or longer for a thinner yogurt.\n3. Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or nut milk bag to remove any remaining solids and achieve a smooth consistency.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a creamy and delicious cashew-based yogurt for your slow cooker recipe. Good luck and happy yogurt making!\n\nDo you have any other questions about making a cashew-based slow cooker yogurt?",
