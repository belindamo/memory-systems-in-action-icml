As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences, memories, or access to your personal calendar or social life. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation, and I don't retain any information from previous chats.\n\nIf you're trying to remember the date of the Super Bowl party, you might want to check your calendar, phone, or social media to see if you have any records of the event. Or, you could ask your friends who hosted the party to refresh your memory!",
