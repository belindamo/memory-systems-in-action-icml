Do you need a stand that can accommodate larger or smaller trees?\n3. **Weight capacity**: Make sure the stand is rated for your weight and any additional gear you plan to bring.\n4. **Comfort**: Consider the seat size, backrest, and armrests. You'll be sitting for extended periods, so comfort is crucial.\n5. **Safety features**: Look for stands with a secure harness system, sturdy construction, and a fall arrest system (FAS) or a safety line.\n\nWith those factors in mind, here are some top tree stand brands and models to consider:\n\n**Budget-friendly options:**\n\n1. **Summit Treestands**: Known for their affordable, high-quality stands.
