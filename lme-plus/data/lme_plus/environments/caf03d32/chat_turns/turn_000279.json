  "content": "Yes, hiking the Half Dome Trail in Yosemite National Park requires a permit. Here are the details:\n\n- Permits are required seven days a week and are available only by lottery from April through October. - The lottery is typically held in March and permits are awarded through a randomized lottery system. - The permit allows you to climb the subdome and the cables to the top of Half Dome. - The permit is specific to the day you are allowed to hike and is non-transferable. - The permit is required for both day and overnight hikers. - The park limits the amount of permits issued per day so it's best to apply early. You can obtain more information on the permit requirements for hiking Half Dome and apply for the lottery through the Yosemite National Park website.",
