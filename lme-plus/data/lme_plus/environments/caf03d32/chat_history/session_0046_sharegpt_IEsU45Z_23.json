Here is a table and diagram for the anatomy of a perfectly executed marketing content translation process using MT and TM with market reviewers in a post-edit workflow.\n\n| Step | Activity | Tool/Method | Stakeholders/Actors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Content Analysis | Text Analytics, Terminology Extraction | Localization Project Manager, Content Creator |\n| 2 | Translation | Machine Translation, Translation Memory | Machine Translation System, Translation Memory System |\n| 3 | Post-Editing | Post-Editing Guidelines, Style Guides, Review Checklist | In-Country Reviewer, Post-Editor |\n| 4 | Quality Assurance | Quality Assurance Checklist | Localization Project Manager, Quality Assurance Specialist |\n| 5 | Review and Approval | Review and Approval Workflow | Marketing Manager, Localization Project Manager |\n\nAnd here is a diagram illustrating the process:\n```scss\n                    CONTENT ANALYSIS\n                             |\n                             |\n                             v\n                   TRANSLATION (MT & TM)\n                             |\n                             |\n                             v\n                POST-EDITING (Guidelines, Checklists)\n                             |\n                             |\n                             v\n                 QUALITY ASSURANCE (Checklist)\n                             |\n                             |\n                             v\n              REVIEW AND APPROVAL (Workflow)\n```\nIn this process, the localization project manager and content creator analyze the content to identify any issues or areas that require special attention. The content is then translated using machine translation and translation memory, with the machine translation system and translation memory system serving as the tools/methods.\n\nAfter translation, the content is post-edited by an in-country reviewer and post-editor who follow post-editing guidelines, style guides, and review checklists. This step ensures that the translations are accurate, culturally appropriate, and consistent with the brand message and voice.\n\nNext, the content undergoes quality assurance by the localization project manager and quality assurance specialist using a quality assurance checklist. This step ensures that the translations are error-free, conform to the brand guidelines, and meet the client's requirements.\n\nFinally, the marketing manager and localization project manager review and approve the translated content using a review and approval workflow. This step ensures that the translations meet the client's expectations and are ready for publication."
