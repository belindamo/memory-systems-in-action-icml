I will provide some specific information about a web app requirements, and it will be your job to come up with an architecture and code for developing good python software. \n\nGeneral purpose:\nI want a system that use users opinion to do trading with criptocurrency named All2Trade\n\nTecnologies involved:\nPython 3 as programming language, Flask and MySQL\n\nWhat is the purpose of the application? The purpose is to make money using the condensed knowledge of the users base.\n\nWho are the users of the application? Everyone whants to help the system to make right decision and want a portion of the revenues.\n\nWhat features do you want to include in the application? the system will be completely automated and minimal.\n\nHow do you want to collect users' opinions? The user will provide the opinion on the future trend of the currency he want through a simple interface.\n\nFor users the use of the platform will be completely free.\nThe business will generates a revenue by trade using users opinion, pay them a small percentage of the payout and taking the difference."

      "content": "To develop the web application described, I would recommend the following architecture:\n\n1. The frontend of the application should be developed using Flask, which is a lightweight web framework for Python. This will allow us to create the user interface that users will interact with to provide their opinions on the future trend of the currency.\n2. A database is required to store the users' opinions and other application data. For this purpose, MySQL can be used as the database management system.\n3. The backend of the application should be implemented in Python, using appropriate libraries and frameworks to handle the trading and other business logic. This could include libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, and the ccxt library for interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges.\n4. The application should have a system for authenticating and authorizing users, to ensure that only registered users can provide their opinions and receive payouts. This could be implemented using Flask-Login and Flask-JWT.\n5. To automate the trading process, the application should have a system for regularly fetching the latest market data and making trades based on the users' opinions. This could be implemented using a scheduled task or a message queue such as Celery.\n\nOverall, the architecture of the application should be designed to handle the following high-level workflow:\n\n1. Users sign up and log in to the application.\n2. Users provide their opinions on the future trend of the currency they want to trade.\n3. The application uses the users' opinions to make trades on a cryptocurrency exchange.\n4. The application generates revenue from the trades and pays out a percentage to the users who provided their opinions."

      "content": "To expand the architecture to include a deep learning system, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, you need to define the input and output of the deep learning model. The input could be a combination of the users' opinions, market data, and any other relevant information that can be used to predict the future trend of the currency. The output could be a prediction of the future trend, represented as a probability distribution over different possible outcomes.\n2. Next, you need to choose a deep learning framework and design the architecture of the model. There are many deep learning frameworks available for Python, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. You can choose one that best fits your needs and design a model architecture that takes the input and produces the output.\n3. You can then train the model using a dataset of past market data and users' opinions, and tune the hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.\n4. Once the model is trained, you can integrate it into the web application by adding a new endpoint to the backend that accepts the input and returns the output of the model. The model's output can then be used in conjunction with the users' opinions to make trading decisions.\n5. You can also set up a system for periodically retraining the model using the latest data to improve its accuracy over time. This could be implemented using a scheduled task or a message queue such as Celery.\n\nOverall, the architecture of the expanded application should be designed to handle the following high-level workflow:\n\n1. Users sign up and log in to the application.\n2. Users provide their opinions on the future trend of the currency they want to trade.\n3. The deep learning model processes the users' opinions and other relevant information to make a prediction of the future trend.\n4. The application uses the users' opinions and the model's prediction to make trades on a cryptocurrency exchange.\n5. The application generates revenue from the trades and pays out a percentage to the users who provided their opinions.\n6. The model is periodically retrained using the latest data to improve its accuracy."
