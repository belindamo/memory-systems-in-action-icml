The trail is largely traffic-free and offers some great views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe trail starts at Aberdare Railway Station and follows the canal route northwards towards Abernant, eventually reaching the village of Hirwaun. From there, it continues along the canal before turning south towards Troedyrhiw, where it links up with the Taff Trail. The trail then follows the Taff Trail eastwards, passing through the town of Merthyr Tydfil before ending at Cardiff Bay.\n\nAlong the way, there are several notable landmarks and attractions to see, such as the Cyfarthfa Castle Museum & Art Gallery in Merthyr Tydfil, the ruins of Aberdare Ironworks, and the Brecon Mountain Railway in Pant. There are also several picturesque villages and towns to explore, such as Cefn-coed-y-cymmer and Troedyrhiw.\n\nThe Aberdare Canal Trail is a great way to explore the history and natural beauty of the area, and it's suitable for walkers and cyclists of all abilities."
