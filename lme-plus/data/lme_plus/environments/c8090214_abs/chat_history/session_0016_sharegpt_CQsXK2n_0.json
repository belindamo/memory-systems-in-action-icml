They spend their lunch breaks discussing their favorite series and characters, but one topic always seems to spark a heated debate: the merits of asses and titties in anime and manga.\n\nOne of the friends, a boy named Tom, is a huge advocate for titties. He believes that nothing beats the classic, bouncy, and well-endowed female characters that are often found in anime and manga.\n\nAnother friend, a girl named Sarah, is a devout fan of asses. She argues that a well-designed and well-proportioned butt is the true measure of a character's sex appeal.\n\nThe debate between Tom and Sarah quickly becomes a heated argument, with the rest of the group trying to mediate and offer their own opinions on the matter.\n\nAct 2:\n\nAs the debate continues, the group realizes that the popularity and prevalence of asses and titties in anime and manga has changed over the years. They decide to take a trip to their local comic book store to research and gather evidence to support their arguments.\n\nAt the comic book store, the group discovers a wide variety of manga and anime spanning different decades. They begin to analyze the artwork and character designs, noticing how the portrayal of female bodies has changed over time.\n\nTom finds a collection of classic manga from the 1980s and 1990s, which he believes showcases the best examples of titties in anime and manga. Sarah counters with a selection of modern manga that features prominently-displayed asses.\n\nAct 3:\n\nAs the group continues to debate, they realize that the debate is not just about personal preferences, but also about cultural and societal attitudes towards femininity and female sexuality. They begin to discuss the way that women's bodies have been objectified and sexualized in anime and manga, and how these depictions have evolved over time.\n\nThrough their research and discussions, the group comes to a realization: the debate between asses and titties is not as important as they initially thought. What matters is the respect and appreciation of women's bodies, regardless of their shape or size.\n\nAct 4:\n\nIn the end, Tom and Sarah realize that they have both been guilty of objectifying and reducing women to their physical attributes. They apologize to each other and to the rest of the group, and vow to be more mindful and respectful in their discussions of anime and manga.\n\nThe group leaves the comic book store with a newfound understanding and appreciation for the diversity and complexity of women in anime and manga. They continue to enjoy and discuss their favorite series, but with a greater awareness and sensitivity towards the portrayal of women."
