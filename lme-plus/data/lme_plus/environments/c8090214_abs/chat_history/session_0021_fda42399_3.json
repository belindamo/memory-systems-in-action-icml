However, I can suggest a few ways for you to set reminders for yourself:\n\n1. **Digital Calendars**: Add recurring events to your digital calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook) for 2 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You can set reminders to notify you 15-30 minutes before the event.\n2. **Phone Reminders**: Set reminders on your phone using a built-in reminder app (e.g., Reminders on iPhone, Google Keep on Android). You can set a recurring reminder for 2 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n3. **Alarm Clock App**: Use an alarm clock app (e.g., Alarmy, Habitica) that allows you to set custom reminders and notifications.\n4. **Sticky Notes**: Place sticky notes in strategic locations where you'll see them, such as on your fridge, desk, or mirror, to remind you of your tea breaks with Emma.\n5. **Habit Tracker**: Use a habit tracker app (e.g., Habitica, HabitBull) to log your tea breaks with Emma and set reminders to help you stay consistent.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and don't forget to enjoy your tea breaks with Emma!"

It's great that you have a colleague who shares your interest in tea and can provide a nice break from the workday.\n\nNow, about storing tea properly... Yes, I can definitely help with that! Here are some tips to keep your tea fresh:\n\n1. **Airtight containers**: Store tea in airtight containers, such as glass jars or tins, to prevent air from getting in and spoiling the tea.\n2. **Cool, dry place**: Keep tea away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture. A cool, dry place like a pantry or cupboard is ideal.\n3. **Avoid strong-smelling foods**: Tea can absorb odors from nearby foods, so store it away from strong-smelling foods like onions, garlic, and spices.\n4. **Keep it away from light**: Light can cause tea to lose its flavor and aroma, so it's best to store it in a dark or shaded area.\n5. **Use the original packaging**: If possible, store tea in its original packaging, as it's designed to protect the tea from the elements.\n6. **Don't store tea in the fridge or freezer**: While it might seem like a good idea to store tea in the fridge or freezer to keep it fresh, the moisture and temperature fluctuations can actually cause more harm than good.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help preserve the flavor and aroma of your tea and enjoy it for a longer period.\n\nI hope that helps! Do you have a favorite tea-related accessory, like a teapot or infuser, that you use during your tea breaks with Emma?"

      "content": "A French press is a great brewing method for coffee, and it's wonderful that you're considering getting a tea infuser for your afternoon tea sessions!\n\nThere are many excellent tea infusers out there, and the best one for you will depend on your personal preferences and needs. Here are a few popular options to consider:\n\n1. **Silicone Infusers**: Flexible, easy to clean, and often inexpensive, silicone infusers are a great option for loose-leaf tea. They come in various shapes and sizes, and some even have built-in strainers.\n2. **Stainless Steel Infusers**: Durable, rust-resistant, and easy to clean, stainless steel infusers are a popular choice. They can be used for both hot and cold brew tea.\n3. **Mesh Infusers**: These infusers have a fine mesh material that allows for optimal tea leaf expansion and easy cleaning. They're often made of stainless steel or silicone.\n4. **Tea Balls**: Tea balls are a classic option, but they can be a bit more finicky to clean. Look for ones with a larger opening to make it easier to add and remove tea leaves.\n\nSome popular brands to consider include:\n\n* Finum\n* Hario\n* Tea Forte\n* The Tea Spot\n* Adagio Teas\n\nWhen choosing an infuser, think about the type of tea you'll be brewing, the size of your tea leaves, and how easy you want the infuser to be to clean.\n\nDo you have a preferred material or style in mind for your tea infuser?"

      "content": "Silicone infusers are a popular choice for many tea enthusiasts.\n\nCleaning your tea infuser is an important step to ensure your tea tastes its best and to prevent any buildup of old tea residue or bacteria. Here's a simple step-by-step guide to cleaning your silicone tea infuser:\n\n1. **Rinse with warm water**: After each use, rinse your infuser with warm water to remove any loose tea leaves or debris.\n2. **Soak in hot water**: Soak the infuser in hot water for 5-10 minutes to loosen any stubborn tea residue.\n3. **Mild soap and water**: Use a mild soap, such as dish soap, and warm water to gently scrub the infuser. A soft-bristled brush can be helpful for getting into small crevices.\n4. **Rinse thoroughly**: Rinse the infuser thoroughly with warm water to remove any soap residue.\n5. **Dry with a soft cloth**: Use a soft cloth to dry the infuser, paying extra attention to any crevices or areas where water might collect.\n6. **Occasional deep clean**: Every 1-2 weeks, mix equal parts water and white vinegar in the infuser and let it soak for 10-15 minutes. Then, rinse and dry as usual. This will help remove any mineral deposits and sanitize the infuser.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Avoid using abrasive materials or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the silicone.\n* Don't put your silicone infuser in the dishwasher, as the high heat and harsh detergents can cause it to degrade.\n* If you notice any stubborn stains or residue, you can try soaking the infuser in a mixture of baking soda and water for a few hours before cleaning.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to keep your silicone tea infuser clean and in good condition.\n\nDo you have any other questions about tea infusers or tea-related accessories?"
