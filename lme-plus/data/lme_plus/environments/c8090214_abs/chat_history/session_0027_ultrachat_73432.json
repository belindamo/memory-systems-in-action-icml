Repeat the layers of noodles, cashew cream, spinach leaves, tomato sauce, and cheese until all of your ingredients have been used.\n\n14. Cover your lasagna with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.\n\n15. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the cheeses are melted and bubbly.\n\n16. Let your lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nEnjoy your homemade vegan lasagna!"

      "content": "Absolutely! Cashew cream is a versatile ingredient in vegan cooking and can be used as a substitute for dairy cream in many recipes. Here are a few other uses for cashew cream:\n\n1. Vegan Alfredo Sauce: Just blend cashew cream with garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper for a creamy and cheesy Alfredo sauce.\n\n2. Creamy Soups: Add cashew cream to soups like tomato, broccoli, or mushroom for a silky texture and rich flavor.\n\n3. Vegan dips and spreads: You can mix cashew cream with hummus or white bean dip for a creamy, delicious dip for crackers and vegetables.\n\n4. Vegan Frostings: Blend cashew cream with coconut oil, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar for a rich and smooth frosting.\n\nI hope this gives you some ideas for how to use cashew cream beyond lasagna!"
