I've been enjoying listening to audiobooks during my daily commute, so I'll continue to do that, and I'll dedicate 30 minutes before bed to reading physical books. I'll also try to make the most of my downtime by squeezing in some reading during breaks or while waiting in line. One challenge I'm facing is staying focused while reading physical books, as I tend to get distracted by my phone or other things around me. Do you have any advice on how to stay focused while reading physical books?",
