  "content": "Happy birthday to your sister! I'd be happy to help you find a thoughtful gift that fits your budget.\n\nFirst, let's explore the handmade jewelry option. Even if you're not sure if it's her style, it's a unique and thoughtful gift that shows you're willing to venture out of the ordinary. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Learn more about her taste**: Think about your sister's fashion sense, favorite colors, and jewelry preferences. Does she like bold and statement-making or understated and elegant?\n2. **Ask for guidance**: If you're still unsure, ask a mutual friend or family member who knows her style well for input.\n3. **Check the prices**: If you liked the jewelry at the Holiday Market, go back and check the prices. Handmade items can be affordable, and you might find a beautiful piece within your budget.\n\nIf handmade jewelry isn't the way to go, here are some other budget-friendly gift ideas:\n\n1. **Personalized item**: A personalized keychain, mug, or journal with her name or initials can be a thoughtful gift.\n2. **Candle or home decor**: A nice candle or a decorative item for her home can add a cozy touch.\n3. **Experience gift**: Consider gifting her an experience, like tickets to a concert, play, or a fun activity, like rock climbing or a cooking class.\n4. **Subscription service**: A subscription to a streaming platform, a book club, or a monthly delivery of her favorite snacks can provide ongoing entertainment and enjoyment.\n5. **Practical yet thoughtful**: A good quality wallet, a set of nice notecards, or a luxurious throw blanket can be both practical and appreciated.\n6. **Create a memory book**: Make a heartfelt gift by creating a photo album or scrapbook filled with memories of special moments you've shared together.\n7. **Gourmet treat**: If your sister enjoys food, consider gifting her a gourmet treat, like artisanal chocolates or a specialty tea set.\n\nRemember, the thought and effort you put into the gift matter more than the price tag. Whatever you choose, make sure it's something that comes from the heart.\n\nDo any of these ideas resonate with you, or would you like more suggestions?",
