You can find high-quality, gently used items at a lower cost and reduce waste.\n2. **Sustainable fashion brands:** Look for brands that prioritize sustainability, such as:\n\t* Everlane (transparent pricing and supply chain)\n\t* Patagonia (environmental responsibility and sustainable materials)\n\t* Reformation (sustainable materials and practices)\n\t* H&M Conscious (affordable, sustainable fashion)\n3. **Affordable fashion brands:** Discover brands that offer trendy, affordable clothing without compromising on quality:\n\t* COS (minimalist, affordable fashion)\n\t* & Other Stories (trendy, affordable clothing and accessories)\n\t* Madewell (high-quality denim and trendy pieces at a lower price point)\n4. **Local and independent brands:** Support local designers, thrift stores, or independent boutiques in your area.
