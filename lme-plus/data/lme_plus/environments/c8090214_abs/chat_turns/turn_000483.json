  "content": "There were several factors that influenced the United States' decision to enter World War I:\n\n1. Unrestricted submarine warfare: Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare threatened American neutrality and lives. The sinking of the Lusitania in 1915, which killed 128 Americans, was a major turning point in public opinion.\n\n2. Economic interests: American companies had invested heavily in Allied countries, and a German victory would have led to a loss of business and potential default on loans.\n\n3. the Zimmermann Telegram: Germany proposed a secret alliance with Mexico against the United States, promising to help Mexico regain lost territories in return for joining Germany in the war.\n\n4. Idealism: President Woodrow Wilson believed that the United States had a duty to spread democracy and make the world safe for peace. The war was seen as an opportunity to establish a lasting peace through the establishment of the League of Nations.\n\n5. National prestige: The United States wanted to assert its role as a world power and demonstrate its military strength.",
