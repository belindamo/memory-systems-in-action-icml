Closing the game when not in use and limiting your playtime can definitely help reduce battery drain. Here are some additional suggestions:\n\n**Closing the game when not in use:**\n\n1. **Close the app completely**: When you're not playing Puzzle Quest, make sure to close the app completely by swiping it away from the recent apps list or using the \"Close all\" option.\n2. **Disable background data usage**: Go to Settings > Apps > Puzzle Quest > Data usage and disable \"Background data\" to prevent the game from consuming data and battery life when you're not actively playing.\n\n**Limiting your playtime:**\n\n1. **Set a daily playtime goal**: Set a daily playtime goal for yourself, say 30 minutes or 1 hour, and try to stick to it.
