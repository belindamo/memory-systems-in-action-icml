His black-and-white images are gritty, raw, and often confrontational, and they explore the urban environment in innovative and unexpected ways. Moriyama is known for his use of extreme angles, blurred motion, and grainy textures, which give his images a sense of urgency and immediacy. His work challenges conventional notions of beauty and emphasizes the rawness and chaos of modern life.
