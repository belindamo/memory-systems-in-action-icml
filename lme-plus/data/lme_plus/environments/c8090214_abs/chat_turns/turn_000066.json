I'll also be thinking about all the people who have supported me so far, including my friends and family who donated to my \"Walk for Cancer\" event and colleagues who bought my homemade cookies and cakes at the \"Bake Sale for Education\" event. Additionally, I'll be listening to music and podcasts to keep my mind occupied and energized throughout the ride.",
