It's great that you have a colleague who shares your interest in tea and can provide a nice break from the workday.\n\nNow, about storing tea properly... Yes, I can definitely help with that! Here are some tips to keep your tea fresh:\n\n1. **Airtight containers**: Store tea in airtight containers, such as glass jars or tins, to prevent air from getting in and spoiling the tea.\n2. **Cool, dry place**: Keep tea away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture. A cool, dry place like a pantry or cupboard is ideal.\n3. **Avoid strong-smelling foods**: Tea can absorb odors from nearby foods, so store it away from strong-smelling foods like onions, garlic, and spices.\n4. **Keep it away from light**: Light can cause tea to lose its flavor and aroma, so it's best to store it in a dark or shaded area.\n5. **Use the original packaging**: If possible, store tea in its original packaging, as it's designed to protect the tea from the elements.\n6. **Don't store tea in the fridge or freezer**: While it might seem like a good idea to store tea in the fridge or freezer to keep it fresh, the moisture and temperature fluctuations can actually cause more harm than good.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help preserve the flavor and aroma of your tea and enjoy it for a longer period.\n\nI hope that helps! Do you have a favorite tea-related accessory, like a teapot or infuser, that you use during your tea breaks with Emma?",
