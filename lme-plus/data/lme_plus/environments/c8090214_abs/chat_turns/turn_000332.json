  "content": "I think I'll try to create a conducive reading environment and remove temptations while reading. I'll also use a reading timer to challenge myself to stay focused for a certain amount of time. Additionally, I'll practice active reading by taking notes and summarizing the main points in my head. I might also try to develop a pre-reading routine to signal to my brain that it's time to focus. One challenge I'm facing is staying motivated to read physical books when I have a long commute, as I tend to prefer listening to audiobooks during that time. Do you have any advice on how to stay motivated to read physical books, even when I have a long commute?",
