  "content": "Yes, society has come a long way since the days of Ancient Athens, but it is important to remember that there is still much work that needs to be done to achieve true inclusivity and equal representation for all members of society. \n\nAlthough many societies have moved towards a more inclusive system of government, there are still many examples of exclusion and discrimination around the world. It is important to continue to strive towards a more just and equitable society in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity and are given an equal voice in the political process. By recognizing and confronting the inequalities that still exist today, we can continue to make progress towards a better and more inclusive world.",
