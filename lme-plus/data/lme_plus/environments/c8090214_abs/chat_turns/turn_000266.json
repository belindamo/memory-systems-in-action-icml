  "content": "I'm really excited to ask Sophia about her goals and aspirations. I think it'll give me a deeper understanding of what drives her and what she's passionate about. I want to know what she wants to achieve in her life and what's holding her back from getting there.\n\nI'm particularly curious about her sense of purpose and what gives her a sense of direction in life. Is it her relationships, her work, or something else? I also want to know what she's afraid of and what she's willing to risk to achieve her goals.\n\nOne question I'm going to ask her is: What's the one thing you're most afraid of failing at, and how does that fear hold you back from pursuing your dreams? I think this will give me insight into her deepest fears and insecurities, and how they influence her decisions and actions.\n\nI'm also going to ask her: What's the most important thing to you in life, and how do you prioritize it? This will help me understand",
