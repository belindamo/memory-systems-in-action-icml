  "content": "Vegas is always a great destination for a bachelorette party! It sounds like you helped plan a fun trip for your sister and her friends. $1,200 per person for a 4-day trip is a reasonable price, especially if it included accommodations, activities, and other perks.\n\nIt's great that you were able to help your sister plan a memorable trip. Planning a group trip can be challenging, but it's always rewarding to see everything come together and create lifelong memories.\n\nVegas has so much to offer, from the vibrant nightlife to the amazing shows, restaurants, and attractions. I'm sure your sister and her friends had an amazing time exploring the Strip, trying new restaurants, and enjoying the various activities and entertainment options.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what was the highlight of the trip for your sister and her friends? Was there a particular activity or experience that stood out as a favorite?",
