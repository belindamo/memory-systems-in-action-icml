  "content": "Adding chopped onions to the skillet with the garlic is a great way to add depth and sweetness to your saut\u00e9ed spinach. In fact, the combination of caramelized onions and garlic is a classic flavor combination that pairs beautifully with spinach.\n\nHere's a revised recipe:\n\n**Sauteed Spinach with Garlic and Onions**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 package fresh spinach leaves (about 1 pound)\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)\n* 1/2 medium onion, chopped (about 1/2 cup)\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Optional: lemon wedges, red pepper flakes, or other ingredients (see previous response)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n2. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 for 5-7 minutes, until it's translucent and starting to caramelize.\n3. Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for another minute, until fragrant and lightly golden. Be careful not to burn the garlic.\n4. Add the fresh spinach leaves to the skillet in batches, if necessary, to prevent overcrowding.\n5. Cook the spinach for 1-2 minutes, until it starts to wilt.\n6. Use a spatula to gently fold the spinach leaves over themselves, allowing the heat to distribute evenly.\n7. Continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes, until the spinach has reached your desired level of doneness.\n8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n9. Serve hot, garnished with lemon wedges if desired.\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to cook the onions slowly over medium heat to bring out their natural sweetness.\n* If using a stronger onion variety, like yellow or red onion, you may want to cook it for a few minutes longer to mellow out the flavor.\n* Don't overcook the onions, as they can quickly go from caramelized to burnt.\n* As before, feel free to add other ingredients like cherry tomatoes, red pepper flakes, or feta cheese to the skillet for added flavor and texture.\n\nBy adding chopped onions to the skillet, you'll create a rich, savory flavor profile that complements the spinach and garlic perfectly. Enjoy!",
