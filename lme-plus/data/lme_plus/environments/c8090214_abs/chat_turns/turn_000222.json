  "content": "I've actually been to the Governors Ball Music Festival before, it was amazing! I went on June 10th with my sister and saw some incredible performances by Tame Impala, Lorde, and J. Cole. This year's lineup looks great too, I'm a bit bummed I won't be able to make it. Anyway, I'm thinking of planning a road trip to the Austin City Limits Music Festival in October. Do you have any recommendations for accommodations or things to do in Austin while I'm there?",
