  "content": "Travel insurance is a great topic! I'd be happy to help you understand the different types of policies available.\n\nTravel insurance typically falls into three main categories:\n\n1. **Trip Cancellation Insurance**: This type of insurance reimburses you for trip-related expenses if you need to cancel your trip due to unforeseen circumstances such as illness, injury, natural disasters, or other covered events. This is often the most common type of travel insurance.\n2. **Trip Interruption Insurance**: This type of insurance provides coverage if you need to interrupt your trip due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a family emergency or a travel-related issue.\n3. **Travel Medical Insurance**: This type of insurance provides medical coverage while you're traveling, including emergency medical evacuations, hospital stays, and medical expenses.\n\nSome policies may also offer additional features, such as:\n\n* **Travel Delay Insurance**: Reimburses you for expenses incurred due to flight delays or cancellations.\n* **Baggage Loss or Damage Insurance**: Covers loss, damage, or theft of your luggage and personal belongings.\n* **Travel Assistance**: Provides 24/7 assistance with travel-related issues, such as flight changes, hotel bookings, and more.\n\nWhen considering a policy, it's essential to review the following:\n\n* **Policy Coverage**: What events are covered, and what's excluded?\n* **Policy Limits**: What's the maximum amount the insurer will pay out per person or per trip?\n* **Deductible**: How much you'll need to pay out of pocket before the insurance kicks in?\n* **Pre-Existing Conditions**: Are pre-existing medical conditions covered, or are they excluded?\n* **Policy Duration**: Does the policy cover you for the entire duration of your trip, or is it limited to a specific period?\n\nRegarding the policy you're considering, $100 per person for the trip seems reasonable. However, make sure you understand what's included in that price. Ask yourself:\n\n* What's the policy coverage, and are there any exclusions?\n* What's the maximum policy limit per person?\n* Is there a deductible, and if so, how much is it?\n* Does the policy cover pre-existing conditions, or are they excluded?\n* What's the policy duration, and does it cover the entire trip?\n\nIt's also a good idea to compare policies from different providers to ensure you're getting the best coverage for your needs and budget.\n\nRegarding your sister's bachelorette party trip to Vegas, the cost being per person is a good point to consider. When buying travel insurance, you'll typically need to purchase a policy for each person traveling. So, if you're traveling with others, you'll need to factor in the cost of insurance for each person.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision about travel insurance for your trip to Hawaii!",
