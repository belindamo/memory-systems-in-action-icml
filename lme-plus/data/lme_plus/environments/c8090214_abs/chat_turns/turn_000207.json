  "content": "I'd be happy to help you set reminders for your tea breaks with Emma.\n\nSince I'm a text-based AI, I don't have the ability to send you reminders or notifications directly. However, I can suggest a few ways for you to set reminders for yourself:\n\n1. **Digital Calendars**: Add recurring events to your digital calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook) for 2 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You can set reminders to notify you 15-30 minutes before the event.\n2. **Phone Reminders**: Set reminders on your phone using a built-in reminder app (e.g., Reminders on iPhone, Google Keep on Android). You can set a recurring reminder for 2 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n3. **Alarm Clock App**: Use an alarm clock app (e.g., Alarmy, Habitica) that allows you to set custom reminders and notifications.\n4. **Sticky Notes**: Place sticky notes in strategic locations where you'll see them, such as on your fridge, desk, or mirror, to remind you of your tea breaks with Emma.\n5. **Habit Tracker**: Use a habit tracker app (e.g., Habitica, HabitBull) to log your tea breaks with Emma and set reminders to help you stay consistent.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and don't forget to enjoy your tea breaks with Emma!",
