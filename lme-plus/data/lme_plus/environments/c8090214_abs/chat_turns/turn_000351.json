  "content": "Chicken parmesan is a classic! I'd be happy to help you find a simple and healthy side dish to pair with it. \n\nConsidering the rich flavors of parmesan, you'll want a side that provides a nice contrast in texture and flavor. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Roasted Broccoli**: A natural pairing! Broccoli's bitterness cuts through the richness of the parmesan, and a sprinkle of garlic powder (like you mentioned) will enhance the flavor. Simply toss broccoli florets with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes until tender and caramelized.\n2. **Sauteed Spinach**: Quickly cooking a handful of spinach with garlic, lemon juice, and a pinch of red pepper flakes will provide a refreshing contrast to the crispy, cheesy chicken. You can also add some cherry tomatoes for extra flavor and texture.\n3. **Grilled or Roasted Asparagus**: Asparagus's slight bitterness and crunchy texture will complement the parmesan nicely. Brush with olive oil, season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice, and grill or roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 12-15 minutes until tender.\n4. **Green Salad with a Light Vinaigrette**: A simple mixed green salad with a light vinaigrette dressing will help cut the richness of the parmesan. Add some cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, or carrots for extra crunch.\n5. **Roasted Zucchini**: Zucchini's mild flavor and high water content make it a great side dish to balance the parmesan. Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs (like basil or oregano), and roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes until tender and lightly browned.\n6. **Roasted Sweet Potato Wedges**: If you want a more filling side dish, sweet potato wedges roasted with olive oil, salt, and pepper will provide a satisfying contrast in texture. Simply slice sweet potatoes into wedges, toss with oil and seasonings, and roast at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes until crispy.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to try something new and delicious with your chicken parmesan!\n\nP.S. Garlic powder is a great addition to many roasted vegetables, as it enhances their natural flavors without overpowering them.",
