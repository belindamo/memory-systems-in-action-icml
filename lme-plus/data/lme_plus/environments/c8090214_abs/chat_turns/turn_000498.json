The set was issued by a European country, but I forget which one off the top of my head. I'll have to check the packaging again.\n\nI'm thinking of organizing the album chronologically, but I also like the idea of including additional materials to make it more engaging. Maybe I could include some photos of the planets or spacecraft, or even some fun facts about space exploration. Do you have any suggestions for resources where I could find that kind of information?",
