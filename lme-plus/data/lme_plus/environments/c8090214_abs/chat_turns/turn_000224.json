  "content": "That sounds amazing! I'll definitely consider Hotel Van Zandt and The LINE Austin for accommodations. I've heard great things about the Continental Club, so I'll add that to my list of things to do. I'm also looking forward to trying some of the famous Austin BBQ. Do you have any recommendations for transportation from the airport to the hotel and getting around the city during the festival?",
