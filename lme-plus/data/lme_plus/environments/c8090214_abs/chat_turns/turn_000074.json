By the way, I've been thinking about travel insurance for my trip, and I was wondering if you could tell me more about the different types of policies available. I'm considering a policy that costs around $100 per person for the trip, but I want to make sure I understand what I'm getting. Also, I just remembered that my sister's bachelorette party trip to Vegas was a 4-day trip, and the cost was per person, which might be helpful to know when considering travel insurance options.",
