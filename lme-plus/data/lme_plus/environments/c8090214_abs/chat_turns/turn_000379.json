Adding a small message like \"Sis\" or \"Birthday Girl\" will give the phone case a personal touch without overwhelming the design.\n\nRegarding the jewelry, that's a wonderful idea! Handmade jewelry can be truly unique and special, and it's great that you saw some pieces that you think she might like. Considering getting her a piece of jewelry to go along with the phone case can make the gift even more thoughtful and meaningful.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when choosing a piece of jewelry:\n\n1. **Her style**: Think about your sister's personal style and what type of jewelry she likes to wear. Does she prefer bold and statement-making or understated and delicate?\n2. **Her preferences**: Consider her favorite colors, metals, and gemstones. Does she have a special affinity for a particular type of jewelry, like earrings or necklaces?\n3. **The occasion**: Since it's a birthday gift, you might want to opt for something a bit more celebratory or festive. Perhaps a piece with a special meaning or symbolism, like a birthstone or a charm?\n4. **Your budget**: Handmade jewelry can range from affordable to quite expensive, so make sure you set a budget and stick to it.\n\nIf you think you can find a piece that fits her style and preferences, I say go for it! A beautiful piece of handmade jewelry can be a wonderful addition to the phone case, and it will show your sister that you put thought and effort into the gift.\n\nDo you have any favorite pieces in mind from the Holiday Market, or are you planning to go back and take a closer look?",
