Congratulations on raising $120 for a great cause.\n\nI'd be delighted to help you come up with some more fundraising ideas for your upcoming charity event. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:\n\n1. **Charity Walk/Run**: Organize a charity walk or run where participants collect pledges for each mile completed. You can partner with a local park or recreation center to host the event.\n2. **Restaurant Fundraiser**: Reach out to a local restaurant to see if they'd be willing to host a fundraiser night. They can donate a percentage of sales from that evening to your charity.\n3. **Talent Show**: Host a talent show where participants can showcase their skills, and charge an admission fee. You can also offer concessions and raffle tickets.\n4. **Bingo Night**: Organize a bingo night with prizes donated by local businesses. Charge an entry fee and offer additional cards for sale.\n5. **Online Auction**: Host an online auction where people can bid on items donated by local businesses or individuals. You can use social media platforms or online auction sites to host the event.\n6. **Car Wash**: Organize a car wash event where volunteers can wash cars for a donation.
