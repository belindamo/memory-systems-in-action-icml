  "content": "Using garlic powder as a seasoning is a great idea, and adding onions and bell peppers will definitely give your sauce more flavor and texture. Here are some tips to consider when adding these ingredients:\n\n**Garlic powder**: When using garlic powder, start with a small amount (about 1/2 teaspoon) and adjust to taste. Garlic powder can be quite strong, so it's better to err on the side of caution. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess garlic flavor from the sauce.\n\n**Onions**: As I mentioned earlier, caramelizing the onions will bring out their natural sweetness and add depth to your sauce. Make sure to cook them slowly over medium-low heat for about 45 minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally, until they're dark golden brown and caramelized.\n\n**Bell peppers**: Bell peppers add a sweet, slightly crunchy texture to the sauce. You can use any color bell pepper you like, but red bell peppers will give your sauce a slightly sweeter flavor. Dice the bell peppers and saut\u00e9 them with the onions and garlic powder until they're tender.\n\n**Other ingredients**: Consider adding other aromatics like diced carrots, celery, or mushrooms to the sauce for added flavor and texture. You can also add a splash of red wine, beef broth, or tomato paste to enhance the flavor.\n\n**Acidity balance**: With the addition of onions and bell peppers, your sauce may become slightly sweeter. To balance the acidity, you can add a splash of red wine or a pinch of baking soda (about 1/4 teaspoon).\n\nHere's an updated recipe to get you started:\n\n**Garlic Powder Tomato Sauce Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 large onion, diced\n* 2 large bell peppers, diced\n* 3-4 garlic cloves, minced (or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder)\n* 2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes (or 1 can of crushed tomatoes)\n* 1 can of diced tomatoes\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1 teaspoon dried basil\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Optional: red wine, beef broth, tomato paste, or other aromatics\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n6.
