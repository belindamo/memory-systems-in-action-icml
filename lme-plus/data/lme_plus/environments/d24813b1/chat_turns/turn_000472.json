Adding relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation can be a great way to enhance your routine and help you wind down, especially on Sundays when anxiety might be higher.\n\nHere's how you can incorporate these techniques into your routine:\n\n**Deep Breathing:**\n\n1. Find a comfortable position in bed, either sitting up or lying down.\n2. Close your eyes and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Hold the breath for a count of 4.\n3. Slowly exhale through your mouth, emptying your lungs completely. Hold the exhale for a count of 4.\n4. Repeat this process for 5-10 minutes, focusing on your breath and letting go of any thoughts or worries.\n\n**Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**\n\n1. Start by finding a comfortable position in bed, either sitting up or lying down.\n2. Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and moving up to your head.\n3. For each muscle group, tense the muscles for a count of 5, and then release and feel the relaxation spread through your body.\n4. Move through the following muscle groups:\n\t* Toes and feet\n\t* Ankles and calves\n\t* Knees\n\t* Thighs\n\t* Hips and lower back\n\t* Upper back and shoulders\n\t* Arms and hands\n\t* Neck and head\n5. Take slow, deep breaths throughout the exercise, focusing on the sensation of relaxation spreading through your body.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Start with short sessions (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase as you become more comfortable with the techniques.\n* Focus on your breath and the physical sensations in your body, rather than your thoughts or worries.\n* Try to let go of any tension or anxiety as you exhale, imagining it leaving your body with each breath.\n* Make sure to turn off any electronic devices and dim the lights to create a peaceful environment.\n\nBy incorporating these relaxation techniques into your bedtime routine, you can help calm your mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep and prepare for a restful night's sleep, even on Sundays.\n\nRemember, consistency is key, so try to stick to your routine as much as possible, even on weekends or days off. Good luck, and I hope you find these techniques helpful in managing your Sunday anxiety!",
