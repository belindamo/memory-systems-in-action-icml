Here are a few factors to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Focal length**: A focal length between 50mm and 135mm is often ideal for portraits, as it provides a flattering perspective and compression.\n2. **Aperture**: A wide aperture (like f/1.4 or f/1.8) will help create a shallow depth of field, separating your subject from the background and adding a professional look to your portraits.\n3. **Image quality**: Look for lenses with high optical quality, minimal distortion, and good bokeh (out-of-focus area) rendering.\n\nBased on these factors, here are some prime lens recommendations for portraits:\n\n1. **Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM**: A budget-friendly, compact, and lightweight lens with a wide aperture and great image quality.\n2. **Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM**: A classic portrait lens with a medium telephoto focal length, wide aperture, and excellent image quality.\n3. **Sigma 50mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art**: A high-end lens with exceptional image quality, a wide aperture, and a robust build.\n4. **Tamron 45mm f/1.8 Di VC USD**: A versatile lens with a unique focal length, wide aperture, and image stabilization.\n\nAll of these lenses are compatible with your Canon EOS 80D camera. You can check reviews, compare prices, and read more about each lens on B&H Photo's website or other online retailers.\n\nWhich one of these lenses catches your attention, or do you have any specific preferences (e.g., budget, size, weight)?",
