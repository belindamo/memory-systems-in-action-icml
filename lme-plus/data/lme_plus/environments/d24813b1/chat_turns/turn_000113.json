As a conversational AI, I don't have the ability to retain information about your past visits or interactions with the sports bar. Our conversation just started, and I don't have any knowledge about your previous experiences or preferences.\n\nHowever, it's definitely worth asking the sports bar about any deals or promotions they might have on their buffalo wings during the game. They might have some special offers or discounts available, especially if they're a popular item on their menu.\n\nWhen you call the sports bar, you can ask them directly about any deals on buffalo wings or other menu items. They'll be able to give you the most up-to-date information about their current promotions and offerings.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and they'll have a special deal on buffalo wings just for Bucks fans!",
