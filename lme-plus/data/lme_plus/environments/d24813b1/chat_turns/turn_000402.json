Here's a recipe that's sure to impress:\n\n**Chocolate Cake:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the cake:\n\n* 2 \u00be cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 \u00bd cups granulated sugar\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n* 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature\n* 2 large eggs, at room temperature\n* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease two 9-inch (23cm) round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n3. In a large mixing bowl, combine cocoa powder and milk. Stir until smooth.\n4. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Whisk in the vanilla extract.\n5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture, whisking until smooth.\n6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops.\n7. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n**Caramel Ganache Frosting:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the ganache:\n\n* 1 cup (200g) heavy cream\n* 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar\n* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n* 1 teaspoon sea salt\n* 1 cup (250g) dark chocolate chips (at least 60% cocoa)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a small saucepan, combine the heavy cream, sugar, and butter. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved.\n2. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the caramel turns a deep amber color.\n3. Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly pour in the chocolate chips. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes, then stir the mixture until the chocolate is melted and smooth.\n4. Let the ganache cool to room temperature, then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n\n**Assembly:**\n\n1. Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate or cake stand.\n2. Spread a layer of caramel ganache frosting on top of the cake.\n3. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the entire cake with the remaining ganache.\n\nTips:\n\n* To ensure the cake is moist, make sure to not overmix the batter.\n* For a more intense caramel flavor, cook the sugar mixture to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) on a candy thermometer.\n* If the ganache is too thick, you can reheat it in the microwave in 10-second increments, stirring between each interval, until it reaches the desired consistency.\n\nEnjoy your delicious chocolate cake with caramel ganache frosting!",
