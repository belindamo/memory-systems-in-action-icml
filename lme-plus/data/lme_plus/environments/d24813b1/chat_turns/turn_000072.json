  "content": "I find that listening to audiobooks and reading e-books have their own strengths. With audiobooks, I can multitask and get a feel for the overall story or concept, but sometimes I miss out on details. With e-books, I can absorb more details and nuances, but it requires more focused attention. \n\nAs for notes, I usually jot down quotes that resonate with me, interesting ideas, or questions that come to mind. Sometimes I'll even summarize key points or takeaways from a chapter. It helps me reflect on what I've learned and retain the information better.",
