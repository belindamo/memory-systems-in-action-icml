  "content": "I think I'll go with a mix of soft, plush throw pillows in different textures and patterns, and a few statement pillows with bold designs. For blankets, I'll choose a few soft, cozy ones in different materials and weights, like fleece, Sherpa, and cable knit. I'll also add a few throw blankets in different colors and textures to switch out depending on my mood and the season. Thanks for the tips!",
