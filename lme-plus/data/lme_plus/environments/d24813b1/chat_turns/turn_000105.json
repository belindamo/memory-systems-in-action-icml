Calling the sports bar directly is the best way to get the most up-to-date and accurate information.\n\nAs for special deals, it's definitely possible that they might have some promotions or discounts on food and drinks during the game. Many sports bars offer special deals or discounts on game days to attract more customers and create a lively atmosphere.\n\nSome common deals you might find include:\n\n* Happy hour specials on drinks or appetizers\n* Discounted prices on certain menu items, like burgers or wings\n* Combo deals that include food and drinks\n* \"Game-day specials\" on specific menu items or drinks\n* Loyalty rewards or discounts for frequent customers\n\nWhen you call the sports bar, be sure to ask about any deals or promotions they might be offering during the game.
