Based on what you've shared, here are some observations and suggestions:\n\n**Income:** Your annual salary of $70,000 is a good foundation for building a solid financial foundation.\n\n**Fixed Expenses:** Your fixed monthly expenses of $2,500 seem reasonable, but it's essential to review each item to ensure you're not overspending in any area. Consider creating a budget that accounts for every dollar to ensure you're making the most of your income.\n\n**Credit Card Debt:** The 20% interest rate on your credit card debt is alarmingly high. It's crucial to tackle this debt aggressively to avoid paying more interest over time. The minimum payment approach can lead to a longer payoff period and more interest paid.\n\n**401(k) Contributions:** Contributing 10% of your salary to your 401(k) is a great start, but you might consider increasing this amount over time to take advantage of compound interest.\n\n**Emergency Fund:** Not having an emergency fund in place can make it challenging to cover unexpected expenses, which might lead to further debt. Aim to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n1. **Pay off credit card debt:** Consider the debt avalanche method, where you focus on paying off the credit card debt with the highest interest rate (20% in your case) first. You can try to negotiate with your credit card company to lower the interest rate or consider a balance transfer to a lower-interest credit card.\n2. **Build an emergency fund:** Allocate a specific amount each month to build an emergency fund. You can start with a smaller goal, like saving $1,000, and then increase the target as you make progress.\n3. **Save for a down payment on a house:** This is a great long-term goal. You can start by researching the costs associated with buying a house, such as down payment, closing costs, and ongoing expenses like mortgage payments, property taxes, and insurance.\n\nTo get started, let's create a plan to tackle your credit card debt and build an emergency fund. Here's a possible strategy:\n\n1. Increase your income: Explore ways to boost your income, such as taking on a side hustle, asking for a raise, or pursuing additional education/training to enhance your earning potential.\n2. Decrease expenses: Review your fixed expenses and see where you can cut back on non-essential items. Consider ways to reduce your rent, utilities, or car insurance costs.\n3. Allocate debt repayment: Commit to paying more than the minimum payment on your credit card debt each month. You can try the 50/30/20 rule: 50% of your income goes towards fixed expenses, 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards saving and debt repayment.\n4. Build an emergency fund: Allocate a specific amount each month to build an emergency fund. You can start with a small goal, like saving $500, and increase the target as you make progress.\n\nHere's an example of how you could allocate your income:\n\n* Fixed expenses: $2,500 (36% of your income)\n* Debt repayment: $1,000 (14% of your income)\n* Emergency fund: $500 (7% of your income)\n* Discretionary spending: $1,500 (21% of your income)\n* Savings and investments: $1,000 (14% of your income)\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point, and you can adjust the proportions based on your priorities and expenses.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a good starting point for you, or do you have any questions/concerns?",
