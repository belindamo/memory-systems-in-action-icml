  "content": "I apologize, but it's unlikely that Walmart offers a 20% off coupon for the entire bill on their website or weekly ad. Walmart's weekly ads typically feature sales and promotions on specific items, but they don't usually offer a blanket 20% off coupon for the entire purchase.\n\nIt's possible that you might have misunderstood or misread the coupon or promotion. Could you have accidentally added the discount amount to the original price instead of calculating the correct discount?\n\nIf you can provide more information about the coupon, such as the coupon code, the website or page where you found it, or a screenshot of the coupon, I might be able to help you clarify things.\n\nAdditionally, you can always check Walmart's website or contact their customer service to verify the coupon and its terms. They can help you understand how to use the coupon correctly and ensure you're getting the discount you're expecting.",
