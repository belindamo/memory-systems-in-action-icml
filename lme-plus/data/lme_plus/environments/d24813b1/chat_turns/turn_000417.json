  "content": "I'm making around 70,000 dollars a year. My fixed monthly expenses are around 2,500 dollars, which includes rent, utilities, car payment, insurance, and minimum credit card payments. I have a credit card balance of 5,000 dollars with a 20% interest rate, and I've been paying the minimum payment for a while now. I contribute 10% of my salary to my 401(k) each month. I don't have an emergency fund in place, and my short-term goal is to pay off the credit card debt and build an emergency fund. Long-term, I'm thinking about saving for a down payment on a house.",
