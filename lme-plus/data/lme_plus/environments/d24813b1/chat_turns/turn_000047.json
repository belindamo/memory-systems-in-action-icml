  "content": "You already have a Rokinon lens, the 14mm f/2.8 ED AS IF UMC, which is an excellent ultra-wide-angle lens for astrophotography and other specialized uses.\n\nFor everyday shooting, you're looking for a lens that's more versatile and can handle a variety of situations. Considering your experience with the Rokinon 14mm, you might appreciate a lens that's still wide-angle but not as extreme.\n\nGiven your budget of $300-$500, here are some options that might interest you:\n\n1. **Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary**: A compact and lightweight lens with a 24mm focal length, making it suitable for everyday shooting, landscapes, and street photography. ($299)\n2. **Canon EF 28mm f/2.8 IS USM**: A wide-angle lens with a 28mm focal length and image stabilization, making it ideal for handheld shooting in various lighting conditions. ($449)\n3. **Tamron 20mm f/2.8 Di III OSD M1:2**: A compact and lightweight lens with a 20mm focal length, featuring a wide aperture and a unique close-focusing capability (1:2 magnification). ($349)\n\nThese lenses are all compatible with your Canon EOS 80D camera and offer a more versatile focal length for everyday shooting. You might find that one of these options provides the perfect balance of width and portability for your needs.\n\nSince you've had a good experience with Rokinon, you might also consider their **Rokinon 21mm f/1.4 AS UMC** ($499), which is a wide-angle lens with a fast aperture and a unique perspective.\n\nWhich one of these lenses resonates with you, or would you like me to explore more options?",
