  "content": "I'd be happy to help you plan out your schedule for the week.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your work schedule and commitments? For example:\n\n* What are your working hours? Are you available to work flexible hours or do you have set times?\n* Do you have any fixed meetings or appointments that you need to schedule around?\n* What are your top priorities for the week? Are there any deadlines or tasks that you need to complete?\n* How many hours of work do you aim to complete each day?\n* Do you have any breaks or time off during the week?\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to know what you learned from last Monday's experience. What did you find challenging about having back-to-back meetings till 6 pm? Was it the lack of breaks, the amount of work you had to complete, or something else?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your schedule and priorities, I can help you plan out your tasks and schedule for the week to avoid overcommitting yourself again.",
