  "content": "That's great to hear! It's always exciting to try out new tools and techniques, and it sounds like your airbrush compressor is going to make a big difference in your work.\n\nApplying decals can be a bit nerve-wracking, but it sounds like you did a great job on the engine compartment and body. Decals can really add a lot of detail and realism to a model, and it's great that you're happy with how they turned out.\n\nWhat kind of decals did you use? Were they pre-made or did you create your own? And how did you find the application process? Was it straightforward or were there any challenges you had to overcome?\n\nAlso, now that you've got the decals applied, what's next on your agenda for the Ferrari project? Are you moving on to the paint job, or are there other details you want to focus on first?\n\nBy the way, have you considered adding any additional details to the engine compartment, such as wiring, hoses, or other engine components? Sometimes, adding those small details can really make the model pop and give it a more realistic look.",
