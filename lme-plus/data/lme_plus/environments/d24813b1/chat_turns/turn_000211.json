Here are some tips to improve your skills in identifying birds by their calls:\n\n**Tips for Learning Bird Calls:**\n\n1. **Start with Common Birds:** Begin with common bird species in your area, as you're more likely to hear them frequently. Focus on learning the calls of birds you see regularly.\n2. **Listen to Recordings:** Familiarize yourself with the sounds of different bird species by listening to recordings. You can find recordings online or through mobile apps like Merlin Bird ID, iBird Pro, or the Cornell Lab's All About Birds website.\n3. **Practice Active Listening:** When you're out birding, actively listen to the sounds around you.

Some birds have distinctive call patterns, such as the Whip-poor-will's three-syllable call or the Red-winged Blackbird's conk-la-ree.\n5. **Focus on One Species at a Time:** Master one species' call before moving on to the next. This will help you build confidence and reduce confusion.\n6. **Use Visual Aids:** Watch videos or animations that show the bird's beak and tongue movements while calling.
