I'd be happy to help you plan out your exercise schedule for the week.\n\nTo ensure you're getting enough rest days, it's generally recommended to have at least one or two rest days per week, depending on the intensity and frequency of your workouts. Here's a sample schedule for you:\n\n**Monday, January 9th**\n\n* Gym day! Focus on a full-body workout or a specific muscle group (e.g., chest and triceps).\n\n**Tuesday, January 10th**\n\n* Yoga day! Take a gentle flow class or focus on restorative yoga to stretch and recover from Monday's gym session.\n\n**Wednesday, January 11th**\n\n* Rest day Take a break and let your body recover. You can still engage in light activities like walking or stretching, but avoid any high-intensity exercises.\n\n**Thursday, January 12th**\n\n* Gym day! Focus on a different muscle group (e.g., back and biceps) or a cardio workout.\n\n**Friday, January 13th**\n\n* Yoga day! Try a more dynamic flow class or focus on core strength and flexibility.\n\n**Saturday, January 14th**\n\n* Rest day Enjoy your weekend and take a break from structured exercise. You can still engage in outdoor activities or light stretching.\n\n**Sunday, January 15th**\n\n* Gym day! Focus on legs and shoulders or a full-body workout.\n\n**Remember to listen to your body**: If you need an extra rest day or feel fatigued, don't hesitate to take an extra day off. It's essential to allow your body time to recover and rebuild muscle tissue.\n\nFeel free to adjust this schedule to fit your personal preferences, goals, and schedule. Make sure to also prioritize proper nutrition, hydration, and sleep to support your exercise routine.\n\nHow does this schedule look to you? Do you have any specific goals or preferences you'd like to incorporate?",
