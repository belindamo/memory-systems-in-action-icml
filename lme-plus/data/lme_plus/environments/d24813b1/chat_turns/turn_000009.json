  "content": "I apologize, but it's still unlikely that Walmart offered a 20% off coupon for the entire purchase on their website. Walmart's coupon policy is quite strict, and they rarely offer coupons for a percentage off the entire purchase.\n\nIt's possible that you might have misremembered or misinterpreted the coupon or promotion. Our memories can play tricks on us, and it's easy to get confused.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can try checking your email or the Walmart website to see if you can find any evidence of the coupon or promotion. You can also contact Walmart's customer service to ask about the coupon and see if they can provide any information.\n\nHowever, I want to reiterate that it's highly unlikely that Walmart offered a 20% off coupon for the entire purchase. If you're looking for discounts, I'd be happy to help you explore other options, such as cashback apps, digital coupons, or price matching policies.",
