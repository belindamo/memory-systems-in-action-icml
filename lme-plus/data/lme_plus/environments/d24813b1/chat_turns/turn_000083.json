  "content": "**Tofu Scramble Quantity:**\nA good starting point for the tofu scramble is to use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of scrambled tofu per serving. This will give you a nice creamy, egg-like texture without overpowering the dish. You can adjust the amount to your liking, but this should be a good starting point. Keep in mind that the tofu will absorb some of the sauce, so it's better to start with a slightly smaller amount and add more if needed.\n\n**Vegan Sour Cream or Yogurt for Cashew Cream:**\nYou can use a store-bought vegan sour cream or yogurt to enhance the flavor and texture of the cashew cream. Here are some popular brands you can consider:\n\n1. **Kite Hill**: Their vegan sour cream and yogurt are excellent choices, with a rich, creamy texture and neutral flavor.\n2. **So Delicious**: This brand offers a range of vegan sour creams and yogurts, including cashew-based and coconut-based options.\n3. **Tofutti**: Their vegan sour cream is a popular choice, with a creamy texture and mild flavor.\n4. **Follow Your Heart**: This brand offers a range of vegan sour creams and yogurts, including soy-based and coconut-based options.\n5. **Silk**: Their vegan sour cream and yogurt are made from soy and have a smooth, creamy texture.\n\nWhen using a store-bought vegan sour cream or yogurt, start with a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) and blend it with the cashews, lemon juice, and spices. This will help to create a creamy, tangy sauce. You can always add more if needed, but it's easier to start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to press and drain the tofu scramble well before adding it to the sauce, as excess moisture can make the sauce too thin.\n* If using a store-bought vegan sour cream or yogurt, choose an unflavored or neutral-tasting option to avoid affecting the overall flavor of the dish.\n* Don't over-blend the cashew cream, as it can become too thick and sticky. Stop blending when it reaches a smooth, creamy consistency.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance.",
