She might appreciate the opportunity to share stories and photos of her new grandson. Who knows, you might even get to see some adorable baby pictures!\n\nRemember, it's always exciting to celebrate new life and new relationships, whether it's a coworker's baby, a friend's adoption journey, or a neighbor's grandchild.
