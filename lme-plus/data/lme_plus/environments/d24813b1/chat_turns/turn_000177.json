Peer discussion boards or chat groups: The University of Virginia's Master of Education program uses online discussion boards to foster social learning in their literature courses. Students are encouraged to post their responses to readings and engage in discussions with their classmates.\n\n2. Group projects: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill offers an online course in American history that uses group projects to encourage collaboration and critical thinking. One project asks students to research a key figure in American history and create a multimedia presentation that showcases their contributions.\n\n3. Virtual study groups: The University of California, Irvine's online course on the Vietnam War offers a virtual study group feature that allows students to connect with each other and discuss course material outside of class.\n\n4. Social media groups: The University of Notre Dame has an online course on the Bible that encourages students to connect through social media groups. These groups allow students to share resources, discuss course material, and build a sense of community.\n\n5. Online debates: The University of Edinburgh offers an online course on Scottish history that uses online debates to encourage critical thinking and engagement.
