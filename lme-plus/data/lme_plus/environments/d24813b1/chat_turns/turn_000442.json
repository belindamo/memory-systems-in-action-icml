  "content": "A storage ottoman with a tray on top can be a fantastic option! It can provide both storage and a surface for your \"launching pad\" items. However, it's essential to consider a few factors to avoid making it look cluttered:\n\n1. **Size**: Make sure the ottoman is proportional to your coffee table and the space available. A large ottoman with a small tray on top might look overwhelming.\n2. **Tray size and design**: Choose a tray that's not too large or too small for the ottoman. A tray with a lip or a decorative edge can help contain items and add visual appeal.\n3. **Item selection**: Be mindful of what you place on the tray. Limit it to essential items that you need quick access to, such as remotes, coasters, and a few snacks. Avoid overcrowding the tray with too many items.\n4. **Balance**: Balance the look by leaving some negative space on the tray. This will create a visually appealing arrangement and prevent the ottoman from looking cluttered.\n5. **Style**: Consider the style of your living room and the ottoman. A modern, sleek ottoman with a simple tray might work well in a minimalist space, while a more ornate ottoman with a decorative tray could fit in with a traditional or bohemian-inspired room.\n\nIf you're concerned about the ottoman looking cluttered, you could also consider the following alternatives:\n\n* A storage ottoman with a lift-top or hinged top, allowing you to store items inside and keep the surface clear.\n* A storage cube or basket with a tray on top, providing a more compact solution.\n* A console table or console cabinet behind the sofa, which can offer additional storage and a surface for your \"launching pad\" items.\n\nUltimately, the key to avoiding clutter is to strike a balance between functionality and aesthetics. By choosing the right size, design, and items for your storage ottoman with a tray, you can create a stylish and practical solution for your coffee table organization.",
