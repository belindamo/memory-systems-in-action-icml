  "content": "If the discriminant of a polynomial equation is negative, it means that the equation has no real solutions and all the roots are complex numbers. This is the case for the cubic equation x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 that I used as an example.\n\nWhen the discriminant is negative, we can find the solutions of the equation using techniques such as the Cardano's method which can find the complex roots in the form of x = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1.\n\nIn general, for a polynomial equation of degree n, if the discriminant is negative, it will have n complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs.\n\nFor example, the discriminant of a quadratic equation (degree 2) like ax^2+bx+c=0 is given by the value of b^2 - 4ac. If it's negative, it will have two complex roots which are conjugates of each other.",
