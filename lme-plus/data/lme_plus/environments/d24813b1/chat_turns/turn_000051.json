  "content": "The autofocus performance of the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary is a great topic.\n\n**Comparison to Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM:**\nThe Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM is a great lens with a reputation for fast and accurate autofocus. The Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary's autofocus performance is similar, but not quite as fast or accurate as the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of the autofocus performance comparison:\n\n* Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM: Very fast and accurate autofocus, with a response time of around 0.1-0.2 seconds in good light.\n* Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary: Fast autofocus, but slightly slower than the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM, with a response time of around 0.2-0.3 seconds in good light.\n\nIn general, the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary's autofocus is still quite reliable and suitable for most photography situations. However, if you're used to the lightning-fast autofocus of the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM, you might notice a slight difference.\n\n**Autofocus Modes:**\nThe Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary supports both One-Shot AF (AF-S) and Continuous AF (AF-C) modes, as well as Manual Focus (MF) mode. The lens also features a focus limiter switch, which allows you to set the focus range to either 0.25m-0.5m or 0.5m-infinity, helping to speed up autofocus in certain situations.\n\n**Low-Light Performance:**\nIn low-light conditions, the autofocus performance of the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary might slow down slightly, but it's still capable of locking focus in most situations. However, if you're shooting in very dim light, you might need to use the camera's AF assist lamp or an external light source to help the lens focus.\n\nOverall, while the autofocus performance of the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary is not quite as fast as the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM, it's still a capable and reliable lens that can deliver great results in a variety of situations.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the autofocus performance or any other aspects of the Sigma 24mm f/2.8 DN Contemporary?",
