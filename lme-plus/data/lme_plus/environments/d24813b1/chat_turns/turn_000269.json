  "content": "The other root in the example equation x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 is a complex root. The cubic equation has 3 roots, but since the equation x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 does not have any real solutions for x^2, the discriminant of the equation is negative, which means the solutions will be complex. In the example I provided, the solutions were found by factoring the equation into the product of two linear factors (x - 1)(x + 2) = 0, and solving for the roots. Since a linear equation only has real solutions, the complex root is not shown in that way.\n\nAnother way to find the roots of a cubic equation is to use the Cardano's method. Cardano's method will give you the three roots of the equation, including the complex roots.\n\nIn this case, the other root will be a complex number, which can be represented in the form of x = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1. The two solutions provided in the previous example are real solutions, while the third one is a complex number.",
