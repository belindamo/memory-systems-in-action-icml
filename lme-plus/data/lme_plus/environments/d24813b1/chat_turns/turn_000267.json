  "content": "In the example I provided, the equation x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 was factored into (x - 1/2 + 3/2)(x - 1/2 - 3/2) = (x-1)(x+2) =0.\nThe factorization of the polynomial equation into the product of two factors (x - 1/2 + 3/2)(x - 1/2 - 3/2) = (x-1)(x+2) = 0 is done by setting each factor to zero, because a product is equal to zero if at least one factor is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two equations: x - 1 = 0 and x + 2 = 0.\n\nSolving each equation separately will give us two solutions x = 1 and x = -2. This means that x = 1 and x = -2 are the two solutions of the polynomial equation x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0.\n\nAlternatively, the polynomial equation of degree n has always n solutions, which can be real or complex numbers. In this case it's a cubic equation so it has three roots.",
