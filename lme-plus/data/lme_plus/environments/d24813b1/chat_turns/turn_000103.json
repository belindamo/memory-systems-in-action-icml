  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific sports bars or their promotions. But I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. Check the sports bar's website or social media pages: They might have a schedule of upcoming games and events, as well as promotions and deals listed.\n2. Call the sports bar directly: Give them a quick call to ask about the game time, promotions, and deals. They should be able to provide you with the most up-to-date information.\n3. Check online event listings: Websites like ESPN, NBA.com, or other sports websites might have the game schedule and start time listed.\n4. Ask your friends: If you have friends who have been to the sports bar recently, they might have some insider information about promotions or deals.\n\nAs for the buffalo wings, I'm glad to hear they're delicious! Enjoy the game and the wings with your friends!\n\nRemember to always plan ahead, arrive early, and be respectful of the sports bar's rules and other patrons. Have a great time!",
