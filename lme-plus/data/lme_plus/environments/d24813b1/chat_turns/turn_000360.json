I'm actually thinking of exploring more into the 1970s, since I already have some great finds like my limited edition pressing of Fleetwood Mac's \"Rumours\". I've heard great things about Led Zeppelin's \"IV\" and The Who's \"Who's Next\". Do you think it's worth checking out those albums, and are there any other essential 1970s records I should consider?",
