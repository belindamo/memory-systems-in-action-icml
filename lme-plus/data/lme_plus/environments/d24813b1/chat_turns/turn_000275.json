  "content": "In mathematics, a conjugate of a complex number is the number obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the number while keeping the real part unchanged. For example, the conjugate of a complex number z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, is the number z\\* = a - bi. The conjugate of a complex number is also referred to as the \"complex conjugate\" of the number.\n\nIn the context of polynomial equations, if the discriminant is negative, it means that the roots of the equation are complex numbers, and they come in conjugate pairs.\nFor example, if a complex number z = a + bi is a root of the equation, then its conjugate z\\* = a - bi is also a root of the equation.\n\nFor example, if the equation is a quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0, and the discriminant (b^2-4ac) is negative, then the roots of the equation are two complex numbers that are conjugates of each other.\n\nFor a polynomial equation of degree n, if the discriminant is negative, it will have n complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs. The conjugates of a complex number have the same magnitude but opposite signs in the imaginary part.",
