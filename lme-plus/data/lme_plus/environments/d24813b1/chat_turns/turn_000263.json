  "content": "Here is an example of how to use Cardano's method to solve the cubic equation x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0:\n\n1. Start by putting the equation in standard form by moving all the terms to one side of the equation: x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 becomes x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x = 1\n2. Next, complete the square by adding and subtracting the square of half of the coefficient of x^2: (x - (3/2))^2 - (9/4) + 2x = 1\n3. Now, we can factor the left side of the equation: (x - (3/2))^2 = x^2 - 3x + 9/4 + 2x = x^2 - x + 9/4 = (x - 1/2)^2 + 9/4 = (x - 1/2 + 3/2)(x - 1/2 - 3/2)\n4. Next, we will use the factored form of the equation to find the solutions:\n* x - 1/2 + 3/2 = x = 1 is one solution,\n* x - 1/2 - 3/2 = x = -2 is another solution.\n\nBy solving the equations we have x = 1 and x = -2 as solutions of the cubic equation x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0.",
