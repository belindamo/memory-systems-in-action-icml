Checking weekly ads and using coupons to maximize your savings is a great strategy!\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that Walmart doesn't typically offer 20% off coupons for the entire bill. They do offer various discounts and promotions, but a 20% off coupon for the total bill is not a common offer.\n\nIt's possible that you might have used a different type of coupon or discount, such as:\n\n1. **Category-specific coupons**: Walmart often offers coupons for specific product categories, like 20% off household essentials or 10% off pet food.\n2. **Item-specific coupons**: They might offer coupons for specific products, like $1 off a particular brand of coffee or $5 off a certain type of laundry detergent.\n3. **Digital coupons**: Walmart has a digital coupon program that allows you to load coupons onto your loyalty card or mobile app. These coupons can be used at checkout.\n4. **Cashback apps**: As I mentioned earlier, cashback apps like Ibotta or Fetch Rewards offer rebates on certain items or categories.\n\nIf you could provide more details about the coupon you used, I might be able to help you better.",
