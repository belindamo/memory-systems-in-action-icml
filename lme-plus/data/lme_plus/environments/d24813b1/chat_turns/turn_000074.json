It's been working really well for me so far! As for audiobooks, I've been using the Audible app, which also has a feature to bookmark and add notes to specific parts of the audiobook.\n\nI've been thinking of exploring other book tracking or reading log apps, though. Do you have any recommendations? I'd love to find something that can help me stay organized and motivated with my reading goals.",
