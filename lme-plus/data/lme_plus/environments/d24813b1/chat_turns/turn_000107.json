  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! As a sports bar, they'll likely have multiple TVs showing the game, but they won't have TVs with a direct view of the court. The court is actually located at the Fiserv Forum, which is the home arena of the Milwaukee Bucks, and it's not possible for a sports bar to have a live view of the court.\n\nHowever, sports bars usually have multiple TVs strategically placed around the venue to ensure that every seat has a good view of the game. They'll likely have the game broadcast on multiple screens, so you and your friends should be able to get a good view of Giannis and the Bucks in action!\n\nWhen you call the sports bar, you can ask about the TV layout and seating arrangements to get a better idea of what to expect. They might also have certain areas or sections that are designated for big games or have a more lively atmosphere.\n\nRemember to also ask about their sound system and audio setup, as some sports bars might have a more immersive experience with surround sound or loudspeakers. This can really add to the excitement of watching the game with your friends!",
