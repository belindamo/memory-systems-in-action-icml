I already have a team lunch scheduled for this Thursday, and I'm planning to dedicate this Friday to admin tasks like budgeting and invoicing. As for priorities, I have a few projects that I need to make progress on, but I don't have any urgent deadlines this week. I'm hoping to get at least 7 hours of work done each day. Last Monday was tough because I didn't have any breaks and was feeling exhausted by the end of it, so I'd like to avoid that this week.",
