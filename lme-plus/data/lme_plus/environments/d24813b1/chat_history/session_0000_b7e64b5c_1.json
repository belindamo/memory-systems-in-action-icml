      "content": "Bed Bath & Beyond's price matching policy is quite generous, and it's not limited to just home goods stores. According to their official website, they'll match prices from a wide range of retailers, including:\n\n* Online retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target\n* Local competitors' brick-and-mortar stores\n* Bed Bath & Beyond's own online prices\n\nTo qualify for a price match, the item must be identical, including the brand, model number, and features. You'll need to provide proof of the lower price, such as a printed ad, a digital ad on a mobile device, or a website URL.\n\nHere are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Price match is only for in-stock items**: If the item is out of stock at the competitor's store or website, Bed Bath & Beyond won't match the price.\n2. **Online prices must be from authorized retailers**: Bed Bath & Beyond won't match prices from third-party sellers or marketplaces like eBay or Craigslist.\n3. **Exclusions apply**: Some items, like special orders, clearance items, or those with prices that are lower due to a pricing error, are excluded from price matching.\n4. **Price match is available at time of purchase**: You need to request a price match at the time of purchase, not after the sale.\n\nSo, if you find a lower price on an identical item at Walmart or any other eligible retailer, Bed Bath & Beyond should match that price. Just make sure to review their price matching policy and follow the necessary steps to request a price match.\n\nNow, go ahead and shop with confidence, knowing you can get the best price at Bed Bath & Beyond!"

      "content": "You're a savvy shopper, aren't you? Checking weekly ads and using coupons to maximize your savings is a great strategy!\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that Walmart doesn't typically offer 20% off coupons for the entire bill. They do offer various discounts and promotions, but a 20% off coupon for the total bill is not a common offer.\n\nIt's possible that you might have used a different type of coupon or discount, such as:\n\n1. **Category-specific coupons**: Walmart often offers coupons for specific product categories, like 20% off household essentials or 10% off pet food.\n2. **Item-specific coupons**: They might offer coupons for specific products, like $1 off a particular brand of coffee or $5 off a certain type of laundry detergent.\n3. **Digital coupons**: Walmart has a digital coupon program that allows you to load coupons onto your loyalty card or mobile app. These coupons can be used at checkout.\n4. **Cashback apps**: As I mentioned earlier, cashback apps like Ibotta or Fetch Rewards offer rebates on certain items or categories.\n\nIf you could provide more details about the coupon you used, I might be able to help you better."

      "content": "I apologize, but it's unlikely that Walmart offers a 20% off coupon for the entire bill on their website or weekly ad. Walmart's weekly ads typically feature sales and promotions on specific items, but they don't usually offer a blanket 20% off coupon for the entire purchase.\n\nIt's possible that you might have misunderstood or misread the coupon or promotion. Could you have accidentally added the discount amount to the original price instead of calculating the correct discount?\n\nIf you can provide more information about the coupon, such as the coupon code, the website or page where you found it, or a screenshot of the coupon, I might be able to help you clarify things.\n\nAdditionally, you can always check Walmart's website or contact their customer service to verify the coupon and its terms. They can help you understand how to use the coupon correctly and ensure you're getting the discount you're expecting."

      "content": "I apologize, but it's still unlikely that Walmart offered a 20% off coupon for the entire purchase on their website. Walmart's coupon policy is quite strict, and they rarely offer coupons for a percentage off the entire purchase.\n\nIt's possible that you might have misremembered or misinterpreted the coupon or promotion. Our memories can play tricks on us, and it's easy to get confused.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can try checking your email or the Walmart website to see if you can find any evidence of the coupon or promotion. You can also contact Walmart's customer service to ask about the coupon and see if they can provide any information.\n\nHowever, I want to reiterate that it's highly unlikely that Walmart offered a 20% off coupon for the entire purchase. If you're looking for discounts, I'd be happy to help you explore other options, such as cashback apps, digital coupons, or price matching policies."
