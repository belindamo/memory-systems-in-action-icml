  "content": "If someone owns a physical collectible card and generates an NFT to represent it, but then sells the NFT without transferring the physical card, it could potentially lead to confusion or disputes about ownership of the card.\n\nFor example, if someone buys an NFT representing a collectible card, they may expect to receive the physical card as well, or at least have some way to verify that they are the legitimate owner of the card. If the seller has sold the NFT without transferring the physical card, it could be difficult for the buyer to prove that they are the rightful owner of the card.\n\nTo avoid confusion or disputes, it is generally a good idea to clearly communicate the terms of the sale and to ensure that the physical card and the NFT are transferred together. This can help to establish clear ownership of the collectible and prevent any misunderstandings.",
