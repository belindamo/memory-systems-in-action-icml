There are several companies that offer tours, so you can choose the one that best fits your interests and schedule. Some tours even include stops at other historical sites like the Oostpoort, the last surviving medieval gate of Delft, which can be a great addition to your city tour. Enjoy your boat tour and have a great time exploring the canals of Delft!",
