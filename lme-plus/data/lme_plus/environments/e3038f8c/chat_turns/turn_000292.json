  "content": "To configure RADIUS on your Mikrotik router, you will need to complete the following steps:\n\n1. In the Mikrotik router's web interface, go to the \"Pools\" menu and create a new RADIUS server by specifying the IP address and port of the RADIUS server.\n2. Go to the \"Users\" menu and create new users or import them from a CSV file. Each user will need a unique username and password, which will be used to authenticate to the RADIUS server.\n3. Go to the \"Access\" menu and create a new RADIUS client by specifying the IP address of the Mikrotik router and a shared secret. The shared secret is a password that is used to encrypt the communication between the Mikrotik router and the RADIUS server.\n4. Go to the \"Ppp\" menu, and then to the \"Secrets\" tab, and create new PPP secrets. PPP secrets are used to authenticate the VPN clients that connect to the Mikrotik router. You will need to specify a username and password for each client, as well as the RADIUS server that the client will use for authentication.\n5. Go to the \"IP\" menu, then to the \"Firewall\" and create a new firewall rule that allows incoming VPN connections. You will need to specify the protocol (usually \"tcp\" or \"udp\"), the port number (usually 1701, 1723, or 500), and the IP addresses of the VPN clients that are allowed to connect.\n6. Go to the \"IP\" menu, then to the \"Services\" and enable the L2TP server.\n7. Verify that the RADIUS server is properly configured by running a test using the \"radius\" command in the Mikrotik router's terminal.\n\nIt's recommended to make sure that the RADIUS server is reachable from the Mikrotik router and also check the logs in the Mikrotik router and the RADIUS server for any errors.",
