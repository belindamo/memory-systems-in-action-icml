  "content": "Using manual focus mode can be a great way to take control of your focus, especially if you're having issues with autofocus.\n\nGiven your setup and the issues you're experiencing, here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. **Check your focus magnification**: When using manual focus, it's essential to zoom in on the subject's eyes to ensure they're sharp. On your Nikon D5600, you can press the \"Playback\" button and then use the \"Zoom in\" button to magnify the focus area. This will help you accurately focus on the eyes.\n2. **Use the \"focus peaking\" feature**: The D5600 has a \"Peaking\" feature that highlights areas in focus. You can enable this feature by going to the Shooting Menu and selecting \"Peaking.\" This will give you a visual cue to help you achieve accurate focus.\n3. **Use the \"Live View\" mode**: Switching to Live View mode can help you focus more accurately, especially in a studio setting. This mode allows you to see the actual image on the camera's LCD screen, making it easier to focus on the subject's eyes.\n4. **Check your aperture settings**: While a shallow depth of field can be great for portraits, it can also make it more challenging to get the subject's eyes sharp. Try experimenting with slightly higher f-stops (e.g., f/2.8 or f/3.2) to ensure the eyes are within the depth of field.\n5. **Pay attention to your subject's distance**: Make sure your subject is at a comfortable distance from the camera. If they're too close, it can be difficult to get the eyes sharp. Try maintaining a distance of around 6-8 feet (1.8-2.4 meters) to ensure a more comfortable working distance.\n6. **Use a remote shutter release or the camera's self-timer**: Even with manual focus, camera shake can occur when you press the shutter button. Consider using a remote shutter release or the camera's self-timer to minimize camera movement and ensure a sharper image.\n7. **Check your lens calibration**: Although you mentioned you're using a new 50mm prime lens, it's still possible that there might be some calibration issues. Try checking the lens calibration using the camera's built-in focus adjustment feature or by sending the lens to Nikon for calibration.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you should see an improvement in your focus accuracy, especially when it comes to getting the subject's eyes sharp.\n\nDo you have any other questions or would you like more specific guidance on any of these points?",
