However, according to data from Ofcom's \"Digital Radio Report 2021\", there is a higher percentage of households that use Freeview in rural areas compared to urban areas. This may be due to a lack of other TV service options available in rural areas, leading residents to rely on Freeview's free-to-air service. However, it's important to note that the report focuses on digital radio usage and not TV usage specifically.",
