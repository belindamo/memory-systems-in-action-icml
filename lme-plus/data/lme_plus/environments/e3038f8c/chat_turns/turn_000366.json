  "content": "A private garden picnic is a wonderful way to propose to Mike, and I'm sure he'll be surprised and delighted by the intimate setting.\n\nTo get Mike to the picnic without suspecting anything, you'll need to come up with a convincing plan. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Casual Invitation**: Invite Mike to a casual picnic or afternoon in the garden, without giving away the surprise. You could say something like, \"Hey, I was thinking of packing a picnic lunch and heading to the garden this weekend. Want to join me?\"\n2. **Fake Plans**: Create a fake plan or errand that Mike needs to accompany you to, and then \"accidentally\" end up at the garden. For example, you could say, \"I need to pick up some flowers for my mom's birthday, and I heard this garden has the most beautiful blooms. Want to come with me?\"\n3. **Scavenger Hunt**: Plan a scavenger hunt that leads Mike to the garden, without giving away the surprise. You could create a series of clues or challenges that ultimately lead him to the picnic spot.\n4. **Photography Session**: Tell Mike you've hired a photographer to take some casual photos of the two of you in a garden setting, and that you want to make it a special afternoon. This way, he'll be expecting a photo shoot, but not a proposal!\n5. **Family Outing**: Invite Mike to a family outing or gathering at the garden, and make it seem like a casual get-together. You could say, \"My parents are meeting us at the garden for a picnic, and we can catch up with them for a bit.\"\n\nRemember to keep the plan simple and believable, and make sure you have a solid alibi in case Mike starts to suspect anything.\n\nOnce you have a plan in place, make sure to coordinate with your parents and any other involved parties to ensure everything goes smoothly. And don't forget to enjoy the moment \u2013 it's a special day, and you'll want to cherish the memory forever!\n\nHow do these ideas sound? Do you have any other plans in mind to get Mike to the picnic without suspecting anything?",
