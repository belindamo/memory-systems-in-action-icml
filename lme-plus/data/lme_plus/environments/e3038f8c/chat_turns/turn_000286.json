  "content": "Most of the companies that produce collectibles, such as Topps, Funko, Hasbro, Upper Deck, LEGO, and Hot Wheels, actively create new collectibles on a regular basis. This can include new lines of sports cards, entertainment cards, figurines, toy building sets, toy cars, and other novelty items. These companies often release new collectibles to coincide with major events or to capitalize on current trends or popular franchises.\n\nIn addition to creating new collectibles, these companies may also engage in trading of older collectibles. This can involve buying and selling older collectibles through retail channels, online marketplaces, or other channels. However, the focus of these companies is typically on producing and selling new collectibles, rather than trading older ones.",
