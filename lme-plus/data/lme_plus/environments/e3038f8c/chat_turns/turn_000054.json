  "content": "To become a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a student must first attend a college or university that has a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. The student must then meet the chapter's eligibility requirements which vary depending on the institution, but usually include a minimum GPA and completion of a certain number of courses in humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. \n\nOnce a student meets the eligibility requirements and completes the application process, the chapter will review the application and decide whether to extend an invitation for membership. \n\nOverall, becoming a member of Phi Beta Kappa is certainly challenging, as the eligibility requirements are rigorous and the invitation process is selective. However, it is not impossible and is certainly attainable with dedication and hard work.",
