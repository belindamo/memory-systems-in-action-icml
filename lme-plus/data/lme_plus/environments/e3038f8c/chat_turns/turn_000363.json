  "content": "I think a private garden would be perfect for the proposal. It's intimate and romantic, and we can arrange for a private tour or picnic to make it even more special. Since I helped my cousin with her wedding preparations, I have a better idea of what goes into planning a special day. Speaking of which, I was thinking of involving my parents in the proposal, since they've been a great example of a loving relationship for me. They celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary last month, and I'd love to make this proposal even more meaningful by having them there.",
