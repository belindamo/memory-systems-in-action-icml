However, I have to reiterate that I couldn't find any information about an author named Sarah Jones who has written a novel called \"The Lost City\". It's possible that the event was private or local, or the book hasn't been widely released yet.\n\nThat being said, I'd be happy to suggest some authors who write genre-bending fiction that combines elements of literary fiction and adventure. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. Michael Chabon - Known for his lyrical prose and genre-bending novels, Chabon's works often blend elements of literary fiction, adventure, and fantasy. Try \"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\" or \"The Yiddish Policemen's Union\".\n2. Laura Esquivel - This Mexican author is famous for her magical realist novel \"Like Water for Chocolate\", which combines elements of romance, adventure, and fantasy. Her writing is lyrical and evocative, and she often explores themes of identity, culture, and history.\n3. Gabriel Garcia Marquez - A master of magical realism, Garcia Marquez's works often blend elements of literary fiction, adventure, and fantasy. Try \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" or \"Love in the Time of Cholera\".\n4. Salman Rushdie - Rushdie's novels often combine elements of literary fiction, adventure, and fantasy, with a focus on exploring cultural identity, history, and politics. Try \"Midnight's Children\" or \"The Satanic Verses\".\n5. Isabel Allende - This Chilean author is known for her epic novels that combine elements of literary fiction, adventure, and romance. Try \"The House of the Spirits\" or \"City of the Beasts\".\n6. Neil Gaiman - While often classified as a fantasy author, Gaiman's works often blend elements of literary fiction, adventure, and mythology. Try \"American Gods\" or \"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\".\n7. Alice Hoffman - Hoffman's novels often combine elements of literary fiction, adventure, and magical realism, with a focus on exploring themes of identity, love, and family. Try \"Practical Magic\" or \"The Dovekeepers\".\n\nThese authors are just a few examples of writers who have successfully blended elements of literary fiction and adventure in their works. I hope you find something that resonates with you!",
