Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona. The show premiered on Disney+ in June 2022.\n\nKamala Khan is a 16-year-old Pakistani-American high school student from Jersey City who becomes a superhero. She's a huge fan of the Avengers, particularly Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers), and writes fan fiction about her. Kamala's life changes when she discovers she has Inhuman genes, which grant her superhuman abilities.\n\nThe series explores Kamala's journey as she navigates her identity, family, and friendships while learning to control her powers. It's a heartwarming and action-packed coming-of-age story that celebrates diversity, representation, and the power of fandom.\n\nMs. Marvel is connected to the MCU, and the show's events will likely have implications for the larger universe. In fact, Kamala Khan is set to appear in the upcoming movie **The Marvels** (2023), which is a sequel to Captain Marvel. Brie Larson will reprise her role as Carol Danvers, and Iman Vellani will play Kamala Khan.\n\n**She-Hulk**\n\nShe-Hulk is a live-action series based on the Marvel Comics character Jennifer Walters, created by Stan Lee and John Buscema. The show is currently in production and is expected to premiere on Disney+ in 2022.\n\nJennifer Walters is a lawyer and the cousin of Bruce Banner (the Incredible Hulk). After receiving a blood transfusion from Bruce, Jennifer gains Hulk-like abilities, including superhuman strength and agility. However, she retains her intelligence and personality, making her a unique and powerful hero.\n\nThe series will follow Jennifer as she navigates her new life as a superhero, lawyer, and single woman in her 30s. It's described as a comedy-drama that explores themes of identity, family, and female empowerment.\n\nShe-Hulk is also connected to the MCU, and the show will likely feature connections to other Marvel characters and events. Mark Ruffalo is set to reprise his role as Bruce Banner in the series, and Tatiana Maslany will play Jennifer Walters.\n\nBoth Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk offer fresh perspectives on the superhero genre, with a focus on diverse characters, representation, and relatable themes.
