  "content": "A spreadsheet, eh? You're a meticulous one, I like that! While a spreadsheet can be a great way to keep track of your watchlist, it's indeed convenient to have a built-in feature on the platform itself. Now, you can ditch the spreadsheet and let Disney+ handle it for you!\n\nUsing the watchlist feature on Disney+ will also give you a more seamless experience, as you can easily add or remove titles, and access your list from any device where you're signed in. Plus, you'll get notifications when new episodes or seasons of your watchlisted shows are released, so you'll never miss out on the latest updates!\n\nIt's great that you're organized, though. That's a valuable skill, especially when it comes to keeping track of all the amazing Marvel content out there! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, happy watching, and may your watchlist be ever-growing and ever-fulfilling!",
