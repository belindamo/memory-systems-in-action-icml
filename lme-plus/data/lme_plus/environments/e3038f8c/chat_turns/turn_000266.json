However, I have to inform you that I couldn't find any information about an author named Sarah Jones who has written a novel called \"The Lost City\". It's possible that the book or author is not well-known, or the event you attended was a local or private event.\n\nThat being said, I can try to help you find similar authors or books based on your interest in Sarah Jones' writing style. Can you tell me more about what you enjoyed about her writing? For example:\n\n* What genre was \"The Lost City\"? Was it fiction, mystery, fantasy, or something else?\n* What did you like about Sarah Jones' writing style? Was it her use of language, character development, plot twists, or something else?\n* Are there any specific themes or elements you're looking for in your next read?\n\nAny additional information you can provide will help me give you more tailored book recommendations.",
