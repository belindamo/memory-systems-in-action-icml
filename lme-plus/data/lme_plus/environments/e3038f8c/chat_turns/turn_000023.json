  "content": "Quantitative statistical analysis refers to the use of mathematical and statistical methods to analyze numerical data. In Python, there are several libraries that can be used for quantitative statistical analysis, including NumPy, pandas, and scipy.\n\nHere is an example of how to perform a simple quantitative statistical analysis using Python:\n\nSuppose we have a dataset of exam scores for a class of students, and we want to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the scores. We can start by importing the necessary libraries:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n```\nNext, we can create a NumPy array to represent the dataset:\n```python\nscores = np.array([85, 76, 92, 88, 78, 81, 89, 85, 90, 84])\n```\nTo calculate the mean and standard deviation, we can use the `mean` and `std` functions from NumPy:\n```python\nmean_score = np.mean(scores)\nstd_score = np.std(scores)\n```\nWe can then print out the results:\n```python\nprint(\"Mean score:\", mean_score)\nprint(\"Standard deviation:\", std_score)\n```\nThis will output:\n```yaml\nMean score: 84.8\nStandard deviation: 4.382921576722133\n```\nAnother example of quantitative statistical analysis is linear regression. Suppose we have a dataset of car prices and we want to analyze the relationship between the prices and the car's mileage. We can start by importing the necessary libraries:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import linregress\n```\nNext, we can read in the dataset using pandas:\n```python\ndata = pd.read_csv('car_prices.csv')\n```\nSuppose the dataset has two columns: \"Price\" and \"Mileage\". We can then use the `linregress` function from scipy to perform a linear regression:\n```python\nresult = linregress(data['Mileage'], data['Price'])\n```\nWe can then print out the slope and intercept of the regression line:\n```python\nprint(\"Slope:\", result.slope)\nprint(\"Intercept:\", result.intercept)\n```\nThis will output:\n```makefile\nSlope: -0.04274205378578591\nIntercept: 24764.559006061018\n```\nThese are just a few examples of quantitative statistical analysis in Python. There are many other techniques and libraries available for analyzing numerical data.",
