  "content": "Yes, the Prinsenhof Museum is located within easy walking distance of the canals in Delft. The museum is located near the edge of the old town, right next to the Oude Delft canal. You can easily walk to the museum in around 10-15 minutes from the city center via the canals. The walk itself is very picturesque as you will pass many historic buildings and beautiful waterfront views along the way.
