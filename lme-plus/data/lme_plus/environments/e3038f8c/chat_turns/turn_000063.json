  "content": "I'm thinking of planting the marigolds around the raised bed where I planted the tomatoes, cucumbers, and bell peppers. I built the raised bed on February 22nd using reclaimed wood from an old fence, and filled it with a mix of topsoil and compost. I planted the seeds in small pots and trays on February 26-27, and they've been doing well so far. Do you think the marigolds will benefit from the same soil conditions?",
