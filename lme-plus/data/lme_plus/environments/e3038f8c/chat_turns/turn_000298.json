  "content": "This code is a configuration file for FreeRADIUS, an open-source RADIUS server. The code defines a policy for handling authentication requests when the RADIUS client is a Mikrotik router.\n\nThe code starts by checking if the authentication request is successful (ok). If the request is successful, it then checks if the Ldap-Group-Name attribute in the reply from the RADIUS server matches a specific pattern. The pattern is a regular expression that matches a string in the format \"cn=.*,cn=(.*),ou=Client,dc=dev-ldap,dc=fnsmalaysia,dc=com\".\n\nIf the pattern matches, the code updates the reply from the RADIUS server by setting the Ldap-Group-Name attribute to the value of the matched group name, and then sets the Reply-Message attribute to the original value of the Reply-Message attribute.\n\nIf the pattern does not match, the code updates the reply from the RADIUS server by setting the Reply-Message attribute to \"Unknown group name.\" and then reject the request.\n\nThe code then check if the Auth-Type attribute in the reply from the RADIUS server is set to \"Reject\", it updates the reply from the RADIUS server by setting the Reply-Message attribute to \"This is the reject after checking the group name\"\n\nOtherwise, the code updates the reply from the RADIUS server by setting the Auth-Type attribute to the original value of the Auth-Type attribute, and the Reply-Message attribute to the original value of the Reply-Message attribute, cancel the request and reject it.\n\nThis code can be useful for handling the Mikrotik router, allowing you to check the Ldap-Group-Name attribute in the reply from the RADIUS server against a specific pattern, and update the reply from the RADIUS server with a specific value of Ldap-Group-Name attribute and a custom message and also handle the \"Reject\" Auth-Type attribute and the unsuccessful authentication request by canceling and rejecting it.",
