Here are some tips to share with your mom:\n\n1. **Avoid harsh chemicals**: Exposure to chemicals like perfume, cosmetics, and cleaning products can damage the pearls' surface. If your mom applies perfume or hairspray, make sure she does so before putting on her pearl jewelry.\n2. **Store them separately**: To prevent scratching, store pearl jewelry in a separate box or pouch, away from other jewelry pieces.\n3. **Avoid direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause pearls to fade or become brittle. If your mom plans to wear her pearl studs outdoors, suggest she wear them under clothing or in shaded areas.\n4. **Clean them gently**: Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the pearls. For more thorough cleaning, mix a solution of mild soap and warm water, and use a soft-bristled brush to gently scrub the pearls. Rinse with clean water and dry with a soft cloth.\n5. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Sudden changes in temperature can cause the pearls to crack. Avoid exposing them to extreme heat (like saunas or hot tubs) or cold (like freezing temperatures).\n6. **Handle with care**: Pearls are relatively soft, so handle them with care to avoid scratching or chipping.\n7. **Get them re-strung**: If your mom's pearl necklace or bracelet is worn frequently, consider having it re-strung every 5-7 years to prevent the silk thread from deteriorating.\n8. **Check for damage**: Regularly inspect the pearls for signs of damage, such as cracks, chips, or discoloration. If you notice any issues, take the jewelry to a professional jeweler for repair.\n9. **Avoid ultrasonic cleaners**: Ultrasonic cleaners can damage pearls, so it's best to avoid using them.\n10. **Consider a pearl cleaning service**: Many jewelers offer pearl cleaning and maintenance services. Consider having your mom's pearl jewelry professionally cleaned and inspected periodically.\n\nBy following these care tips, your mom's pearl studs will remain beautiful and lustrous for years to come.\n\nRemember to include a care instruction card or a note with the gift, so your mom knows how to properly care for her new pearl studs.",
