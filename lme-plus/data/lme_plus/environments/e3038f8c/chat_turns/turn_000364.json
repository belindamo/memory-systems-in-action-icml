  "content": "A private garden is a wonderful choice for a proposal! It's an intimate and romantic setting that will make the moment even more special. Arranging a private tour or picnic will add a lovely touch to the occasion.\n\nI love that you're considering involving your parents in the proposal! It's a beautiful way to make the moment even more meaningful and special. Given their 30th wedding anniversary last month, it's a great way to honor their love and commitment to each other, and to have them share in your special moment.\n\nHaving your parents present will also make the proposal feel more like a family celebration, which is lovely. You could even consider having them bring a few close family members or friends to make it a small, intimate gathering.\n\nHere are a few ideas to consider for involving your parents in the proposal:\n\n1. **Private Garden Picnic**: Set up a romantic picnic in the private garden, and have your parents join you and Mike for a lovely afternoon in the sun. You could propose during the picnic, or have a special moment afterwards when you're all together.\n2. **Family Blessing**: Ask your parents to join you in the private garden, and have them give their blessing for your union. This could be a beautiful way to involve them in the proposal and make it feel more like a family celebration.\n3. **Special Message**: Have your parents write a heartfelt letter or create a special message for Mike, expressing their love and support for your relationship. You could read it aloud during the proposal, or have Mike read it afterwards.\n4. **Family Photo Shoot**: Arrange for a family photo shoot in the private garden, and propose to Mike during the shoot. This way, you'll have beautiful photos to capture the moment, and your parents will be there to share in the excitement.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to make the proposal personal and meaningful to you and Mike. With your parents involved, it will be an even more special and memorable moment for all of you.\n\nWhat do you think about these ideas? Is there a particular way you'd like to involve your parents in the proposal, or do you have any other ideas in mind?",
