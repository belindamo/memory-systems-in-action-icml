During my week-long break from Instagram, I started to realize that I was spending too much time comparing my life to others and feeling like I wasn't good enough. I want to continue to work on building my self-confidence and self-worth, rather than relying on social media validation. Do you have any tips on how I can continue to cultivate self-compassion and self-awareness in my daily life?",
