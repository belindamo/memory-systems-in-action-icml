You might be thinking of Instagram or other social media platforms where you can follow meme pages.\n\nIf that's the case, I'd be happy to help you discover new meme pages to follow! Can you tell me what kind of memes you enjoy? Are you into relatable memes, funny animals, pop culture, or something else?",
