  "content": "The Army of the Potomac's leadership structure was initially disorganized and chaotic, with a series of commanders being appointed and then quickly replaced. It wasn't until George McClellan took command in 1861 that the Army of the Potomac began to develop a more coherent structure, with clear lines of authority and a more centralized system of command.\n\nOn the other hand, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia had a more stable and cohesive leadership structure. Robert E. Lee, who became the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862, was able to maintain a consistent and effective chain of command throughout the war. He was supported by a group of experienced and competent subordinate commanders, such as James Longstreet and Stonewall Jackson, who were able to execute his orders effectively.\n\nOverall, while both armies evolved over the course of the war, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia had a more effective and stable leadership structure than the Army of the Potomac.",
