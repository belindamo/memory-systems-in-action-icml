  "content": "How would you monetize an uncopyable QR code. In other words, each instance is 100% unique, and cannot be recreated. It requires a specialised but simple reader to ingest the \"QR code\", and then can trigger some action via an API once the reader has authenticated the QR code. I have some ideas about authenticating physical goods throughout a sensitive supply chain, or authenticating high value luxury items (like a birkin bag). Alternatively, it could involve NFTs.",
