But I can give you some suggestions on how to find funny videos to share with your friends!\n\nYou can try searching for popular video-sharing platforms like YouTube, TikTok, or Vimeo, and look for channels or hashtags related to comedy, humor, or entertainment. You can also try searching for keywords like \"funny animal videos,\" \"prank videos,\" or \"comedy sketches\" to find relevant content.\n\nAdditionally, you can also ask your friends to share some funny videos they've come across, or you can take turns sharing videos with each other. This way, you'll get a constant stream of new and funny content to enjoy together!\n\nRemember to always be respectful and considerate when sharing content with your friends, and make sure you're not sharing anything that might be offensive or inappropriate.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your WhatsApp group chat will continue to be a fun and entertaining space for you and your friends!",
