The 50mm prime lens is an excellent choice for portrait photography.\n\nRegarding your struggle with focus, I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot and offer some tips to improve your skills. Here are a few questions to help me better understand the issue:\n\n1. What type of camera body are you using with your 50mm prime lens?\n2. Are you using the lens's autofocus (AF) mode or manual focus (MF) mode?\n3. What kind of lighting conditions are you shooting in? Natural light, artificial light, or a mix of both?\n4. Are you using a single focus point or zone focusing?\n5. Can you describe the type of focus issues you're experiencing? Is it front or back focus, or is the subject's eyes not sharp?\n6. Are you using any specific camera settings, such as aperture priority or manual mode?\n\nIn general, here are some tips to improve your focus skills:\n\n* **Use the correct autofocus mode**: Make sure you're using the appropriate AF mode for your subject. For portraits, you might want to use the \"Single Shot AF\" or \"AF-S\" mode, which focuses on a single point.\n* **Choose the right autofocus point**: Select a focus point that's closest to the subject's eyes. This will help ensure that the eyes are sharp, which is critical in portrait photography.\n* **Use the \"focus and recompose\" technique**: Focus on the subject's eyes, then recompose the shot to get the desired framing. This technique can help you achieve a more precise focus on the eyes.\n* **Check your camera's focus assist features**: Many cameras have features like \"focus peaking\" or \"focus magnification\" that can help you achieve accurate focus.\n* **Practice, practice, practice**: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with your camera and lens. Try shooting in different environments and lighting conditions to improve your skills.\n* **Pay attention to your subject's movement**: If your subject is moving, try using the \"Continuous AF\" or \"AF-C\" mode to track their movement and maintain focus.\n\nI hope these tips help you improve your focus skills. If you have any more specific questions or would like more detailed advice, feel free to ask!",
