  "content": "I think those tips are great! I especially like the idea of personalizing the setting and having a special message prepared. I'll make sure to speak from my heart and express my true feelings to Mike during the proposal.\n\nBy the way, I was thinking about my cousin's wedding last weekend, and how beautiful it was to see Rachel and Alex exchange their vows. It was such a romantic and intimate ceremony, and it really made me think about what I want for my own wedding. Speaking of which, do you have any tips on how to plan a small, intimate wedding like my cousin's? I've been thinking about having a similar setup, with a small guest list and a beautiful outdoor ceremony.",
