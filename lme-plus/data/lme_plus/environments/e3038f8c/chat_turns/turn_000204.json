  "content": "People in Delft do still use the canals for transportation, but it is not as common as it used to be. The canals were historically used for transportation of goods, and even people, but today they are mostly used for recreational purposes such as boating or walking along the towpaths. However, there are still some commercial boats that use the canals for delivering supplies to businesses and restaurants located on the waterfront. Overall, the canals in Delft are seen as an important part of the city's heritage and charm, and are enjoyed by residents and visitors alike.",
