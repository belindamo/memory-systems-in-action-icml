  "content": "This code is a configuration file for FreeRADIUS, an open-source RADIUS server. The code defines a policy for handling authentication requests when the RADIUS client is a Mikrotik router and the NAS-Port attribute is set to 1.\n\nThe code starts by checking if the authentication request is successful (ok) and if the NAS-Port attribute is equal to 1. If both conditions are met, it continues to the next block of code, where the fail variable is set to 9.\n\nThe next block of code checks if the authentication request is successful (ok) again and then checks if the Auth-Type attribute in the reply from the RADIUS server is set to \"Accept\".\n\nIf both conditions are met, it then checks if the Ldap-Group-Name attribute in the reply from the RADIUS server matches a specific pattern. The pattern is a regular expression that matches a string in the format \"cn=.*,cn=(.*),ou=Client,dc=dev-ldap,dc=fnsmalaysia,dc=com\".\n\nIf the pattern matches, the code updates the reply from the RADIUS server by setting the Fortinet-Group-Name attribute to the value of the matched group name, and then sets the Reply-Message attribute to the original value of the Reply-Message attribute.\n\nIf the pattern does not match, the code updates the reply from the RADIUS server by setting the Reply-Message attribute to \"Unknown group name.\" and then reject the request.\n\nIf the Auth-Type attribute is not set to \"Accept\", the code updates the reply from the RADIUS server by setting the Auth-Type attribute to the original value of the Auth-Type attribute, and the Reply-Message attribute to the original value of the Reply-Message attribute and then reject the request.\n\nIf the authentication request is not successful, it cancels the request and reject it.\n\nThis code can be useful for handling the Mikrotik router and the NAS-Port attribute is set to 1, allowing you to check the Ldap-Group-Name attribute in the reply from the RADIUS server against a specific pattern, and update the reply from the RADIUS server with a specific value of Fortinet-Group-Name attribute and a custom message, and also handle the unsuccessful authentication request by canceling and rejecting it.",
