Planting marigolds around the raised bed will not only provide benefits to the vegetables but also add a pop of color and vibrancy to your garden.\n\nMarigolds are quite adaptable and can thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Since you've created a mix of topsoil and compost, your marigolds should do well in that soil. Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **pH tolerance**: Marigolds can grow in a wide pH range, from 6.0 to 7.5. Since you're using a mix of topsoil and compost, the pH is likely to be close to neutral, which is suitable for marigolds.\n2. **Soil moisture**: Marigolds prefer well-draining soil and can tolerate some drought. However, they'll perform better with consistent moisture, especially when they're producing flowers. Since you're using a raised bed, make sure the soil isn't too dense and allows for good drainage.\n3. **Nutrient availability**: Marigolds are light feeders and don't require a lot of nutrients. The compost you've added to the soil should provide enough nutrients for the marigolds to thrive.\n\nWhen planting the marigolds, make sure to:\n\n* Space them about 6-12 inches apart, depending on the variety.\n* Plant them at the same depth as they were in their pots, and water well.\n* Mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.\n\nBy planting marigolds around your raised bed, you'll be creating a beneficial relationship between the flowers and your vegetables. The marigolds will help repel pests, attract pollinators, and add to the overall health and biodiversity of your garden.\n\nIt's great to hear that your tomato, cucumber, and bell pepper seeds are doing well! With the marigolds in place, you'll be creating a more resilient and thriving garden ecosystem.",
