Want to come with me?\"\n3. **Scavenger Hunt**: Plan a scavenger hunt that leads Mike to the garden, without giving away the surprise.

You could say, \"My parents are meeting us at the garden for a picnic, and we can catch up with them for a bit.\"\n\nRemember to keep the plan simple and believable, and make sure you have a solid alibi in case Mike starts to suspect anything.\n\nOnce you have a plan in place, make sure to coordinate with your parents and any other involved parties to ensure everything goes smoothly.
