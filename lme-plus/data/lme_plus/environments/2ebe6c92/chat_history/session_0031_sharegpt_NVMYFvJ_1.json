[[8](https://www.brostrick.com/guide/best-hair-texturizers/)]\n5. Heat Protectant Spray, Oil, or Cream: Applying a heat protectant product can repair damage caused by color and heat styling, leaving hair looking less frizzy and more shiny. It works on both natural and color-treated hair. [[10](https://www.byrdie.com/best-heat-protectants-for-hair-4588775)]\n\nBlow Dryer Techniques:\n\n1.
