      "content": "Yes, it is possible to track customers who are referred by an affiliate using a unique referral link. One way to do this is to use a referral tracking system. These systems can be integrated into your website or e-commerce platform, and they typically work by assigning each affiliate a unique referral link or code. When a customer clicks on that link and makes a purchase, the referral is tracked and the affiliate is credited with the sale.\n\nThere are many referral tracking systems available, both paid and free. Some popular options include:\n\n* ReferralCandy\n* Ambassador\n* ReferralHero\n* Post Affiliate Pro\n* Referral Rock\n\nEach of these systems have their own features and capabilities, so you'll want to research them and choose the one that best fits your needs.\n\nAnother approach is to use UTM tracking on the links your affiliate is sharing, this way you can track the source of the traffic to your website and then track the conversion.\n\nKeep in mind, if the customer comes through DM, you may have to rely on their word on how they found you, unless they are willing to give you the referral link or code."

The UI/UX designer\u2019s job is to make sure that the website is not only visually appealing, but also easy to use and navigate. They also research and study the user behavior and habits to create a website that is tailored to their needs.\n\nIn simpler terms, web page design is more focused on the aesthetics, layout and design of the website, while UI/UX design is focused on the functionality, usability and the overall user experience."
