    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "If you have a small remote design team with a limited budget, I would recommend Figma or InVision as they offer free or affordable pricing plans with enough features to help you collaborate effectively. \n\nFigma is a cloud-based design tool with a lot of collaborative features such as real-time design collaboration, commenting, and chat. The basic plan is free and allows you to work on up to three design files for free, and advanced plans start at $12 per editor per month. \n\nInVision provides a full suite of design and collaboration features including prototyping, inspect, and handoff. It has a free plan for a single project, while the paid plans start at $7.95 per user per month. It also offers a 90-day free trial for its paid plans.\n\nBoth of these tools offer design collaboration features and have a user-friendly interface. I would suggest trying them out and then choosing based on your team's preferences and needs."

      "content": "Can these design collaboration tools integrate with project management tools like Asana?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, both Figma and InVision can integrate with Asana or other project management tools to help you keep your design workflow organized.\n\nFigma can integrate with Asana using third-party services like Zapier or Integromat that enable you to instantly move your Figma comments and feedback to Asana's task list, create new Asana tasks from Figma designs, and vice versa.\n\nInVision also can integrate with Asana and other project management tools like Trello, Slack, Basecamp, and JIRA. This integration enables you to create tasks, link to designs, and assign design tasks directly from Asana, keeping everyone on the same page and driving your project forward.\n\nOverall, integrating your design tools with your project management tools can help you streamline your design workflow, optimize collaboration, and improve team communication."
