  "content": "Caribou, also known as reindeer, interact with other species in the Arctic tundra ecosystem in several ways:\n\n1. Predators: Caribou are preyed upon by wolves, bears, and humans. This interaction plays a significant role in regulating the caribou population and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.\n\n2. Competition: Caribou share the tundra habitat with other herbivores, such as muskox and arctic hares, which compete for food and resources such as water and shelter.\n\n3. Mutualism: Caribou have a mutualistic relationship with various other species. For instance, they help to disperse seeds of tundra plants by consuming berries and excreting them elsewhere.\n\n4. Parasitism: Caribou interact with parasitic organisms such as ticks, lice, and worms. These parasites can negatively affect caribou health and survival, and they rely on caribou as hosts to complete their life cycles.\n\nOverall, caribou play a vital role in the Arctic tundra ecosystem and their interactions with other species contribute to the ecosystem's stability and biodiversity.",
