Adding a pop of color with a fun accessory can really elevate your outfit and make it more interesting.\n\nTo take your messy bun to the next level, here are a few tips:\n\n* Use a bit of texturizing spray or dry shampoo to add volume and texture to your hair before you bun it.\n* Don't over-tighten your bun. You want it to look relaxed and undone, so leave a few strands loose and don't worry if it's not perfect.\n* Use your fingers to gently tug on the strands of your bun to loosen it up and create a more relaxed, piecey look.\n* Emphasize the undone look by leaving a few wispy strands framing your face.\n\nI think you'll love how your outfit comes together with the messy bun and the cute hair tie. You'll look relaxed, stylish, and totally on-trend for a casual brunch.\n\nNow, go get ready and have fun!",
