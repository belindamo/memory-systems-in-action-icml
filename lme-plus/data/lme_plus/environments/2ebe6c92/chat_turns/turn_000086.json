Still, ride-sharing services are expected to continue dominating the market for the foreseeable future because they have brought innovation and convenience to the transportation industry. Ride-sharing services' business model allows them to provide affordable, convenient, and flexible services, making them prevalent among users.\n\nHowever, traditional taxi companies are adapting to the market and introducing changes to their business models by adopting mobile applications, improving driver behavior, and enhancing customer experience.
