Creating a balanced and healthy aquascape is crucial for the well-being of your fish, including your new school of neon tetras. Here are some general tips and recommendations to help you achieve a visually appealing and thriving aquarium:\n\n1. **Balance and Symmetry**: Aim for balance and symmetry in your aquascape. Divide your tank into thirds both horizontally and vertically, and place decorations and plants accordingly. This will create a sense of harmony and visual appeal.\n2. **Create Hiding Places**: Provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers for your neon tetras. They're a schooling fish and prefer to feel secure, so add plants, rocks, and decorations that offer them shelter and protection.\n3. **Layering**: Create a layered effect in your tank by using different heights and textures. This can be achieved by using rocks, driftwood, and plants of varying sizes and shapes.\n4. **Plant Selection**: Choose plants that are suitable for your tank's lighting and water conditions. For neon tetras, you'll want plants that thrive in low-to-moderate lighting, such as Java moss, Anacharis, or Cryptocorynes.\n5. **Open Swimming Space**: Make sure to leave enough open swimming space for your neon tetras to dart and school comfortably. Aim for at least 25-30% of the tank's surface area to be open water.\n6. **Water Flow**: Consider the water flow in your tank. Neon tetras prefer gentle currents, so avoid placing decorations that can create strong water circulation.\n7. **Visual Focal Points**: Create visual focal points in your tank, such as a statement piece of driftwood or a showy plant, to draw the viewer's attention.\n8. **Color Scheme**: Choose a color scheme that complements your neon tetras' vibrant colors. You can use plants, rocks, and decorations in shades of green, blue, and yellow to create a cohesive look.\n9. **Scale**: Ensure that your decorations are proportional to the size of your tank and fish. Avoid oversized decorations that can overwhelm the space.\n10. **Experiment and Be Patient**: Don't be afraid to experiment with different layouts and arrangements. Take your time, and observe how your fish interact with the environment. Make adjustments as needed to create a harmonious and thriving aquascape.\n\nSpecifically for your neon tetras, consider the following:\n\n* Provide a school of at least 10-15 individuals to help them feel secure and exhibit their natural schooling behavior.\n* Maintain a temperature range of 72-82\u00b0F (22-28\u00b0C) and a pH range of 6.0-7.0, which are ideal for neon tetras.\n* Offer a varied diet that includes small, frequent meals to keep them active and healthy.\n\nBy following these tips and recommendations, you'll be well on your way to creating a stunning and healthy aquascape that your neon tetras will thrive in. Happy aquascaping!",
