  "content": "Storing coffee beans properly is crucial to preserving their flavor and aroma. I've got some tips to help you keep your coffee beans fresh for a longer period:\n\n**The Ideal Storage Conditions:**\n\n1. **Airtight container:** Store coffee beans in an airtight container, such as a glass or ceramic jar with a tight-fitting lid. This will prevent air, light, and moisture from affecting the beans.\n2. **Cool, dry place:** Keep the container in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing coffee beans near heat sources, ovens, or direct sunlight.\n3. **Darkness:** Coffee beans are sensitive to light, so it's best to store them in a dark or dimly lit area.\n\n**Tips for Storing Coffee Beans:**\n\n1. **Freeze them:** Freezing coffee beans is an excellent way to preserve their flavor and aroma. Simply place the beans in an airtight container or freezer bag and store them in the freezer.\n2. **Use the \"first in, first out\" rule:** Make sure to use the oldest beans first to ensure you're always brewing with the freshest beans.\n3. **Store in small quantities:** Divide your coffee beans into smaller portions (e.g., 1/2 cup or 100g) and store them in separate containers. This will help you use the beans before they go stale.\n4. **Avoid moisture:** Coffee beans are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb moisture from the air. Avoid storing them in humid environments or near sources of moisture.\n5. **Keep them away from strong-smelling foods:** Coffee beans can absorb odors from nearby foods, so store them away from pungent ingredients like onions, garlic, or spices.\n\n**How Long Do Coffee Beans Stay Fresh?**\n\nThe shelf life of coffee beans depends on various factors, including the roast level, storage conditions, and handling. Generally:\n\n* **Light roasts:** 1-2 weeks\n* **Medium roasts:** 2-4 weeks\n* **Dark roasts:** 4-6 weeks\n* **Frozen coffee beans:** 3-6 months\n\nRemember, the flavor and aroma of coffee beans will degrade over time, even with proper storage. Try to use your coffee beans within 2-4 weeks of opening for optimal flavor.\n\nEnjoy your new coffee roast, and happy brewing!",
