The exact documents required may vary depending on the bank's policies and your individual situation, but here are some common ones you should consider bringing:\n\n1. **Court order or legal name change document**: This is a crucial document that proves your name change is legal and valid. Bring the original or a certified copy of the court order, marriage certificate, divorce decree, or other legal document that confirms your name change.\n2. **Updated government-issued ID**: Bring a government-issued ID that reflects your new name, such as a driver's license, state ID, or passport. This will help the bank verify your identity and match it with the name on your account.\n3. **Current identification**: Bring your current identification, even if it still shows your previous name. This will help the bank link your old identity to your new one.\n4. **Account information**: Bring your account numbers, debit/credit card numbers, or any other relevant account information to ensure the bank updates the correct accounts.\n5. **Proof of address**: You may need to provide proof of address, such as a utility bill or lease agreement, to verify your current address.\n\nIt's a good idea to call the bank ahead of time to confirm their specific requirements. You can ask questions like:\n\n* What documents do I need to bring to update my account information?\n* Do I need to bring original documents or can I bring copies?\n* Are there any specific forms I need to fill out beforehand?\n* How long will the update process take?\n\nBy being prepared and bringing the necessary documents, you'll be able to efficiently update your account information and avoid any potential delays.\n\nRemember to stay calm and patient during the process, Avery. The bank staff will guide you through the update process, and it's a normal part of maintaining your financial records. Good luck, and I hope everything goes smoothly!",
