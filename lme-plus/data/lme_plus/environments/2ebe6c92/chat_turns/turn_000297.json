You can find plenty of free resources online, like YouTube videos or apps like Down Dog.\n2. **Focus on your breath**: Pay attention to your breathing and try to sync it with your movements. This will help you relax and get the most out of your stretching or yoga routine.\n3. **Listen to your body**: If you're feeling tired or sore, take it easy. You can always modify the routine or take a rest day if needed.\n4. **Make it a habit**: Try to perform your morning stretching or yoga routine at the same time every day, so it becomes a consistent part of your daily routine.\n\nBy starting small and being consistent, you can build up your endurance and eventually work your way up to longer sessions if you choose to.\n\nHow does that sound?
