  "content": "Yes, the interactions between caribou and other species in the Arctic tundra ecosystem do change throughout the year. This is because the availability of resources, such as food and water, varies with the seasons. In general, during the winter months, caribou face increased predation pressure from predators such as wolves, bears, and humans. They also need to compete with other herbivores, such as muskox, for limited resources like food and shelter.\n\nDuring the summer months, caribou have access to greater food resources such as plants and berries, which allows them to form mutualistic relationships with other species. For example, their consumption of berries can spread seeds and promote plant growth in the tundra.\n\nFurthermore, during the spring and fall, caribou undertake long-distance migrations to reach their breeding and calving grounds. During this time, their interactions with other species may change as they move through different habitats.\n\nIn conclusion, the interactions between caribou and other species in the Arctic tundra ecosystem are dynamic and can vary based on seasonal changes in resource availability and caribou behavior.",
