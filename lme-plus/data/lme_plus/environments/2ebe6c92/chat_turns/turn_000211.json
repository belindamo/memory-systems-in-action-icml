  "content": "H&M has some great affordable options for leggings.\n\nA plain white or gray graphic t-shirt would be a fantastic choice to pair with your leggings and Adidas sneakers. Here's why:\n\n**Why it works:**\n\n* A plain white or gray tee is a neutral color that won't compete with the boldness of the sneakers.\n* A graphic tee adds a touch of casual coolness to the outfit, which fits perfectly with the athleisure vibe.\n* The simplicity of the tee will let your sneakers be the star of the show, which is perfect since you want to showcase your new kicks.\n\n**Tips to consider:**\n\n* If you choose a white tee, make sure it's not too thin or see-through. You want to maintain a level of modesty, especially if you're planning to wear the outfit to brunch.\n* If you opt for a gray tee, consider a lighter gray to create a nice contrast with the darker color of your sneakers.\n* Consider the fit of the tee. A relaxed fit will add to the casual, athleisure vibe, while a fitted tee will create a more polished look.\n\n**Additional ideas:**\n\n* Add a lightweight, neutral-colored jacket or cardigan to dress up the outfit and add some texture.\n* If you want to add some visual interest, throw on a statement hat, like a baseball cap or a trendy fedora.\n* Keep your accessories simple and understated, like a simple watch and a pair of stud earrings.\n\nYou've got a great starting point with your leggings and sneakers. Now, just add the tee and a few finishing touches, and you'll be brunch-ready in no time!",
