  "content": "Let's take a closer look at that first activity.\n\nResponding to urgent messages on social media while your coffee is brewing... That's a great opportunity to examine!\n\nHere are a few questions to consider:\n\n1. Are these messages truly urgent, or can they wait? Could you respond to them later in the day when you're more focused and alert?\n2. Are you getting sucked into scrolling through social media feeds while responding to messages, which can lead to mindless scrolling and wasted time?\n3. Could you allocate a specific time slot later in the day for social media checks, rather than doing it first thing in the morning?\n\nBy responding to messages first thing in the morning, you might be:\n\n* Allowing social media to dictate your morning routine\n* Setting yourself up for a potential distraction-filled day\n* Delaying more important tasks or activities that could set a positive tone for the day\n\nConsider alternatives:\n\n* Allocate a specific time slot for social media checks later in the day (e.g., during your lunch break or after you've completed a priority task)\n* Use this morning time for a more intentional activity, such as:\n\t+ Journaling or meditation to clear your mind\n\t+ Planning out your day or week\n\t+ Getting a head start on a priority task or project\n\t+ Doing some light stretching or exercise to get your blood flowing\n\nWhat do you think? Are you open to exploring alternative morning routines, or do you feel that responding to urgent messages is a necessary part of your daily routine?",
