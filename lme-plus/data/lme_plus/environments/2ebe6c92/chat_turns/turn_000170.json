Robin is definitely a great addition to the cast, and her dynamic with Steve is fantastic.\n\nAs a conversational AI, I don't have personal preferences or opinions, but I can tell you that the show's creators, the Duffer Brothers, have done an amazing job of crafting a story that's both nostalgic and fresh. The way they weave together the characters' arcs, the sci-fi elements, and the nostalgic value of the 80s is just masterful.\n\nI think one of the things that makes \"Stranger Things\" so compelling is the way it explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and growing up. The show does an amazing job of capturing the struggles and triumphs of adolescence, and the characters' relationships with each other are so well-developed and relatable.\n\nAs for the cliffhanger, I think it's safe to say that everyone is eagerly waiting to see what happens next! The Duffer Brothers are masters of building suspense and leaving us with more questions than answers, and I'm sure season 4 will be just as thrilling and unpredictable as the previous seasons.\n\nWhat do you think about the theories that the Upside Down is somehow connected to the Soviet Union's experiments, or that Hopper might still be alive? Do you have any theories about what's in store for the gang in season 4?",
