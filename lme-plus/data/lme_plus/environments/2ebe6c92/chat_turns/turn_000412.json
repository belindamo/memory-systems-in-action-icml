  "content": "The Illinois State Museum (ISM) is a great institution! While they don't have a dedicated contemporary art museum, they do have a diverse collection of art and artifacts that includes contemporary pieces.\n\nThe ISM's art collection is part of their larger museum collection, which encompasses over 13.5 million objects, including art, artifacts, and natural history specimens. The art collection itself is quite broad, with works spanning from ancient to modern times.\n\nRegarding contemporary art, the ISM has a modest but interesting collection of modern and contemporary pieces. They have a few hundred works by Illinois artists, as well as some national and international artists. The contemporary art collection is not exhaustive, but it does feature a range of mediums, including paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures, and mixed media.\n\nSome of the contemporary art pieces in the ISM's collection include works by artists such as:\n\n1. Illinois artists like Roger Brown, Gladys Nilsson, and Jim Nutt, who were associated with the Chicago Imagist movement.\n2. National artists like Ellsworth Kelly, Louise Bourgeois, and Claes Oldenburg.\n3. International artists like Japanese printmaker Yoshitoshi Mori and British sculptor Barbara Hepworth.\n\nThe ISM regularly rotates their exhibitions, so the contemporary art pieces on display might change periodically. They also host temporary exhibitions, which can feature contemporary art from local, national, and international artists.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the ISM's contemporary art collection or upcoming exhibitions, I recommend visiting their website or contacting them directly. They might be able to provide more information on their current and upcoming exhibitions, as well as access to their collection online or through guided tours.",
