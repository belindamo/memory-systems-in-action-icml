Messy Bun:**\n\t* Gather all your hair into a high ponytail and secure it with an elastic band.\n\t* Leave a few loose strands framing your face for a relaxed, undone look.\n\t* You can also add some texture with a bit of hair wax or pomade.\n\n**2. Low Ponytail:**\n\t* Pull your hair back into a low ponytail, just above the nape of your neck.\n\t* Leave a few strands loose in the front to create a soft, effortless look.\n\t* You can also add some volume to your ponytail with a texturizing spray.\n\n**3. Braided Crown:**\n\t* Create a simple three-strand braid and secure it with a small elastic band.\n\t* Place the braid on top of your head, just above your forehead, for a cute and casual crown.\n\t* Leave a few loose strands framing your face to soften the look.\n\n**4. Undone Waves:**\n\t* Use a texturizing spray or sea salt spray to add volume and texture to your hair.\n\t* Scrunch your hair while it's damp to create natural, undone waves.\n\t* Let your hair air-dry or use a diffuser to enhance the texture.\n\n**5. Top Knot:**\n\t* Gather all your hair into a high ponytail and twist it into a knot.\n\t* Secure the knot with bobby pins and leave a few loose strands framing your face.\n\t* This look is great for a more polished, yet still casual, athleisure vibe.\n\nPick the hairstyle that resonates with you the most, or feel free to experiment with different looks to find your favorite!\n\nNow, you've got a complete outfit: leggings, sneakers, graphic tee, and a fun hairstyle. You're all set for a casual and stylish brunch!",
