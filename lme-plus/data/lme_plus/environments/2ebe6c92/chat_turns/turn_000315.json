Since I've been taking beginner salsa classes on Mondays and Thursdays, but after a month, I added intermediate hip hop classes on Tuesdays, I want to make sure I'm focusing on perfecting my salsa footwork and also improving my hip hop technique. Can you suggest some specific exercises or routines for those practice days?",
