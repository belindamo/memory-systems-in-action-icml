  "content": "I like the idea of creating playlists for my practice sessions. For my salsa practice, I think I'll start with some classic songs by Celia Cruz and Tito Puente, and then add some modern songs by Marc Anthony and Romeo Santos. I'll also look into those playlists on Spotify and Apple Music for more inspiration. For hip hop, I'll start with some classic songs by Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys, and then add some modern songs by Cardi B and Travis Scott. Do you have any tips on how to use these playlists during my practice sessions?",
