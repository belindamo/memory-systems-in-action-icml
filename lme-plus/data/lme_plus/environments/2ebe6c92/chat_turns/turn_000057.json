  "content": "I think I'll stick to public transportation and ride-hailing services. I've been doing a lot of driving recently, like on my road trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles with friends, and I'm ready for a break from driving. Plus, I've heard Portland is very pedestrian-friendly, so I'm looking forward to exploring on foot as well. Can you recommend some good coffee shops to check out while I'm in Portland?",
