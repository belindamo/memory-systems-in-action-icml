  "content": "Yes, both Figma and InVision can integrate with Asana or other project management tools to help you keep your design workflow organized.\n\nFigma can integrate with Asana using third-party services like Zapier or Integromat that enable you to instantly move your Figma comments and feedback to Asana's task list, create new Asana tasks from Figma designs, and vice versa.\n\nInVision also can integrate with Asana and other project management tools like Trello, Slack, Basecamp, and JIRA. This integration enables you to create tasks, link to designs, and assign design tasks directly from Asana, keeping everyone on the same page and driving your project forward.\n\nOverall, integrating your design tools with your project management tools can help you streamline your design workflow, optimize collaboration, and improve team communication.",
