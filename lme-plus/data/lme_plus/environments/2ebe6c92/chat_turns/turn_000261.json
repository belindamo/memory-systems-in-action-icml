  "content": "Happy birthday to your best friend! I'd be delighted to help you with gift ideas.\n\nIt's great to know that you've been thoughtful and generous with your gifts lately. The care package you sent to your brother with snacks, personal care items, and a gift card to his favorite coffee shop shows you put thought into what he might appreciate. That's a great starting point for thinking about what your best friend might like.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your best friend? For example:\n\n1. What are their interests or hobbies?\n2. Do they have any favorite colors, sports teams, or brands?\n3. Are they more of a practical person or someone who appreciates sentimental gestures?\n4. What's your budget for the gift?\n5. Do you want the gift to be something they can use, wear, or experience?\n\nFeel free to share as much or as little as you'd like, and I'll do my best to suggest some personalized gift ideas for your best friend's birthday!",
