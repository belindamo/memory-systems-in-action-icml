  "content": "If you have a small remote design team with a limited budget, I would recommend Figma or InVision as they offer free or affordable pricing plans with enough features to help you collaborate effectively. \n\nFigma is a cloud-based design tool with a lot of collaborative features such as real-time design collaboration, commenting, and chat. The basic plan is free and allows you to work on up to three design files for free, and advanced plans start at $12 per editor per month. \n\nInVision provides a full suite of design and collaboration features including prototyping, inspect, and handoff. It has a free plan for a single project, while the paid plans start at $7.95 per user per month. It also offers a 90-day free trial for its paid plans.\n\nBoth of these tools offer design collaboration features and have a user-friendly interface. I would suggest trying them out and then choosing based on your team's preferences and needs.",
