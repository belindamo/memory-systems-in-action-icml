  "content": "Harlequin Rasboras are a great choice for a community tank! They're peaceful, schooling fish that can add a lot of interest and activity to your aquarium. As for compatibility, they should do well with your neon tetras and the algae-eating fish you're planning to introduce.\n\n**Harlequin Rasboras and Neon Tetras:**\n\nHarlequin Rasboras and neon tetras are both peaceful, small schooling fish that can coexist peacefully. In fact, they can even school together, creating a beautiful display of color and movement in your tank. Just make sure to provide plenty of swimming space and hiding places for both species.\n\n**Harlequin Rasboras and Algae-Eating Fish:**\n\nHarlequin Rasboras are generally not competitive with algae-eating fish, as they focus on eating small invertebrates and plants. Algae-eating fish like Amano shrimp, Otocinclus catfish, and Bristlenose Plecos will likely ignore the Harlequin Rasboras and focus on their algae-eating duties.\n\n**Tips for Keeping Harlequin Rasboras:**\n\n1. **Schooling:** Harlequin Rasboras are schooling fish and should be kept in a group of at least 6-8 individuals.\n2. **Water Parameters:** They prefer soft, slightly acidic water with temperatures between 72\u00b0F to 82\u00b0F (22\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C).\n3. **Diet:** Harlequin Rasboras are omnivores and will eat a variety of foods, including commercial flake, pellets, and live/frozen foods like brine shrimp and bloodworms.\n4. **Tank Size:** A minimum tank size of 10 gallons is recommended, but a larger tank will provide a more stable environment and give your fish more space to swim.\n\nBy introducing Harlequin Rasboras to your tank, you'll be adding a new layer of interest and activity to your aquarium. With proper care and attention, they should thrive alongside your neon tetras and algae-eating fish.",
