  "content": "Yes, yoga can be adapted for people with physical limitations or injuries. In fact, yoga can be a great way to promote healing, reduce pain, and improve mobility in certain cases. However, it is important to first consult with a healthcare professional to discuss the suitability of yoga for your specific condition. If you have a physical limitation or injury, it is also important to inform your yoga teacher before class so that they can make appropriate modifications or recommend an appropriate yoga style. In some cases, private sessions with a yoga therapist may be recommended. A well-trained yoga teacher can help you modify poses, provide necessary props to support you, and offer alternatives to help you practice yoga safely and effectively. Remember, yoga is not a one-size-fits-all practice, and modifications can be made to suit your unique needs.",
