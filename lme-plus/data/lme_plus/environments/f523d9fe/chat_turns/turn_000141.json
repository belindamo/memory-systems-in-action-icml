The spiritual world is accessible and can be engaged with through various practices such as meditation, drumming, and dancing.\n3. Shamans can communicate with the spiritual world and are able to access knowledge, wisdom, and healing powers.\n4. Healing is not only physical but also emotional and spiritual, and it is the responsibility of the shaman to facilitate this process.\n\nShamanic practices include ceremonies, rituals and healing in the form of spiritual counseling, energy healing, and herbal remedies. They also emphasize the importance of living in harmony with nature, recognizing the interconnectedness of all things.\n\nThe primary differences between Shamanism and other spiritualities lie in the specific practices and beliefs within each respective tradition.
