Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n**Option 1: Body Scan Meditation**\n\n1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed and take a few deep breaths.\n2. Bring your attention to your toes and work your way up to the top of your head, noticing any areas of tension or relaxation.\n3. As you focus on each body part, release any tension or discomfort, allowing yourself to relax further.\n4. Repeat a calming phrase, such as \"I am relaxed and at peace,\" as you scan your body.\n\n**Option 2: Mindful Breathing**\n\n1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed and focus on your breath.\n2. Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs completely, and then exhale slowly through your mouth.\n3. As you breathe, focus on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.\n4. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath without judgment.\n5. Repeat a calming phrase, such as \"I am present and focused,\" as you breathe.\n\n**Option 3: Loving-Kindness Meditation**\n\n1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed and focus on your heart center.\n2. Repeat the following phrases to yourself, allowing the feelings to sink in:\n\t* \"May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be at peace.\"\n\t* \"May my loved ones be happy, may they be healthy, may they be at peace.\"\n\t* \"May all beings be happy, may they be healthy, may they be at peace.\"\n3. As you repeat the phrases, imagine the feelings of love and kindness spreading throughout your body and into the world.\n\n**Option 4: Guided Visualization**\n\n1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed and imagine yourself in a peaceful, relaxing environment (e.g., a beach, a forest, or a mountain meadow).\n2. Use all your senses to bring the scene to life: visualize the sights, sounds, smells, and sensations.\n3. As you explore your peaceful environment, repeat a calming phrase, such as \"I am relaxed and at peace in this moment.\"\n4. Stay in the visualization for 5-7 minutes, then slowly open your eyes, feeling refreshed and focused.\n\n**Option 5: Mantra Meditation**\n\n1. Choose a simple word or phrase, such as \"om\" or \"I am enough,\" and repeat it to yourself as you sit comfortably with your eyes closed.\n2. Focus on the sound and meaning of the mantra, allowing it to become a calming anchor for your mind.\n3. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to the mantra without judgment.\n4. Repeat the mantra for 10 minutes, feeling your mind calm and focus.\n\nRemember, the goal of meditation isn't to achieve a specific state or stop your thoughts completely; it's to cultivate awareness, calmness, and focus in the present moment. Be gentle with yourself, and feel free to experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you.",
