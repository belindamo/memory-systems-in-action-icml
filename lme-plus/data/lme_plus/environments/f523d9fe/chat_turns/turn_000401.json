I can provide general information about the Lakers' schedule, but I wouldn't know about a specific game that you watched today.\n\nThat being said, I can suggest some ways for you to find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. Check the official NBA website or the Los Angeles Lakers' website for their schedule and upcoming games.\n2. Look up sports websites or apps like ESPN, CBS Sports, or Yahoo Sports for the latest news and schedules.\n3. Follow the Lakers' social media accounts or sign up for their newsletter to get updates on their schedule and games.\n\nAs for LeBron James' performance, I'm glad you enjoyed the game! He's indeed an incredible player, and it's always exciting to watch him play.\n\nIf you have any more general questions about the Lakers or the NBA, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!",
