  "content": "Grated cheese is an excellent addition to savory scones, and both sharp cheddar and Parmesan would be fantastic choices to pair with caramelized onions and mushrooms!\n\n**Sharp Cheddar:**\n\n* Sharp cheddar will add a rich, tangy flavor that will complement the sweetness of the caramelized onions and the earthiness of the mushrooms.\n* Its relatively mild flavor won't overpower the other ingredients, allowing each component to shine.\n* Sharp cheddar is a great melting cheese, so it will add a nice, creamy texture to the scones when baked.\n\n**Parmesan:**\n\n* Parmesan has a nuttier, more umami flavor that will enhance the savory aspects of the mushrooms and onions.\n* Its sharp, salty flavor will cut through the richness of the caramelized onions and add depth to the scones.\n* Parmesan is a harder, more aged cheese, so it will provide a nice textural contrast to the softness of the scones.\n\n**Tips for using cheese in savory scones:**\n\n1. **Use a moderate amount:** Aim for about 1/2 cup of grated cheese per recipe. Too much cheese can make the scones dense and heavy.\n2. **Choose a cheese that melts well:** Sharp cheddar and Parmesan are both great melting cheeses, but you can also experiment with other options like Gruy\u00e8re, Gouda, or even feta.\n3. **Mix the cheese in gently:** Fold the grated cheese into the dough gently to avoid developing too much gluten, which can make the scones tough.\n4. **Consider the type of milk:** If you're using a strong, pungent cheese like Parmesan, you might want to use a milder milk like whole milk or a non-dairy milk to balance the flavors.\n\nIn your case, I think either sharp cheddar or Parmesan would work beautifully with the caramelized onions and mushrooms. If you want a slightly milder flavor, sharp cheddar might be the way to go. If you prefer a bolder, more umami flavor, Parmesan could be the better choice.",
