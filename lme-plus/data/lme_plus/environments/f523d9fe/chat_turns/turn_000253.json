Caramelized onions and mushrooms will add incredible depth and umami flavor to your savory scones.\n\nUsing bread flour for your caramelized onion and mushroom scones could be a great choice, considering the denser texture it produces. Here's why:\n\n**Why bread flour might be a good choice:**\n\n1. **Hearty texture:** Bread flour's higher protein content will result in a denser, chewier scone that can hold its own against the rich, savory flavors of caramelized onions and mushrooms.\n2. **Better structure:** The stronger gluten network in bread flour will help maintain the scone's shape and structure, even with the added moisture from the caramelized onions and mushrooms.\n3. **More robust flavor:** Bread flour can contribute a slightly nuttier, more robust flavor to your scones, which will complement the earthy flavors of the mushrooms and caramelized onions.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that using bread flour will also change the overall character of your scones. They might be less tender and more dense than scones made with all-purpose flour.\n\n**Tips for using bread flour with caramelized onions and mushrooms:**\n\n1. **Don't overmix:** Be gentle when mixing the dough to avoid developing too much gluten, which can make the scones tough.\n2. **Use a slightly higher liquid ratio:** Bread flour can absorb more liquid than all-purpose flour, so you might need to add a little more buttermilk to achieve the right consistency.\n3. **Don't overdo the add-ins:** While caramelized onions and mushrooms are delicious, they can add a lot of moisture to the dough. Be careful not to overdo it, or your scones might become too dense and heavy.\n4. **Consider a longer resting time:** Bread flour can benefit from a longer resting time to allow the gluten to relax, which can result in a more tender, easier-to-work-with dough.\n\nIf you're willing to experiment and adjust the recipe accordingly, using bread flour can be a great choice for your caramelized onion and mushroom scones. Just remember to keep an eye on the dough's consistency and texture, and be prepared to make adjustments as needed.",
