  "content": "That sounds amazing! I love the idea of incorporating natural materials, like reclaimed wood and stone, into the design.

I'm also interested in exploring sustainable features like solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and composting toilets. Can you tell me more about the costs and benefits of these features?",
