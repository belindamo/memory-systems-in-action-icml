The smoky flavor of the grill pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the bell peppers and the savory flavor of the chicken.\n\nI'm glad you mentioned that massive gas grill, too! Gas grills can be a great option for large gatherings because they provide a lot of cooking space and can heat up quickly. Plus, they're often easier to clean and maintain than charcoal grills.\n\nIf you're looking for some tips on grilling chicken breasts, I'd be happy to share some advice. Here are a few secrets to achieve juicy and flavorful grilled chicken breasts:\n\n**1. Brine the chicken:** Soak the chicken breasts in a saltwater brine solution (1 tablespoon of salt per 1 cup of water) for 30 minutes to an hour before grilling. This helps to keep the chicken moist and adds flavor.\n\n**2. Preheat the grill:** Make sure the grill is hot, hot, hot! A medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F to 425\u00b0F) is ideal for grilling chicken breasts.\n\n**3. Don't press down:** Resist the temptation to press down on the chicken breasts with your spatula while they're grilling. This can squeeze out juices and make the chicken dry.\n\n**4. Flip frequently:** Flip the chicken breasts every 5-7 minutes to ensure even cooking and to prevent burning.\n\n**5. Don't overcook:** Grill the chicken breasts until they reach an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F. Overcooking can make the chicken dry and tough.\n\n**6. Let it rest:** Once the chicken is cooked, let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken even more tender and flavorful.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve perfectly grilled chicken breasts to pair with your Mediterranean-marinated bell peppers and onions!",
