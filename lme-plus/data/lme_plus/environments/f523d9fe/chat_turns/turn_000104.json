Look for one that's windproof and has a sturdy frame.\n2. **Wear water-repellent clothing**: Invest in water-repellent or waterproof clothing, such as a jacket or pants, to help keep you dry. You can also wear clothing with a water-repellent treatment or apply a fabric spray to your clothes.\n3. **Bring a raincoat or poncho**: If you don't have an umbrella, a raincoat or poncho can be a great alternative. Look for one that's lightweight and compact, so it's easy to carry around.\n4. **Seek shelter**: If you're caught in a sudden downpour, try to find shelter as quickly as possible. It could be a building, a tree, or even a bus stop.\n5. **Avoid walking in low-lying areas**: If possible, try to avoid walking in areas that are prone to flooding or have poor drainage.

You can also apply a waterproofing spray to your shoes to help repel water.\n7. **Use a rain cover for your bag**: If you're carrying a bag, consider using a rain cover to keep your belongings dry. You can find rain covers specifically designed for backpacks, messenger bags, or tote bags.\n8. **Stay calm and move quickly**: If you do get caught in the rain, try to stay calm and move quickly to find shelter.
