  "content": "Architect's Expert Witness, Avery Palladio - Expert Report: The following comprises my report as an architectural expert concerning certain issues raised by the Respondent Owner in the arbitration entitled Columbia Architects, LLP v. Warbucks Enterprises LLC, American Arbitration Association Case, No. 2020-1040. Respondent Owner charges Claimant Architect with failure to adjust her architectural plans for a multistory structure in Tribeca, based upon changes in the applicable Building Code that occurred while the project was still in the Design Development Phase. Respondent seeks in its counterclaims damages in excess of $40 million. Claimant opposes the counterclaims on the ground that the performance as an architect was consistent with and not a departure from the standard of care because of guidance Phyllis Brunelleschi and her firm received from representatives of the Department of Buildings. I have been engaged by Claimant\u2019s attorneys to render an opinion on this issue.\nQualifications. I am licensed to practice the profession of architecture in the State of New York and in the 46 other jurisdictions, including 32 additional states of the United States and the District of Columbia (where I am advisor to the Architect of the Capitol), Canada, Mexico, the Veneto, the Kingdom of Naples, Austria, Prussia, the entire Balkan Peninsula, Ireland, Sri Lanka and Borneo. I have served as principal design architect on over 1,000 projects, including the Grounds of the University of Virginia and Monticello, ranging from one-room glass houses to monumental commercial projects. In many of those projects, my duties as an\narchitect have included performing research into the applicable regulatory regime, including building code requirements, and assuring that the architectural plans are consistent with regulatory requirements.\nI am the author of 12 monographs concerning architecture, several graced by pleasing photographs and drawings, and 36 peer-reviewed scholarly articles. My clients tell me and anyone else who will listen how much they love my work, and their only complaint is that I have become too expensive for them to engage for their next project. I am also astonishingly well-educated, holding an undergraduate degree in the plastic arts from the University of Padua, a Masters in Architecture, Planning and Preservation from Columbia University, and honorary doctorates too numerous to list. Perhaps most relevant to my role here is my experience testifying in judicial proceedings and arbitrations as an expert witness nonpareil, 36 appearances at last count. In several of them, the parties on behalf of whom I testified won the case. One of those cases involved issues of code compliance, and while I testified on related matters in that case, another expert witness for the party who engaged me directly addressed code issues. The forum decision-maker ruled against the party who engaged us on the code issue.\nA curriculum vitae setting out my skills and achievements would have been included as an addendum to this report, but it is far too long and tedious. If my adversaries, the Arbitrator, or anyone else would like to see it, I refer them to my website www.over-the-top-palladio.\nScope of Expert Engagement. An element of the case now in arbitration is the question, raised in the counterclaims of Respondent Warbucks, is whether the inclusion by the Claimant Architect of a 20th floor in the architectural plans for the proposed building in violation of the\nNew York City Building Code, constituted a departure from the applicable standard of professional care attributable to the architect. I have been asked to address this question from the viewpoint of an architectural expert, not as a legal expert.\nMaterials Reviewed and Participants Interviewed. Before reaching any opinion on the issue presented for determination, I reviewed the following materials:\nStatement of Claim.\nAnswer and Statement of Counterclaims.\nArchitectural plans for the project.\nAIA B101 Owner/Architect agreement.\nAffirmation of Phyllis Brunelleschi for administrative appeal.\nAffirmation of Warbucks in general contractor\u2019s fee-recovery action.\nNYC Building Code provisions relating to building heights.\nMy Opinion. The parties have stipulated that after the building topped out at 20 stories, the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) issued a stop-work order requiring that all construction work be suspended until the top story was removed. The basis for the order was the DOB\u2019s contention that the building height was out of compliance with BC \u00a7 \\_\\_\\_\\_, requiring that building height be no greater than \\_\\_ times building volume. It is further stipulated that a 20-story building was permitted under the code provision in force at the time the Schematic Design Phase of the architectural work was completed, but that the formula changed during the Design Development Phase. By the time any substantial construction began on the project, the height used in the plans was no longer permitted. The Architect contends that Phyllis Brunelleschi was repeatedly assured by DOB representatives on-site that her plans were\nacceptable and consistent with the Building Code. The question presented is whether the Architect\u2019s continuation of the original building height in their plans, even though the applicable code provision had changed before substantial construction work began, constituted a departure from the professional standard of care. My opinion: The architect\u2019s conduct was not a departure from the professional standard of care because the Architect was misled by the DOB representatives.\nBasis for Opinion. The NYC Building Code and zoning regulations do not explicitly limit building heights, focusing attention instead on building bulk and density through the concept of \u201cfloor area ratio\u201d, also known as \u201cFAR.\u201d The principal concern is to assure that building mass in a densely populated city does not cut off too large an area of air and light. This was the problem that emerged in downtown Manhattan during the two decades before the First World War, epitomized by the Equitable Life Insurance Society headquarters on lower Broadway, the largest commercial structure in the world at the time it was built. Complaints from the community led to the NYC Zoning Resolution of 1916, the first municipal zoning law of its kind in the United States. The current Zoning Resolution contains provisions that are, in effect, the direct descendent of the 1916 version.\nHere, the structure in question is located in Zoning District C6, a commercial district and rapidly changing part of Manhattan that has transformed in the past 30 years, from an area of warehouses and light manufacturing dominated by fully depreciated structures dating back to the 19th century, to an area of high-rise residences, commercial buildings, and mixed-use structures. This was the dynamic that Respondent Warbucks was seeking to exploit in developing the mixed-use structure now at issue. There is no dispute about what happened\nwith the FAR in this district. The calculation used by the Claimant Architect was completely correct at the time of Design Development, thereby permitting construction of a 20-story building. In May 2017, the FAR was modified; in view of the floorplate size, a building of only 19 stories would be allowed under the new standard. The DOB has the duty to enforce compliance with the FAR by building developers and contractors.\nDuring her work on the project, Phyllis Brunelleschi on behalf of the Architect periodically made for site visits to the project during which she encountered building inspectors from the DOB. These representatives of the enforcement agency inspected the work on a regular basis to ensure that the applicable regulations were being followed. Ms. Brunelleschi has testified under oath in administrative appeal proceedings and in this arbitration that she was assured by these representatives of the DOB that her firm\u2019s drawings were fully consistent with the volume/height ratio requirements of the Building Code. When it subsequently emerged that the drawings were not consistent with Code, the DOB rejected the argument advanced by the Owner and by the Architect that the Architect, had a right to rely upon what was said by DOB representatives in the field and that, in any event, the failure of the inspectors to speak up constituted a waiver. The administrative appeal has not yet been decided.\nRespondent Warbucks now takes a different position in the present arbitration. The company through its witness Mr. Warbucks contends that the Architect should have disregarded what was said by the DOB representatives and made a supplemental code review before finalizing construction drawings. I respectfully disagree. While it is always a good practice for an architect to periodically update his or her review of the applicable regulations, when representatives of the enforcement agency lead the architect to believe that his or her\nplans are compliant, is not unreasonable for the architect to proceed on that basis without further code review. The question is not whether that is the best practice but rather whether operating in reliance on the building inspector, even at the risk that one might fail to discover a change in the regulations the inspector is enforcing, constitutes a departure from the standard of professional care. I submit that as a matter of custom and usage in the profession in New York City, and architect should be, and indeed are, permitted to rely upon the views of the building inspectors and that this is the standard of professional care. That is what Claimant did here, and accordingly, it was not a departure.\nCompensation. Under my engagement agreement with Claimant\u2019s attorneys, I am being compensated at the rate of $900 per hour for all preparation time, and a per diem charge of $10,000 for my appearance as a witness in the arbitration. None of my compensation is contingent on the outcome of the case.",
