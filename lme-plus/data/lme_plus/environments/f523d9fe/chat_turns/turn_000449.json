Achieving a crispy crust on a rustic Italian bread can be a challenge, but with some tips and techniques, you can increase your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you get a crispy crust:\n\n1. **High protein flour**: Italian breads often use high-protein flour (12-14% protein) to create a strong gluten structure, which helps to produce a crispy crust. Your whole wheat flour might not be the best choice for this recipe, as it typically has a lower protein content (around 10-12%). Consider using a bread flour or all-purpose flour with a higher protein content for this recipe.\n2. **Long fermentation time**: A longer fermentation time allows the yeast to break down the starches more thoroughly, resulting in a crisper crust. Consider using a slow rise or delayed fermentation technique to give your dough more time to develop.\n3. **Steam**: Steam is essential for creating a crispy crust. You can achieve this by:\n\t* Placing a pan of water in the oven while baking to create steam.\n\t* Spraying the oven with water before baking.\n\t* Using a steam injection system, if your oven has one.\n4. **High oven temperature**: A hot oven helps to create a crispy crust. Aim for an oven temperature of at least 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for the first 10-15 minutes of baking.\n5. **Score the bread**: Scoring the bread before baking can help control the way it expands and create a more even, crispy crust. Use a lame or razor blade to make a few shallow cuts on the surface of the bread.\n6. **Dry the dough**: Make sure the dough is not too sticky or wet, as this can prevent the crust from becoming crispy. If necessary, add a little more flour to the dough to achieve the right consistency.\n7. **Bake with a stone**: Baking the bread on a preheated stone can help to create a crispy crust. The stone will absorb excess moisture and distribute heat evenly.\n8. **Cooling**: After baking, cool the bread on a wire rack to help the crust set and become crisper.\n\nAs for using your whole wheat flour, you can still experiment with it, but keep in mind that the crust might not be as crispy as you'd like. Whole wheat flour can produce a denser, heavier bread with a softer crust. If you do decide to use whole wheat, try adding a small amount of vital wheat gluten to help strengthen the dough and improve the crust.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt doesn't turn out exactly as you hoped. Keep experimenting, and you'll eventually achieve the crispy, rustic Italian bread you're looking for!",
