I've got some awesome marinade and sauce recipes for you to try:\n\n**Bulgogi Marinade:**\n\n* 1/2 cup soy sauce\n* 1/4 cup Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon grated ginger\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n\nThis marinade is a classic Korean-style bulgogi marinade, with a sweet and spicy flavor profile. You can adjust the level of spiciness to your liking by adding more or less chili flakes.\n\n**Gochujang Sauce:**\n\n* 1/2 cup gochujang (Korean chili paste)\n* 1/4 cup soy sauce\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n\nGochujang sauce is a sweet and spicy Korean chili paste that's commonly used in BBQ sauces.
