Here are some tips to help you get a perfect char on your grilled vegetables:\n\n**1. Preheat your grill:** Make sure your grill is hot, hot, hot! A medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F to 425\u00b0F) is ideal for getting a good char on veggies.\n\n**2. Brush with oil and season:** Brush your veggies with a neutral-tasting oil, like canola or avocado oil, to prevent sticking and promote browning. Add some salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you like to bring out the flavors.\n\n**3. Choose the right veggies:** Some veggies are more prone to charring than others. Bell peppers, zucchini, eggplant, and onions are all great candidates for grilling and charring. Thicker slices or wedges tend to char better than thin slices.\n\n**4. Grill in batches:** Grill your veggies in batches to ensure they have enough room to cook evenly. Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of charring.\n\n**5. Cook with the lid open:** Cooking with the lid open allows you to keep an eye on your veggies and adjust the heat as needed. This also helps to prevent steam from building up and promoting charring.\n\n**6. Don't stir too much:** Resist the temptation to stir your veggies too frequently. Let them develop a nice char on one side before flipping or rotating them.\n\n**7. Use a thermometer:** Keep an eye on the internal temperature of your veggies. Most veggies are done when they reach an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F to 160\u00b0F.\n\n**8. Don't overcook:** Veggies can go from perfectly charred to burnt quickly. Check on them frequently towards the end of their cooking time to avoid overcooking.\n\n**9. Add a smoky flavor:** If you want to add an extra layer of smokiness to your charred veggies, you can finish them off with a drizzle of liquid smoke or a sprinkle of smoked paprika.\n\n**10. Practice makes perfect:** Grilling veggies is an art that requires practice. Don't be discouraged if your first attempts don't turn out perfectly. Keep trying, and you'll soon be a veggie-grilling master!\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a beautiful char on your veggies without burning them. Happy grilling!",
