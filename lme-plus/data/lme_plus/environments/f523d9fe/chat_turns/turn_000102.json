Check online weather websites or apps: You can check websites like weather.com, accuweather.com, or apps like Dark Sky (iOS) or Weather Underground (Android) to get the current weather forecast for your location.\n2. Use a virtual assistant: You can ask virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa to give you the current weather forecast for your location.\n3. Check your local news website or TV: You can also check your local news website or TV channel to get the latest weather forecast.\n\nAs for your mistake of leaving your umbrella at home on sunny days, it's a good lesson learned! It's always a good idea to check the weather forecast before heading out, especially if you live in an area with unpredictable weather. You can also consider keeping a compact umbrella in your bag or car, just in case.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm happy to assist you with any other questions you may have!",
