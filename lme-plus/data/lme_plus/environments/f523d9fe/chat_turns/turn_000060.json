The EU should play a greater role in health policy by providing funding and technical assistance to member states to help them improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.\n3. The EU should establish a European Health Union to coordinate the health policies of member states and address common public health issues.\n\nOption 1: EU member states should take a more active role in health policy by developing common policies and strategies for healthcare financing and public health.\n\nThis option would involve EU member states working together to develop common policies and strategies for healthcare financing and public health. This would involve sharing best practices, data, and information among member states, as well as working together to develop common policies and strategies for healthcare financing and public health. This option would allow member states to share the burden of healthcare costs and improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.\n\nOption 2: The EU should play a greater role in health policy by providing funding and technical assistance to member states to help them improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.\n\nThis option would involve the EU providing funding and technical assistance to member states to help them improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. This would involve the EU providing funding for healthcare infrastructure, research, and development, as well as providing technical assistance for the implementation of healthcare policies and strategies. This option would allow the EU to support member states in improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.\n\nOption 3: The EU should establish a European Health Union to coordinate the health policies of member states and address common public health issues.\n\nThis option would involve the EU establishing a European Health Union to coordinate the health policies of member states and address common public health issues. This would involve the EU providing funding and technical assistance to member states to help them improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. This would also involve the EU working with member states to develop common policies and strategies for healthcare financing and public health. This option would allow the EU to coordinate the health policies of member states and address common public health issues.\n\nAll three options would require the EU to play a greater role in health policy, but they differ in their approach and the level of involvement of the EU. The first option would involve EU member states working together to develop common policies and strategies for healthcare financing and public health, the second option would involve the EU providing funding and technical assistance to member states to help them improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. The third option would involve the EU establishing a European Health Union to coordinate the health policies of member states and address common public health issues. All options have their own advantages and disadvantages, which will be evaluated in the next section.",
