I also love the idea of using nature-inspired decor, like pinecones and evergreen branches. And, of course, I'll make sure to serve some festive foods and drinks to get everyone in the holiday spirit!\n\nBy the way, speaking of festive foods, I was thinking of making some holiday treats for my friends and family. Do you have any favorite holiday cookie recipes or ideas for edible gifts?",
