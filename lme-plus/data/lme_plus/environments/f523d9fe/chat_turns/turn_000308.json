It's a popular choice for those who prefer a more subtle green tea flavor.\n3. **Matcha**: If you're looking for a more energizing green tea experience, Matcha is the way to go. This powdered green tea is often used in lattes and smoothies, but you can also brew it traditionally.

Generally, green teas are best brewed at lower temperatures (160\u00b0F - 170\u00b0F) for 1-3 minutes.\n\nRemember, the world of green tea is vast, and there are many more varieties to explore. Feel free to experiment and find the one that suits your taste preferences!",
