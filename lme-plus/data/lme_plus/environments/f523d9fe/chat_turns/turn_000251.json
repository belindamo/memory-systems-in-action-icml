  "content": "Savory scones are a fantastic idea! You can easily adapt this recipe to create delicious savory scones with herbs and cheese. Here's how:\n\n**Savory Scone Variations:**\n\n1. **Herby Delight:** Add 1-2 tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs like chives, parsley, rosemary, or thyme to the dry ingredients. You can also use dried herbs, but reduce the amount to 1 teaspoon.\n2. **Cheesy Goodness:** Add 1/2 cup of grated cheese, such as cheddar, Parmesan, or feta, to the dry ingredients. You can also mix in some crumbled goat cheese or blue cheese for added flavor.\n3. **Garlic and Chive:** Mix in 1-2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 tablespoon of chopped chives into the butter before adding it to the dry ingredients.\n4. **Spicy Kick:** Add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes to the dry ingredients for a spicy twist.\n\n**Tips for Savory Scones:**\n\n* Reduce the sugar: Savory scones don't need as much sugar, so you can reduce the granulated sugar to 1-2 tablespoons or even omit it altogether.\n* Use a lighter touch: Savory scones can be more delicate, so be gentle when mixing the dough to avoid overworking it.\n* Adjust the liquid: Depending on the ingredients you add, you might need to adjust the amount of buttermilk. If you're using cheese, herbs, or other wet ingredients, you might need to reduce the buttermilk by 1-2 tablespoons.\n* Consider adding some acidity: A splash of lemon juice or vinegar can help balance the flavors in savory scones.\n\n**Other Savory Scone Ideas:**\n\n* Bacon and Scallion: Add 2-3 pieces of crumbled cooked bacon and 1 tablespoon of chopped scallions to the dough.\n* Sun-dried Tomato: Mix in 1/4 cup of chopped sun-dried tomatoes and 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh basil.\n* Mushroom and Thyme: Add 1/4 cup of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh thyme to the dough.\n\nRemember, the key to making great savory scones is to balance the flavors and textures.
