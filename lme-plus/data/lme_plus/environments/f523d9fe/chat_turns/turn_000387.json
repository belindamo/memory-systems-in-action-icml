  "content": "The magnetic field through a horizontal surface can be found by taking the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nThe horizontal component of the magnetic field is given by B\\_h = B \\* cos(theta), where B is the magnitude of the magnetic field, and theta is the angle between the magnetic field and the horizontal.\n\nGiven B = 42 \u00b5T and theta = 57 degree, we have:\n\nB\\_h = 42 \u00b5T \\* cos(57 degree)\n= 21.3 \u00b5T\n\nThe magnetic field through a horizontal surface of area 2.5 m^2 is:\n\nB\\_horiz = B\\_h \\* A\n= 21.3 \u00b5T \\* 2.5 m^2\n= 53.25 \u00b5T\u00b7m^2\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field through a horizontal surface of area 2.5 m^2 is 53.25 \u00b5T\u00b7m^2.",
