  "content": "While modernist art and literature may not be to everyone's taste, it is considered important and influential because it fundamentally shifted the way people thought about creative expression. Before the modernist movement emerged, art and literature were often expected to follow established rules and conventions, and were evaluated based on their success in accurately representing the world and human experience. Modernist artists and writers, however, began to subvert these expectations by deliberately breaking with tradition and experimenting with new forms, techniques, and subject matter.\n\nIn doing so, they challenged the definition of art and literature itself, asking questions about what they could be and what purpose they served. They also often explored themes of individualism, fragmentation, and existential angst, reflecting the disillusionment and uncertainty of a rapidly changing world in the aftermath of World War I.\n\nOverall, modernist art and literature were influential because they represented a significant departure from conventional modes of creative expression and pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in art and literature. They continue to be studied and appreciated today for their innovation and impact on subsequent artistic and literary movements.",
