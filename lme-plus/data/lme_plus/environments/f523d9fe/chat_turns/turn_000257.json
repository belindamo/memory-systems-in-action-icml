  "content": "Parmesan is a fantastic choice, and its nutty flavor will pair beautifully with the caramelized onions and mushrooms.\n\nNow, about adding fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary... \n\n**Fresh herbs can be a great addition:**\n\n* Fresh herbs like thyme, rosemary, or even parsley can add a bright, fresh flavor to your scones that will complement the richness of the caramelized onions and mushrooms.\n* Herbs like thyme and rosemary have a piney, slightly bitter flavor that will balance out the sweetness of the onions and the earthiness of the mushrooms.\n* Fresh herbs can also add a lovely aroma to your scones, which will make them even more appealing.\n\n**However, use them judiciously:**\n\n* Fresh herbs can be quite potent, so start with a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs per recipe) and taste as you go.\n* Make sure to chop the herbs finely so they distribute evenly throughout the dough.\n* Consider the strength of the herb you're using. Thyme and rosemary can be quite strong, so use them sparingly. Parsley or chives might be a better choice if you want a more subtle herbal flavor.\n\nIn your case, I think thyme or rosemary would be a great addition to your scones. They'll add a lovely depth of flavor and aroma that will complement the caramelized onions, mushrooms, and Parmesan beautifully.\n\nJust remember to taste the dough as you go and adjust the amount of herbs to your liking. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess herbs from the dough.",
