Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Bread flour vs. All-purpose flour:**\n\n* Bread flour has a higher protein content (12-14%) compared to all-purpose flour (10-12%). This means bread flour will produce more gluten, which can lead to a chewier, denser scone.\n* Bread flour is often made from a harder wheat and has a coarser texture, which can result in a slightly denser, heavier scone.\n\n**How bread flour will affect your scones:**\n\n* Scones made with bread flour might be slightly more dense and heavier than those made with all-purpose flour.\n* They might have a slightly chewier texture and a more rustic, artisanal quality.\n* The gluten in bread flour can make the scones more prone to spreading during baking, which might affect their shape.\n\n**Tips for using bread flour in scones:**\n\n* Use a slightly lower ratio of bread flour to liquid ingredients to compensate for the higher protein content. You can try reducing the buttermilk by 1-2 tablespoons to start.\n* Be gentle when mixing the dough to avoid developing too much gluten, which can make the scones tough.\n* Keep an eye on the scones while they're baking, as they might brown more quickly due to the higher protein content.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, go ahead and try using bread flour in this recipe! Just be aware of the potential differences and adjust the recipe accordingly. If you're looking for a lighter, more tender scone, all-purpose flour might still be the better choice.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and experiment with different flours to find the combination that works best for you and your taste preferences!",
