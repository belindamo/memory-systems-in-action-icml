Grab some food, chat with friends, or simply take a few minutes to people-watch.\n4. **Be open-minded**: Music festivals are all about discovery, so be open to checking out acts you've never heard of before. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy something outside of your usual genre comfort zone!\n5. **Dress comfortably**: Wear comfortable shoes, clothing, and accessories that can withstand the festival environment. You'll be glad you did!\n\nAs you're researching festivals, keep an eye out for ones that feature a mix of jazz fusion, indie rock, and synth-heavy electronic music.
