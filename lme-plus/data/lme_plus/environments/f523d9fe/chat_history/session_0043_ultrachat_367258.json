Increased Health Care Costs: As people age, they tend to require more healthcare services, which can strain the healthcare system and increase costs.\n\n2. Increased Demand for Aged Care Services: Similarly, an ageing population creates an increased demand for aged care services such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and home health services.\n\n3. Housing Affordability: Many older adults in Sydney are finding it hard to afford suitable housing, as housing costs continue to rise.\n\n4. Social Isolation and Loneliness: Older adults may become more socially isolated as they age, leading to loneliness and depression, which can have detrimental health effects.\n\n5.
