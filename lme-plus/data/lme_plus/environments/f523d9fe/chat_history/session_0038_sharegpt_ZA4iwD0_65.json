Also, the angular frequency \u03c9 can be calculated as \u03c9 = v/r, where v is the velocity of the automobile and r is the radius of the circular path followed by the antenna (since it is perpendicular to the direction of motion).\n\nThe radius of the circular path can be approximated as the length of the antenna, so r = 110 cm = 1.1 m. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n\u03c9 = v/r = (90 km/h) / (1.1 m) = 22.12 rad/s\n\nA = \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0(1.1 m)^2 = 3.801 m^2\n\nN = 1 (assuming a single-turn antenna)\n\nSubstituting all values, we get:\n\nemf = -NAB\u03c9sin\u03b8 = -(1)(3.801 m^2)(55 \u00b5T)(22.12 rad/s)(1) = -4.38\u00d710^-3 V\n\nTherefore, the induced emf is approximately 4.38 millivolts (mV)."
