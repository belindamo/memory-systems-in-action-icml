      "content": "As an AI, I don't have personal biases, but a good recommendation for someone who is new to the comic book scene would be a convention that is in or near their area, so they do not have to go far. Fan Expo Canada, which is held annually in Toronto would be a good option as it is one of the largest comic book conventions in North America and has a broad range of activities for fans of all ages and interests including, comic book artists, special guests, cosplay, exhibitors and more. It's also a great place to meet other fans and make new friends who have similar interests in comics."

      "content": "Certainly! Here are some tips that may help in preparing for your first comic book convention:\n\n1. Plan ahead: Find out what events, exhibitions, panels or performances are taking place during the convention and note the times and locations. Prioritize the ones you're interested in attending.\n\n2. Dress comfortably: Comic book conventions are usually crowded, so it's essential to wear comfortable shoes and clothes that you can move around in all day. Some people like to wear costumes or cosplay, which is a fun and popular aspect of comic book conventions, but it's not necessary.\n\n3. Bring cash: Make sure you have some cash on hand as some of the exhibitors and vendors may not accept credit cards. Also, consider setting a budget for yourself to avoid overspending.\n\n4. Be prepared to stand in lines: Lines will be long for some events or exhibitions, so be prepared to stand in line for a significant amount of time. Consider bringing a book, portable charger, or headphones to help pass the time.\n\n5. Bring a backpack or bag: You're likely to acquire many items at the convention, so having a sturdy backpack or bag to carry your purchases is a good idea.\n\n6. Meet new people: Comic book conventions are an excellent opportunity to meet like-minded people who share your interests.\n\nI hope these tips help you prepare for your first comic book convention, and most importantly, have fun!"
