Here's a breakdown of the noise levels for each of the eco-friendly air purifiers I mentioned earlier:\n\n1. **Austin Air**:\n\t* Noise level: 39.5 dB (low), 55 dB (medium), 66 dB (high)\n\t* Note: Austin Air units are known for their quiet operation, making them suitable for bedrooms and home offices.\n2. **Blueair**:\n\t* Noise level: 17 dB (low), 32 dB (medium), 45 dB (high)\n\t* Note: Blueair units are designed to be whisper-quiet, with a unique fan design that minimizes noise.\n3. **RabbitAir**:\n\t* Noise level: 25.6 dB (low), 35.2 dB (medium), 45.2 dB (high)\n\t* Note: RabbitAir units are designed to be quiet and have a silent mode for nighttime use.\n4. **Dyson**:\n\t* Noise level: 22 dB (low), 35 dB (medium), 43 dB (high)\n\t* Note: Dyson air purifiers are designed to be quiet and have a built-in silent mode for nighttime use.\n5. **Honeywell**:\n\t* Noise level: 20 dB (low), 35 dB (medium), 45 dB (high)\n\t* Note: Honeywell air purifiers are designed to be quiet, but some models may be louder than others.\n6. **Coway**:\n\t* Noise level: 24.4 dB (low), 34.4 dB (medium), 44.4 dB (high)\n\t* Note: Coway air purifiers are designed to be quiet and have a silent mode for nighttime use.\n7. **Winix**:\n\t* Noise level: 27.8 dB (low), 37.8 dB (medium), 47.8 dB (high)\n\t* Note: Winix air purifiers are designed to be quiet, but some models may be louder than others.\n\nFor comparison, a normal conversation between two people is around 60 dB, while a whisper is around 20 dB. So, most of these air purifiers are designed to be very quiet, especially on their lowest settings.\n\nIf noise level is a top priority, you may want to consider the following:\n\n* Austin Air and Blueair units are known for their extremely quiet operation.\n* RabbitAir, Dyson, and Coway units have silent modes or very low noise levels on their lowest settings.\n* Honeywell and Winix units may be slightly louder, but still relatively quiet compared to other air purifiers on the market.\n\nRemember to check the specific model you're interested in, as noise levels can vary between models and brands. You may also want to read reviews and watch videos to get a better sense of the noise level in real-world use.",
