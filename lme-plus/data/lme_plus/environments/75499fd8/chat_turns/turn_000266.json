  "content": "I've been attending comedy shows at different venues around the city, and last weekend I saw a great show at the Improv with a headlining act who's one of my favorite comedians. I've also been taking a comedy writing workshop on Sundays, which has been really helpful in improving my joke structure and delivery. Do you have any tips on how to create a comedy persona or character, like a stage presence that's different from my everyday self? I feel like that could help me stand out as a comedian.",
