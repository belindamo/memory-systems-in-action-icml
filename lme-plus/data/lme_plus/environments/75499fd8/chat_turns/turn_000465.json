  "content": "To update the transformation matrix in the Acceleration Structure (AS), you will typically need to rebuild the AS with the updated transformation data. The exact steps for doing this will depend on the type of AS you are using and the specific implementation you have.\n\nHere's a general outline of the steps you might take to update an instance in a Bottom Level Acceleration Structure (BLAS) in Vulkan:\n\n1. Retrieve the existing geometry information for the instance you want to update from the BLAS. This information will typically include the vertex and index data for the mesh, as well as any instance-specific transformation matrices or other data.\n2. Update the transformation matrix for the instance based on the current time or other inputs.\n3. Modify the geometry information to reflect the updated transformation data. For example, you might transform the vertex positions based on the new transformation matrix.\n4. Rebuild the BLAS with the modified geometry information for the updated instance. This will typically involve creating a new VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR object and passing it to a function like vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR() to build the updated AS.\n5. Once the AS has been rebuilt, you can use it to render the updated scene with the new object position.\n\nNote that this is just a general outline, and the exact steps you will need to take may vary depending on your specific implementation. Additionally, there may be some optimizations you can make to avoid rebuilding the entire AS for each object update, such as using instance transformation matrices instead of modifying the geometry data directly.",
