  "content": "Based on the given information, we can calculate the mapping percentage as follows:\n```scss\nMapping % = (100 - (40/3450)*100) * 100/(9375/218670)\n```\nTo explain the formula, we first need to calculate the ratio of the two Gauge32 values, which is `(40/3450)`. We multiply this value by 100 to get the percentage of the second value in relation to the first value.\n\nWe then subtract this percentage from 100 to get the percentage of the first value that is not accounted for by the second value.\n\nFinally, we divide the result by the ratio of the actual total range of the first value (`218670`) to get the mapping percentage.\n\nAssuming the IP address `172.27.199.165` is correct, you can use the following command to calculate the mapping percentage:\n```bash\necho \"Mapping % = $(echo \"scale=2;(100 - ($(snmpwalk -v2c -c public 172.27.199.165 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11610.435.7742.1.3.201.0)/$(snmpwalk -v2c -c public 172.27.199.165 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11610.435.7742.1.3.200.0))*100)*100/(9375/218670)\" | bc)%\"\n```\nThis command uses command substitution to get the two Gauge32 values from the SNMP server and calculates the mapping percentage using the formula above. The `bc` command is used to perform floating-point arithmetic with a scale of 2 decimal places. The final result is displayed with a percentage symbol.",
