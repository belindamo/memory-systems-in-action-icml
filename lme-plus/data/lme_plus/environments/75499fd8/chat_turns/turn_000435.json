  "content": "Pyrrhos was not specifically identified as a magician in the story I created. Rather, he was described as a wise and just individual who was chosen by the gods to build a tower that could withstand the fire that was to come.\n\nHowever, Pyrrhos was said to have great knowledge of the arts and sciences, and he had spent many years studying and experimenting to develop the magical material that was used to construct the tower. It's possible that his understanding of the principles of magic and the natural world aided him in his creation of the material and the design of the tower, but the story did not specifically identify him as a magician.",
