Plan ahead: Find out what events, exhibitions, panels or performances are taking place during the convention and note the times and locations. Prioritize the ones you're interested in attending.\n\n2. Dress comfortably: Comic book conventions are usually crowded, so it's essential to wear comfortable shoes and clothes that you can move around in all day. Some people like to wear costumes or cosplay, which is a fun and popular aspect of comic book conventions, but it's not necessary.\n\n3. Bring cash: Make sure you have some cash on hand as some of the exhibitors and vendors may not accept credit cards. Also, consider setting a budget for yourself to avoid overspending.\n\n4. Be prepared to stand in lines: Lines will be long for some events or exhibitions, so be prepared to stand in line for a significant amount of time. Consider bringing a book, portable charger, or headphones to help pass the time.\n\n5. Bring a backpack or bag: You're likely to acquire many items at the convention, so having a sturdy backpack or bag to carry your purchases is a good idea.\n\n6. Meet new people: Comic book conventions are an excellent opportunity to meet like-minded people who share your interests.\n\nI hope these tips help you prepare for your first comic book convention, and most importantly, have fun!",
