Here's the continuation of the outer system description:\n\nKuiper Belt:\nLocated at a distance of approximately 30-55 AU from Xylophia-IV-a, the Kuiper Belt is a region of icy bodies, including dwarf planets, and other small celestial objects composed mainly of frozen volatiles (such as water, ammonia, and methane). The Kuiper Belt marks the boundary between the more densely populated inner system and the sparsely populated outer system.\n\nOort Cloud:\nThe Oort Cloud is a distant, spherical shell of icy bodies surrounding the Xylophia-IV system, extending from approximately 2,000 to 100,000 AU from the star. It is a reservoir of long-period comets and other icy bodies that occasionally get perturbed into the inner system due to gravitational interactions with nearby stars or other massive objects. The Oort Cloud represents the outermost boundary of the Xylophia-IV star system.\n\nI hope this provides a comprehensive overview of the entire Xylophia-IV star system.",
