I'll offer you some tips to help you achieve crystal-clear water.\n\n**First, let's review what might be causing the cloudiness:**\n\n1. **Algae bloom**: You already addressed this by doing water changes and reducing food, which is great! However, it's essential to monitor the situation to prevent another bloom.\n2. **Live plants**: While plants help with water quality, they can also contribute to cloudiness, especially if they're not fully established or if there's an imbalance in the tank's ecosystem.\n3. **Decaying plant matter**: As plants grow, they shed leaves or release organic compounds that can cloud the water.\n4. **Overfeeding**: Excess food particles can decay and contribute to cloudiness.\n5. **Insufficient water circulation**: Poor water circulation can lead to stagnant areas, allowing debris to settle and cloud the water.\n\n**Tips for maintaining good water clarity:**\n\n1. **Regular water changes**: Continue performing regular water changes (10-15% every week) to remove built-up waste products, excess nutrients, and decaying plant matter.\n2. **Monitor water parameters**: Test the water for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels to ensure they're within safe ranges for your fish. You can also monitor pH, hardness, and alkalinity to ensure stability.\n3. **Maintain good water circulation**: Ensure your filter is working efficiently, and consider adding a powerhead or adjusting the direction of your filter outlets to improve water circulation.\n4. **Optimize your aquarium's biological balance**: Ensure your tank has a balanced biological load. Avoid overstocking, and consider adding more plants or beneficial bacteria supplements to help break down waste.\n5. **Adjust your feeding**: Monitor your fish's food intake and adjust feeding amounts accordingly. Avoid overfeeding, as this can lead to excess nutrients and cloudiness.\n6. **Prune and maintain your plants**: Regularly prune your plants to promote healthy growth and prevent excess plant matter from decaying.\n7. **Consider adding a clarifier**: If you're experiencing persistent cloudiness, consider adding a water clarifier (e.g., a flocculant) to help clear the water.\n8. **Perform a gravel vacuum**: Regularly vacuum your gravel to remove debris and decaying matter that can contribute to cloudiness.\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n* Consider upgrading your filter media to something like activated carbon or a high-quality biological media to help remove impurities and excess nutrients.\n* Introduce beneficial bacteria supplements to help break down waste and maintain a balanced ecosystem.\n* Monitor your tank's lighting schedule to ensure it's not promoting excessive algae growth.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to maintain good water clarity and a healthy environment for your fish and plants. If you're still experiencing issues, feel free to provide more details, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot the problem.",
