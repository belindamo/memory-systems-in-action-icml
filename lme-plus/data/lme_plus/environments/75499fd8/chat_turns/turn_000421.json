  "content": "I'm having some issues with my aquarium's water clarity. I recently added some live plants to my 20-gallon tank, and while they're doing great, I noticed the water was getting a bit cloudy last week. I think it might be related to an algae bloom I had on March 10th, which I fixed by doing some water changes and reducing food for my fish. Do you have any tips on how to maintain good water clarity?",
