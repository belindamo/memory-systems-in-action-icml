  "content": "Yes, here are a few examples of specific actions and statements made by former college athletes regarding the unionization movement and their frustrations with the NCAA:\n\n- In 2014, Northwestern University football players led a movement to unionize and gain collective bargaining rights. Former quarterback Kain Colter testified before the National Labor Relations Board in support of the effort, stating that \"we need a seat at the table to be able to negotiate for things that are basic rights and protections that every other worker in America has.\" Despite initial progress, the effort ultimately stalled due to legal challenges.\n\n- In 2019, NBA player and former Duke University basketball player Jayson Tatum tweeted his support for college athletes being able to profit off their name, image, and likeness (NIL), stating that \"it's crazy that [the NCAA] can sell our jerseys and make money off us but we can't make a little profit ourselves.\"\n\n- In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, former college athletes have been vocal about the need for increased protections and benefits for current athletes. Former UCLA gymnast Katelyn Ohashi wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times in which she stated that \"athletes deserve better than to be treated as disposable assets in a multi-billion dollar industry.\" Many other former athletes have echoed this sentiment on social media and in public statements.\n\nOverall, former college athletes who support a unionization movement are frustrated with what they see as the NCAA's exploitation of athletes for profit, and are advocating for increased rights and protections for current and future college athletes.",
