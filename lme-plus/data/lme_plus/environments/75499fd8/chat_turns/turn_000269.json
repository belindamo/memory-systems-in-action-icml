Here are some tips to help you craft a character that resonates with audiences:\n\n**Relatability:**\n\n1. **Draw from your own experiences**: Use your own life, interests, and observations to create a character that's authentic and relatable. As an accountant, you can draw from your daily experiences and frustrations to create humor.\n2. **Find common ground**: Identify universal themes, emotions, or struggles that audiences can identify with. For example, who hasn't dealt with tax season anxiety or struggled with budgeting?\n3. **Make your character flawed**: Give your character relatable flaws, quirks, or insecurities that make them more human and endearing to audiences.\n\n**Uniqueness and Memorability:**\n\n1. **Exaggerate and amplify**: Take your relatable traits and exaggerate them for comedic effect. This could be an extreme passion for spreadsheets, an obsession with tax law, or an exaggerated reaction to minor setbacks.\n2. **Add a twist or surprise**: Introduce an unexpected element to your character that subverts audience expectations. For example, a tough, no-nonsense accountant with a secret love for rom-coms or a passion for baking.\n3. **Create a distinct voice and tone**: Develop a unique voice, tone, and language that sets your character apart. This could be a dry wit, a sarcastic tone, or a folksy, down-to-earth demeanor.\n\n**Character Development:**\n\n1. **Give your character a name**: Naming your character can help you define their personality, traits, and characteristics. This could be a play on your real name, a nickname, or a completely fictional name.\n2. **Develop a backstory**: Create a brief history for your character, including their occupation, relationships, and goals. This will help you understand their motivations and behaviors.\n3. **Practice and refine**: Try out your character in different scenarios, writing exercises, and performances. Refine their traits, tone, and behavior based on feedback and your own instincts.\n\n**Tips for Your Comedy Writing Workshop:**\n\n1. **Write from your character's perspective**: Use your workshop to write jokes and bits from your character's point of view. This will help you develop their voice and tone.\n2. **Experiment with different formats**: Try writing different types of jokes, like one-liners, short stories, or even songs, to see what works best for your character.\n3. **Get feedback from your peers**: Share your work with your workshop group and ask for feedback on how well your character is coming across.\n\nRemember, creating a memorable comedy persona takes time and practice. Be patient, stay true to your character, and keep refining their traits and behaviors until they feel authentic and hilarious. Good luck, and have fun with the process!",
