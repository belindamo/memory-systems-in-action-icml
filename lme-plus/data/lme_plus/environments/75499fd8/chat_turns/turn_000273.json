  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or opinions, but here are some possible limitations or downsides of playing games with friends on different platforms:\n\n1. Limited cross-platform compatibility: Not all games support cross-platform play. This means that if you and your friends are on different platforms, you may not be able to play certain games together.\n\n2. Performance differences: Different platforms have different hardware capabilities, software optimization, and internet connectivity, which can affect the performance and experience of the game. Players on less powerful platforms or weaker internet connection may experience lag, freezing, or lower graphic quality.\n\n3. Control differences: Different platforms have different control schemes, input methods, and controllers. This can create some learning curve or disadvantage for players who are not familiar with their friend's platform or controller.\n\n4. Communication challenges: Different platforms may have different voice chat technologies, party systems, or messaging systems, which can make it hard to communicate with friends across platforms.\n\n5. Extra fees or requirements: In some cases, playing with friends on different platforms may require extra fees or requirements, such as subscribing to a specific online service, buying a specific compatible controller, or downloading additional software.",
