  "content": "I'm planning to use my devices moderately during the trip, so I think the Anker PowerCore 20000 should be enough. I'm also planning to pack a travel adapter with multiple USB ports, so I can charge my devices and power bank simultaneously when I have access to a power outlet. By the way, I also have a wireless charging pad, Belkin Boost Up, that I use to charge my phone and smartwatch at home. Do you think I should bring it with me on the trip, or would it be too bulky?",
