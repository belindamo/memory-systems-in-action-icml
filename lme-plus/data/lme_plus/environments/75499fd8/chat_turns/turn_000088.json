Here's a Python script that should accomplish what you're looking for:\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\nparent_dir = '/path/to/parent/dir'  # replace with the path to your parent source directory\ncc_dir = os.path.join(parent_dir, 'CC')  # path to the CC directory inside the parent source directory\ndest_dir = '/path/to/destination/dir'  # replace with the path to your destination directory\n\n# Walk through the parent directory and recreate empty folders in the destination directory\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(parent_dir):\n    for d in dirs:\n        src_path = os.path.join(root, d)\n        dest_path = src_path.replace(parent_dir, dest_dir)\n        os.makedirs(dest_path, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Move the contents of the CC directory into their respective folders in the destination directory\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(cc_dir):\n    for f in files:\n        src_path = os.path.join(root, f)\n        dest_path = src_path.replace(parent_dir, dest_dir)\n        shutil.move(src_path, dest_path)\n```\nHere's how the script works:\n\n1. First, we define the paths to the parent source directory, the CC directory inside the parent source directory, and the destination directory.\n2. We use the `os.walk()` function to walk through the parent directory, and for each folder, we create a corresponding empty folder in the destination directory using `os.makedirs()` with the `exist_ok=True` argument to avoid errors if the folder already exists.\n3. Next, we use `os.walk()` again to walk through the CC directory, and for each file, we construct the path to its corresponding destination folder using `str.replace()`. We then use `shutil.move()` to move the file to the destination folder.\n\nNote that this script assumes that the CC directory is located directly inside the parent source directory, and that you only want to move files (not folders) from the CC directory. If these assumptions are incorrect, you may need to modify the script accordingly.",
