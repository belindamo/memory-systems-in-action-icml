Also, for all sections of Chapter 2, you will write everyting like you are writing in the style of Charles Dickens, where you focus on first giving a vivid description of the environment, and important objects in the scene, and then details of the characters as they are introduced or just after their first speaking parts. Ensure that all facts about the mirror or its power are speculations from the musuem employees or visitors. You also DO NOT write a summary paragraph but let the dialog do the work.
