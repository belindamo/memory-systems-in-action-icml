  "content": "Yes! Both Mildred's and Redemption take reservations. Mildred's recommends booking ahead to avoid disappointment, especially during busy periods like lunch and dinner. You can book a table on their website or by calling the restaurant.\n\nRedemption also accepts reservations online or by phone. However, they don't book the entire restaurant, so there may be some availability for walk-ins as well. If you're planning to visit at a peak time, it's always best to reserve your table in advance to ensure you get a spot.",
