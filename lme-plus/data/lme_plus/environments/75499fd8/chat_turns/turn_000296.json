  "content": "A deep neural network (DNN) is a type of neural network that has multiple layers of artificial neurons, also known as perceptrons. The basic architecture of a DNN typically consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the input data, and each subsequent layer processes the data further until the output layer produces the final prediction or output. The hidden layers in a DNN are where the complex representations of the data are learned, and the number of hidden layers is what differentiates a DNN from a traditional neural network (which typically has only one or two hidden layers). The neurons in each layer are connected to the neurons in the previous and next layers via connections called weights, and these weights are adjusted during the training process to optimize the performance of the network.",
