  "content": "Let's do some science fiction world-building and idea workshopping. The overall theme/subgenre is going to be an Ecopunk adventure, and the primary setting, at first is going to be the tidally-heated forest moon of a gas giant in a distant star system, where a colony is established, but discoveries on the moon after the establishment of the colony will make them shift their focus from colonization to conservation.\n\nThe first thing I am going to need is the big picture area where it takes place, in a sector near the base of a spiral arm in a cluster of the older range of Population I stars. This typical-for-older-pop-I, unremarkable, main sequence star is the primary of the gas giant.\n\nThe gas giant is much larger than Jupiter, and has multiple ring systems and many major moons, minor moons, and moonlets, but this particular moon is the only one with life. It skirts the snow line of the primary, spending most of its year barely outside it, and part of it barely inside it.\n\nThe life on the tidally-heated forest moon, but there is remarkably Earth-like. However, there is a near-Earth-analogue (2nd-4th planet?), in terms of size, gravity, geology, and atmosphere, in the inner system that has bizarrely alien life by Earth standards. It is also somewhat geographically unstable and has severe weather. On the initial scans and survey of the system its high ESI made it the primary object for colonization but on closer inspection it was unsuitable. \n\nI need a detailed, plausible astronomical/cosmological description of the system using the best models about astrophysics and planetology you have available, including all relevant stellographical data about the primary, as well as the detailed orbital data (incl. major/minor/average axis-eccentricity, tilt, inclination) for each satellite, as well as the satellites geology, atmosphere if any, hydrology if any, etc. Include features like asteroid belts and the system's outer halo of Kuiper and Oort type objects.\n\nWe can get into the specifics of the moon that will be the focus of the story later, for now, I want as much detail as possible about the system itself.",
