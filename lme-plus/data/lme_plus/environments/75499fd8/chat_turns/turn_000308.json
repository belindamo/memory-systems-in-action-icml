  "content": "Information gain is a measure of the reduction in impurity or disorder after a split in a decision tree. It is calculated as the difference between the entropy or the Gini impurity before the split and the weighted average of the entropy or Gini impurity of each partition after the split.\n\nInformation gain is calculated using the following formula:\n\nInformation gain = Impurity before split - Weighted average of impurity of each partition after split\n\nwhere impurity before split is the entropy or Gini impurity before the split and the impurity of each partition after the split is the entropy or Gini impurity of each partition created by the split, weighted by the size of the partition.\n\nInformation gain is a way to measure the reduction in impurity or disorder of a split. The feature and threshold that result in the highest information gain are chosen as the split.\n\nInformation gain is not the same as entropy or Gini impurity, it's a measure of the reduction in impurity or disorder after a split in a decision tree, it's calculated as the difference between the entropy or the Gini impurity before the split and the weighted average of the entropy or Gini impurity of each partition after the split.\n\nIn summary, Information gain is a measure of the reduction in impurity or disorder after a split in a decision tree. It's calculated as the difference between the entropy or the Gini impurity before the split and the weighted average of the entropy or Gini impurity of each partition after the split. It's a way to measure the reduction in impurity or disorder of a split.",
