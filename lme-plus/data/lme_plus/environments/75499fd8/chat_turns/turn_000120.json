  "content": "It seems like there is an error in the syntax of the command. The multiplication operator should be enclosed in backticks or within `$()` to perform command substitution.\n\nTry the following command instead:\n```bash\nexpr $(( (100 - 40/3450) * 100 ))\n```\nThis should calculate the expression `(100 - 40/3450) * 100` and display the result using the `expr` command. The `$(( ))` syntax is used for arithmetic expansion in Bash, which allows you to perform mathematical operations within double parentheses.",
