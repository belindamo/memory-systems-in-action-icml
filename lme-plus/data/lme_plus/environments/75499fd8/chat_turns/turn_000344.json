  "content": "Indeed, the terms \"Kuiper Belt\" and \"Oort Cloud\" have become generic terms to describe similar regions in other star systems. Here are a few major Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) in the Xylophia-IV system:\n\n1. Xylophia-IV-KBO1 (Aeternum):\nAeternum is the largest known KBO in the Xylophia-IV system, with a diameter of approximately 1,200 km. Its surface is composed primarily of water ice mixed with darker organic material. Aeternum has a reddish hue and an elongated shape, suggesting it may be a contact binary or a close binary system.\n2. Xylophia-IV-KBO2 (Nixora):\nNixora is a moderately sized KBO, with a diameter of about 700 km. It has a highly inclined orbit, suggesting that it may have originated from a more distant region of the outer system. Nixora's surface is relatively bright, indicating the presence of fresh ice deposits.\n3. Xylophia-IV-KBO3 (Cryovale):\nCryovale is an irregularly shaped KBO with a diameter of approximately 550 km. Its surface is a mix of water ice and frozen methane, giving it a bluish tint. Cryovale has a very slow rotation period, taking more than 20 Earth days to complete one rotation.\n4. Xylophia-IV-KBO4 (Gelidon):\nGelidon is a small, elongated KBO with a diameter of around 300 km. Its surface is primarily composed of water ice and rock, with a scattering of small impact craters. Gelidon has a highly eccentric orbit, which occasionally brings it closer to the inner Kuiper Belt region.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many diverse KBOs that can be found within the Xylophia-IV Kuiper Belt, each with its own unique composition and orbital characteristics.",
