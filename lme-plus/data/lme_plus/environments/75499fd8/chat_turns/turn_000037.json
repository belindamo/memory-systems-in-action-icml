However, if you're still looking for a better match or want to explore other options, here are a few tips and recommendations:\n\n1. **Get a color match at multiple stores**: Visit different makeup counters, like MAC, Bobbi Brown, or Laura Mercier, and get color matched at each store. This will give you a better idea of your skin tone and undertones.\n2. **Consider your undertones**: Are you warm, cool, or neutral? Warm undertones look better with golden or yellow-based foundations, while cool undertones suit pink or blue-based foundations. Neutral undertones can pull off a wide range of shades.\n3. **Look for foundations with a wide shade range**: Brands like Fenty Beauty, Huda Beauty, and Make Up For Ever offer a diverse range of shades to cater to different skin tones.\n4. **Check online reviews and swatches**: Websites like Sephora, Ulta, and MakeupAlley often have customer reviews and swatches that can give you an idea of how a foundation looks on different skin tones.\n\nBased on your interest in Drunk Elephant, I'll assume you might prefer a more natural, skin-like finish. Here are a few foundation recommendations that might work for you:\n\n1. **Giorgio Armani Maestro Foundation**: This foundation offers a natural, buildable coverage with a wide range of shades. It's known for its skin-like finish and is suitable for combination skin.\n2. **Laura Mercier Foundation**: Laura Mercier offers a variety of foundation formulas, but their Silk Creme Foundation is a popular choice for its natural, buildable coverage and wide shade range.\n3. **NARS Sheer Glow Foundation**: If you liked the Nars foundation you purchased but want to explore other options, the Sheer Glow Foundation provides a natural, radiant finish with a medium to high coverage.\n4. **Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Foundation**: This foundation offers a natural, skin-like finish with a wide range of shades. It's known for its buildable coverage and is suitable for combination skin.\n\nRemember, the key to finding the perfect foundation match is to experiment, be patient, and don't be afraid to ask for help from makeup artists or skincare professionals.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find your perfect match!",
