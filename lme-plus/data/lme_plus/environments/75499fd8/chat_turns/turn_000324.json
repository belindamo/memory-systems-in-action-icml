  "content": "As an AI, I don't have personal biases, but a good recommendation for someone who is new to the comic book scene would be a convention that is in or near their area, so they do not have to go far. Fan Expo Canada, which is held annually in Toronto would be a good option as it is one of the largest comic book conventions in North America and has a broad range of activities for fans of all ages and interests including, comic book artists, special guests, cosplay, exhibitors and more. It's also a great place to meet other fans and make new friends who have similar interests in comics.",
