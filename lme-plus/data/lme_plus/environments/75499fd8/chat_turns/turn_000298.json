  "content": "Activation functions are used in neural networks for several reasons:\n\n1. Non-linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network, which allows the network to learn and represent more complex relationships between the inputs and outputs. Without non-linearity, a neural network would only be able to learn linear relationships.\n2. Introduce non-linearity to the output of each neuron : Activation functions allow the output of each neuron to be transformed, allowing the network to learn more complex patterns in the data.\n3. Allow for backpropagation : Activation functions, such as the sigmoid or rectified linear unit (ReLU) functions, are differentiable, which is crucial for the backpropagation algorithm used to train neural networks.\n4. Introduce sparsity: Some activation functions, such as the ReLU function, introduce sparsity to the output of the neurons, which can help to prevent overfitting.\n5. Normalization of output : Some activation functions like softmax, normalize the output of neurons to give a probability distribution of the classes, which helps in classification task.\n6. Introduce thresholding : Some activation functions like step function and rectified linear unit (ReLU) functions, introduce thresholding in the output of neurons, which can help to prevent overfitting.",
