He had short brown hair and piercing blue eyes that were often red and puffy from crying. His father had passed away a few years ago, leaving him and his mother alone in the world. Jack's mother worked at the museum, and he would often come there after school to wait for her to finish her shift.\n\nOne day, while wandering through the exhibits, Jack stumbled upon a mirror tucked away in a corner. It was ornately framed and caught his eye immediately. He stepped closer to get a better look and was surprised to find that the mirror seemed to glow, even though there was no light source nearby.\n\nSection 2: The boy becomes entranced by the mirror\n\nJack was immediately entranced by the mirror and would spend hours staring into it. He would often arrive at the museum early and stay late, just to have more time with the mirror. At first, he couldn't quite put his finger on what drew him to it. But the longer he looked, the more he felt like he was seeing something just out of reach.\n\nThe other museum employees noticed Jack's fascination with the mirror and thought it was a bit odd, but they didn't pay it too much mind. They had all seen stranger things in the museum over the years. But as the weeks went by, Jack's obsession with the mirror became more and more concerning.\n\nSection 3: The mirror shows the boy an alternate future where a tragedy from his past did not occur\n\nOne day, as Jack was staring into the mirror, he saw something that made him catch his breath. It was an alternate future where his father was still alive. In this future, Jack's father had never gotten sick, and he was there with Jack and his mother, laughing and smiling. They were all happy, and it was as if the past few years of pain and loss had never happened.\n\nJack was so taken aback by what he saw that he stumbled backwards, almost falling over. He knew it was just a reflection, but it felt so real. He became obsessed with seeing this alternate future again and would spend even more time staring into the mirror, hoping to catch another glimpse of what could have been.\n\nAs the days went by, Jack's behavior became more erratic, and he started to neglect his schoolwork and other responsibilities. His mother noticed that something was off and tried to talk to him about it, but he brushed her off, saying he was just tired.\n\nLittle did she know that he was being consumed by the mirror, and the alternate future it showed him.",
