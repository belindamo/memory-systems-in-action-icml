No need more any comments.\n\nAirbnb in 2020\n\nOVERVIEW OF ACCOMMODATION MARKET\nHotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts competed within the larger, tourist accommodation market. All businesses operating within this sector offered lodg- ing but were differentiated by their amenities. Hotels and motels were defined as larger facilities accom- modating guests in single or multiple rooms. Motels specifically offered smaller rooms with direct parking lot access from the unit and amenities such as laun- dry facilities to travelers who were using their own transportation. Motels might also be located closer to roadways, providing guests quicker and more con- venient access to highways. It was also not uncom- mon for motel guests to segment a longer road trip as they commuted to a vacation destination, thereby potentially staying at several motels during their travel. Hotels, however, invested heavily in additional amenities as they competed for all segments of trav- elers. Amenities, including on-premise spa facilities and fine dining, were often offered by the hotel.\nFurther, properties offering spectacular views, bol- stering a hotel as the vacation destination, may con- tribute to significant operating costs. In total, wages, property, and utilities, as well as purchases such as food, accounted for 78 percent of the industry\u2019s total costs\u2014see Exhibit 1.
