It's always nice to support local music shops and show appreciation for good work.\n\nHowever, I should mention that I'm a large language model, I don't have any information about a specific GuitarWorks on 5th street. I think you might have mentioned it earlier as a recommendation for other guitarists, but I don't have any knowledge about its existence or location.\n\nIf you're planning to visit a guitar shop, you might want to double-check the address and hours of operation to make sure it's convenient for you. But it's great that you're thinking of showing appreciation for good work!\n\nRemember to have fun trying out the Mustang II and finding the right drumheads for your set. Playing music is all about having a good time and enjoying the process, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further recommendations!",
