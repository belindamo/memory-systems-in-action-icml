  "content": "International factors have played a significant role in the evolution of democracy in Latin America, particularly the role of the United States in supporting authoritarian regimes in the region.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States viewed Latin America as a front line in the battle against communism and supported a number of authoritarian regimes in the region. This included providing military and economic assistance to governments that were known for their human rights violations, such as the military governments in Chile and Argentina in the 1970s. The United States also supported coups d'etat that overthrew democratically-elected governments, such as the 1954 coup in Guatemala.\n\nThese actions had a profound impact on the region, as they helped to entrench authoritarian regimes and undermine democratic movements. The United States often prioritized its national security interests over support for democratic institutions in the region, which contributed to a perception among many Latin American citizens that the United States was not committed to democratic values.\n\nIn recent years, the United States has attempted to redress this history by apologizing for its past actions and supporting democratic movements and institutions in the region. However, the legacy of U.S. intervention in Latin America remains a significant factor in the region's political landscape.\n\nIt is worth noting that other international actors, such as regional organizations like the Organization of American States and international NGOs, have also played important roles in supporting democratic movements and institutions in Latin America. Additionally, economic globalization and international trade agreements have also impacted democracy in the region by influencing economic policies and social structures.",
