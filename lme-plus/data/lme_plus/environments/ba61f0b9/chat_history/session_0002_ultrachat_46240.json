      "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot confirm the exact resources and budget of your non-profit organization, but in general, there are still practical measures that non-profits can take to attract and retain donors, even with limited resources:\n\n1. Identify and prioritize your most loyal donors: Your organization may not be able to retain every single donor, but identifying and prioritizing your most loyal donors is a good place to start. Thank them for their contributions, keep them engaged with your organization, and ask for their feedback and input.\n\n2.

Focus on a few simple strategies that work best for your organization and make sure they are executed well.\n\n3. Build relationships with local businesses: Partnering with local businesses can be a great way to raise funds and increase exposure for your organization, even with limited resources. Consider reaching out to businesses that share your values and mission.\n\n4.

It's easy and free to use, but make sure to use it effectively by highlighting impact stories, sharing fundraising campaigns, and engaging with followers.\n\n5.
