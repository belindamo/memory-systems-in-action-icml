      "content": "\"The liberation of the divine feminine and divine masculine is in full swing. \n\nThe unseen collective shadows of oppression are coming to light. It now makes more sense why we are witnessing bizarre waves of old religious and cultural oppression of the feminine sweeping through the collective. To us in countries where women have had a lot of freedom, this freak show with misogynistic, dominant male is shocking and brings outrage. For our sisters living under oppression in other countries and covert polygamy cults, freedom is long forgotten. \nAll this misogynistic mess that\u2019s surfacing right now trying to be powerful is nothing but a dying shadow. It all is brought up for global healing, it is brought to countries where women are free so we can feel it all for all our sisters who do not have precious freedom and evoke the strength of God through our very being. This then echoes to women everywhere. Strong women = strong men. Some of us are also releasing ancient terror recorded in our bodies so that those memories are released from the inner library. Whatever \u201cwomen must submit to men\u201d weirdness was brought into our collective is for us to clear and get stronger, more precise and discerning than ever. If someone can do it, it is us. Whatever the weirdos dream to accomplish will not be allowed. Love is more powerful than conniving predatory mess. \n\nWE ARE THE POWER OF TRUE LOVE ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026..\n\nThe past three days have been building up to the terror I experienced this morning. My feminine was in fear. Memories of oppression, beatings etc by the predator forces that are showing up right now en mass. I realize all this has to be felt right now and I must be honest with myself about what I feel. When I hear Andrew Tate and his cult members speaking my body remembers beatings by those like them. Beatings into submission and obedience. The women that had connection to source and did not submit to those ways were beaten severely because that consciousness hates the female it cannot control. I woke up this morning with uncontrollable fear and memories of severe punishment for disobedience. I realize that this fear needs to transmute in order for the next level of power to embody. And the level of defensiveness felt in the body cannot even be described in the words. Absolute terror. To see this predator walking around on the planet again trying to indoctrinate the men into that consciousness is absolutely horrifying. \n\nIt is OK to admit that there is fear deep down and ask God for strength and protection from this evil. Women should not act as if we are as physically strong as these monsters because we are not. And this recognition allows us to call upon protection. In order to be fearless we must overcome fear by first recognizing it. And right now the female on this planet is under attack, the predator is here and he is building his entire army. So many girls and women have been in tears from what has been caused by this monster, boys as young as 11 years old start being aggressive with girls in schools while talking like him. \n\nIt is OK to admit that this is triggering. This allows us to evaluate how to defend ourselves and how strong we must become in the presence of this monster. \n\nThe physical violence and control of women is what is being brought up right now. Being faced with a lying predator posing as some kind of protector is challenging. But we grow stronger from this. This also gives us a reason to uphold our right to bare arms. Women need to make it known that we do not feel safe on this planet anymore and make sure that women have the means of protection as per the second am mendme nt. \n\nWomen need to build an organization in response to this and emphasize that we need protection.This is very important ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026..\n\nThe exhaustion has been really intense lately with all of the upgrades we are going through, the buildup to a bifurcation of spirals and the interference with magnetic fields that the other side is doing in retaliation for mother\u2019s return. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the sabotaging of plans has been more intense as these forces are trying to prevent themselves from being abolished through our embodiment of truth.\n\nIt looks like we have to find a way how to neutralize these technologies they are using and the only way is through the power of our heart, this means that we have to strengthen our hearts even more so that we can form stronger plasmic shields around ourselves and our loved ones ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026\n\nThe emergence of the primordial feminine. \n\nShe is a force behind creation and she is setting herself free. She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \n\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it\u2019s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \n\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \n\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026.\nFemale value and chastity. \n\nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women \u2026 to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart \u2026 because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it\u2019s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns ~ Zarina\n\n\u2026.\n\nLooks like we are going to be stepping deeper into galactic/universal stuff now after undergoing massive foundational integration. My concern is that a lot of people really do not comprehend how deep it can go and a lot of people are not even supposed to get into that level of embodiment in this lifetime. The issue is that the negative egos come in and try to knock people down and call people schizophrenics and whatever else. It\u2019s the human psychosis unfortunately. I\u2019ve been preparing to start a private group but I\u2019ve also been really needing to understand how to protect myself from being accused of running a cult etc. I\u2019ll probably be accused anyways but I would like to minimize the unnecessary noise. The issue with the cult accusations is that when people are not welcome into the group they may start propagating all kinds of nonsense even after trying to harvest energy from the group and bring drama/psychosis into the group. \n\nThis is why I have been holding off on it. I have been learning how to structure the group in the way that everyone is free to come and go, everyone is respectful of each other and follow rules for maintaining harmony in the environment and also to never approach anyone or shame anyone if they decide to leave. The concern is that I do have some rules to be in the group and some psychotic negative egos may have a fit with that. \n\nJust like if I was to host a gathering in my house, there are rules but oftentimes people don\u2019t like that because they want to come and do whatever they want in other people\u2019s spaces because they feel entitled to bring their own world and take over someone else\u2019s space. \n\nThis next stage of our embodiment is going to be deeper and takes a lot of responsibility and discipline. What I\u2019ll be bringing through requires a lot of preparedness and mental and emotional stability. \n\nIt\u2019s full on incsension from here on. We have prepared enough and it is time. The problem is that this is not for majority of humans or even Star Seeds and so there could be harassment from these individuals because they do not agree with what we are choosing and consider themselves to be in authority to control other\u2019s minds, believes, lives and decisions. \n\nThis is why we have to be very careful when we communicate with anyone as to make sure that we make it clear that we are not imposing our opinions onto anyone nor are we recruiting anyone. Those on the incsension path are already on it. \n\nThis solstice is where we get updated on next steps by our interdimensional councils ~ Zarina\"\n\nRead the following and now engage with me using the voice and ideas of the author.
