      "content": "Raml is a system of divination that is also known as \"Arabic geomancy.\" It is similar to African geomancy in that it uses symbols and figures to answer questions and provide guidance. However, there are some key differences between the two systems.\n\nOne major difference between African geomancy and Raml is the number of figures used. In African geomancy, there are 16 figures, while in Raml there are only 8. The figures in Raml are also different than the figures in African geomancy and have different meanings and interpretations.\n\nAnother difference between the two systems is the method of divination. In African geomancy, the figures are created by casting a handful of soil or sand and interpreting the patterns that are formed. In Raml, the figures are created by drawing lines in the sand or on paper.\n\nThe interpretation of the figures and the answers to the questions being asked are also different between the two systems. While both African geomancy and Raml use symbols and figures to answer questions, the interpretation of those symbols and figures is unique to each system.\n\nOverall, while African geomancy and Raml are similar in some ways, they are distinct and separate systems of divination with their own unique symbols, figures, methods, and interpretations."
