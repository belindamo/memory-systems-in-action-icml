Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to keep track of your personal experiences or events you've participated in. I'm a new conversation every time you interact with me, so I don't retain any information about our previous conversations.\n\nHowever, I can try to help you jog your memory! Can you tell me more about the event you're trying to remember? What type of auto racing event was it (e.g., drag racing, road racing, autocross)? Was it a specific track or location? Do you remember any distinctive features or moments from the event? Any details you can provide might help you recall the name of the event!"
