  "content": "One interesting Welsh myth that could make a good painting is the story of Blodeuwedd. Blodeuwedd is a woman made out of flowers by the wizard Gwydion to be the wife of Lleu Llaw Gyffes. However, she falls in love with another man and plots to kill her husband. As punishment, she is turned into an owl and is doomed to spend eternity alone in the night sky. The imagery of a woman made of flowers and her transformation into an owl could make for a striking and unique painting.",
