It's also a great option for a low-key Sunday lunch with your parents.\n\nHere are a few tips to make it even more special:\n\n* **Choose a good quality marinara sauce**: You can use store-bought or homemade marinara sauce. If you have the time, make your own using fresh tomatoes, garlic, and herbs.\n* **Select a variety of vegetables**: Steamed vegetables like broccoli, carrots, green beans, and zucchini are all great options. You can also add some cherry tomatoes or asparagus for extra flavor and color.\n* **Add some protein**: Consider adding some grilled chicken, saut\u00e9ed shrimp, or sliced meatballs to make the dish more substantial.\n* **Use a variety of pasta**: Penne, spaghetti, or linguine work well with marinara sauce. You can also try using whole wheat pasta for a healthier option.\n* **Add some garlic bread**: Serve the pasta with some garlic bread or crusty bread on the side for a comforting touch.\n\nI'm sure your parents will appreciate the effort you put into making a delicious and satisfying meal. Enjoy your Sunday lunch together!",
