  "content": "Another interesting Welsh myth that could make for a good painting is the story of Afagddu, also known as the \"most ugly man.\" According to legend, Afagddu was born so hideously ugly that his mother died of shock upon seeing him. Despite his appearance, he was a powerful druid and poet, and was able to see the beauty in the world that others could not. A painting depicting Afagddu, showcasing his inner beauty and wisdom, despite his physical appearance, could be a powerful and thought-provoking piece of art.",
