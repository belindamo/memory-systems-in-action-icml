  "content": "Sure, here are some examples of foods that are rich in enzymes:\n- Pineapple: Pineapple contains the enzyme bromelain, which helps break down protein. - Papaya: Papaya contains the enzyme papain, which aids in the digestion of protein. - Mango: Mango contains the enzyme amylase, which helps break down carbohydrates. - Avocado: Avocado contains the enzyme lipase, which helps break down fats. - Fermented foods: Fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and miso contain various enzymes that aid in digestion. It's important to note that while eating foods rich in enzymes can support digestion, the body also produces its own enzymes. Furthermore, some enzymes may be destroyed during cooking and processing, so it's important to eat a balanced diet with both raw and cooked foods to ensure optimum enzyme intake.",
