I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to keep track of specific events or results, so I didn't actually know about your participation in a drag racing event called \"Turbocharged\" on March 17th.\n\nBut I'm happy to chat with you about your experience and offer advice or guidance on improving your drag racing skills! A 12.8-second quarter-mile time is a great achievement, by the way! What do you think contributed to your personal best time? Was there anything you did differently in terms of your driving technique, car setup, or strategy?",
