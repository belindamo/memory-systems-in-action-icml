  "content": "have a cool animated grid overlay effect on the objects using the new material. The grid will appear and disappear smoothly, following the sinusoidal oscillation determined by the animation speed property. You can further customize the effect by tweaking the properties such as grid frequency, animation speed, and grid opacity to suit your specific requirements.\n\nAdditionally, if you want the grid to animate only on certain objects or areas, you can use vertex colors or a mask texture to control the grid's visibility. To do this:\n\n1. Add a \"Sample Texture 2D\" node to your Shader Graph and create a new \"Texture2D\" property for it. Name it \"Mask Texture\". Connect the \"UV\" node's output to the \"UV\" input of the \"Sample Texture 2D\" node.\n2. Add a \"Channel\" node and connect the \"RGBA\" output of the \"Sample Texture 2D\" node to its input. Choose a color channel that you would like to use as the mask (e.g., Red).\n3. Add a \"Multiply\" node and connect the output of the \"Channel\" node to the first input and the output of the \"Multiply\" node (grid opacity) to the second input.\n4. Connect the output of this new \"Multiply\" node to the second input of the \"Add\" node.\n\nNow, the grid animation will be controlled by the mask texture, allowing you to define specific areas where the grid appears and animates. Paint the mask texture accordingly, with white representing the grid lines and black representing the background.",
