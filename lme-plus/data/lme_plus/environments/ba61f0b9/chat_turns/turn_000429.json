  "content": "Yes, social media and augmented reality filters can make a significant difference in how engaged students are with the student union. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Social media is a powerful platform: Social media has the power to reach a vast number of students, from all over the world. By using social media, student unions can reach students who may have otherwise been unaware of the events, initiatives, or campaigns they organize.\n\n2. Gives students a sense of participation: Social media and augmented reality filters can give students a sense of participation when engaging with the student union activities. By offering interactive and engaging opportunities, students are actively involved in the campaign or event, which makes them more likely to participate.\n\n3. Brings a human element to the student union: Social media platforms, when managed correctly, offer a personal connection between the student union representatives and the student body. By using social media and augmented reality filters, student unions can offer a new, modern way to do student union work.\n\n4. Offers sharable content: By using augmented reality filters and other social media campaigns, student unions can offer students sharable content, making them more likely to spread the word and drive further engagement.\n\n5. Improves transparency: A virtual suggestion box allows student unions to provide an outlet through which students can quickly and easily offer up their thoughts and ideas, increasing transparency.\n\nOverall, social media and augmented reality filters provide a means for student unions to connect with students in a way that is relevant, personal, and interactive. This, in turn, can increase engagement, improve the sense of belonging, and drive further involvement in student union initiatives.",
