  "content": "The code you provided uses the `ord()` function to convert a letter representing a note (A-G) to its corresponding ASCII value, and then adds a fixed offset (60) to get the MIDI note value. To support sharp notes (e.g. A#, C#, etc.), you can modify the code as follows:\n```\n        # Extract the note and octave from the input\n        note, octave = note[:-1], int(note[-1])\n\n        # Check if the note is sharp\n        if \"#\" in note:\n            note_num = midi.A_4 + (ord(note[0]) - ord('A')) + (octave - 4) * 12 + 1\n        else:\n            note_num = midi.A_4 + (ord(note[0]) - ord('A')) + (octave - 4) * 12\n```\nThis code first splits the input note into its base note and octave, then it checks if the note is sharp by looking for the \"#\" character in the base note, if it is sharp it add 1 to the note number, otherwise it uses the same calculation as before, then it adds the octave \\* 12.\n\nYou might need to adjust the code to your use case, for example, you might need to change the octave offset or the way the notes are represented.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other question.",
