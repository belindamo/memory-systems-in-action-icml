This will give you a physical copy of your files, which can be useful in case you need to access them quickly or if you're offline. You can set up a regular backup schedule to automate the process.\n\n**Cloud Backup for Added Protection:**\n\nIn addition to your local backup, using a cloud backup service will provide an extra layer of protection for your files. This way, you'll have two copies of your files: one locally on your external hard drive and another in the cloud.\n\n**3-2-1 Backup Strategy:**\n\nYou're unknowingly following the 3-2-1 backup strategy, which is a great approach:\n\n1. **Three copies of your data**: You'll have three copies of your files: the original files on your laptop, the local backup on your external hard drive, and the cloud backup.\n2. **Two different storage types**: You're using two different storage types: a local external hard drive and cloud storage.\n3. **One offsite copy**: Your cloud backup provides an offsite copy of your files, which is safely stored in a remote location.\n\n**Benefits of Combining Local and Cloud Backup:**\n\nBy using both local and cloud backup methods, you'll enjoy:\n\n* Faster data recovery in case of a local failure (from your external hard drive)\n* Added protection against natural disasters, theft, or physical damage (with cloud backup)\n* Flexibility to access your files from anywhere, on any device with an internet connection (cloud backup)\n* Redundancy in case one backup method fails or is compromised\n\n**Choose a Cloud Backup Service:**\n\nNow, you can select a cloud backup service that complements your local backup setup. Consider the cloud backup services I mentioned earlier, and choose one that fits your needs and budget.\n\nRemember to set up a regular backup schedule for both your local and cloud backups to ensure your files are consistently protected.",
