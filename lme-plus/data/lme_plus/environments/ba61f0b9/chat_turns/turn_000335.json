  "content": "I'm currently using Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest for GreenCycle. My top three goals are to increase website traffic, build brand awareness, and engage with customers. I typically post product showcases and behind-the-scenes content. I'd like to post at least three times a week on each platform, but I'm open to adjusting the schedule based on your recommendations. I don't have any specific themes or campaigns in mind, but I'd like to feature some of the products I met at the craft fair, like the sustainable fashion brand I mentioned.",
