  "content": "That's a great plan! Expedia and Booking.com are both excellent choices for finding hotels. They offer a wide range of options, competitive prices, and user-friendly interfaces.\n\nFor a hotel close to downtown Denver with easy access to public transportation, I'd recommend considering the following neighborhoods:\n\n1. **LoDo (Lower Downtown)**: This historic neighborhood is right in the heart of downtown Denver, with plenty of hotels, restaurants, and shops. You'll be within walking distance to Union Station, which offers easy access to public transportation, including the RTD Light Rail and buses.\n2. **Larimer Square**: This upscale neighborhood is just a few blocks from LoDo and offers a mix of high-end hotels, boutiques, and restaurants. You'll be close to the 16th Street Mall, a pedestrian mall lined with shops and restaurants, and within walking distance to Union Station.\n3. **Uptown**: This neighborhood is just north of downtown and offers a more laid-back vibe. You'll find a mix of boutique hotels, restaurants, and bars, and it's still within walking distance to downtown and Union Station.\n\nWhen searching for hotels, you can filter by neighborhood, price, and amenities like \"public transportation nearby\" or \"walkable to downtown.\" You can also read reviews from other travelers to get a sense of the hotel's quality and location.\n\nRemember to also consider the hotel's distance to the attractions and activities you plan to do in Denver. If you have any specific interests or preferences, feel free to share, and I can give you more tailored recommendations.\n\nOnce you've booked your flight and hotel, you can start planning the fun part \u2013 exploring Denver!",
