  "content": "Yes, the average salary for a registered nurse (RN) in the United States is approximately $75,000 per year. However, this can vary depending on factors such as education level, experience, specialty, and location. RNs who work in metropolitan areas may earn higher salaries than those who work in rural areas, for example. Additionally, RNs who have advanced degrees or certifications may earn more than those with only a basic nursing degree.
