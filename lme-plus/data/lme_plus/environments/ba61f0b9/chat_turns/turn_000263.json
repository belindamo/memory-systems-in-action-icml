Here's the updated table:\n\n**Trek FX 3 Hybrid Bike**\n\n| Date | Vehicle | Category | Description | Cost | Mileage | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 01/25/2023 | Trek FX 3 Hybrid Bike | Repairs | Flat Rear Tire Repair | ? |  |  |\n\nI didn't fill in the cost, as you didn't mention the exact amount. Please let me know how much the repair cost, and I'll add it to the table.\n\nAlso, I assume you don't need to track mileage for your bike, so I left that column blank. If you want to track mileage or any other metric, just let me know!\n\nOnce you provide the cost, I'll update the table. Then, we can move on to your 2015 Yamaha FZ6R motorcycle expenses.",
