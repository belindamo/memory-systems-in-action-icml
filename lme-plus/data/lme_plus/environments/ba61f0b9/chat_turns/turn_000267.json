I'm here to help you track your expenses!\n\nHowever, if you want to add those expenses to the template for your 2015 Yamaha FZ6R motorcycle, I'd be happy to help! Please confirm the details:\n\n* February 19th, filled up gas tank, cost $25\n* February 10th, ordered brake pads online, cost ?\n\nLet me know the cost of the brake pads, and I'll add both expenses to the template.",
