  "content": "Yes, promoting augmented reality filters can be just as crucial as creating them. After you create the filter, the key is to get it in front of as many students as possible through promotional efforts. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Promote the filter on all social media channels: Share the AR filter on all your student union's social media channels, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. This will help ensure that students who follow your student union will see it.\n\n2. Use hashtags: Use relevant hashtags, such as #studentlife, #campuslife or specific event hashtags that can help students find your filter when they're searching on social media.\n\n3. Collaborate with influencers: Reach out to social media influencers who have a wide following among the student community, to promote the filter on their accounts. By leveraging their following, you can reach a broader audience and get more students to use your filter.\n\n4. Include it in your student union's app: If your student union has an app, consider integrating the filter and make it available within the app. This will encourage students to use it and also spend more time engaging with the student union's app.\n\n5. Create a special event: Create a special event to promote the filter, bring students together to try out the filter, and take photos or videos with it.\n\n6. Use email marketing: Send out newsletters to your student union's mailing list and include the filter as part of the content. This will drive attention to your filter, especially if the email list is extensive.\n\n7. Free Merchandise giveaway: Give away free merchandise at student union events or other organized events to anyone who uses the filter and shares a post containing the filter while tagging the student union's account. This incentivizes students to engage and offers a tangible reward.\n\nBy using these strategies, you can promote your augmented reality filter and get more students to use it, leading to increased engagement and building the student union's brand.",
