I especially like the idea of categorizing and grouping similar items together, and using labels to identify what's inside each container. I'll have to check out some pantry organizers online and see what would work best for my space.\n\nBy the way, have you heard about any good composting methods for food waste? I've been trying to reduce my waste in the kitchen, and I'm looking for some tips on how to compost effectively.",
