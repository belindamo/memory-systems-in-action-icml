It's always helpful to have the exact address of your destination to ensure you arrive at the correct location.\n\nPlease go ahead and check with your mom to get the address of the lake house, and feel free to share it with me when you're ready. I'll be happy to assist you with directions and any other questions you may have.\n\nIn the meantime, you might also want to ask your mom if she has any other useful information about the trip, such as:\n\n* The best route to take to avoid traffic or road closures\n* Any specific instructions for finding the lake house or parking\n* Information about the lake house itself, such as the amenities available or any specific rules or regulations\n\nOnce you have the address, I can provide you with turn-by-turn directions and help you prepare for a smooth and enjoyable trip to the lake house!",
