  "content": "The digestive system absorbs nutrients from food through several steps. First, in the mouth, food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin to break down carbohydrates. The food then travels down the esophagus into the stomach, where it is mixed with more enzymes and gastric juices that break down proteins.\n\nNext, the partially digested food moves into the small intestine, where more enzymes from the pancreas and small intestine break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into smaller molecules such as amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids. These smaller molecules are then absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine.\n\nThe role of enzymes in this process is to break down the large, complex molecules in food into smaller, simpler molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Enzymes are catalysts that speed up chemical reactions, making the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the body more efficient. Without enzymes, the body would not be able to break down food into absorbable nutrients, and proper nutrition could not be achieved.",
