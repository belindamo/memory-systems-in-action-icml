I'd be happy to provide you with some recommendations for games and activities that are perfect for kids at the lake house!\n\nA scavenger hunt is an excellent idea, and I'm sure the kids had a blast! Here are a few more ideas you might consider:\n\n1. **Lake-themed crafts**: Set up a craft station with materials like paper, glue, scissors, and paint, and let the kids create their own lake-inspired masterpieces.\n2. **Water games**: Depending on the lake house's rules and the age of the kids, you could set up a water balloon toss, have a water gun fight, or even organize a game of \"Sharks and Minnows\" in the lake.\n3. **Nature walks**: Take the kids on a guided nature walk around the lake house property, encouraging them to observe and collect leaves, rocks, or other natural treasures.\n4. **Fishing**: If the lake house allows fishing, consider setting up a simple fishing station with kid-friendly gear and bait. This can be a great way to teach kids about patience and the importance of conservation.\n5. **Campfire activities**: If the lake house has a fire pit, consider setting up a campfire and having the kids make s'mores, tell ghost stories, or sing campfire songs.\n6. **Lake-themed treasure hunt**: Create a treasure hunt with clues and riddles that lead the kids around the lake house property, ending with a hidden treasure chest filled with lake-themed goodies.\n7. **Outdoor movie night**: Set up an outdoor movie screen or projector and watch a kid-friendly movie under the stars.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started. You could also consider bringing along board games, card games, or outdoor games like cornhole, ladder toss, or badminton to keep the kids entertained.\n\nRemember to always supervise the kids during these activities and ensure their safety near the lake.\n\nI hope these ideas help, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you with the lake house address and any other details!",
