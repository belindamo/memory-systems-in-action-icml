Each line represents one note, with the letter of the note (C#, D#, F#, G#) followed by the duration (in ticks) to hold that note.\nThe melody starts with the F# note, followed by the sequence of notes F#, G, F#, G, F#, G, F#, G, F#, G, F#, G, D#, F#, D#, F#, D#, F#, D#, F#, C#, F#, C#, F#, C#, F#, C#, F#, C#, G#, C#, G#, C#, G#, C#, G#\n\nPlease note that this is just a simple example, in real use cases you will have many notes and durations, and you might need to adjust the program accordingly. Also, the melody is not exactly the same as the original one.",
