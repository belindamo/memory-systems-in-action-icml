I've been meaning to get a compost bin for a while now, and your tips have given me the motivation to finally take the plunge. I'll make sure to balance my green and brown materials, add water, and mix regularly to create a healthy compost pile.\n\nBy the way, I've been thinking about redoing my kitchen backsplash, and I was wondering if you have any advice on choosing the right material. I've been looking at glass tile and marble, but I'm not sure which one would be best for my kitchen.",
