And using a preferment like a biga is a great way to add complexity and depth to your bread!\n\nA biga is a type of Italian preferment that's essentially a small, naturally leavened sponge that's added to the dough to enhance the flavor and texture. Here's a simple recipe for a sourdough biga that you can use in your bread recipe:\n\n**Sourdough Biga Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 100g sourdough starter (active and bubbly)\n* 100g bread flour\n* 50g water\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a clean glass or ceramic container, mix together the sourdough starter, bread flour, and water until just combined. The mixture should be shaggy and rough.\n2. Cover the container with a cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature (around 75\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F) for 12 to 14 hours.\n3. After 12 to 14 hours, the biga should have expanded and have a few large bubbles on the surface. It should also have a slightly sour, fruity aroma.\n4. Once the biga is ready, you can use it in your bread recipe. Simply add it to the dough along with the other ingredients and mix until just combined.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a mature, active sourdough starter for the best results.\n* Keep the biga at room temperature during the fermentation period. This will help it develop faster and more evenly.\n* If you're short on time, you can also ferment the biga for 8 to 10 hours, but the flavor and texture might not be as developed.\n* You can store the biga in the fridge for up to 24 hours or freeze it for up to 2 months. Just thaw it at room temperature or in the fridge before using.\n\nWhen using the biga in your bread recipe, you can replace up to 20% of the total flour with the biga. For example, if your recipe calls for 1000g of flour, you can use 800g of flour and 200g of biga.\n\nRemember to adjust the water content and mixing time according to your recipe and the type of flour you're using. And don't overmix the dough! \n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to hear how your next loaf turns out with the biga!",
