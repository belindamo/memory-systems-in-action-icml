Since I'm a text-based AI, I don't have access to your personal location or the exact address of the lake house.\n\nCould you please provide me with the following information:\n\n1. The city or zip code of your starting point (your house)?\n2. The city or zip code of the lake house?\n\nAlternatively, you can also give me the exact addresses of both locations, and I can provide you with turn-by-turn directions using Google Maps.\n\nAdditionally, I can offer some general tips to help you prepare for your trip:\n\n* Make sure to check the weather forecast before you leave and plan accordingly.\n* Fill up on gas and make sure your vehicle is in good condition before embarking on your trip.\n* Consider checking for any road closures or construction along your route.\n* Bring snacks, water, and entertainment for the road to make the drive more enjoyable.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you!",
