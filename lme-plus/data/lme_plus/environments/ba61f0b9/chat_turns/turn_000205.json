  "content": "That's a great idea to create a separate playlist for guitar inspiration! Having a dedicated playlist for guitar motivation can help you stay focused and excited about playing.\n\nAs for including songs you want to learn to play on the guitar in this playlist, it's a great idea! Adding songs you're interested in learning can serve as a reminder and motivator to practice and improve your skills. You can also use this playlist as a goal-oriented list, where you can track your progress and feel a sense of accomplishment as you learn and master each song.\n\nHowever, you might want to consider creating a separate playlist for songs you want to learn, alongside your \"Guitar Inspiration\" playlist. This way, you can keep your motivational playlist focused on songs that inspire and energize you, while having a separate list for songs you're actively working on learning.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n* \"Guitar Inspiration\" playlist: Focus on songs that motivate and inspire you to play guitar, with a mix of genres and styles that keep you excited and engaged.\n* \"Guitar Goals\" playlist: Create a separate playlist for songs you want to learn to play, with a focus on specific techniques, styles, or artists you're interested in mastering. This playlist can help you stay organized and track your progress as you work on learning new songs.\n\nBy having both playlists, you can use your \"Guitar Inspiration\" playlist to get pumped up and motivated, and then switch to your \"Guitar Goals\" playlist to focus on learning and improving your skills.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process of learning and playing guitar!",
