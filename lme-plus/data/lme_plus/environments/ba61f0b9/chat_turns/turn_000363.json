  "content": "Yes, there are several apps and tools available that can help you to limit your time on social media. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. Offtime - This app helps you to disconnect from your phone and other apps that take up your time. It tracks your phone usage and helps you to set time limits for apps. 2. StayFocusd \u2013 This is a browser extension that lets you block or limit access to certain websites, including social media websites. 3. Forest - This app helps you stay away from your phone by using gamification techniques. You plant a virtual tree and if you leave the app before the time is up, the tree dies. 4. Freedom - With Freedom, you can block websites and apps for a certain amount of time. 5. Rescue Time - RescueTime tracks the websites and apps you use, and helps you set goals and limits for your usage. 6. Space - Similar to Offtime, Space helps you disconnect and focus by blocking unnecessary apps and notifications. I hope you find one of these apps helpful to limit your social media usage and stay focused on your goals!",
