It's great that you were adventurous enough to try them, and even better that you enjoyed them!\n\nNow, about your revised itinerary, 5 days in Tokyo and 5 days in Kyoto is an excellent split. This will give you a good balance of time to explore both cities without feeling rushed. You'll have ample opportunity to discover Tokyo's vibrant neighborhoods, try various foods, and visit famous attractions like Shibuya Crossing, Tokyo Tower, and the Tsukiji Fish Market.\n\nIn Kyoto, you'll have time to explore the city's stunning temples and gardens, such as the Fushimi Inari Shrine, Kinkaku-ji Temple, and the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. You can also wander through the traditional Gion district, visit the Nijo Castle, and take a stroll along the Philosopher's Path. With 5 days, you can take your time to soak in the atmosphere and enjoy the city's serene beauty.\n\nTo make the most of your time, consider creating a rough outline of your daily plans for each city. This will help you prioritize your activities, ensure you don't miss anything important, and leave some room for spontaneity. You can always adjust your plans as you go along, but having a general idea of what you want to do each day will help you make the most of your time.\n\nSome tips for your time in Kyoto:\n\n* Consider purchasing a Kyoto City Bus Pass, which grants you unlimited access to public transportation for a set period. This can be very convenient for getting around the city.\n* Be prepared for crowds at popular attractions, especially during peak travel seasons. Try to visit these places early in the morning or later in the evening to avoid the bulk of the tourists.\n* Don't be afraid to explore Kyoto's smaller, less touristy neighborhoods, like Kurama or Ohara. These areas offer a more local, laid-back atmosphere and can be a great way to experience the city's daily life.\n* Take your time to enjoy the city's food scene, which is famous for its kaiseki (multi-course) meals, shojin-ryori (Buddhist vegetarian cuisine), and yudofu (boiled tofu).\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for you to start planning your Japan adventure!",
