  "content": "Part 32 Clause 27 of the contract is headed \u201cFinal Certificate\u201d. It comes after clause 26 which is headed \u201cPractical Completion\u201d. It states:\n27.1 Unless stated elsewhere in this contract, the builder is not required to obtain any certificate of occupancy or final inspection certificate relating to the building works.\nClause 29 of the contract is headed \u201cDefects Liability Period\u201d. It states:\n29.1 The defects liability period is a period of 26 weeks commencing on and including the date of practical completion. [Note: The standard form contract provides for a 13 week period. In this contract \u201c13\u201d is struck through and \u201c26\u201d inserted. The amendment is initialled.]\n29.2 The owner may, before the end of the defects liability period, give the builder a list of defects in the building works that appear after the date of practical completion.\n29.3 The builder must rectify defects that are the builder\u2019s responsibility and which are notified to the builder during the defects liability period.\nClause 14 of Schedule 1 specifies that Tender No 2277 dated 22 January 2009 (the Tender) forms part of the contract. The Tender (at page 194 of the Hearing Bundle) specifies that the basic tender price includes the Council Development Application and Inspection Fees. The tender price does not include provision of the FOC. The Tender specifies the work to be completed by the owners prior to the issue of an occupation certificate: items 18, 19 and 20 which concern lighting and the installation of outdoor and indoor clothes lines.\nWe are of the view that the Tribunal misinterpreted the contract when it concluded that the builder was responsible for obtaining the FOC as part of the works to be carried out and that the works were therefore not complete until the FOC was provided to the owners\nFirst, cl 27 clearly states that the builder is not responsible for obtaining the FOC. The contract (including the Tender) does not otherwise provide that the builder is responsible for doing so. This is so notwithstanding Item 11 of Schedule 1 of the contract.\nSecond, a FOC is not a building or planning approval. For the purposes of this decision, it is unnecessary to go into the statutory basis for the issue of a FOC set out in the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. Suffice to note that, as stated by Moore J in Toplace Pty Ltd v The Council of the City of Sydney [2020] NSWLEC 121 at [16]:\nA Final Occupation Certificate can be issued when all aspects of an approved development have been finalised and no further interaction between the developer and the consent authority is required concerning that development.\nAn FOC certifies that the completed building (or part of the building) is suitable for occupation or use. It is a certification of completed building works, not a part of the building works. This is supported by the wording of cl 27, which refers to a certificate \u201crelating to the building works\u201d. A certificate that relates to building works cannot, in our view, be part of the building works. It is also supported by the definition of building works in cl 1; that is, the building works to carried out, completed and handed over to the owner. In this contract, the owners were required to undertake works prior to an occupation certificate being issued. The building works \u201chanded over\u201d to the owner could not, in such circumstances, include the provision of the FOC.\nPlease write in English language.",
