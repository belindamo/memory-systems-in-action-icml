Kaiseki and shojin-ryori are definitely must-try experiences, and I'm sure you'll appreciate the attention to detail and care that goes into preparing each dish. And don't even get me started on Nishiki Market and Kyoto Central Market - you'll find so many delicious and unique ingredients to try.\n\nBy the way, have you thought about how you'll get around Kyoto?
