  "content": "Yes, education and awareness-raising initiatives are critical to preventing future conflict in Sri Lanka. Education can play a significant role in promoting inter-ethnic harmony, respect for diversity, and tolerance. These values can be instilled in future generations if they are introduced in the education system at an early age.\n\nThe government has taken some steps towards this end, including introducing a new subject called Citizenship Education and Governance in the school curriculum in 2017. The aim of this subject is to teach students about social values, national identity, and the principles of democracy.\n\nIn addition, non-governmental organizations and civil society groups have implemented various initiatives to promote education and awareness on ethnic reconciliation. These include interfaith dialogue programs, community-based programs, and cultural exchange programs. These initiatives aim to foster inter-ethnic understanding and promote respect for diversity.\n\nOverall, education and awareness-raising initiatives can play a crucial role in preventing future conflict in Sri Lanka. However, they must be combined with other measures, including the promotion of socio-economic development, inclusive decision-making, and good governance.",
