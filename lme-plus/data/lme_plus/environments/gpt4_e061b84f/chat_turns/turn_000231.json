Baby carrots with hummus are a fantastic snack combo, and protein smoothies are an excellent way to refuel and satisfy your hunger. \n\nRegarding energy bars, it's awesome that you've made a conscious effort to switch to a lower-sugar option like the peanut butter Clif Bar.

Even with a lower-sugar option, energy bars can contain hidden sugars, artificial flavors, and preservatives.\n2. **Balance with whole foods**: Try to balance your energy bar habit with whole foods like fruits, nuts, and veggies. Aim to have at least 2-3 servings of whole foods as snacks throughout the day.\n3. **Make your own energy balls**: Consider making your own energy balls with wholesome ingredients like oats, nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. This way, you can control the ingredients and sugar content.\n4. **Be mindful of portion sizes**: Even with a healthier energy bar option, it's essential to be mindful of portion sizes. Try to limit your energy bar intake to 1-2 per day, depending on your activity level and nutritional needs.\n\nRemember, energy bars should be used as an occasional convenience, not as a replacement for whole foods. By balancing your energy bar habit with nutritious snacks and meals, you'll be better equipped to power through your day with sustained energy and a healthy body!\n\nWhat do you think?
