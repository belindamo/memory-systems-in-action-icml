Adding a small amount of corn syrup to the buttercream is a common trick among cake decorators, and it can indeed help with its stability and workability.\n\n**What does corn syrup do in buttercream?**\n\nCorn syrup is a humectant, which means it helps retain moisture in the buttercream. This can be beneficial in several ways:\n\n1. **Improved stability:** Corn syrup helps prevent the buttercream from becoming too soft or too brittle, making it more stable and easier to work with, especially in warm temperatures.\n2. **Better piping consistency:** Corn syrup can help maintain a smooth, consistent texture when piping borders, lines, or details, reducing the likelihood of breaks or blobs.\n3. **Enhanced flexibility:** With corn syrup, the buttercream becomes more pliable and easier to shape, making it ideal for creating intricate designs or molding small details like the mortarboard and tassel.\n4. **Reduced crusting:** Corn syrup can help slow down the crusting process, giving you more time to work with the buttercream before it sets.\n\n**How much corn syrup to add?**\n\nWhen adding corn syrup to your buttercream, start with a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons per 2 cups of buttercream) and mix well. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess corn syrup, so begin with a small amount and adjust to your liking.\n\n**Important note:** While corn syrup can be beneficial, don't overdo it! Too much corn syrup can make the buttercream too soft, sticky, or even separate. A small amount is all you need to achieve the desired benefits.\n\nBy incorporating corn syrup into your buttercream, you'll likely find it easier to work with and more stable, which will help you create a beautiful and realistic graduation cap cake for your cousin's son's celebration!",
