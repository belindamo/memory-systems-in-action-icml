It's a nice mid-morning pick-me-up to help you tackle the rest of your day.\n\nRemember to set the reminder to recur every weekday (Monday to Friday) at 10 am, so you don't forget to take a break and enjoy your coffee.\n\nIf you want to make your coffee break even more enjoyable, consider adding a few extra habits to your routine, such as:\n\n* Taking a short walk outside to get some fresh air\n* Stretching or doing a few quick exercises to loosen up\n* Reading an article or blog post on a topic you're interested in\n* Chatting with a colleague or friend to socialize\n* Doing something creative, like doodling or writing a short poem\n\nWhatever you choose, make your coffee break a time to relax, recharge, and refocus for the rest of your day!",
