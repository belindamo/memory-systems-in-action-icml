  "content": "Sorting and filtering are essential skills to master in a spreadsheet, and I'm happy to guide you through it.\n\n**Sorting:**\n\nSorting allows you to arrange your data in a specific order, such as alphabetical or chronological. To sort your loyalty program data:\n\n1. Select the entire table by clicking on the top-left corner of the table or pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac).\n2. Go to the \"Data\" menu and click on \"Sort & Filter\" (in Google Sheets) or \"Sort\" (in Microsoft Excel).\n3. Choose the column you want to sort by (e.g., \"Expiration Date\").\n4. Select the sorting order (e.g., \"Ascending\" or \"Descending\").\n5. Click \"Sort\" to apply the sorting.\n\nFor example, if you sort the \"Expiration Date\" column in ascending order, the programs with the nearest expiration dates will appear at the top of the list.\n\n**Filtering:**\n\nFiltering allows you to narrow down your data to show only specific information. To filter your loyalty program data:\n\n1. Select the entire table by clicking on the top-left corner of the table or pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac).\n2. Go to the \"Data\" menu and click on \"Sort & Filter\" (in Google Sheets) or \"Filter\" (in Microsoft Excel).\n3. Click on the filter icon (a small triangle) in the header row of the column you want to filter (e.g., \"Expiration Date\").\n4. Select \"Filter by condition\" and choose the condition you want to apply (e.g., \"Is before\" or \"Is within the next\").\n5. Enter the specific date or date range you want to filter by (e.g., \"April 15th\" or \"Within the next 30 days\").\n6. Click \"OK\" to apply the filter.\n\nFor example, if you filter the \"Expiration Date\" column to show only programs expiring within the next 30 days, you'll see a list of programs that require your attention soon.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use the \"Filter\" function to quickly see which programs have rewards expiring soon or to focus on a specific type of reward (e.g., points, miles, or cash back).\n* Use the \"Sort\" function to prioritize your programs based on factors like expiration date, reward type, or balance.\n* You can also use conditional formatting to highlight cells that meet certain conditions, such as rewards expiring soon or balances below a certain threshold.\n\nNow that you know the basics of sorting and filtering, you can easily manage your loyalty programs and stay on top of your rewards.\n\nDo you have any questions about sorting and filtering, or would you like to learn more about conditional formatting or other spreadsheet features?",
