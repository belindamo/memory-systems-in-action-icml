Adding corn syrup will definitely help with the buttercream's stability and workability.\n\n**Refrigerating Buttercream:**\n\nYes, you can refrigerate buttercream for a short period. In fact, refrigerating it can help the flavors meld together and the texture to set. Here's what you need to know:\n\n* Refrigerate the buttercream in an airtight container, such as a glass or plastic bowl with plastic wrap or aluminum foil covering it.\n* Store it in the refrigerator at a consistent temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C).\n* Buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.\n* Before using, let the buttercream come to room temperature (about 30 minutes to 1 hour) and re-whip it with a mixer to restore its light and fluffy texture.\n\n**Freezing Buttercream:**\n\nFreezing is a great option if you need to store the buttercream for a longer period. Here's how to do it:\n\n* Transfer the buttercream to an airtight container or freezer-safe bag, making sure to press out as much air as possible before sealing.\n* Label the container or bag with the date and contents.\n* Store the buttercream in the freezer at 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or below.\n* Frozen buttercream can be stored for up to 3-4 months.\n* When you're ready to use it, thaw the buttercream overnight in the refrigerator or at room temperature for a few hours. Re-whip the buttercream with a mixer before using.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* If you're using a corn syrup-enriched buttercream, it's best to refrigerate it instead of freezing, as corn syrup can crystallize when frozen, affecting the buttercream's texture.\n* Before freezing or refrigerating, make sure the buttercream is at room temperature and has been mixed well to prevent separation or graininess.\n* If you notice any off-flavors, odors, or texture changes after refrigerating or freezing, it's best to err on the side of caution and discard the buttercream.\n\nBy refrigerating or freezing your buttercream, you'll have plenty of time to focus on other aspects of your graduation cap cake, like baking and decorating. Just remember to re-whip the buttercream before using it to ensure it's light, fluffy, and ready for decorating!",
