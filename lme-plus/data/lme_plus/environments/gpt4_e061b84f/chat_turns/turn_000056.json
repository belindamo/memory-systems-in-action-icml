  "content": "Part 31 Clause 26 of the contract, headed \u201cProgress Payments\u201d provides:\n26.2 (c) The final progress claim is to be a claim for the amount payable on practical completion (less any amounts previously paid on account of the final progress claim) and is to include a certificate of occupancy if required under any applicable legislation.\n26.7 Final payment to the Builder shall be made by the Owner within 5 working days after Practical Completion of the Works and receipt of the relevant documentation referred to in Clause 26.2.\nIn our view, the Tribunal erred in finding that the FOC was part of the definition of \u201cbuilding works\u201d. The definition of \u201cbuilding works\u201d is clear and refers to physical works, including variations. The FOC, while a crucial component of obtaining planning and building approvals, is not part of the physical works themselves. Clause 7.1 of the contract places the responsibility for obtaining and paying for all building and planning approvals on the builder, but this does not mean that the obtaining of approvals is part of the building works themselves.\nWe also do not accept the Tribunal\u2019s finding that completion of the works occurred for the purposes of s 3B(1) of the HB Act upon the owners\u2019 receipt of the FOC. The definition of \u201cpractical completion\u201d in the contract specifically provides that the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. The receipt of the FOC is not necessary for the building works to be reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. While the FOC is a necessary component of obtaining planning and building approvals, it is not a necessary component of practical completion of the building works themselves.\nFor these reasons, we conclude that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of the contract in finding that the completion date of the works was 20 October 2010. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider Ground 7.\nOrders\nFor the reasons given above, we make the following orders:\n\n1. The appeal is allowed in part.\n2. The orders made by the Tribunal on 16 March 2020 are set aside.\n3. The matter is remitted to the Tribunal for rehearing.\n4. The owners are to pay the builder\u2019s costs of the appeal.",
