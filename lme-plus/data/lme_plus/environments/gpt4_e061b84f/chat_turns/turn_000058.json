  "content": "Part 33\nWe note that the Tribunal\u2019s finding in this respect was made in the context of its conclusion that there was consideration for the new contract found to have been entered into by the parties. However, as we have concluded that the Tribunal erred in its finding that there was consideration for the new contract, it is not necessary to consider this ground further.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons set out above, we have concluded that the Tribunal erred in its finding that the parties had entered into a new contract, which was supported by consideration. We have also concluded that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of relevant terms of the contract in finding that the completion date was the date upon which the FOC was issued. Given our findings, it is unnecessary to consider Grounds 2 and 3. Grounds 4 and 5 were not established. We therefore allow the appeal and set aside the orders of the Tribunal. As no new contract was found to have been entered into by the parties, the only available remedy to the owners is damages for breach of contract in respect of the 2009 contract. The matter will be remitted to the Tribunal for a determination of damages in accordance with this decision. We direct that the owners pay the builder\u2019s costs of the appeal, to be assessed if not agreed.",
