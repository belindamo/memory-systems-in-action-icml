  "content": "Excellent thinking! Asking the restaurant if they have outdoor seating available is a great idea, especially if you want to keep an eye on your bike. Many waterfront restaurants have outdoor seating areas with great views, and it's a perfect way to enjoy your meal while keeping your bike within sight.\n\nJust make sure to ask the host or server if it's okay to bring your bike to the outdoor seating area, and if they have any bike racks or a safe place to store it. You might also want to consider asking if they have any tables with a clear view of the bike, so you can keep an eye on it while you eat.\n\nBy doing so, you can relax and enjoy your meal knowing that your bike is safe and secure. And, who knows, you might even get to enjoy the sunset or a beautiful view of the waterfront while you dine!",
