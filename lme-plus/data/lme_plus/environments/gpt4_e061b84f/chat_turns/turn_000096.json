However, there are a few workarounds to help you stay on top of expiring rewards:\n\n**Method 1: Google Sheets Notifications (Google Sheets only)**\n\nIf you're using Google Sheets, you can use the \"Notification rules\" feature to receive email notifications when a specific condition is met. Here's how:\n\n1. Go to the \"Tools\" menu and select \"Notification rules\".\n2. Set up a new rule based on a condition, such as \"Expiration Date is within the next 14 days\".\n3. Choose the notification settings, including the email address and frequency.\n\n**Method 2: Script-based Reminders (Google Sheets only)**\n\nYou can use Google Apps Script to create custom reminders. This requires some coding knowledge, but you can find scripts online that can be adapted to your needs.\n\n**Method 3: Third-party Add-ons**\n\nThere are various add-ons available for Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel that offer notification and reminder features. Some popular options include:\n\n* Google Sheets: Autocrat, Form Notifications, or Reminder\n* Microsoft Excel: Excel Reminders, Reminder Manager, or Notify\n\nThese add-ons often require installation and setup, but they can provide more advanced notification features.\n\n**Method 4: External Calendar Reminders**\n\nYou can also use your calendar (Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, or any other) to set reminders for expiring rewards. Simply create events or reminders based on the expiration dates in your spreadsheet.\n\n**Method 5: Manual Checks**\n\nFinally, you can simply set a recurring reminder (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) to review your spreadsheet and check for expiring rewards.\n\nWhile these methods aren't built directly into the spreadsheet, they can help you stay on top of your expiring rewards.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these methods or would you like more information on a specific approach?",
