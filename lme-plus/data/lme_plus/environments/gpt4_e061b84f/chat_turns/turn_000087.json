Let me start with Walgreens Balance Rewards - I've got 10,000 points so far, and I just redeemed 5,000 points for a $5 reward last week. Then there's CVS ExtraCare Rewards, where I've earned a few bucks in rewards and need to use my ExtraBucks reward by April 15th. I also have Target RedCard, Starbucks Rewards, ShopRite Price Plus, and Fetch Rewards. I'll get you the rest of the details, but can you help me set up reminders for those expiration dates?",
