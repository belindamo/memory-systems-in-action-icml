  "content": "Buttercream is a great choice for a graduation cap cake, and it's definitely a more forgiving medium than fondant if you're new to cake decorating.\n\nFor a sturdy and easy-to-work-with buttercream, I highly recommend using an American-style buttercream recipe, also known as a \"crusting\" buttercream. This type of buttercream is perfect for creating detailed designs and shapes, as it holds its shape well and can be manipulated to create fine details.\n\nHere's a simple recipe for a classic American buttercream:\n\n**Classic American Buttercream Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n* 4 cups powdered sugar, sifted\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 2-4 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream\n* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until it's light and fluffy.\n2. Gradually add the powdered sugar to the butter, beating continuously until smooth and creamy.\n3. Beat in the salt and vanilla extract (if using).\n4. Add the milk or heavy cream, starting with 2 tablespoons and adding more as needed, until the buttercream reaches your desired consistency. You want the buttercream to be smooth and spreadable, but not too thin.\n\n**Tips for Working with American Buttercream:**\n\n* Make sure your butter is at room temperature, as this will help the buttercream come together smoothly.\n* Sift your powdered sugar to remove any lumps and ensure a smooth texture.\n* Don't overmix the buttercream, as this can cause it to become too thin and difficult to work with.\n* If you find your buttercream too thin, refrigerate it for about 10 minutes to firm it up. If it's too thick, add a small amount of milk or cream.\n* To color your buttercream, use a small amount of gel or paste food coloring and mix well.\n\nThis buttercream recipe is perfect for creating the mortarboard and tassel, as it's easy to pipe and shape. You can also use it to decorate the rest of the cake, if desired.\n\nRemember to chill your cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before decorating to ensure the buttercream sets properly. This will help the design hold its shape and prevent it from smudging or melting.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!",
