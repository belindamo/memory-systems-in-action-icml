I'll make sure to include a few surprises to keep the slideshow engaging and fun.\n\nBy the way, speaking of gifts, I was thinking of getting my dad a new wallet for Father's Day, which is coming up soon. I ordered a nice leather wallet from Coach last week, and it's supposed to arrive just in time for the holiday. Do you have any ideas for a special message or card to go along with the gift?",
