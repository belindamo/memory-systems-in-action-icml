You might also consider creating a \"General Fiction\" or \"Mainstream Fiction\" category for books that don't fit neatly into a specific sub-genre.\n\nRemember, the key is to create a system that makes sense to you and is easy to maintain. You can always refine your sub-genres as you continue to add books to your collection.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could try the following:\n\n* Look at the book's summary, reviews, or genre labels on the book's cover or online retailers like Amazon.\n* Check out book blogs, Goodreads, or literary awards lists to see how books are categorized.\n* Ask yourself: \"What draws me to this book?\" or \"What's the main theme or element of this story?\"\n\nBy using these methods, you'll be able to create a fiction sub-genre system that helps you find your next great read and keeps your bookshelf organized!",
