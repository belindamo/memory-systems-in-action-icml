  "content": "Sri Lanka operates as a parliamentary democracy, with executive power held by the President and legislative power vested in the Parliament. The main political parties in Sri Lanka include the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, United National Party, and the Tamil National Alliance.\n\nEthnic conflict has played a significant role in shaping Sri Lanka's political landscape. The conflict between the country's majority Sinhalese population and minority Tamil population has led to violence, civil war, and political instability.\n\nIn 1983, anti-Tamil violence erupted, leading to the deaths of thousands of people and creating tens of thousands of refugees. This event marked the beginning of a long and drawn-out civil war that lasted until 2009 when the government successfully defeated the Tamil Tigers.\n\nEthnic tensions continued to influence political decision-making, with both Sinhalese and Tamil parties advocating for their respective communities' interests. The government has faced criticism for its handling of ethnic conflict and human rights abuses against Tamil civilians during the civil war.\n\nThe current political climate in Sri Lanka is characterized by instability and uncertainty. The country's constitution is continually evolving, with power shifting between the President and Prime Minister. The recent constitutional crisis in 2018, where the President attempted to remove the Prime Minister and replace him with a loyalist, highlights the ongoing political turmoil in Sri Lanka.\n\nOverall, Sri Lanka's political system has been significantly impacted by ethnic conflict and continues to deal with the legacy of this conflict. The government must find ways to promote ethnic reconciliation and inclusivity to create a more stable and peaceful political environment.",
