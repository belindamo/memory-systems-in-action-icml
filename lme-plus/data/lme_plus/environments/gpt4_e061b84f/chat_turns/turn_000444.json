Did you discover any new favorite dishes or cuisines?\n\nTo help you break out of your chicken and veggies routine, I'd be happy to suggest some recipe ideas. Here are a few questions to get started:\n\n1. Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)?\n2. What type of cuisine are you in the mood for (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Asian, comfort food)?\n3. Are there any specific ingredients you'd like to incorporate or avoid?\n4. How much time do you have available for cooking and preparation?\n5. Do you have a slow cooker or Instant Pot? If so, would you like some recipe ideas that utilize these appliances?\n\nLet me know your answers to these questions, and I'll start suggesting some delicious and inspiring recipe ideas for you to try!",
