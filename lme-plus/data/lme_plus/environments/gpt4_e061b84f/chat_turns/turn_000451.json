For my first order, I think I'll choose the \"Classic\" menu plan and opt for the \"3 Recipes for 2 People\" plan. I'll also make sure to customize my order based on my dietary preferences and ingredient availability. Do you have any recommendations for Sun Basket recipes that I should try in my first order?",
