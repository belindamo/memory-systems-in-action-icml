Here are some recommendations that will complement your Jamaican Jerk and Korean BBQ flavors:\n\n**For Jamaican Jerk Rub**\n\n1. **Pimento Wood**: Also known as allspice wood, pimento is a traditional Jamaican wood that pairs perfectly with the jerk seasoning. It adds a warm, aromatic, and slightly sweet flavor to your BBQ.\n2. **Guava Wood**: Guava wood is a popular choice for Caribbean-style BBQ, and it complements the fruity and spicy flavors of the jerk rub. It adds a sweet and slightly tangy flavor to your BBQ.\n3. **Orange Wood**: Orange wood is a great option for adding a citrusy flavor to your Jamaican Jerk BBQ. It's a bit lighter than pimento or guava, but still adds a nice depth to your smoke flavor.\n\n**For Korean BBQ Rub**\n\n1. **Korean Oak Wood**: Korean oak is a traditional wood used in Korean BBQ, and it pairs perfectly with the sweet and spicy flavors of the gochujang sauce. It adds a robust, smoky flavor to your BBQ.\n2. **Persimmon Wood**: Persimmon wood is a popular choice for Korean-style BBQ, and it adds a sweet and slightly tangy flavor to your meat. It's a bit lighter than Korean oak, but still adds a nice depth to your smoke flavor.\n3. **Cherry Wood**: Cherry wood is a great option for adding a fruity and slightly sweet flavor to your Korean BBQ. It's a bit lighter than Korean oak or persimmon, but still adds a nice complexity to your smoke flavor.\n\n**General Wood Chip/Chunk Tips**\n\n1. **Soak the wood**: Soak the wood chips or chunks in water for at least 30 minutes before using them to prevent flare-ups and ensure a steady smoke flavor.\n2. **Use the right amount**: Use 1-2 cups of wood chips or 2-3 chunks for a standard BBQ session.
