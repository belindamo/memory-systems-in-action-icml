  "content": "Certainly! Since barramundi has a rich flavor, it pairs well with lighter side dishes that won't overpower it. Here's a simple side dish you may want to try:\n\nRoasted Asparagus with Lemon and Parmesan\n\nIngredients:\n\n- 1 pound asparagus, woody ends trimmed\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- Salt and pepper\n- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice\n- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\n\n2. Arrange the asparagus in a single layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n\n3. Roast the asparagus for 8-10 minutes, until crisp-tender.\n\n4. Remove from the oven and drizzle with the lemon juice and Parmesan cheese.\n\n5. Serve alongside the barramundi.\n\nEnjoy your delicious meal!",
