Remember to re-whip it well before using, and I'm sure it'll turn out beautifully.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to ask. Otherwise, I wish you all the best with your cake decorating and the graduation celebration! I'm sure your cousin's son will appreciate the love and effort you're putting into making this special day even more memorable.\n\nHave fun decorating, and I hope everything turns out wonderfully!",
