  "content": "Mexican Street Corn is a fantastic side dish that pairs perfectly with Chicken Fajitas.\n\nChoosing the right corn for grilling is crucial to achieve that perfect char and sweetness. Here are some tips to help you select the best corn for grilling:\n\n1. **Look for sweet corn**: Opt for corn that's specifically labeled as \"sweet corn\" or \"grilling corn.\" This type of corn is bred for its high sugar content, which caramelizes nicely when grilled.\n2. **Choose corn with a high moisture content**: Fresh corn with a high moisture content will grill better than dry corn. Check the ears by gently tugging on the husk; if it comes off easily, the corn is likely fresh and moist.\n3. **Select ears with tightly wrapped husks**: Ears with tightly wrapped husks tend to retain more moisture and heat during grilling, resulting in a more tender and charred corn.\n4. **Avoid corn with signs of age**: Steer clear of corn with dry, brittle, or brown husks, as it may be past its prime.\n5. **Opt for a variety with a slightly smaller kernel size**: Smaller kernels will grill more evenly and quickly than larger ones.\n6. **Consider the color**: While yellow corn is traditional, you can also find white, bi-colored, or purple corn. Each variety will have a slightly different flavor profile, so feel free to experiment!\n\nWhen preparing your corn for grilling, make sure to:\n\n* Remove the husks and silk\n* Rinse the corn under cold water to remove any remaining silk or debris\n* Pat the corn dry with paper towels to help the grill marks form\n* Brush with oil, season with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices or herbs\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be on your way to grilling delicious, charred, and slightly smoky Mexican Street Corn to accompany your Chicken Fajitas!",
