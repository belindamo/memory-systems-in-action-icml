      "content": "Korean-Style BBQ Beef Bowls are a delicious and flavorful dish. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Korean-Style BBQ Beef Bowls Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 lb beef (thinly sliced, e.g., ribeye or sirloin), cut into bite-sized pieces\n* 2 tbsp Gochujang (Korean chili paste)\n* 2 tbsp soy sauce\n* 2 tbsp brown sugar\n* 2 tbsp rice vinegar\n* 1 tsp garlic, minced\n* 1 tsp grated ginger\n* 1/4 cup beef broth\n* 1/4 cup water\n* 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n* 1 cup mixed veggies (e.g., broccoli, carrots, bell peppers)\n* 1 cup cooked quinoa or white rice\n* Kimchi (store-bought or homemade), sliced green onions, and toasted sesame seeds for garnish (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large bowl, whisk together Gochujang, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger. Add the sliced beef and marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.\n2. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Remove the beef from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Cook the beef for 3-4 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.\n3. In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the mixed veggies and cook until tender-crisp, about 3-4 minutes.\n4. In a small bowl, whisk together beef broth and water. Add the mixture to the skillet and stir to deglaze, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.\n5. To assemble the bowls, place a scoop of cooked quinoa or rice in the bottom. Add sliced beef, mixed veggies, and a spoonful of the BBQ sauce (the deglazed mixture from step 4). Garnish with kimchi, green onions, and toasted sesame seeds (if using).\n\n**Meal Kit Services with Korean-Inspired Dishes:**\n\n1. **Blue Apron**: Occasionally features Korean-inspired dishes, such as Bibimbap or Japchae (stir-fried glass noodles).\n2. **HelloFresh**: Offers a \"Global Cuisine\" menu that sometimes includes Korean dishes, like Korean-Style BBQ Beef or Kimchi Fried Rice.\n3. **Home Chef**: Features a \"Global Inspirations\" menu that may include Korean dishes, such as Korean BBQ Chicken or Japchae.\n4. **Sun Basket**: Regularly offers Korean-inspired dishes, like Korean-Style BBQ Pork or Kimchi Fried Rice, as part of their \"International\" menu.\n5. **Takeout Kit**: A meal kit service that focuses on international cuisine, including Korean dishes like Bibimbap or Bulgogi Beef.\n\nPlease note that menu options may vary depending on your location and the meal kit service's offerings.\n\nI hope you enjoy the Korean-Style BBQ Beef Bowls recipe and exploring meal kit services with international cuisine options!"
