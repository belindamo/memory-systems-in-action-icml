Use blackout curtains, blinds, or shades to block out any light from windows.\n2. **Cool temperature**: Keep your bedroom cool, between 60-67\u00b0F (15-19\u00b0C). A cooler room can promote better sleep.\n3. **Quiet**: Create a quiet sleep environment by using earplugs, white noise machines, or soundproofing materials.\n4. **Comfortable bedding**: Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows to ensure a restful night's sleep.\n5. **Clutter-free bedroom**: Keep your bedroom clutter-free and organized.
