Repeat phrases like \"I am enough,\" \"I am doing my best,\" or \"I am worthy of love and respect.\"\n3. **Mindful relaxation**: End your day with a guided relaxation exercise, such as progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or a calming meditation. This helps calm your mind and prepare you for a restful night's sleep.\n\n**Additional Activities:**\n\n1. **Mindful movement**: Engage in physical activities like yoga, tai chi, or qigong, which combine movement with mindfulness and breath awareness.\n2. **Creative expression**: Engage in creative activities like drawing, painting, or writing poetry to express and process your emotions.\n3. **Nature connection**: Spend time in nature, observing the sights, sounds, and smells around you. This can help you feel more grounded and connected to the world around you.\n\nRemember, the key is to start small and be consistent.
