      "content": "Part 31 Clause 26 of the contract, headed \u201cProgress Payments\u201d provides:\n26.2 (c) The final progress claim is to be a claim for the amount payable on practical completion (less any amounts previously paid on account of the final progress claim) and is to include a certificate of occupancy if required under any applicable legislation.\n26.7 Final payment to the Builder shall be made by the Owner within 5 working days after Practical Completion of the Works and receipt of the relevant documentation referred to in Clause 26.2.\nIn our view, the Tribunal erred in finding that the FOC was part of the definition of \u201cbuilding works\u201d. The definition of \u201cbuilding works\u201d is clear and refers to physical works, including variations. The FOC, while a crucial component of obtaining planning and building approvals, is not part of the physical works themselves. Clause 7.1 of the contract places the responsibility for obtaining and paying for all building and planning approvals on the builder, but this does not mean that the obtaining of approvals is part of the building works themselves.\nWe also do not accept the Tribunal\u2019s finding that completion of the works occurred for the purposes of s 3B(1) of the HB Act upon the owners\u2019 receipt of the FOC. The definition of \u201cpractical completion\u201d in the contract specifically provides that the building works are complete except for minor omissions and defects that do not prevent the building works from being reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. The receipt of the FOC is not necessary for the building works to be reasonably capable of being used for their usual purpose. While the FOC is a necessary component of obtaining planning and building approvals, it is not a necessary component of practical completion of the building works themselves.\nFor these reasons, we conclude that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of the contract in finding that the completion date of the works was 20 October 2010. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider Ground 7.\nOrders\nFor the reasons given above, we make the following orders:\n\n1. The appeal is allowed in part.\n2. The orders made by the Tribunal on 16 March 2020 are set aside.\n3. The matter is remitted to the Tribunal for rehearing.\n4. The owners are to pay the builder\u2019s costs of the appeal."

      "content": "Part 32 Clause 27 of the contract is headed \u201cFinal Certificate\u201d. It comes after clause 26 which is headed \u201cPractical Completion\u201d. It states:\n27.1 Unless stated elsewhere in this contract, the builder is not required to obtain any certificate of occupancy or final inspection certificate relating to the building works.\nClause 29 of the contract is headed \u201cDefects Liability Period\u201d. It states:\n29.1 The defects liability period is a period of 26 weeks commencing on and including the date of practical completion. [Note: The standard form contract provides for a 13 week period. In this contract \u201c13\u201d is struck through and \u201c26\u201d inserted. The amendment is initialled.]\n29.2 The owner may, before the end of the defects liability period, give the builder a list of defects in the building works that appear after the date of practical completion.\n29.3 The builder must rectify defects that are the builder\u2019s responsibility and which are notified to the builder during the defects liability period.\nClause 14 of Schedule 1 specifies that Tender No 2277 dated 22 January 2009 (the Tender) forms part of the contract. The Tender (at page 194 of the Hearing Bundle) specifies that the basic tender price includes the Council Development Application and Inspection Fees. The tender price does not include provision of the FOC. The Tender specifies the work to be completed by the owners prior to the issue of an occupation certificate: items 18, 19 and 20 which concern lighting and the installation of outdoor and indoor clothes lines.\nWe are of the view that the Tribunal misinterpreted the contract when it concluded that the builder was responsible for obtaining the FOC as part of the works to be carried out and that the works were therefore not complete until the FOC was provided to the owners\nFirst, cl 27 clearly states that the builder is not responsible for obtaining the FOC. The contract (including the Tender) does not otherwise provide that the builder is responsible for doing so. This is so notwithstanding Item 11 of Schedule 1 of the contract.\nSecond, a FOC is not a building or planning approval. For the purposes of this decision, it is unnecessary to go into the statutory basis for the issue of a FOC set out in the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. Suffice to note that, as stated by Moore J in Toplace Pty Ltd v The Council of the City of Sydney [2020] NSWLEC 121 at [16]:\nA Final Occupation Certificate can be issued when all aspects of an approved development have been finalised and no further interaction between the developer and the consent authority is required concerning that development.\nAn FOC certifies that the completed building (or part of the building) is suitable for occupation or use. It is a certification of completed building works, not a part of the building works. This is supported by the wording of cl 27, which refers to a certificate \u201crelating to the building works\u201d. A certificate that relates to building works cannot, in our view, be part of the building works. It is also supported by the definition of building works in cl 1; that is, the building works to carried out, completed and handed over to the owner. In this contract, the owners were required to undertake works prior to an occupation certificate being issued. The building works \u201chanded over\u201d to the owner could not, in such circumstances, include the provision of the FOC.\nPlease write in English language."

      "content": "Part 33\nWe note that the Tribunal\u2019s finding in this respect was made in the context of its conclusion that there was consideration for the new contract found to have been entered into by the parties. However, as we have concluded that the Tribunal erred in its finding that there was consideration for the new contract, it is not necessary to consider this ground further.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons set out above, we have concluded that the Tribunal erred in its finding that the parties had entered into a new contract, which was supported by consideration. We have also concluded that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of relevant terms of the contract in finding that the completion date was the date upon which the FOC was issued. Given our findings, it is unnecessary to consider Grounds 2 and 3. Grounds 4 and 5 were not established. We therefore allow the appeal and set aside the orders of the Tribunal. As no new contract was found to have been entered into by the parties, the only available remedy to the owners is damages for breach of contract in respect of the 2009 contract. The matter will be remitted to the Tribunal for a determination of damages in accordance with this decision. We direct that the owners pay the builder\u2019s costs of the appeal, to be assessed if not agreed."
