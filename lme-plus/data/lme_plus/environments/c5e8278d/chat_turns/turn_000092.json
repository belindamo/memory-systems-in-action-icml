  "content": "I think I'll start by running a photo contest, asking followers to share a photo of them using my products, and choosing a winner based on creativity or popularity. I'll promote the contest across all my social media platforms, use relevant hashtags, and encourage engagement by asking followers to share their experiences with my products. Since I've had a successful night at the Tuesday evening night market, I might share some behind-the-scenes content from that event to give my audience a glimpse into my process and build excitement for the contest. Can you give me some tips on how to collaborate with influencers or other small businesses to reach a wider audience?",
