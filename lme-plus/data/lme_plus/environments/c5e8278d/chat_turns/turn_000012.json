  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time information; but to the best of my knowledge, the local government in Hull has put in place various measures to address the issue of displacement caused by redevelopment.\n\nSome of the measures include:\n\n1. Affordable Housing: The local government has required all new housing developments to include a percentage of affordable homes. This is to ensure that residents who have been displaced can still afford to live in the area.\n\n2. Tenancy Protection: The local government has also put in place measures to protect tenants who are at risk of displacement due to regeneration. Tenants who have lived in an area for a long time, particularly in social housing, are offered special protection against eviction.\n\n3. Community Engagement: The local government has made an effort to engage with the local community in regeneration projects to ensure that their concerns are taken into account. The involvement of the community in the planning and decision-making process helps to mitigate the negative impacts of redevelopment.\n\n4. Compulsory Purchase Orders: In some cases, the local government can use compulsory purchase orders to acquire land or property from someone who does not want to sell their property. This is done to enable regeneration projects to proceed, and the property owners are usually compensated for their loss.\n\nOverall, while redevelopment can lead to displacement, the local government in Hull has taken measures to minimize its negative impacts and support the affected residents.",
