  "content": "Chapter 10: Technology in transportation management (e.g. TMS, GPS tracking)\n\nSubtopic: How technology improves visibility and communication in transportation management\n\nOne of the key benefits of technology in transportation management is improved visibility and communication. This is especially relevant in the road freight sector in South Africa, where efficient communication and visibility of the transportation process are crucial to ensuring the timely and safe delivery of goods.\n\nTransportation management systems (TMS) and GPS tracking technology are two examples of tools that enable real-time monitoring and communication between various stakeholders in the transportation process. This includes shippers, carriers, drivers, and customers. With TMS and GPS tracking, transportation managers have access to real-time data and can monitor the progress of shipments, communicate with drivers, and make informed decisions based on the information they receive.\n\nFor example, GPS tracking technology enables managers to track the exact location of vehicles in real-time, allowing them to quickly respond to unexpected events such as road closures, traffic jams, and accidents. In addition, TMS provides a platform for communication between carriers, shippers, and customers, enabling them to share information, resolve issues, and make necessary adjustments to the transportation plan.\n\nImproved visibility and communication also help to enhance the overall customer experience. With TMS and GPS tracking technology, customers can track the progress of their shipments and receive real-time updates on the status of their deliveries. This enhances the transparency of the transportation process and allows customers to make informed decisions based on the information they receive.\n\nIn conclusion, technology has a major impact on the visibility and communication in transportation management in South Africa's road freight sector. The use of TMS and GPS tracking technology has allowed transportation managers to improve the efficiency, productivity, and reliability of their operations while also enhancing the overall customer experience.",
