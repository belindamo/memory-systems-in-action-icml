Please provide more information on how points are redeemed or what the rewards are worth for each program.\n\nTarget RedCard: What are the rewards or cashback rates for this program?\n\nGiant Eagle Advantage Card: How do points translate to rewards or discounts?\n\nCVS ExtraCare: What are the rewards or discounts for this program?\n\nOnce we have this information, we can fill in the table and calculate your total rewards value.",
