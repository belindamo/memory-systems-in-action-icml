  "content": "I'm excited to try out the Simple Tofu Stir-Fry recipe. For the stir-fry, I think I'll use a combination of broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers, along with some minced garlic and ginger for added flavor. I'll use avocado oil as my cooking oil, and I'll make sure to cook the tofu first and then add the veggies. Do you have any suggestions for seasonings or sauces I can add to the stir-fry to give it more flavor?",
