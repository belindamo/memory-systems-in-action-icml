I'll also add a call-to-action to my packaging and website, asking customers to share their experiences with my products. Since I've had a successful night at the Tuesday evening night market, I might share some behind-the-scenes content from that event to give my audience a glimpse into my process. Can you give me some tips on how to run a social media contest or giveaway to encourage engagement and attract new followers?",
