  "content": "The song \"The Wellerman\" is a sea shanty, a type of folk song that originated among sailors working on ships. The song tells the story of a ship called the Billy O' Tea and its crew, who are hunting a whale. The chorus repeats the line \"Soon may the Wellerman come / To bring us sugar and tea and rum,\" suggesting that the crew is waiting for a supply ship called the Wellerman to arrive with provisions. The song describes the whale hunt and the struggles of the crew, as they face challenges and continue to search for the whale. In the end, they are still waiting for the Wellerman to come and bring them the supplies they need.",
