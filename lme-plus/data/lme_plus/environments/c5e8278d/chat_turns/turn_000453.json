I'm planning to create a calendar view that shows all my upcoming events, with different colors or icons for each type of activity. This way, I can see at a glance what's coming up and plan my week accordingly. I'll also add a section for notes or reminders, so I can jot down any specific things I need to do or bring to each event.\n\nBy the way, speaking of my volleyball league, I realized that I started participating in it around mid-June, and we've had a pretty good run so far. We're currently ranked 3rd in the league standings.",
