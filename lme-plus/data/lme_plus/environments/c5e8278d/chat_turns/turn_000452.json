Including yoga classes and cycling events in this section can be beneficial in several ways:\n\n1. **Holistic view**: By incorporating all your fitness-related activities, you'll get a comprehensive view of your overall fitness schedule, allowing you to plan and balance your time more effectively.\n2. **Cross-training benefits**: Yoga and cycling can complement your other sports activities, such as volleyball and soccer, by improving flexibility, strength, and cardiovascular endurance. Seeing them alongside your other events can help you appreciate their impact on your overall performance.\n3. **Reducing overlap and conflict**: By including all your activities in one place, you can avoid scheduling conflicts and ensure that you're not overcommitting yourself.\n4. **Motivation and accountability**: Seeing your yoga classes and cycling events alongside your team sports can help you stay motivated and accountable, as you'll be more likely to attend and participate in all your activities.\n5. **Tracking progress and goals**: You can set specific goals for each activity, track your progress, and celebrate your achievements, which can be a great motivator.\n\nWhen adding yoga classes and cycling events to your dashboard, consider the following:\n\n1. **Categorize and filter**: Use categories or filters to separate your activities by type (e.g., team sports, individual activities, strength training), making it easy to focus on specific areas.\n2. **Include relevant details**: Add relevant details such as dates, times, locations, and any specific requirements or preparation needed for each activity.\n3. **Customize visualization**: Use different colors, icons, or visualizations to distinguish between activities, making it easy to scan and understand your schedule at a glance.\n4. **Integrate with reminders and notifications**: Set reminders and notifications to ensure you stay on track and don't miss any events or activities.\n\nBy incorporating all your sports-related activities into your dashboard, you'll gain a more comprehensive understanding of your fitness routine, stay organized, and remain motivated to reach your goals.\n\nHow do you plan to visualize and organize your upcoming events and activities on your dashboard?",
