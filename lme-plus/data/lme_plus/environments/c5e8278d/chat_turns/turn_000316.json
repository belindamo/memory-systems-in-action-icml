  "content": "Yes, I did know that! Dogs are allowed on the subway in New York City as long as they are in a carrier. This is a great way to explore the city with your furry friend. Just make sure that the carrier is small enough to fit at your feet or on your lap during the ride. Also, keep in mind that some subway stations may not have elevators, so you may need to carry the carrier and your pet up and down stairs. Happy exploring!",
