  "content": "As an AI language model, I can't accurately predict the future, but there is certainly a growing trend towards promoting diversity in advertising and marketing. In recent years, many brands have recognized the importance of inclusivity and have started featuring diverse models in their marketing campaigns. This trend is likely to continue as consumers demand more representation and diverse representation becomes the norm.\n\nFurthermore, the younger generations are more diverse than ever, and they are a significant driving force behind promoting inclusivity and diversity. Brands that fail to recognize this and make an effort to represent people from all walks of life risk losing the trust and loyalty of their customers.\n\nIn conclusion, as consumers push for more diversity and inclusivity in advertising, and as the younger generations become more diverse and influential, we can expect to see more brands and companies using diverse models in their advertising and marketing efforts.",
