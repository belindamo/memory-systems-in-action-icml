  "content": "Lending out clothes to friends or roommates can be a bit risky, especially if you need them back for a specific occasion or activity.\n\nDon't forget to send your roommate a friendly reminder to return your coat. You can shoot her a quick text or mention it to her in person. Hopefully, she'll return it to you soon, and you'll be all set for your hike.\n\nIn the meantime, do you have a backup option for a coat or jacket that you can wear on your hike? It's always good to have a plan B, just in case your roommate doesn't return your coat in time.",
