  "content": "I don't have personal opinions or feelings, but i can tell you that \"more cowbell\" is a reference to a famous saturday night live skit featuring a band recording a song and being repeatedly asked to add more cowbell to the mix. while adding more cowbell might not be a traditional element of andrew lloyd webber's style, it's possible that he could incorporate it in a unique way if it fit the particular production. ultimately, the choice of musical elements is up to the creativity and vision of the composer as they work to tell a story and create an immersive musical experience.",
