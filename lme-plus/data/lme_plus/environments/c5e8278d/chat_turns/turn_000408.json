  "content": "The Simple Tofu Stir-Fry is a great recipe to start with, and it's very versatile. You can use a variety of vegetables to suit your taste preferences and dietary needs. Here are some popular options:\n\n**Vegetable suggestions:**\n\n1. **Bell peppers**: Green, red, or yellow bell peppers add a sweet, crunchy texture to the stir-fry.\n2. **Broccoli**: Fresh or frozen broccoli florets work well in stir-fries. You can also use broccoli rabe or Chinese broccoli for a slightly bitter flavor.\n3. **Carrots**: Thinly sliced or grated carrots cook quickly and add a pop of color to the dish.\n4. **Mushrooms**: Sliced or whole mushrooms (like button, cremini, or shiitake) add an earthy flavor and meaty texture.\n5. **Snow peas**: Flat, tender snow peas are a classic stir-fry addition. You can use fresh or frozen snow peas.\n6. **Onions**: Thinly sliced or diced onions add a sweet, caramelized flavor when cooked.\n7. **Bok choy**: This Asian green has a mild flavor and a delicate texture that pairs well with tofu and other vegetables.\n8. **Zucchini**: Thinly sliced or grated zucchini is another great option for adding moisture and flavor to the stir-fry.\n\n**Oil suggestions:**\n\nFor stir-frying, you want to use an oil with a high smoke point to prevent it from burning or smoking. Here are some good options:\n\n1. **Avocado oil**: Avocado oil has a mild, buttery flavor and a high smoke point, making it ideal for high-heat cooking.\n2. **Peanut oil**: Peanut oil has a distinct nutty flavor and a high smoke point, making it a popular choice for stir-fries.\n3. **Vegetable oil**: A blend of various oils, vegetable oil is a neutral-tasting option with a high smoke point.\n4. **Coconut oil**: Coconut oil has a distinct flavor and a high smoke point, but it can add a slightly coconut flavor to the dish.\n\n**Tips for cooking the tofu and veggies:**\n\n1. **Use a medium-high heat**: This will help you achieve a nice sear on the tofu and veggies.\n2. **Cook the tofu first**: Cook the tofu until it's lightly browned on all sides, then remove it from the pan and set it aside. This will help prevent the tofu from breaking apart when you add the veggies.\n3. **Add aromatics first**: Add minced garlic, ginger, or onions to the pan before adding the veggies to create a flavorful base for the stir-fry.\n4. **Stir-fry quickly**: Stir-fry the veggies quickly to preserve their texture and color. You can add a splash of water or broth to help cook the veggies if needed.\n5. **Return the tofu to the pan**: Once the veggies are cooked, add the tofu back to the pan and stir-fry everything together to combine the flavors.\n\nRemember, the key to a great stir-fry is to cook quickly over high heat, so be sure to stir constantly and adjust the heat as needed. Happy cooking!",
