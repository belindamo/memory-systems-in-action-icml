You can set a reminder for a specific day of the week or month, or create a one-time reminder for your next shopping trip.\n2. **Sticky Note**: Place a sticky note on your fridge, wallet, or purse with a reminder to use your Walgreens Balance Rewards card.\n3. **Digital Note**: Add a note to your digital notes app (e.g., Apple Notes, Google Keep) with a reminder to use your Walgreens Balance Rewards card.\n4. **Habit Tracker**: Use a habit-tracking app (e.g., Habitica, HabitBull) to track your Walgreens shopping trips and remind you to use your Balance Rewards card.\n5. **Routine**: Make using your Walgreens Balance Rewards card a part of your shopping routine. For example, make it a habit to always pull out your card and scan it at checkout.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, and you'll be earning points and rewards in no time!",
