Fiddle leaf figs can outgrow their containers quickly, and repotting can provide fresh nutrients and a larger root system. Since Felix is doing well, it's an excellent time to give him more room to grow.\n\n**When to repot:**\nThe best time to repot a fiddle leaf fig is during the spring or summer when it's actively growing. Avoid repotting during the fall or winter when the plant is dormant.\n\n**Choosing the right potting mix:**\nFiddle leaf figs prefer well-draining, fertile soil with a slightly acidic pH (around 6.0-6.5). Here are some key ingredients to look for in a potting mix:\n\n1. **Peat moss or coconut coir**: These help retain moisture and provide acidity.\n2. **Pine bark or fir bark**: These improve drainage and aeration.\n3. **Compost or worm castings**: These add nutrients and beneficial microorganisms.\n4. **Perlite or vermiculite**: These improve drainage and prevent waterlogging.\n\nSome good potting mix options for fiddle leaf figs include:\n\n1. **Miracle-Gro Indoor Potting Mix**: A well-balanced, peat-based mix with perlite and fertilizer.\n2. **Black Kow All Purpose Potting Mix**: A blend of peat moss, pine bark, and perlite, with added fertilizer.\n3. **E.B. Stone Organics Potting Mix**: A natural, slow-release fertilizer-based mix with peat moss, pine bark, and worm castings.\n4. **Pro-Mix All Purpose Potting Mix**: A professional-grade mix with peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite.\n\n**Tips for repotting Felix:**\n\n1. **Choose a pot that's only 1-2 sizes larger** than the current one to prevent the soil from becoming too wet.\n2. **Use a well-draining pot** with holes in the bottom to prevent waterlogging.\n3. **Gently remove the plant from its pot**, taking care not to damage the roots.\n4. **Inspect the roots** and trim any circling or dead roots with sterile scissors.\n5. **Add a layer of fresh potting mix** at the bottom of the new pot, followed by the plant, and then more potting mix around the roots.\n6. **Water thoroughly** after repotting and keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.\n\nBy following these tips and choosing a suitable potting mix, Felix should thrive in his new home. Good luck with the repotting process!",
