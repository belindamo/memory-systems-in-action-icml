  "content": "I'd advise against wearing a brand new shirt on a hike, especially if it's a outdoor activity that might get you sweaty or dirty. You never know how the fabric will hold up, and you don't want to risk ruining a new shirt on its first wear.\n\nPlus, hiking can be a bit rough on clothes, and you might end up with snags, tears, or stains that would be a bummer on a new shirt. It's better to break it in with a more low-key activity, like a casual day out or a walk around the neighborhood.\n\nWhy not choose a trusty old favorite instead? You know it'll be comfortable, and you won't worry about messing it up. Save the new shirt for a more relaxed outing, and enjoy your hike in a shirt that's already proven itself!",
