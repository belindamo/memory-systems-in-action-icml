I think it would be really helpful to get their input and perspectives as well, especially since they may have their own stories and memories of my grandmother's journey with Alzheimer's. It could also be a good way to start some meaningful conversations and reflections about our experiences. Do you have any suggestions on how I could approach sharing this section with them, or how I could ask for their input?",
