I've been trying to eat healthier and I've been inspired by some recipes I've seen on Instagram, especially from the \"Vegan Recipes\" account. I've been engaging with their posts regularly, commenting on at least 5 of their recent recipes, including a vegan lasagna recipe. Do you have any tips on how to plan a weekly meal plan that incorporates more plant-based meals?",
