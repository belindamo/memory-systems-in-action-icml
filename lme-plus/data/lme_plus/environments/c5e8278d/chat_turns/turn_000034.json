  "content": "That's a great question! While some musical theater composers do write both the music and the lyrics for their shows, many collaborate with separate lyricists. Composing music and writing lyrics are two different skills, and some composers feel more comfortable focusing solely on the music while leaving the lyrics to a separate collaborator. Additionally, working with a lyricist can bring a fresh perspective to the creative process and result in a more well-rounded final product. The dynamic between a composer and lyricist can also lead to a greater range of ideas and increased creativity. Overall, there are many reasons why composers choose to collaborate with lyricists, and it often results in better and more successful musical theater productions.",
