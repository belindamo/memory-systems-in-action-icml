I've been using Walgreens Balance Rewards, Target RedCard, Giant Eagle Advantage Card, and CVS ExtraCare card.

Please provide more information on how points are redeemed or what the rewards are worth for each program.\n\nTarget RedCard: What are the rewards or cashback rates for this program?\n\nGiant Eagle Advantage Card: How do points translate to rewards or discounts?\n\nCVS ExtraCare: What are the rewards or discounts for this program?\n\nOnce we have this information, we can fill in the table and calculate your total rewards value."

We can calculate the rewards value by dividing the points by 1,000.\n\nFor Giant Eagle Advantage Card, we can calculate the rewards value as follows:\n\nGiant Eagle Advantage Card:\nFuel Points: _______\nRewards Value: _______ ( multiply fuel points by 0.01, since 200 points = 20 cents off per gallon)\n\nFor example, if you have 1,000 fuel points, the rewards value would be:\n\n1,000 fuel points x 0.01 = $5 off gas\n\nNow, let's focus on CVS ExtraCare. Please provide more information on how points are redeemed or what the rewards are worth for this program.\n\nAdditionally, do you want to track the rewards value as a total dollar amount or keep the values separate for each program?"

Since it's a fixed dollar amount, we don't need to perform any calculations.\n\nNow, let's focus on Giant Eagle Advantage Card.
