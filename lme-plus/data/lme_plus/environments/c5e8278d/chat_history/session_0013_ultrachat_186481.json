      "content": "Sure, here are a few suggestions for songs by Fractured that could be a good starting point for someone new to industrial music:\n\n1. \"You Are (the Voice Inside My Head)\": This song has an infectious beat and catchy melody, with distorted vocals that add to the overall tension of the track. It's a great example of Fractured's ability to create intense, layered soundscapes that are still very accessible.\n\n2. \"Only Human Remains\": This song has a more melancholic tone, with haunting vocals and a slower tempo. It's a good example of how Fractured incorporates elements of synthpop and darkwave into their industrial sound.\n\n3. \"Psychotic\": This is one of Fractured's more aggressive tracks, with heavily distorted vocals and an intense, driving beat. It might not be for everyone, but if you like music that's heavy and intense, this song will definitely deliver.\n\n4. \"Disengage\": This is another catchy track with a great hook and a danceable beat. It's a good example of how Fractured balances their industrial sound with more poppy elements.\n\n5. \"Beneath Me\": This song features a more experimental sound, with glitchy beats and distorted vocals that create a disorienting atmosphere. It's a good example of how Fractured pushes the boundaries of the industrial genre and incorporates elements from other styles of electronic music."
