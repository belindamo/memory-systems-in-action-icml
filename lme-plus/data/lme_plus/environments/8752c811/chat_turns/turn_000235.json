  "content": "I've been playing a mix of stuff, especially RPGs and FPS games. I finished the main storyline of \"Elder Scrolls Online\" and got back into \"Overwatch\" with my friends. I also started a new playthrough of \"The Witcher 3\" on the highest difficulty level. I've been watching a lot of streams and YouTube videos of \"Apex Legends\" and \"Fortnite\" too. The gaming convention was really cool, I got to try out \"Cyberpunk 2077\" and \"Halo Infinite\" and they both looked amazing. The graphics and gameplay were so smooth and immersive. What about you, do you have any recommendations for games or gaming gear?",
