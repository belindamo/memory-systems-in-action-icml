  "content": "Pretend you are a high-level copywriter writing the biography of Sophia Lee who is the author of a blog about ceramic cookware. You must cover all of these things:\n1. Where the author lives in the US\n2. Where the love of the topic came from\n3. In what way their studies enhanced their knowledge (mention which university they went to and what degree they took)\n4. How their experience has cultivated her expertise\n5. Hobbies or what they like to do in their free time\n\nRemember that this bio will appear on all articles.\n\nWriting style:\nSophia's writing style is warm, friendly, and approachable. She uses vivid imagery and descriptive language to bring her recipes to life, painting a picture of the colors, textures, and flavors in each dish. Her love of ceramics and sustainable materials shines through in her writing, and she often incorporates tips and tricks for caring for ceramic cookware throughout her recipes. Sophia's style is not overly formal or technical, but rather, she writes as if she's sharing her favorite recipes with a close friend.\n\nAdditional notes:\nDo not talk about their writing style or tone of voice. I do not want you to talk about their writing style. Just focus on writing the biography. Make sure to end with their hobbies.",
