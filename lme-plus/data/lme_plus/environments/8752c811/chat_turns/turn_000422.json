Here are some exercises to help improve your leg strength and endurance for cycling:\n\n**Leg Strengthening Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Works quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core muscles. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then bend your knees and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground.\n2. **Lunges**: Targets quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core muscles. Stand with your feet together, take a large step forward with one foot, and lower your body until your back knee almost touches the ground. Alternate legs.\n3. **Leg Press**: Works quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Sit on a leg press machine, push the platform away from you with your feet, and extend your legs.\n4. **Calf Raises**: Targets calf muscles. Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto your toes, and then lower back down.\n\n**Endurance Exercises:**\n\n1. **High-Rep Leg Extensions**: Works quadriceps.
