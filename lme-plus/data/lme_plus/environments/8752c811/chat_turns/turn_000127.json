  "content": "The National Assembly of Pakistan has taken several measures to ensure transparency and accountability in government contracts and procurement processes. Some of these measures are:\n\n1. Public Procurement Regulations (PPR) 2020: The National Assembly has enacted the PPR 2020, which requires all government bodies to follow a transparent and competitive bidding process for any procurement above a certain threshold.\n\n2. Establishment of Procurement Regulatory Authority (PRA): The PRA was established to oversee and regulate government procurement processes. The authority is responsible for developing procurement rules, regulations, and standard operating procedures to ensure transparency and accountability in the procurement process.\n\n3. Electronic Government Procurement (e-GP) system: The National Assembly has introduced an electronic procurement system that allows suppliers to submit bids and proposals online. This system helps to facilitate a more transparent and efficient procurement process.\n\n4. Monitoring and Evaluation: The National Assembly has set up monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure compliance with procurement regulations and to detect any fraudulent or corrupt practices. These mechanisms include conducting audits, establishing complaint mechanisms, and conducting investigations.\n\n5. Public Disclosure: The National Assembly requires all government bodies to publish information related to their procurement processes, including the evaluation criteria, the winning bid, and the contract terms. This ensures that the public can monitor the procurement process and hold the government accountable for any irregularities.\n\nOverall, the National Assembly has taken several steps to ensure transparency and accountability in government contracts and procurement processes. However, challenges remain, and more needs to be done to eliminate corruption and ensure that public procurement is conducted in a fair and transparent manner.",
