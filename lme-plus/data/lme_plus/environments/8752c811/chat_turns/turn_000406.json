Here are some tips to help you keep your portable power bank charged and healthy when not in use:\n\n**1. Store it in a cool, dry place:**\nAvoid storing your power bank in a hot car, humid environment, or near a heat source, as this can affect its performance and lifespan.\n\n**2. Keep it away from metal objects:**\nMetal objects can cause a power bank's battery to drain faster. Store your power bank in a separate compartment or pouch to prevent accidental contact with metal objects.\n\n**3. Avoid extreme temperatures:**\nExtreme temperatures (below 32\u00b0F or above 95\u00b0F) can affect the power bank's performance and lifespan. Store it in a room with a comfortable temperature.\n\n**4. Charge it before storing:**\nCharge your power bank to around 50% capacity before storing it. This helps prevent overcharging and reduces the risk of battery degradation.\n\n**5. Use a protective case or pouch:**\nStore your power bank in a protective case or pouch to prevent scratches, dings, and damage from daily wear and tear.\n\n**6. Avoid deep discharging:**\nTry to keep your power bank's battery level above 20% when not in use. Deep discharging (letting it drain to 0%) can affect the battery's health.\n\n**7. Charge it every 3-6 months:**\nIf you don't plan to use your power bank for an extended period, charge it every 3-6 months to maintain its health and prevent battery degradation.\n\n**8. Monitor its capacity:**\nCheck your power bank's capacity regularly to ensure it's holding its charge. If you notice a significant drop in capacity, it may be time to replace it.\n\n**9. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines:**\nCheck your power bank's user manual or manufacturer's website for specific storage and maintenance guidelines, as they may have unique recommendations.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your portable power bank charged, healthy, and ready to go when you need it.",
