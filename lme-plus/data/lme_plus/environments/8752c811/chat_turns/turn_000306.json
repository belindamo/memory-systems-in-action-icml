This process is called fermentation, and it's what makes bread rise. Yeast is responsible for converting the sugars in the dough into CO2, which gets trapped in the dough, causing it to expand.\n\n**Types of Yeast**\n\nThere are several types of yeast, but for bread-making, you'll typically use active dry yeast or instant yeast. Active dry yeast needs to be rehydrated in warm water before using, while instant yeast can be added directly to the dry ingredients.\n\n**Handling Yeast**\n\nTo ensure your yeast is happy and active, follow these tips:\n\n1. **Store yeast properly**: Keep yeast in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer to maintain its potency.\n2. **Use the right temperature water**: Yeast thrives in warm water between 100\u00b0F and 110\u00b0F (38\u00b0C to 43\u00b0C). Water that's too hot can kill yeast, while water that's too cold can slow down the fermentation process.\n3. **Don't overmix**: Mix yeast with flour and other ingredients just until they come together in a shaggy dough. Overmixing can damage the yeast cells and prevent them from activating properly.\n4. **Use the right amount of yeast**: Too little yeast can result in a slow rise, while too much yeast can cause the dough to over-ferment and collapse.\n5. **Check yeast expiration dates**: Make sure your yeast is within its expiration date to ensure it's still active and potent.\n\n**Proofing Yeast**\n\nBefore adding yeast to your dough, it's a good idea to \"proof\" it to ensure it's active. To proof yeast:\n\n1. Mix 1 teaspoon of sugar with 1/2 cup of warm water (around 100\u00b0F to 110\u00b0F).\n2. Add 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast to the mixture.\n3. Stir gently to dissolve the yeast, then let it sit for 5-10 minutes.\n4. If the mixture becomes frothy and bubbly, your yeast is active and ready to use. If not, your yeast may be dead or inactive.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to successful bread-making with happy, active yeast!\n\nDo you have any more questions about yeast or bread-making in general?",
