It's great to hear that your snake plant is producing new leaves and your spider plant is thriving in the kitchen window.\n\nDealing with too much direct sunlight can be a challenge, especially for plants like basil that prefer partial shade. Here are some tips to help you handle plants that are getting too much direct sunlight:\n\n1. **Provide Shade:** Move the plant to a spot with filtered sunlight or partial shade. You can use a sheer curtain, shade cloth, or a lattice to filter the intense sun rays.\n2. **Use Sunscreen:** Yes, you read that right! You can use a plant sunscreen or a UV-blocking spray to protect your basil plant from intense sunlight. These products contain ingredients that absorb or reflect UV rays, reducing the risk of scorching.\n3. **Rotate the Plant:** Rotate your basil plant regularly to ensure even exposure to sunlight. This will prevent one side from getting too much direct sunlight and reduce the risk of scorching.\n4. **Water Carefully:** Basil plants in direct sunlight may require more frequent watering to prevent drying out. However, be cautious not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot.\n5. **Prune and Train:** Prune your basil plant regularly to encourage bushy growth and prevent it from becoming leggy. You can also train the plant to grow upright or use a trellis to provide support.\n6. **Choose a Variety:** If you find that your basil plant is consistently struggling with direct sunlight, consider growing a variety that's more tolerant of full sun, such as 'Thai Basil' or 'Sweet Basil'.\n7. **Monitor Temperature:** Basil plants prefer temperatures between 60\u00b0F (15\u00b0C) and 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C). If the temperature is consistently above 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C), it may be contributing to the plant's stress.\n8. **Provide Air Circulation:** Good air circulation can help prevent fungal diseases that thrive in hot, humid environments. Make sure your basil plant has enough space around it and that air can circulate freely.\n\nFor your balcony basil plant, you could try moving it to a spot with morning sun and dappled afternoon shade or providing shade using a sheer curtain or umbrella. Keep an eye on your plant's response and adjust its position accordingly.\n\nRemember, every plant is different, so it's essential to observe your basil plant's response to different lighting conditions and adjust your care routine accordingly. Happy planting!",
