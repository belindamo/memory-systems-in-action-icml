However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your specific location. Could you please share what state or region you're in? That way, I can provide you with more tailored suggestions for nearby lakes and streams that are known for bass and walleye fishing.\n\nAlso, if you have any specific preferences, such as lake size, water type (lake, river, stream), or accessibility, feel free to let me know and I can try to accommodate your needs.\n\nLet's get you hooked up with some great fishing spots!",
