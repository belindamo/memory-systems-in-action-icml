The Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that could establish a cause of action against the Defendant.\n\nFirst, the Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the terms of the warranty. The warranty explicitly states that any repairs must be done at an authorized dealership. However, the Plaintiffs chose to change the oil themselves, which could have caused damage to the vehicle.\n\nSecond, the Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts to suggest that the Defendant was responsible for the alleged water entry problem. The service manager, Josef Schmidt, informed the Plaintiffs that the customer service department of Volkswagen denied responsibility, and attributed the problem to the Plaintiffs' failure to clear the area below the windshield of leaves and other debris. The Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence to refute this claim or to suggest that the water entry problem was caused by a defect in the vehicle.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court dismiss the Complaint filed by the Plaintiffs.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT NAME]\n\nBy: [INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY NAME]\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY BAR NUMBER]\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY ADDRESS]\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY PHONE NUMBER]\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY EMAIL]",
