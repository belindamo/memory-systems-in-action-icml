  "content": "Sibelius' relationship with the Finnish government and establishment had a significant impact on his musical career and compositions. He was seen as a national hero in Finland, especially during the early 20th century when the country was struggling for independence from Russia.\n\nThe Finnish government provided Sibelius with financial support, which enabled him to concentrate on his work as a composer. Additionally, his music was frequently performed at official state events, which helped to elevate his status as a national icon.\n\nSibelius' music was also heavily influenced by Finnish mythology, legends, and landscape. This was particularly evident in his symphonies, such as \"Finlandia\" and \"Kullervo,\" which celebrate the Finnish people and their struggle for independence.\n\nSibelius' close relationship with the Finnish government and establishment allowed him to create music that was uniquely Finnish and helped to shape the country's national identity. Today, Sibelius' music remains an integral part of Finnish culture and is widely celebrated both at home and abroad.",
