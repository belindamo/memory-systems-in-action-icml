  "content": "Yes, there was some controversy surrounding Sibelius' relationship with the Finnish government and establishment. Some of his fellow artists and intellectuals accused him of being too closely associated with the government and of being too nationalistic in his music.\n\nIn the 1930s, as Finland became more politically polarized, these criticisms grew louder. Some left-wing artists viewed Sibelius as too conservative and too closely aligned with right-wing and nationalist political movements.\n\nAdditionally, during World War II, Sibelius was criticized by some for not being more vocal in his opposition to Finland's decision to ally with Nazi Germany. Sibelius was viewed by some as having been co-opted by the ruling political establishment and as being unwilling to use his fame and position to advocate for progressive causes.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Sibelius remained a beloved figure in Finland until his death in 1957, and his music continues to be celebrated for its nationalistic spirit and its evocative depictions of the Finnish landscape and people.",
