  "content": "That's a great detail! Unfortunately, it's still not enough to pinpoint the exact mall, as Forever 21 and H&M are both popular retailers that can be found in many malls. However, I can try to give you some general advice on how to find a restaurant near H&M in your mall.\n\nYou can try checking the mall's website or mobile app (if they have one) to see a directory of stores and restaurants. You can filter the results to show only restaurants, and then look for ones that are located near H&M. You can also try searching online for \"restaurants near H&M [mall name]\" or \"dining options at [mall name]\" to see if any websites or review platforms have lists of restaurants in your mall.\n\nIf you're still having trouble finding a restaurant, you could consider asking a mall employee or a sales associate at H&M for recommendations. They might be able to point you in the direction of some great options!\n\nI hope this helps, and I apologize again for not being able to provide more specific guidance.",
