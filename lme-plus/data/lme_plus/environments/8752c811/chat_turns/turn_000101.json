  "content": "Thank you for the clarification. Here is a draft of a motion to dismiss based on the facts you provided, with the assumption that the Kotters are filing a lawsuit against Volkswagen:\n\n[Caption - Name of Court, Case Number, Names of Parties]\n\nMOTION TO DISMISS\n\nNOW COMES the defendant, Volkswagen, by its attorneys, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to dismiss the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Jane and Frank Kotter, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, based on the following grounds:\n\nI. Failure to State a Claim upon which Relief can be Granted\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The complaint merely alleges that plaintiffs purchased a Volkswagen Passat, and that after a heavy rainfall, water entered the vehicle and caused damage to the interior and the transmission control module. However, the complaint fails to allege any facts demonstrating that Volkswagen breached its warranty or any other legal duty to plaintiffs.\n\nII. Lack of Standing\n\nPlaintiffs lack standing to bring this action. Plaintiffs have not alleged any personal injury or property damage caused by Volkswagen's alleged actions or omissions. Further, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they suffered an injury in fact that is traceable to Volkswagen's conduct.\n\nIII. Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Plaintiffs have not alleged that they made any attempts to resolve their claims with Volkswagen through the administrative procedures provided by the warranty or other legal provisions before filing this lawsuit.\n\nIV. Failure to Join Indispensable Parties\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to join indispensable parties. Plaintiffs have not alleged that any other parties, such as the dealership where they purchased the vehicle or any third-party service providers, may have contributed to or caused the alleged damages. The absence of such parties from this lawsuit may prevent Volkswagen from adequately defending itself and from obtaining complete relief.\n\nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Volkswagen respectfully requests that this Honorable Court dismiss plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety.\n\n[Signature Block]",
