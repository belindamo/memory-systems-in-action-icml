Here are some tips to help your peace lily settle in faster:\n\n1. **Provide Optimal Lighting:** Peace lilies prefer bright, indirect light but can tolerate low light conditions. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause leaf scorch. East- or west-facing windows are ideal.\n2. **Maintain Consistent Watering:** Peace lilies prefer well-draining soil and consistent moisture. Water your plant when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.\n3. **Humidity:** Peace lilies thrive in humid environments (50-70% relative humidity). You can increase humidity around your plant by placing it on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier.\n4. **Temperature:** Peace lilies prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 80\u00b0F (27\u00b0C). Avoid placing your plant near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n5. **Fertilization:** Feed your peace lily with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n6. **Pruning:** Remove any dead or dying leaves or flowers to prevent the spread of disease and encourage new growth. Cut back the plant to about 6 inches from the soil surface if it's looking leggy.\n7. **Repotting:** If your peace lily is pot-bound (the roots have filled the pot), consider repotting it into a slightly larger container with fresh, well-draining potting mix. This will give the roots more room to grow.\n8. **Monitor for Pests:** Check your plant regularly for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale. Isolate your plant if you notice any infestation, and treat it with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n9. **Provide Support:** Peace lilies can grow quite tall. Provide support using stakes or a trellis to keep the plant upright and promote healthy growth.\n10. **Patience:** Adjusting to a new environment can take time. Keep an eye on your plant's progress, and make adjustments as needed. With proper care, your peace lily should start to thrive within a few weeks.\n\nSome additional tips to help your peace lily settle in faster:\n\n* Avoid sudden changes in temperature, humidity, or lighting.\n* Keep your plant away from drafts and extreme temperatures.\n* Mist the leaves with water daily to help maintain humidity and reduce stress.\n* Consider using a plant probiotic or beneficial bacteria to promote healthy root development.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to help your peace lily adjust to its new environment and thrive. Good luck!",
