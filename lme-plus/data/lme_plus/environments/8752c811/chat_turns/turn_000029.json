  "content": "Rawalpindi cuisine is generally spicy, with a use of various spices and chilies that give dishes a bold flavor. Some dishes, such as Nihari and Haleem, are particularly spicy. However, there are also many options for those who prefer milder flavors. Some dishes that are generally less spicy include Palak Paneer, Biryani, and Chicken Karahi. In general, it's best to ask the server or restaurant staff about the level of spiciness in a dish and ask for a milder version if preferred.",
