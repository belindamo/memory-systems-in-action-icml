A points-based system is a great way to start, and the exclusive discounts and promotions will definitely make your customers feel valued.\n\nNow, about expanding your product line to include savory items... That's an intriguing idea! Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Diversification**: Adding savory items can help you attract a broader customer base and reduce dependence on sweet treats.\n2. **Increased average order value**: Savory items might have a higher price point than your current products, which could increase your average order value.\n3. **Complementary products**: Artisanal cheeses and crackers can complement your existing products, creating opportunities for cross-selling and bundling.\n4. **Competitive advantage**: By offering a unique combination of sweet and savory items, you can differentiate your business from competitors.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Cannibalization**: Introducing savory items might cannibalize sales from your existing products, especially if they're similar in price point.\n2. **Target audience**: Your current customer base might not be interested in savory items, which could lead to a mismatch between your products and target audience.\n3. **Production and logistics**: You'll need to consider the production process, storage, and logistics for the new products, which could add complexity to your operations.\n4. **Quality control**: Ensuring the quality of artisanal cheeses and crackers might require additional quality control measures, which could be time-consuming and costly.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, you could:\n\n1. **Conduct market research**: Survey your customers to gauge their interest in savory items and gather feedback on potential products.\n2. **Start small**: Introduce a limited selection of savory items to test the waters and refine your offerings based on customer feedback.\n3. **Partner with local suppliers**: Collaborate with local artisanal cheese and cracker makers to source high-quality products and reduce production complexity.\n4. **Develop a clear brand identity**: Ensure that your brand identity and messaging align with the new product offerings to avoid confusing your target audience.\n\nUltimately, the decision to expand your product line depends on your business goals, target audience, and operational capabilities. If you're willing to invest time and resources into researching and refining your savory offerings, it could be a great opportunity to diversify your business and attract new customers.\n\nWhat do you think?
