Involving civil society organizations and media in monitoring procurement processes can act as a check on the government's actions and increase transparency in procurement processes. Civil society organizations can act as watchdogs and help to detect any irregularities that might be missed by government oversight bodies. By monitoring the procurement process, documenting any irregularities, and advocating for transparency and accountability, civil society organizations can help to create pressure for reform and better government practices.
