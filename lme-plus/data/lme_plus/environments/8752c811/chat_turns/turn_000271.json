  "content": "I think introducing savory items could be a great idea, but I want to make sure I do it right. I'll start by conducting some market research to see what kind of savory items my customers would be interested in. I'll also reach out to some local suppliers to see if I can find some high-quality artisanal cheeses and crackers to partner with. Once I have a better understanding of the market and the products, I'll start small and introduce a limited selection of savory items to test the waters. Thanks for the advice!",
