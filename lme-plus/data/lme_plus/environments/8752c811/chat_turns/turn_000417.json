I've been doing a lot of cardio lately with jogging and cycling, but I want to incorporate more strength training into my routine. Do you have any recommendations for exercises I can do at home or at the gym? By the way, I'm taking a break from my usual routine today to volunteer at a kids' tennis tournament at the local park, which should be a fun change of pace!",
