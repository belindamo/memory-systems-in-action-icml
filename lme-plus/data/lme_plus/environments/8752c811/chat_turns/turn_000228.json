  "content": "Sure, I can make the story even shorter, similar to the style of \"On the First Day of Kindergarten\" by Tish Rabe. Here is a shorter version of the story:\n\nMeicha starts kindergarten.\nShe makes new friends.\nShe learns and plays.\nShe loves her school.\n\nThis version is even shorter, it can be made with 4-6 pages. With simple illustrations, it will be easy for the child to follow and understand the story, and it will be easy for the parent/teacher to read it out loud. The storybook is also easy to carry and read anywhere.",
