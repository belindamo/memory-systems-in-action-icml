  "content": "Jane and Frank Kotter live at 1350 East 85th Street, Brooklyn. They had a good experience leasing a Volkswagen Passat for three years, from 2018 to 2021 from Metro Volkwagen/Audi located on 11th Avenue and 52nd Street in New York City. They recall seeing at least one advertisement for the Passat portraying it as a technologically advanced car that is good for families. On May 1, 2022, they purchased (in Frank\u2019s name) a new Passat for $30,500.00 with a standard three-year / 36,000 mile warranty for repairs and defects. In addition, they also purchased for $500.00 a one-year warranty against transmission failure. VW recommends a vehicle inspection every 10,000 miles and, as with most warranties, any work done at the car is required to be done at an authorized dealership. As was their practice with the leased vehicle, they parked the car on their tree-lined street. On August 1, 2022, Frank changed the car\u2019s oil himself. \n\nOn September 10, 2022, after a heavy rainfall, Frank went to get the car and saw that the interior floor of the vehicle in both the front and rear were flooded with about four inches of water. After many tries, the car would not start. Frank checked the windows and doors of the car, but nothing was open or ajar and there was there was no crack or space through which the water could have entered.\n\nFrank went back home and told Jane about the problem and they decided to call Metro\u2019s service department and have the car towed to Manhattan. The service manager, Josef Schmidt, told them the cost of the tow, $125.00, would be borne by the Kotters. Once the car arrived at the service department, Schmidt told the Kotters that he would call them when he determined the problem and prior to commencing repairs. He called one day later and informed the Kotters that the interior carpets were a total loss and the transmission control module (\u201cTCM\u201d), located under the carpet below the driver\u2019s seat, had to be replaced because it was damaged by the water that entered the vehicle. The total cost of repairs would be $3,790.00 ($1,100.00 for the carpets and $2,690.00 for the TCM). \n\nThe Kotters tried to convince Schmidt that there was a defect and that they did nothing to damage the car or cause the water ingress, and that since they were within the warranty, everything should be covered. Their arguments were unavailing. They also asked if the water entry was an aberration for the Passat, and Schmidt answered that he had heard of such problems and seen it one time. Schmidt told them that he checked with Volkswagen, and their customer service department denied responsibility, saying that the Kotters failed to clear the area below the windshield of leaves and other debris. Left with no other choice, the Kotters reluctantly paid the bill and returned home to Brooklyn.\n\nAfter doing some research on the Internet, the Kotters saw that other Passats also had water entry problems due to a blocked plenum drain, and they decided to seek legal advice.",
