Planning a dinner party can be overwhelming, but with a little guidance, you'll be on your way to hosting a memorable and delicious meal for your guests.\n\nFor a main course that's easy to make for a large group, I'd recommend considering dishes that:\n\n1. Are relatively simple to prepare\n2. Can be made in advance or cooked in large quantities\n3. Don't require individual plating or precise timing\n\nHere are some main course ideas that fit these criteria:\n\n1. **Lasagna**: A classic choice for a crowd-pleaser! You can make a large lasagna in a 9x13 inch pan, and it's easy to customize with meatballs, vegetables, or different types of cheese.\n2. **Roasted Chicken or Pork**: Roasting a large piece of meat is a great way to feed a crowd. You can season the meat with herbs and spices, and let it cook to perfection in the oven. Serve with roasted vegetables and potatoes for a hearty meal.\n3. **Pasta with Tomato Sauce**: A large pot of pasta with a homemade tomato sauce is a crowd-pleaser. You can add ground beef, sausage, or vegetables to make it more substantial.\n4. **Grilled Skewers**: Skewers of marinated meat (chicken, beef, pork, or vegetables) can be grilled in large quantities and served with a side of rice, quinoa, or roasted vegetables.\n5. **Casseroles**: Dishes like chicken enchiladas, shepherd's pie, or baked ziti are all easy to make in large quantities and can be customized with your favorite ingredients.\n6. **Sliders or Sandwiches**: If you want to offer a more casual, buffet-style main course, consider making sliders or sandwiches in bulk. You can offer a variety of toppings and condiments to let guests customize their own.\n7. **Braised Short Ribs or Beef Bourguignon**: These hearty, slow-cooked dishes are perfect for a large group. They can be made in advance and simmered in the oven or on the stovetop, serving 8-10 people easily.\n\nThese ideas should give you a great starting point. Remember to consider your guests' dietary restrictions and preferences when choosing a main course. You can always ask for help or adjust recipes to accommodate specific needs.\n\nDo any of these options stand out to you, or would you like more specific recipe recommendations?",
