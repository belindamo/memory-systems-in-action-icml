Don't worry if you're new to bread-making \u2013 I'll guide you through each step, and you'll be enjoying freshly baked bread in no time!\n\n**Step 1: Activate the Yeast (10 minutes)**\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine:\n\t* 1 cup of warm water (around 100\u00b0F to 110\u00b0F)\n\t* 1 teaspoon of sugar\n\t* 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast\n2. Stir gently to dissolve the yeast and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy and bubbly. This step is called \"proofing\" the yeast and ensures it's active and will help your dough rise.\n\n**Step 2: Mix the Dough (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Add the following ingredients to the bowl:\n\t* 2 cups of all-purpose flour\n\t* 1 teaspoon of salt\n2. Mix the ingredients together until they form a shaggy dough. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or mix by hand with a wooden spoon.\n3. Continue mixing for about 10 minutes, until the dough starts to come together in a sticky ball.\n\n**Step 3: Knead the Dough (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes.\n2. Knead the dough by pushing down with the heel of your hand, folding the dough back up, and repeating the process. This helps develop the gluten in the dough, giving your bread its structure and texture.\n3. As you knead, the dough will become smoother and more elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment for this step.\n\n**Step 4: First Rise (1 hour)**\n\n1. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place.\n2. Let the dough rise for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.\n\n**Step 5: Shape the Dough (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles.\n2. Shape the dough into a round or oblong shape. You can use a banneton or a proofing basket to help the dough hold its shape.\n3. Place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet or peel lined with parchment paper, if desired.\n\n**Step 6: Second Rise (1 hour)**\n\n1. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a clean towel and let it rise for another hour, or until it has doubled in size again.\n\n**Step 7: Preheat and Score the Dough (30 minutes)**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) with a Dutch oven or a ceramic pot with a lid inside. If you don't have one, you can use a regular oven.\n2. Use a sharp knife or razor blade to make a few shallow cuts on the surface of the dough. This is called \"scoring\" the bread and helps control the way it expands during baking.\n\n**Step 8: Bake the Bread (25-30 minutes)**\n\n1. Place the dough into the preheated oven or pot, and cover it with the lid.\n2. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n3. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.\n\nThat's it! You've successfully made your first loaf of Simple Crusty Bread. Be proud of yourself \u2013 you've accomplished something amazing!\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the steps, feel free to",
