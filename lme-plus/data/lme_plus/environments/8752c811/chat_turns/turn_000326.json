Could you please provide more details or clues about the mall, such as:\n\n1. The city or state where the mall is located\n2. The name of the mall (if you remember)\n3. Any other distinctive features or landmarks near the food court\n4. The type of cuisine you're in the mood for (e.g. Italian, Mexican, Asian, etc.)\n\nWith more information, I can try to help you find a great place to grab lunch near the H&M store at your mall!",
