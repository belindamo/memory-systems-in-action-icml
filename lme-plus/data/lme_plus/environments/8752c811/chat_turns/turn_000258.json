Set achievable goals: Start with realistic goals that you can achieve in a week or two, like winning a game using a specific opening or solving ten chess puzzles. Celebrate when you achieve them, and this will keep you motivated to keep learning. 2. Mix it up: Don't stick to one thing. Practice a different opening, strategy or play style every day. This will help you try new things, staying engaged, and find new tactics that will improve your game. 3. Join a chess club or community: Being involved in a community provides social interaction with like-minded individuals that can help keep you engaged and motivated. 4. Play with people who are better than you: Playing against people who are stronger than you is a great way to learn new tactics and strategies. Even if you lose, you will learn and improve. 5. Don't get discouraged: Finally, don't get discouraged if it takes longer than a week or two to see improvement in your game. Chess is a complex game that requires time, persistence, and patience.
