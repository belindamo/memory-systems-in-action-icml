Here are some exercises to target your core, focusing on balance and flexibility:\n\n**Bodyweight Exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise engages your entire core, including abs, obliques, and lower back.\n2. **Tree Pose**: Stand on one leg, keeping the other foot resting on the inner thigh. Hold for 30 seconds, switch legs, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise improves balance and engages your core.\n3. **Single-Leg Deadlifts**: Stand on one leg, bend your knee slightly, and hinge forward at the hips. Keep your back straight, engage your core, and lift the other leg off the ground. Hold for a few seconds, then lower back down. Repeat on the other side.\n4. **Side Plank (Vasisthasana)**: Lie on your side with your feet stacked, lift your hips off the ground, and balance on your forearm and the side of your foot. Hold for 30 seconds, switch sides, and repeat for 3-5 sets.\n5. **Bird Dog**: Start on all fours, then lift your right arm and left leg off the ground, keeping them straight.
