By reaching out to local suppliers, you'll be able to find high-quality artisanal cheeses and crackers that will complement your existing products.\n\nStarting small and testing the waters with a limited selection of savory items will allow you to refine your offerings and make adjustments based on customer feedback. This will also help you to avoid overwhelming your production and logistics capabilities.\n\nRemember to also consider the packaging, pricing, and marketing strategies for your new savory items. You'll want to ensure that they align with your brand identity and appeal to your target audience.\n\nIt's great that you're taking a thoughtful and measured approach to introducing new products. I'm confident that with careful planning and execution, you'll be able to successfully expand your product line and attract new customers.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your market research and product development!",
