  "content": "It can be challenging to narrow down the options without more specific information.\n\nYes, many malls have restaurants located outside of the food court, often referred to as \"in-line\" restaurants. These can be a great option if you're looking for a sit-down meal or a more upscale dining experience.\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the specific mall, I can't give you a list of exact options. However, I can suggest a few popular restaurants that are commonly found in malls and might not be part of the food court:\n\n1. The Cheesecake Factory\n2. California Pizza Kitchen (CPK)\n3. P.F. Chang's\n4. BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse\n5. Olive Garden\n6. Red Robin\n\nIf you're willing, could you try to recall any other details about the mall, such as:\n\n* Is it an indoor or outdoor mall?\n* Are there any department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, or JCPenney?\n* Is it a relatively new or older mall?\n* Do you remember any distinctive features, like a large statue, fountain, or play area for kids?\n\nAny additional information you can provide might help me give you more tailored suggestions.",
