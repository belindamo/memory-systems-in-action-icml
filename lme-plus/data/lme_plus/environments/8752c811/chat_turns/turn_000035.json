Rawalpindi's cuisine is influenced by various cultural, religious, and historical factors. The Mughal Empire, which ruled India from the 16th to the 19th centuries, played a significant role in shaping the cuisine of Rawalpindi. Mughlai cuisine, which is known for its rich and creamy curries, biryanis, and kebabs, has had a considerable impact on the city's cuisine. Rawalpindi's cuisine also draws inspiration from the various communities that have lived in the region. The region has been home to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, and Muslims, each of whom has contributed their unique culinary traditions to the local cuisine. One dish that is closely associated with Rawalpindi is Nihari. Nihari is a slow-cooked meat curry that traces its origins to the Mughal era.
