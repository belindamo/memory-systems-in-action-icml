  "content": "Yes, there are many restaurants in Rawalpindi that serve milder dishes. One restaurant that I can recommend is Bundu Khan Restaurant. They offer a variety of dishes, including grilled meats, chicken Karahi, biryani, and vegetarian options like chana masala and aloo gobi. They also have a kids' menu that includes milder versions of popular dishes. The restaurant has a pleasant ambiance and great service, making it a great option for those looking to try local cuisine without the heat.",
