On December 5, a team at LLNL\u2019s National Ignition Facility (NIF) conducted the first controlled fusion experiment in history to reach this milestone, also known as scientific energy breakeven, meaning it produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it. This historic, first-of-its kind achievement will provide unprecedented capability to support NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship Program and will provide invaluable insights into the prospects of clean fusion energy, which would be a game-changer for efforts to achieve President Biden\u2019s goal of a net-zero carbon economy.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark achievement for the researchers and staff at the National Ignition Facility who have dedicated their careers to seeing fusion ignition become a reality, and this milestone will undoubtedly spark even more discovery,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting our world-class scientists\u2014like the team at NIF\u2014whose work will help us solve humanity\u2019s most complex and pressing problems, like providing clean power to combat climate change and maintaining a nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had a theoretical understanding of fusion for over a century, but the journey from knowing to doing can be long and arduous. Today\u2019s milestone shows what we can do with perseverance,\u201d said Dr. Arati Prabhakar, the President\u2019s Chief Advisor for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\n\u201cMonday, December 5, 2022, was a historic day in science thanks to the incredible people at Livermore Lab and the National Ignition Facility. In making this breakthrough, they have opened a new chapter in NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship Program,\u201d said NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby. \u201cI would like to thank the members of Congress who have supported the National Ignition Facility because their belief in the promise of visionary science has been critical for our mission. Our team from around the DOE national laboratories and our international partners have shown us the power of collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pursuit of fusion ignition in the laboratory is one of the most significant scientific challenges ever tackled by humanity, and achieving it is a triumph of science, engineering, and most of all, people,\u201d LLNL Director Dr. Kim Budil said. \u201cCrossing this threshold is the vision that has driven 60 years of dedicated pursuit\u2014a continual process of learning, building, expanding knowledge and capability, and then finding ways to overcome the new challenges that emerged. These are the problems that the U.S. national laboratories were created to solve.\u201d"
