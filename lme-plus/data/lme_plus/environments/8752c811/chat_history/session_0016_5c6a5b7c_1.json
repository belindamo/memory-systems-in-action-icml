      "content": "Ahrefs is an excellent tool for keyword research.\n\nWhen it comes to prioritizing keywords, it's essential to strike a balance between search volume and competition. Here's a general framework to consider:\n\n**High Search Volume Keywords**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Higher search volume can lead to more traffic and potential conversions.\n\t+ Can be more lucrative for businesses with high-converting products or services.\n* Cons:\n\t+ Higher competition makes it harder to rank and maintain positions.\n\t+ May require more resources (content, links, etc.) to compete.\n\n**Low Competition Keywords**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Easier to rank and maintain positions due to lower competition.\n\t+ Can be more targeted to your niche or specific audience.\n* Cons:\n\t+ Lower search volume may result in less traffic and conversions.\n\t+ May not be as lucrative for businesses with high-converting products or services.\n\n**The Sweet Spot: Medium Search Volume with Lower Competition**\n\n* This is often the ideal scenario, as you can:\n\t+ Target keywords with a decent search volume (100-1,000 searches per month).\n\t+ Face relatively lower competition, making it easier to rank.\n\t+ Focus on long-tail keywords that are more specific to your niche or audience.\n\nWhen using Ahrefs, you can filter keywords based on search volume and competition metrics. Here's a rough guideline:\n\n* Search volume: 100-1,000 searches per month (medium to low)\n* Competition: KD (Keyword Difficulty) score of 30-60 (medium to low)\n\nThis will give you a list of keywords that have a decent search volume and relatively lower competition. However, remember to also consider other factors, such as:\n\n* Relevance: How closely does the keyword align with your content and target audience?\n* Intent: Is the keyword used by people looking for information, products, or services like yours?\n* Conversion potential: Is the keyword likely to drive conversions or generate revenue for your business?\n\nBy considering these factors, you can prioritize keywords that offer a balance between search volume and competition, and create content that resonates with your target audience.\n\nDo you have any specific goals or targets in mind for your keyword research, such as driving traffic, generating leads, or increasing conversions?"

Conferences like that can be a great way to learn from industry experts, network with like-minded professionals, and get energized to take your business to the next level.\n\nTo help you stay focused and on track, I recommend creating a keyword research template or spreadsheet to organize your findings.
