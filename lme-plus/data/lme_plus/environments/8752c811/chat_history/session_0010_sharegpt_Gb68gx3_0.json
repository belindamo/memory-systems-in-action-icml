      "content": "Jane and Frank Kotter live at 1350 East 85th Street, Brooklyn. They had a good experience leasing a Volkswagen Passat for three years, from 2018 to 2021 from Metro Volkwagen/Audi located on 11th Avenue and 52nd Street in New York City. They recall seeing at least one advertisement for the Passat portraying it as a technologically advanced car that is good for families. On May 1, 2022, they purchased (in Frank\u2019s name) a new Passat for $30,500.00 with a standard three-year / 36,000 mile warranty for repairs and defects. In addition, they also purchased for $500.00 a one-year warranty against transmission failure. VW recommends a vehicle inspection every 10,000 miles and, as with most warranties, any work done at the car is required to be done at an authorized dealership. As was their practice with the leased vehicle, they parked the car on their tree-lined street. On August 1, 2022, Frank changed the car\u2019s oil himself. \n\nOn September 10, 2022, after a heavy rainfall, Frank went to get the car and saw that the interior floor of the vehicle in both the front and rear were flooded with about four inches of water. After many tries, the car would not start. Frank checked the windows and doors of the car, but nothing was open or ajar and there was there was no crack or space through which the water could have entered.\n\nFrank went back home and told Jane about the problem and they decided to call Metro\u2019s service department and have the car towed to Manhattan. The service manager, Josef Schmidt, told them the cost of the tow, $125.00, would be borne by the Kotters. Once the car arrived at the service department, Schmidt told the Kotters that he would call them when he determined the problem and prior to commencing repairs. He called one day later and informed the Kotters that the interior carpets were a total loss and the transmission control module (\u201cTCM\u201d), located under the carpet below the driver\u2019s seat, had to be replaced because it was damaged by the water that entered the vehicle. The total cost of repairs would be $3,790.00 ($1,100.00 for the carpets and $2,690.00 for the TCM). \n\nThe Kotters tried to convince Schmidt that there was a defect and that they did nothing to damage the car or cause the water ingress, and that since they were within the warranty, everything should be covered. Their arguments were unavailing. They also asked if the water entry was an aberration for the Passat, and Schmidt answered that he had heard of such problems and seen it one time. Schmidt told them that he checked with Volkswagen, and their customer service department denied responsibility, saying that the Kotters failed to clear the area below the windshield of leaves and other debris. Left with no other choice, the Kotters reluctantly paid the bill and returned home to Brooklyn.\n\nAfter doing some research on the Internet, the Kotters saw that other Passats also had water entry problems due to a blocked plenum drain, and they decided to seek legal advice."

      "content": "Based on the information provided, here is a possible template for a motion to dismiss:\n\n---\n\nIN THE [INSERT NAME OF COURT] COURT OF [INSERT JURISDICTION]\n\n[INSERT PLAINTIFF NAMES],\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\nv.\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT NAME],\n\nDefendant.\n\nCase No. [INSERT CASE NUMBER]\n\nMOTION TO DISMISS\n\nNOW COMES the Defendant, [INSERT DEFENDANT NAME], and hereby moves this Honorable Court to dismiss the Complaint filed by the Plaintiffs, [INSERT PLAINTIFF NAMES], pursuant to Rule [INSERT RULE NUMBER] of the [INSERT NAME OF COURT] Rules of Civil Procedure, on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\nFACTS\n\n[INSERT BRIEF SUMMARY OF FACTS]\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Complaint filed by the Plaintiffs fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that could establish a cause of action against the Defendant.\n\nFirst, the Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the terms of the warranty. The warranty explicitly states that any repairs must be done at an authorized dealership. However, the Plaintiffs chose to change the oil themselves, which could have caused damage to the vehicle.\n\nSecond, the Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts to suggest that the Defendant was responsible for the alleged water entry problem. The service manager, Josef Schmidt, informed the Plaintiffs that the customer service department of Volkswagen denied responsibility, and attributed the problem to the Plaintiffs' failure to clear the area below the windshield of leaves and other debris. The Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence to refute this claim or to suggest that the water entry problem was caused by a defect in the vehicle.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court dismiss the Complaint filed by the Plaintiffs.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT NAME]\n\nBy: [INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY NAME]\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY BAR NUMBER]\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY ADDRESS]\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY PHONE NUMBER]\n\n[INSERT DEFENDANT ATTORNEY EMAIL]"

      "content": "Thank you for the clarification. Here is a draft of a motion to dismiss based on the facts you provided, with the assumption that the Kotters are filing a lawsuit against Volkswagen:\n\n[Caption - Name of Court, Case Number, Names of Parties]\n\nMOTION TO DISMISS\n\nNOW COMES the defendant, Volkswagen, by its attorneys, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to dismiss the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Jane and Frank Kotter, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, based on the following grounds:\n\nI. Failure to State a Claim upon which Relief can be Granted\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The complaint merely alleges that plaintiffs purchased a Volkswagen Passat, and that after a heavy rainfall, water entered the vehicle and caused damage to the interior and the transmission control module. However, the complaint fails to allege any facts demonstrating that Volkswagen breached its warranty or any other legal duty to plaintiffs.\n\nII. Lack of Standing\n\nPlaintiffs lack standing to bring this action. Plaintiffs have not alleged any personal injury or property damage caused by Volkswagen's alleged actions or omissions. Further, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they suffered an injury in fact that is traceable to Volkswagen's conduct.\n\nIII. Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Plaintiffs have not alleged that they made any attempts to resolve their claims with Volkswagen through the administrative procedures provided by the warranty or other legal provisions before filing this lawsuit.\n\nIV. Failure to Join Indispensable Parties\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to join indispensable parties. Plaintiffs have not alleged that any other parties, such as the dealership where they purchased the vehicle or any third-party service providers, may have contributed to or caused the alleged damages. The absence of such parties from this lawsuit may prevent Volkswagen from adequately defending itself and from obtaining complete relief.\n\nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, Volkswagen respectfully requests that this Honorable Court dismiss plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety.\n\n[Signature Block]"
