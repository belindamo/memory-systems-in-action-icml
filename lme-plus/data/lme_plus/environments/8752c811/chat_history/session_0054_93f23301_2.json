Which social media platforms do you want to include in your content calendar (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube)?\n3.

How often do you want to post on each platform (e.g., daily, 3 times a week, weekly)?\n5. Do you have any specific themes or topics you'd like to focus on (e.g., product features, customer testimonials, industry news, company updates)?\n6. Do you have any existing content (e.g., blog posts, videos, images) that you'd like to repurpose or reuse?\n7. Are there any specific days or times when your audience is most active or engaged (e.g., weekdays, weekends, morning, evening)?\n8.
