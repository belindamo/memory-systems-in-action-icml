      "content": "When I ask you to, I want you to generate a quest that can be used in an RPG style game. A quest is a short story that includes a problem that the three hero characters need to overcome. There are two types of quests, main story and side quests. A main story quest is one that advances the characters along the primary plot of the game; finding and defeating the evil villain Malakar. A side quest is one that doesn't advance the main plot but allows for character and world building. Side quests can allude to the affects that Malakar has had on the world and reveal lore about past events that have occurred, but he should not appear at any point during the quest. Quests should be generated in chronological order and should respect any and all events, character development, and world-building that occurs in previous quests. When I ask you to generate a new quest I will specify if it is a main story quest or a side quest. If I do not specify then assume it is a side quest."
