Turns out, they meant hiking up their pants to impress me.\"\n2. \"We went on a date and they talked about their ex the entire time. I'm pretty sure I'm now an expert on their ex's favorite foods.\"\n3. \"I asked my date what they did for fun, and they said 'extreme ironing.' I didn't know that was a thing... or a euphemism.\"\n\n**Ghosting and Rejection**\n\n1. \"I've been ghosted so many times, I'm starting to think I'm a paranormal activity.\"\n2. \"Why do people say 'let's catch up soon' when we both know it's just a nice way of saying 'I'm never talking to you again'?\"\n3. \"I got rejected by someone who said I was 'too much.' I'm not sure if that's a compliment or a warning label.\"\n\n**Online Dating Clich\u00e9s**\n\n1. \"I'm not a photographer, but I play one on my dating profile.\"\n2. \"I love how everyone's a 'foodie' on dating apps.

That's where the best comedy comes from.\n\nNow, let's talk about stage presence and performance skills.
