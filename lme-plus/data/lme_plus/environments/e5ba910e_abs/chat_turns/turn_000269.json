It encourages listeners to speak up, to not be afraid to take a stand, and to be confident in their own identity, regardless of what others may think or say. The lyrics, \"Say what you wanna say, and let the words fall out,\" and \"I wanna see you be brave,\" are empowering messages that inspire courage and authenticity.
