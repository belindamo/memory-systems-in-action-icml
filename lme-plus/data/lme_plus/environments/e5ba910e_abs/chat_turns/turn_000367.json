Here are some signs that might indicate it's time to prune or repot:\n\n* Pruning:\n\t+ Overgrown or leggy stems\n\t+ Dead or damaged leaves or branches\n\t+ Unbalanced or uneven growth\n\t+ Encouraging bushy growth or promoting fruiting/flowering\n* Repotting:\n\t+ The plant has outgrown its container\n\t+ The soil is depleted of nutrients\n\t+ The plant is showing signs of root bound (e.g., slow growth, yellowing leaves)\n\t+ You want to change the potting mix or upgrade to a larger pot\n\nWhen pruning, make clean cuts using sharp, sterile tools, and remove any weak or damaged growth to promote healthy development. For repotting, choose a pot that is only one to two sizes larger than the current one, and use a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for your plant type.\n\nRemember to research specific pruning and repotting techniques for your particular plants, as some may have unique requirements.\n\nNow, tell me about your plans for your plants! Do you have any pruning or repotting projects lined up?",
