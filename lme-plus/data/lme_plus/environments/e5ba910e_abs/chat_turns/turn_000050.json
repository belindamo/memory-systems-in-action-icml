Yoga: How many times a week would you like to practice yoga, and how long do you want each session to be?\n2. Reading: How many days a week do you want to dedicate to reading, and how much time do you want to spend reading each day?\n3. Drawing: How many days a week do you want to dedicate to drawing, and how much time do you want to spend drawing each day?\n\nAssuming you want to have some flexibility in your schedule, let's aim to allocate time for each activity 3-4 times a week.\n\nHere's a sample evening routine for you to consider:\n\n**Monday, Wednesday, Friday:**\n\n* 6:00-7:00 PM: Yoga (1 hour)\n* 7:15-8:15 PM: Reading (1 hour)\n* 8:30-9:30 PM: Free time (relaxation, dinner, etc.)\n\n**Tuesday, Thursday:**\n\n* 6:00-7:00 PM: Drawing (1 hour)\n* 7:15-8:15 PM: Reading (1 hour)\n* 8:30-9:30 PM: Free time (relaxation, dinner, etc.)\n\n**Weekends:**\n\n* You can use this time to catch up on any activities you missed during the week or dedicate to other hobbies/activities.\n\nThis schedule allows you to practice yoga three times a week, read four times a week, and draw two times a week. You can adjust the schedule as needed to fit your specific needs and preferences.\n\nRemember, having some flexibility in your schedule is essential, so don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. The goal is to make progress and enjoy your activities, not to create unnecessary stress.\n\nAs for your comment about there being approximately 30 days in a month, that's correct! However, it's essential to remember that every month has either 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, depending on the month. So, be sure to check your calendar for the specific month you're planning for.\n\nFeel free to modify this schedule or share more about your preferences, and I can help you create a more tailored evening routine.",
