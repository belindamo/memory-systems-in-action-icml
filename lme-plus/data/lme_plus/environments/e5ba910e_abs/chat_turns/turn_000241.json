Here are some tips to press and drain tofu like a pro:\n\n**Why press and drain tofu?**\n\nTofu has a high water content, which can make it difficult to marinate and cook evenly. By pressing and draining tofu, you:\n\n1. Remove excess moisture, making the tofu crisper on the outside and more receptive to flavors.\n2. Help the tofu absorb marinades and seasonings more effectively.\n3. Reduce the cooking time and prevent a soggy texture.\n\n**How to press and drain tofu:**\n\n1. **Wrap the tofu:** Wrap the tofu block in a clean, absorbent kitchen towel or paper towels. You can also use a tofu press or a plate with a paper towel-lined surface.\n2. **Apply pressure:** Place a heavy object, such as a cast-iron skillet, a plate, or a can, on top of the tofu to press out the excess moisture. You can also use a tofu press, which is specifically designed for this purpose.\n3. **Let it sit:** Allow the tofu to sit for at least 20-30 minutes to an hour. The longer it sits, the more moisture will be removed.\n4. **Unwrap and drain:** Unwrap the tofu and discard the liquid that has been pressed out. You can also gently squeeze the tofu between your hands or use a paper towel to remove any remaining excess moisture.\n5. **Cut and marinate:** Cut the tofu into the desired shape and size, and then marinate it in your favorite seasonings and flavors.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* **Use a tofu press:** If you plan on working with tofu frequently, consider investing in a tofu press. It's a simple, efficient tool that makes the process much easier.\n* **Pressing time:** Adjust the pressing time based on the type of tofu you're using. Extra-firm tofu may require less pressing time, while softer tofu may need more.\n* **Pressing method:** You can also press tofu between two plates or use a weight to press it. Experiment with different methods to find what works best for you.\n* **Don't over-press:** Be gentle when pressing tofu, as it can become too dense and tough if pressed too hard.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to press and drain tofu like a pro, and your marinated tofu will absorb flavors beautifully. Happy cooking!",
