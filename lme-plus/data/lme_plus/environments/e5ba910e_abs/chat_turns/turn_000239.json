  "content": "Adding protein to the quinoa and black bean bowl will make it even more satisfying and filling. Here are some suggestions to incorporate grilled chicken or tofu:\n\n**Grilled Chicken:**\n\n1. **Grilled Chicken Breast:** Marinate chicken breast in your favorite seasonings (e.g., lime juice, cumin, chili powder) and grill until cooked through. Slice the chicken and place it on top of the quinoa and black bean mixture.\n2. **Shredded Chicken:** Grill chicken breast and shred it into bite-sized pieces. Mix the shredded chicken with the quinoa and black beans for a more cohesive dish.\n3. **Chicken Fajita-Style:** Slice grilled chicken into strips and saut\u00e9 with bell peppers, onions, and a bit of cumin. Serve the chicken and vegetable mixture on top of the quinoa and black beans.\n\n**Tofu:**\n\n1. **Pan-Seared Tofu:** Marinate extra-firm tofu in a mixture of soy sauce, lime juice, and spices. Pan-sear the tofu until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Cube the tofu and add it to the quinoa and black bean bowl.\n2. **Grilled Tofu:** Marinate tofu as above, then grill until crispy on the outside. Slice the tofu into cubes or strips and add it to the bowl.\n3. **Crispy Tofu Bites:** Cut tofu into small cubes and coat with a mixture of cornstarch, chili powder, and lime juice. Pan-fry until crispy and add to the quinoa and black bean bowl.\n\nOther protein options you could consider:\n\n* **Roasted chickpeas:** Season chickpeas with cumin, chili powder, and lime juice, and roast in the oven until crispy. Add them on top of the quinoa and black bean bowl.\n* **Sliced avocado:** While not a traditional protein source, avocado adds healthy fats and creaminess to the dish. Slice it up and add it to the bowl.\n* **Nuts or seeds:** Sprinkle some chopped nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts) or seeds (e.g., pumpkin, chia) on top of the quinoa and black bean bowl for added crunch and nutrition.\n\nFeel free to experiment with different protein options and flavor combinations to make the dish your own!",
