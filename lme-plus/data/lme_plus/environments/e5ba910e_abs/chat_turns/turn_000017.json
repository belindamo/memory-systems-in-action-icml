  "content": "Preventing antibiotic resistance is a shared responsibility among healthcare providers, patients, and the general public. Here are some actions that can help prevent antibiotic resistance from getting worse:\n\n1. Use antibiotics only when they are needed: Using antibiotics when they are not needed, such as for viral infections, does not help and can actually harm, contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\n2. Complete the full course of antibiotics: It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better. This helps to kill off all the bacteria and reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance.\n\n3. Don't share antibiotics: Antibiotics are prescribed to specific patients to target specific infections. Do not share or give antibiotics to others, as it can cause antibiotic resistance.\n\n4. Follow infection prevention and control guidelines: Follow standard infection prevention and control guidelines like hand washing, using disinfectants and other measures to prevent infections in the first place.\n\n5. Implement antibiotic stewardship programs: Healthcare facilities should establish antibiotic stewardship programs that promote judicious use of antibiotics, guide healthcare professionals, and promote patient safety.\n\n6. Promote research and development of new antibiotics: The development of new antibiotics can help address the growing concern of antibiotic resistance.\n\nOverall, adopting a comprehensive approach to tackling antibiotic resistance is crucial to reducing the incidence of resistant infections and ensuring patient safety.",
