I'm designed to provide assistance and answer questions 24/7, so I'm always here to help!\n\nHowever, it's essential to mention that AI models are dependent on resources provided by organizations and servers that require maintenance regularly. So, to speak figuratively, AI models can get tired and be subjected to maintenance downtime.\n\nNonetheless, my purpose is to assist and provide information to users, so feel free to ask any questions or request help because it's my function!",
