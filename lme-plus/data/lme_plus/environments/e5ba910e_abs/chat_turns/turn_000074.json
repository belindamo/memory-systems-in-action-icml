Since I'm a large language model, I don't have personal knowledge of specific cities, but I can provide you with some general suggestions that are likely to be applicable to many cities.\n\nFor a casual dinner, consider the following types of restaurants:\n\n1. Gastropubs: They often have a relaxed atmosphere, a wide selection of beers, and a menu that offers a mix of comfort food and elevated pub fare.\n2. Italian restaurants: They usually have a cozy ambiance, a variety of pasta dishes, and a range of price options.\n3. Tacos or Mexican restaurants: They're often casual, affordable, and offer a fun, lively atmosphere.\n4. Burgers and sandwiches: A casual burger joint or sandwich shop can be a great spot for a low-key dinner.\n5. Asian fusion or noodle houses: These restaurants often have a relaxed vibe and offer a variety of flavorful dishes.\n\nFor coffee, consider the following options:\n\n1. Independent coffee shops: Look for local, independently owned coffee shops that often have a cozy atmosphere and a variety of specialty drinks.\n2. Coffee chains with a relaxed vibe: Some popular coffee chains, like Starbucks or The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, have a more relaxed atmosphere and a wide selection of drinks.\n3. Cafes with a bakery or pastry selection: These can be a great spot to grab a coffee and a snack, and often have a cozy atmosphere.\n\nWhen choosing a location, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Proximity: Pick a spot that's convenient for both you and Alex, taking into account your respective locations and transportation options.\n2. Ambiance: Think about the type of atmosphere you want to create for your get-together. Do you want it to be lively and energetic, or more low-key and intimate?\n3. Menu options: If you or Alex have dietary restrictions or preferences, choose a spot that can accommodate your needs.\n4. Noise level: If you want to be able to easily converse, look for a spot with a moderate noise level or a quieter atmosphere.\n\nOnce you have a few options in mind, you can suggest them to Alex and see what they prefer. You can say something like:\n\n\"Hey Alex, I was thinking it would be great to catch up over dinner or coffee. I was considering a few spots in the city. Would you be up for trying [insert restaurant or cafe name], or do you have another spot in mind?\"\n\nThis approach gives Alex a sense of control and allows you to collaborate on finding a spot that works for both of you.",
