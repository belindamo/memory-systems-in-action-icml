It's great that you were able to catch it and do an emergency watering session, though.\n\nThe key is to learn from those moments and adjust your routine accordingly. You might want to ask yourself:\n\n* What was I doing on Wednesday that distracted me from watering my plants?\n* Could I have set a reminder or alarm to help me remember?\n* Is there a way I can make watering my plants a more integral part of my daily or weekly routine?\n\nReflecting on those moments can help you identify patterns and make changes to prevent them from happening again. And remember, it's not the end of the world if you forget to water your plants occasionally. It's all part of the learning process, and your plants will forgive you.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that plants are more resilient than we think. They can survive with a bit of neglect, but consistent care will always yield better results.\n\nKeep at it, and don't be too hard on yourself if you forget again. With time and practice, watering your plants will become second nature, and you'll develop a rhythm that works for you and your plants.",
