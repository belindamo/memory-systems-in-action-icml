By limiting your engagement in those groups to once a week, you're giving yourself space to focus on other aspects of your life and avoiding potential burnout.\n\nFocusing on positive and uplifting conversations is also a great goal! Not only will this help you maintain a more optimistic outlook, but it can also help you build stronger connections with like-minded individuals.\n\nHere are a few additional suggestions to help you achieve your goals:\n\n1. **Set a specific time and day**: Instead of just limiting yourself to once a week, try setting a specific time and day to engage with those groups. This can help you stay consistent and avoid mindless scrolling.\n2. **Use Facebook's built-in features**: Facebook has features like \"Groups You Manage\" and \"Groups You're In\" that can help you prioritize your group engagement. You can also use the \"Notifications\" feature to customize what types of updates you receive from each group.\n3. **Create a \" Positivity Only\" rule**: When engaging in discussions, try to focus on sharing positive and uplifting comments or insights. Avoid getting drawn into arguments or debates that can quickly escalate into negativity.\n4. **Explore other platforms**: If you find that Facebook groups are still causing you more stress than joy, consider exploring other platforms or communities that align with your interests. You might find that you prefer the atmosphere or format of a different platform.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Remember that it's okay to take breaks or step away from online discussions altogether. Prioritize your mental and emotional well-being by engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you! By being mindful of your social media usage and setting intentional boundaries, you can maintain a healthy and positive online presence.",
