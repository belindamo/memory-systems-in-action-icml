Here are some ideas for jokes about online dating to get you started:\n\n**Profiles and Photos**\n\n1. \"I'm not lazy, I'm just conserving energy... for my online dating profile pictures.\"\n2. \"My profile says 'outdoorsy' because I once walked to the mailbox without an umbrella.\"\n3. \"Do you think it's a red flag if someone's profile picture is a selfie with a dog, but there's no dog in the background?\"\n\n**Dating App Frustrations**\n\n1. \"Swiping right on everyone because I'm not sure what I'm looking for, but I'll know it when I don't get a match.\"\n2. \"I've been on so many dates from this app, I'm starting to think it's just a social experiment to see how many times I can say 'no thanks' in a row.\"\n3. \"Why do dating apps make me answer 50 questions, but still manage to match me with someone who thinks pineapple belongs on pizza?\"\n\n**Dates Gone Wrong**\n\n1. \"I went on a date with someone who said they loved hiking. Turns out, they meant hiking up their pants to impress me.\"\n2. \"We went on a date and they talked about their ex the entire time. I'm pretty sure I'm now an expert on their ex's favorite foods.\"\n3. \"I asked my date what they did for fun, and they said 'extreme ironing.' I didn't know that was a thing... or a euphemism.\"\n\n**Ghosting and Rejection**\n\n1. \"I've been ghosted so many times, I'm starting to think I'm a paranormal activity.\"\n2. \"Why do people say 'let's catch up soon' when we both know it's just a nice way of saying 'I'm never talking to you again'?\"\n3. \"I got rejected by someone who said I was 'too much.' I'm not sure if that's a compliment or a warning label.\"\n\n**Online Dating Clich\u00e9s**\n\n1. \"I'm not a photographer, but I play one on my dating profile.\"\n2. \"I love how everyone's a 'foodie' on dating apps. Code for 'I eat food and take pictures of it'.\"\n3. \"Why do people say they're 'adventurous' when they just mean they've been to Applebee's on a Tuesday?\"\n\nThese ideas should give you a good starting point. Remember to add your own spin and style to make them your own! Good luck with your material, and I hope these jokes help you \"match\" with your audience.",
