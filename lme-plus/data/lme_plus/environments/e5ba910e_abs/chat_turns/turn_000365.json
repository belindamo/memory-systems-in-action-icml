Congratulations on seeing roots form on your Pothos cuttings!\n\nTransplanting from water to soil can be a bit tricky, but with the right techniques, you can increase the chances of successful rooting. Here are some tips to help you:\n\n**1. Prepare the soil:** Before transplanting, prepare a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for tropical plants like Pothos. You can also mix in some perlite or vermiculite to improve drainage and aeration.\n\n**2. Harden off the roots:** 2-3 days before transplanting, start reducing the frequency of water changes to help the roots adapt to the change in environment. This will help the roots become less dependent on the constant water supply.\n\n**3. Handle the roots with care:** When transplanting, gently remove the cuttings from the water and inspect the roots. Trim any dead or damaged roots with clean scissors or pruning shears. This will prevent the spread of disease and encourage healthy root growth.\n\n**4. Plant at the right depth:** Plant the cutting at the same depth as it was in the water, making sure the node (where the leaf meets the stem) is buried in the soil. This will help the plant develop a strong stem and root system.\n\n**5. Water carefully:** Water the soil gently but thoroughly after transplanting. Make sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged, as this can cause root rot.\n\n**6. Provide high humidity:** After transplanting, cover the pot with a clear plastic bag or a cloche to maintain high humidity. This will help the plant adapt to the change in environment and reduce transpiration.\n\n**7. Monitor and adjust:** Keep a close eye on the plant's condition, and adjust the watering schedule as needed. Pothos plants prefer bright, indirect light, so ensure they're placed in a suitable location.\n\n**8. Fertilize sparingly:** Wait a week or two after transplanting before fertilizing with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. This will give the plant time to establish itself in the soil.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to successfully transplant your Pothos cuttings from water to soil. Good luck, and I hope you'll soon have a thriving, rooted Pothos plant!",
