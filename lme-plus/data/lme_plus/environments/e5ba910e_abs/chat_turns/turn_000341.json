  "content": "When a carbon atom is involved in a triple bond, it is typically sp hybridized, meaning that it has one s orbital and two p orbitals hybridized together. These sp hybrid orbitals form sigma bonds with other atoms. The remaining two unhybridized p orbitals on each carbon atom form two pi bonds that overlap sideways. This results in the formation of a triple bond, consisting of one sigma bond and two pi bonds.",
