  "content": "It sounds like you're doing a great job with your plants!\n\nRegarding your succulent, fertilizing every week might be too frequent. Succulents don't require a lot of nutrients, and over-fertilization can actually harm them. A good rule of thumb is to fertilize your succulent during the growing season (spring and summer) once a month. You can also fertilize them during the dormant season (fall and winter) every 2-3 months.\n\nIt's great that you're using organic fertilizer, but make sure to dilute it to half the recommended strength to avoid burning your succulent's roots. You can also consider fertilizing only during watering, so the fertilizer is delivered directly to the roots.\n\nAs for your African Violet, congratulations on its blooming success! African Violets are known to bloom profusely when given the right conditions. Since it's been blooming nonstop since January, you're likely providing it with the right amount of light, water, and nutrients. Keep up the good work!\n\nRemember to repot your African Violet every 6-12 months to refresh the soil and provide fresh nutrients. You can also consider pruning it to encourage bushy growth and more blooms.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
