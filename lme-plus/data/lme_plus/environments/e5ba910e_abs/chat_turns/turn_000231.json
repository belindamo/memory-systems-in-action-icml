Here's what you can expect:\n\n* Charge a smartphone (e.g., iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S21) 4-6 times\n* Charge a tablet (e.g., iPad Air) 1-2 times\n* Charge a laptop (e.g., MacBook Air) 1 time (depending on the laptop's battery size)\n\nFor most users, a 20,000mAh power bank should be sufficient for:\n\n* Daily commutes: Top up your phone or other devices during your daily travel\n* Short trips: Keep your devices charged during a weekend getaway or a short business trip\n* Emergency power: Have a backup power source in case of a power outage or when you're away from a power outlet for an extended period\n\n**Higher Capacity Options: For Heavy Users or Multiple Devices**\n\nIf you're a heavy user or need to charge multiple devices simultaneously, you may want to consider a higher capacity power bank:\n\n* 30,000mAh: Ideal for long trips, camping, or festivals where power outlets may be scarce\n* 40,000mAh or higher: Suitable for heavy users who need to charge multiple devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, multiple times\n\nKeep in mind that higher capacity power banks are generally larger, heavier, and more expensive.\n\n**Other Factors to Consider**\n\nWhen choosing a portable power bank, also consider:\n\n* **Output ports**: Ensure the power bank has enough output ports to charge multiple devices at once\n* **Output power**: Look for power banks with high output power (e.g., 18W) for faster charging\n* **Input power**: Choose a power bank with fast recharging capabilities (e.g., USB-C with Power Delivery)\n* **Size and weight**: Balance capacity with portability; larger power banks may be heavier and less portable\n* **Brand reputation**: Opt for a reputable brand with good quality control and safety features\n\nUltimately, a 20,000mAh power bank is a great starting point for most users. If you're unsure, you can always start with a lower capacity and upgrade later if needed.",
