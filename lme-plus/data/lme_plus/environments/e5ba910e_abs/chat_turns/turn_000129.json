However, it is known that several countries have historically had Grenadier units and some may still maintain them today. \n\nFor example, the United Kingdom has the Grenadier Guards, which is part of the Foot Guards, and are used in ceremonial duties as well as in combat roles. Similarly, other regiments of Foot Guards in the UK also have Grenadier companies or battalions.\n\nIn addition, many other countries such as Belgium, Spain, Russia, and Argentina have had Grenadier units in the past or may still have them as part of their military forces.\n\nIt is worth noting that the role and responsibilities of Grenadier units can vary significantly across different countries depending on their military strategies, organizational structure, and operational requirements.",
