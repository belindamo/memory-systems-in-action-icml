Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Tiffany & Co.**: They do offer watch repair and maintenance services, but it's primarily for Tiffany & Co. brand watches. If your watch is from another brand, they might not be able to assist you.\n2. **Mikimoto**: They focus primarily on pearl jewelry and don't typically offer watch repair services.\n3. **David Yurman**: They don't offer watch repair services, but they do have a customer service department that can help with repairs or maintenance for David Yurman-branded watches.\n4. **Ben Bridge Jeweler**: They do offer watch repair services, and they're authorized dealers for several brands, including Citizen, Seiko, and more. They might be able to help you with your watch, regardless of the brand.\n\nIf none of these options work out, you can try:\n\n1. **Independent watch repair shops**: Look for local, family-owned watch repair shops in the area. They often have experienced watchmakers who can repair a wide range of brands and models.\n2. **Authorized dealers**: If your watch is from a specific brand, try contacting an authorized dealer in the area. They might offer repair services or be able to recommend someone who can help.\n\nBefore taking your watch in for repair, it's a good idea to:\n\n* Check the watch's warranty, if it's still valid\n* Gather any documentation, like receipts or certificates, that came with the watch\n* Call ahead to confirm the repair shop's capabilities and pricing\n\nGetting your watch fixed will be a great feeling, and I'm sure you'll be happy to have it back on your wrist!\n\nRemember to also ask about any additional services they might offer, like cleaning, polishing, or battery replacement, to get your watch looking and functioning like new again.",
