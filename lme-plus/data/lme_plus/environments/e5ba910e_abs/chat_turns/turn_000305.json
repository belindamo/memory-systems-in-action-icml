  "content": "The American Academy of Arts and Sciences has made progress in promoting diversity and inclusivity within its membership, but more work needs to be done. The Membership Diversity Initiative has been successful in identifying and nominating qualified individuals from underrepresented groups, and the percentage of women among new members has steadily increased in recent years. According to the Academy's 2020 report, women made up 42% of new members, up from 33% in 2015.\n\nSimilarly, the Gender Equity in STEM Working Group has made strides in promoting gender equity in STEM by identifying barriers and developing recommendations for addressing them. The Scholars, Artists, and Writers Project has also been successful in recognizing and promoting the work of outstanding scholars, artists, and writers from diverse backgrounds.\n\nDespite these efforts, however, the Academy still has work to do in terms of increasing the representation of other underrepresented groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, and addressing issues of bias and discrimination. The Academy has acknowledged this and has committed to continuing to prioritize diversity and inclusivity in its membership and programs.",
