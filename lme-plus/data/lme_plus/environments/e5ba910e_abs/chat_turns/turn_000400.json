  "content": "I've been thinking about my social media usage, and I realized that I tend to spend more time on Facebook, especially in groups related to my favorite TV shows and books. I've had some great discussions with fellow fans and discovered new titles to add to my reading list. However, I've also noticed that I tend to get sucked into arguments and debates, which can be draining and time-consuming. I've made a mental note to limit my engagement in these groups to once a week, and to focus on more positive and uplifting conversations.",
