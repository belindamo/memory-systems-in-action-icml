  "content": "Yes, when a carbon atom undergoes sp hybridization to form a triple bond, it uses one unhybridized p orbital and two sp hybridized orbitals. The unhybridized p orbital of one carbon atom overlaps with the unhybridized p orbital of the other carbon atom to form the pi bond in the triple bond. The sp hybridized orbitals of each carbon atom form the two sigma bonds in the triple bond.",
