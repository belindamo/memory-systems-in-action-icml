It's great to hear that you're enjoying it.\n\nNow, let's dive into your laptop's battery life concerns. While it's possible that there might be a software issue, it's essential to rule out any hardware-related problems first. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue:\n\n1. **Check your battery health**: You can do this by going to the HP Support Assistant app (pre-installed on your laptop). Open the app, click on \"Battery\" and then \"Battery Health.\" This will give you an idea of your battery's overall health and capacity.\n2. **Update your BIOS and drivers**: Ensure your laptop's BIOS and drivers are up-to-date, as outdated versions can cause battery drain issues. You can check for updates in the HP Support Assistant app or on the HP website.\n3. **Adjust your power settings**: Go to Start > Settings > System > Power & sleep. Make sure the \"Turn battery saver on automatically\" option is enabled, and adjust the percentage to your liking. You can also adjust the screen brightness and timeout settings to conserve battery life.\n4. **Disable unnecessary startup programs**: Some programs might be running in the background and consuming battery power. Press the Windows key + R, type \"msconfig,\" and press Enter. In the Startup tab, disable any unnecessary programs.\n5. **Uninstall resource-intensive apps**: If you've installed any resource-hungry apps recently, try uninstalling them to see if they're causing the battery drain.\n6. **Run a virus scan**: Malware can cause battery drain issues. Run a full scan with your antivirus software to ensure your system is clean.\n7. **Check for Windows updates**: Ensure your Windows operating system is up-to-date, as newer versions often include power management improvements.\n8. **Reset your System Management Controller (SMC)**: The SMC manages various system functions, including battery life. Resetting it might help resolve the issue. To do this, press the Windows key + X, click on Device Manager, expand Batteries, right-click on Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery, and select Uninstall device. Restart your laptop, and Windows will automatically reinstall the driver.\n9. **Perform a System Restore**: If you've made recent changes to your system, try performing a System Restore to a previous point when your battery life was better.\n10. **Contact HP support**: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there's a hardware problem with your laptop's battery or other components. Reach out to HP support for further assistance or to schedule a repair.\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and the issue persists, it's likely a hardware-related problem. However, if you're still unsure, feel free to provide more details about your usage patterns, and I can help you troubleshoot further.",
