  "content": "No, when carbon is sp hybridized, it can form one sigma bond and two pi bonds. This is because in sp hybridization, one s orbital and one p orbital combine to form two sp hybrid orbitals with a linear geometry. The remaining two unhybridized p orbitals are perpendicular to each other and oriented at a 90-degree angle to the sp hybrid orbitals. These p orbitals can form pi bonds with other atoms, resulting in a triple bond when two carbon atoms are involved. The sigma bond is formed by the overlap of the two sp hybrid orbitals.",
