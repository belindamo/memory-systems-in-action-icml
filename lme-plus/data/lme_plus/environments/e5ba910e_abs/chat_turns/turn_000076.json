  "content": "Italian restaurants and gastropubs are always a great choice for casual dinners.\n\nTo find a time that works for both of you, I'd recommend a combination of suggesting specific dates and times, while also leaving room for Alex's input. Here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Send a message to Alex saying something like:\n\n\"Hey Alex, it's great to have you back in the city! I've been meaning to catch up and grab dinner together. Would you be free to meet up sometime in the next week or two? I was thinking maybe Wednesday or Thursday evening, or potentially a weekend lunch?\"\n2. Provide a few specific options, but also leave room for Alex to suggest alternatives. This shows that you're flexible and willing to accommodate their schedule.\n3. Ask Alex to let you know their availability, and if they have a specific date or time in mind.\n\nExample:\n\n\"Let me know what your schedule looks like, and if any of those options work for you. If not, no worries at all - just suggest a few dates and times that work for you, and we can go from there.\"\n\nBy suggesting a few specific options, you're giving Alex a starting point to work with. By also asking them to suggest alternatives, you're showing that you're open to accommodating their schedule.\n\nAdditionally, you could use a scheduling tool like Doodle or Calendly to find a time that works for both of you. These tools allow you to suggest multiple dates and times, and Alex can then select the ones that work best for them.\n\nIt's great that you're reconnecting with Alex after all these years! Catching up with old friends can be such a wonderful experience.\n\n(Remember to keep the conversation casual and friendly, and don't be afraid to bring up old memories or shared experiences from your high school days. It's a great way to rekindle your friendship!)",
