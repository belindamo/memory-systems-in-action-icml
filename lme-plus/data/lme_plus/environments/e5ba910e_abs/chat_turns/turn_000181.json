And yes, it's a thoughtful gesture for him to send a congratulatory message to his colleague. It's a great way to show his support and appreciation for their achievement.\n\nMake sure to remind him about the RSVP deadline, so you can both respond in time. You might also want to discuss with him what you're planning to wear to the party, so you can coordinate your outfits.\n\nIt's also a good idea to ask your husband if he has any other ideas for the gift or if there's something specific his colleague might appreciate. He might have some insight into his colleague's interests or preferences that could help make the gift even more special.\n\nBy involving your husband in the process, you can make the gift and the celebration even more meaningful and special for his colleague. And who knows, you might even get some brownie points for being a thoughtful and considerate partner!",
