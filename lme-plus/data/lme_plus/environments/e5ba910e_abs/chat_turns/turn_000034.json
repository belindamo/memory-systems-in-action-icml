  "content": "Now that you've linked your calendar account to Alexa, you can customize the display of your calendar events on your Echo Show 8 to some extent. While you can't change the font size or color scheme directly, you can adjust some display settings to improve readability. Here's how:\n\n**Customizing Calendar Display on Echo Show 8:**\n\n1. **Adjust the Display Mode**: You can switch between two display modes: **Day** and **Week**. To do this, say \"Alexa, show my calendar\" and then \"Alexa, switch to [Day/Week] view.\"\n2. **Change the Time Format**: You can display the time in 12-hour or 24-hour format. To change this, go to the Amazon Alexa app, tap on \"Settings,\" then \"Calendar,\" and toggle the \"24-hour clock\" switch.\n3. **Show/Hide Event Details**: You can choose to show or hide event details, such as the location or description, on your Echo Show 8. To do this, say \"Alexa, show event details\" or \"Alexa, hide event details.\"\n4. **Adjust the Screen Brightness**: You can adjust the screen brightness to make it easier to read. To do this, swipe down from the top of the screen and adjust the brightness slider.\n5. **Use Accessibility Features**: If you have difficulty reading the display, you can enable accessibility features like **Screen Magnifier** or **Invert Colors**. To do this, go to the Amazon Alexa app, tap on \"Settings,\" then \"Accessibility,\" and toggle the desired feature.\n\nWhile these options don't allow you to change the font size or color scheme directly, they can help improve the readability of your calendar events on your Echo Show 8.\n\n**Future Development:**\nAmazon is continually updating and improving the Alexa experience, so it's possible that future updates may include more customization options for calendar display. You can keep an eye on the Amazon Alexa app updates or Echo Show 8 software updates for new features and improvements.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
