  "content": "Sure! TypeScript is preferred over JavaScript in situations where you need to build large-scale applications that require a high level of code organization, maintainability, and readability. For example, if you are working on a team of developers who need to work together on a large codebase, TypeScript can be a good choice because it makes it easier to understand and maintain the code.\n\nAnother situation where TypeScript is preferred over JavaScript is when you are building an application that has a complex type system, such as a scientific or financial application. In these cases, TypeScript can provide better type safety and help catch errors before runtime.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: Let's say you are building an e-commerce application that allows users to purchase products using a credit card. The application needs to validate the credit card number and ensure that the user has entered a valid expiration date. In this case, TypeScript can be a good choice because it allows you to define and enforce the types of the credit card number and expiration date, making it easier to catch errors before runtime.\n\nIn summary, TypeScript is preferred over JavaScript in situations where you need better organization, maintainability, and readability of your code, or where you need a complex type system to ensure that your application is working correctly.",
