  "content": "No, when carbon is sp2 hybridized, it can form three sigma bonds and one pi bond. The three sigma bonds are formed by overlapping of the hybridized orbitals with the orbitals of other atoms. The pi bond is formed by overlapping of the unhybridized p orbitals on the two carbon atoms involved in the double bond. So, sp2 hybridized carbon can form a total of four bonds, with three of them being sigma bonds and one being a pi bond in the case of a double bond.",
