However, it's essential to approach it carefully and avoid any movements that may exacerbate the condition. Here are some gentle exercise routines and tips that can help with back pain relief:\n\n**Before you start:**\n\n1. Consult with your doctor or physical therapist to get clearance and guidance on exercises suitable for your specific condition.\n2. Warm up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio, such as walking or cycling, to increase blood flow and reduce stiffness.\n3. Start with low-impact exercises and gradually increase intensity and duration as your body allows.\n\n**Stretching exercises:**\n\n1. **Knee to Chest Stretch**: Lie on your back, bring one knee towards your chest, and hold for 30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.\n2. **Pelvic Tilt**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Tilt your pelvis upwards and then back down again, repeating the motion for 10-15 repetitions.\n3. **Cat-Cow Stretch**: Start on your hands and knees. Arch your back, lifting your tailbone and head towards the ceiling (like a cat). Then, round your back, tucking your chin to your chest and your tailbone towards the floor (like a cow). Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n4. **Hamstring Stretch**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lean forward, reaching for your toes, and hold for 30 seconds.\n\n**Strengthening exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Start in a push-up position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Engage your core muscles to support your back, and hold for 30-60 seconds.\n2. **Bridge**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Slowly lift your hips towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes and lower back muscles as you lift. Hold for 2-3 seconds, then lower back down. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n3. **Bird Dog**: Start on your hands and knees. Lift your right arm and left leg off the ground, holding for a few seconds. Lower back down and repeat with the opposite arm and leg. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n\n**Low-impact aerobic exercises:**\n\n1. **Water-based exercises**: Swimming, water aerobics, or simply walking in the water can be great low-impact options.\n2. **Cycling**: Use a stationary bike or outdoor bike with a comfortable seat and back support.\n3. **Yoga or Pilates**: Modified exercises can help improve flexibility, strength, and posture. Look for classes or online resources specifically designed for back pain relief.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Listen to your body**: If you experience any pain or discomfort, stop the exercise immediately.\n2. **Use proper posture**: Maintain good posture during exercises to avoid putting unnecessary strain on your back.\n3. **Strengthen your core**: Weak core muscles can contribute to back pain. Engage in exercises that target your core, such as planks, bridges, and pelvic tilts.\n4. **Take regular breaks**: Rest and stretch every 20-30 minutes to avoid fatigue and muscle strain.\n\nRemember to be patient and gentle with your body as you recover from a herniated disc. It's essential to balance exercise with rest and recovery to allow your body to heal.",
