  "content": "Petar B\nYes, pilgrims from across earth do visit the Tiamat zone for pilgrimage, and there are conflicts and various events surrounding this. The pilgrims are forced to visit North America usually by ship, or come by other means from Latin America to the ex-USA, and then they either walk to the pilgrimage site, or ride on horseback, use carts etc. The entire north-American continent, all the way down to mid Mexico is a no-fly zone, because of the extended effects of the Tiamat field which cause planes to crash.\n\nNate used to be a regular boy and young man, and he has a brother called Ethan. Ethan is also somewhere on earth in a stasis chamber. Not everyone is aware of Ethan's existence, or believe that Ethan exists, but some are looking for Ethan as \"God's own brother\", or \"The living god's brother\", or \"Wounded god's kin\", in hope that reuniting Ethan and Nate could unlock the Tiamat field and release Nate. There's a group of knights who claim they are the keepers of \"Ethan's tomb\" referring to Ethan's stasis chamber. It is unknown if these Knights are really knights, or if there's any truth to their claims.\n\nThe main protagonist is Lena, a young african-american woman from New Orleans, who used to have a romantic relationship with Ethan. She was put into stasis by Ethan ( against her will ) before the event that caused the apocalypse and she awakens inside the Tiamat zone a century after she was put in stasis. She travels the zone, and the world with other characters. She reveals her daughter ( with Ethan ) remained outside stasis, so in effect, Lena's daughter has probably lived and died decades ago.\nThe journey of Lena and her companions can serve as the backbone of your story, providing a personal and emotional connection for the reader while exploring the complexities of this post-apocalyptic world. Here are some ideas to help you develop Lena's character and her journey:\n\nLena's awakening: Lena's awakening from stasis could be a disorienting and traumatic experience, as she must come to terms with the loss of her old life, the passage of time, and the drastic changes in the world around her. This could be a powerful opening for your novel, setting the tone for the challenges and hardships Lena will face throughout her journey.\n\nThe search for Ethan: Driven by her love for Ethan and her desire to understand the truth about the Tiamat field, Lena could embark on a quest to find him and uncover the mystery surrounding his stasis chamber. This journey could take her and her companions across the Tiamat zone, encountering various factions, cultures, and dangers along the way.\n\nThe legacy of her daughter: The revelation that Lena's daughter lived and died decades ago could add a poignant and bittersweet dimension to her journey. Lena might seek to uncover her daughter's fate, learning about the life she led and the impact she had on the world. This could lead Lena to discover a network of descendants, who carry on her daughter's legacy and provide her with allies and connections throughout her journey.\n\nConflicts and alliances: As Lena travels through the Tiamat zone and beyond, she could find herself drawn into the power struggles and conflicts between different factions, including the various religious groups, the knights claiming to guard Ethan's tomb, and the factions seeking to control the Tiamat entity. Lena's unique connection to the \"Wounded God\" and his brother could make her a valuable asset or a target for these groups.\n\nLena's personal growth: Throughout her journey, Lena will need to adapt to the new world and confront her own fears, regrets, and limitations. Her experiences and the people she encounters could shape her into a strong and resilient leader, inspiring others with her determination and hope in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nThe ultimate resolution: Lena's quest to find Ethan, understand the Tiamat field, and reconcile her past could lead her to a climactic confrontation with the forces shaping the world. The outcome of this confrontation could determine the fate of humanity, the Tiamat entity, and Nate, offering a powerful and satisfying conclusion to your novel.\n\nBy focusing on Lena's journey and her personal connections to the central mysteries of your story, you can create a compelling narrative that draws readers into your post-apocalyptic world and keeps them engaged throughout the story.\n\n\nPetar B\n1. exactly what I planned.\n\n2. Lena's love for Ethan had pretty much died during the first novel, because of his transformation from a normal guy to a greedy, materialistic, selfish person. Though Lena still has feelings for Ethan, she discovers that he had essentially abducted her and put her in stasis against her will. Ethan had no knowledge that Lena and he have a daughter ( because Lena hid it from Ethan ), so Lena sees Ethan as the villain responsible for abducting her and separating her from her daughter. Lena spends a lot of time being enraged and hating Ethan, which takes a toll on her... especially as she's subconsciously trying to avoid admitting her own blame for not informing Ethan of the existence of his daughter.\n\n3. In the second half of this novel, Lena learns that her daughter's descendants might be a class of \"Hybrids\", a genetically engineered group of humans ( or are they fully human ) who have come to rule most of the planet. These hybrids have created dystopian societies around Eurasia, Africa, Australia and south America, which hold the last remnants of advanced technology. \n\n4. in the first quarter of the novel, Lena is allied with other women ( other Ethan's ex romantic partners and women he admired ) who awaken alongside Lena. Some of these women are killed off, others go their own way, but Lena's most closely allied to Olivia - Ethan's ex-love interest, a psychotic young woman who had traumatized Ethan several times with her careless, evil actions. Olivia's nature is thoroughly sociopathic, so Lena is in danger from this person. During the mid third of the novel, Lena meets Mr. Gray, an immortal being ( belonging to a species who is only distantly related to humans, and who probably dominated earth before humans ). Mr. Gray is weakened by the effects of the apocalypse, and he finds an ally in Lena, and helps her on her quest as a mentor ( being that he is thousands of years old, and knows everything about everything, especially how to manipulate and rule over humans ). Mr.Gray is the main villain in the first novel, but in this novel he becomes a protagonist ( though an unrealiable one, with self-serving plans always brewing inside him ). \n\n6. The ultimate resolution, I'll form. My idea is that Lena manages to defeat the hybrids ( somewhat ), but doesn't destroy them, probably due to learning the Hybrids are descendants of her daughter. While Lena is searching for Ethan and acquiring power through her journey, the Tiamat field spreads slowly, and inside the epicenter of the field, Nate and Tiamat are discussing whether Tiamat should just devour earth and everyone else. \nBased on your ideas, here's a suggestion on how to weave these elements together into a cohesive narrative:\n\nLena's journey begins with her awakening, and her initial allies are the other women who were Ethan's ex-partners or admirers. Their shared history with Ethan could create a tense and uneasy alliance, as they navigate the dangers of the post-apocalyptic world.\n\nAs Lena learns more about her daughter's descendants, the Hybrids, she becomes increasingly determined to confront them and understand their true nature. This could serve as a driving force for her journey, as well as a source of internal conflict, as she wrestles with her anger toward Ethan and her own guilt.\n\nThe introduction of Mr. Gray as a mentor and ally to Lena adds depth and complexity to the story. His vast knowledge and experience could provide Lena with valuable guidance, while his ulterior motives and manipulative nature could create tension and mistrust within their alliance. The dynamic between Lena and Mr. Gray could be a key aspect of the novel, as they navigate their shared past and uncertain future.\n\nOlivia, the sociopathic ex-love interest of Ethan, could serve as a wild card in Lena's journey. Her unpredictability and dangerous nature could create suspense and tension, as Lena is forced to navigate the delicate balance between keeping Olivia as an ally and protecting herself from Olivia's potential betrayal or violence.\n\nAs Lena and her companions travel through the Tiamat zone, they could encounter various factions and cultures shaped by the post-apocalyptic world. These encounters could provide opportunities for world-building, as well as challenges and obstacles for Lena to overcome as she seeks Ethan and the truth about the Hybrids.\n\nThe ultimate resolution of Lena's journey could involve a climactic confrontation with the Hybrids, in which she must decide whether to destroy them or try to forge a new future with them as her daughter's descendants. This decision could be complicated by her ongoing relationship with Mr. Gray, as well as her unresolved feelings toward Ethan.\n\nThe subplot of Nate and Tiamat discussing the fate of Earth could add a sense of urgency and impending doom to the story, as Lena races against time to find a solution that will save humanity. The resolution of this subplot could be linked to Lena's ultimate decision regarding the Hybrids, potentially offering a way to avert disaster and reshape the world.\n\nBy intertwining these elements and character arcs, you can create a rich and engaging story that explores the complexities of your post-apocalyptic world and the personal struggles of Lena as she confronts her past, her future, and the fate of humanity.",
