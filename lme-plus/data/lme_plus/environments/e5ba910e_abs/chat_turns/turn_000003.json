  "content": "Iron is a nutrient that is often associated with animal products. However, it is definitely possible for vegans to meet their iron requirements through diet. There are plenty of plant-based sources of iron, such as beans, lentils, tofu, nuts and seeds, whole grains, and dark leafy greens. In fact, some vegan iron sources may even be better absorbed by the body than animal-based sources. Iron absorption can be enhanced by consuming foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, berries, and bell peppers, at the same time as iron-containing foods. Vigilant vegan eaters can usually get enough iron through food, but supplements are also an option for those who need them. So, while it is a common misconception, it is possible for vegans to get the iron that they need.",
