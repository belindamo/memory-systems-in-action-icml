  "content": "Calcium is another nutrient that is commonly associated with animal products, particularly dairy. However, like with iron, it is entirely possible for vegans to meet their calcium needs through plant-based sources. Some excellent sources of calcium for vegans include leafy greens (kale, collard greens, bok choy), beans, tofu, figs, fortified plant-based milk and yogurts, and fortified orange juice. It is also possible to get calcium from fortified plant-based supplements. Vegans should aim for around 1000-1200 mg of calcium per day, which can vary depending on age, sex, and other factors. With careful food choices or supplements if necessary, it is possible for vegans to get enough calcium and prevent deficiency.",
