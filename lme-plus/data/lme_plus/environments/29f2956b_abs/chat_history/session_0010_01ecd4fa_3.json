For example, use a strong adhesive like epoxy or hot glue for heavier objects, and a decoupage medium or acrylic glue for lighter objects.\n2. **Experiment with placement:** Arrange the found objects on your collage surface to create a visually appealing composition. Consider balance, harmony, and contrast.\n3. **Secure the objects:** Apply the adhesive to the object and attach it to your collage surface. Make sure it's securely attached to prevent it from falling off over time.\n4. **Integrate with other materials:** Combine found objects with paper, fabric, or other materials to create a cohesive and intriguing artwork.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n1. **Use found objects as a focal point:** Create a centerpiece with a striking found object, and build your collage around it.\n2. **Create a narrative:** Use found objects to tell a story or convey a message in your artwork.\n3. **Experiment with assemblage:** Combine multiple found objects to create a 3D assemblage that adds depth and dimensionality to your collage.\n4. **Play with transparency:** Use transparent or translucent found objects, like glass or plastic, to add an extra layer of visual interest.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative when incorporating found objects into your collage!
