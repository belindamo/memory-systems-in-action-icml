It's great that you're thinking about responsible disposal instead of just throwing them away. Here are some eco-friendly options to consider:\n\n1. **Donate them**: If your shoes are still in decent condition, consider donating them to a local charity or thrift store. Many organizations accept gently used shoes, which can then be distributed to those in need or sold to raise funds for a good cause.\n2. **Repurpose them**: Think creatively about how you can repurpose your old shoes. You could use them as planters for small plants, turn them into bird feeders, or even create a unique piece of art.

Check if Converse or other brands have similar programs.\n4. **Proper disposal**: If your shoes are truly at the end of their life, make sure to dispose of them responsibly. You can take them to a local recycling center or check with your municipal waste management to see if they have special collections for textiles or shoes.\n\nBefore disposing of your shoes, consider the following:\n\n* Remove any laces, insoles, or other removable parts that can be reused or recycled separately.\n* Clean the shoes to prevent any potential contamination during the recycling process.\n* If you're donating, make sure to check the condition and cleanliness of the shoes to ensure they're acceptable to the receiving organization.\n\nAs for keeping the memories attached to your old shoes, you could:\n\n* Take a photo of the shoes and create a digital memory book or scrapbook.\n* Write down the stories and memories associated with the shoes in a journal or on a card.\n* Keep a small memento, like a lace or a button, as a reminder of the good times you had with your old shoes.\n\nRemember, it's okay to let go of old shoes, but it's great that you're considering the environmental impact and finding ways to honor the memories attached to them."

I'm happy to help you get started on organizing your closet and making the most of your space.\n\n**Before you start:**\n\n1. **Purge and declutter**: Take everything out of your closet and sort items into three piles: keep, donate/sell, and discard.
