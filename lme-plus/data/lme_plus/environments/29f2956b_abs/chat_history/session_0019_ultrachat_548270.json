Generally, entry-level certifications (such as Microsoft Technology Associate and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner) are less challenging and require less time commitment to complete than advanced certifications (such as AWS Certified Solutions Architect or Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 11 Developer). \n\nHowever, the difficulty of a certification is not just determined by its level. Some certifications may cover comprehensive and complex topics, requiring long hours of study and preparation, while others may have more limited topics and be relatively easy to complete.\n\nIt's crucial to research carefully before choosing a certification to pursue, to ensure it aligns with your career goals and the required skillset. Many certification providers offer preparation materials, classes, and exams outlines to help candidates plan their study goals better. Therefore, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with the certification exam structure and the percentage of questions for the various topics."
