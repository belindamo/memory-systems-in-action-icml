      "content": "You are a strategist for a political campaigner. \n\n\"I am currently a Lecturer in Social Policy in the Department of Applied Social Studies in Maynooth. I teach courses at post-graduate and under-graduate level in housing, rights and inequality; civic engagement and civil society; the changing nature of the welfare state; and climate, social policy and inequality. \nI have researched and published in academic and policy fields of housing and social housing, spatial disadvantage, housing rights, economic inequality, neoliberalism and the welfare state, social justice, and social movements. I have a PhD in political and economic geography from Trinity College Dublin in 2009. \nMy most recent publication is the book, 'Housing Shock: The Irish Housing Crisis and How to Solve it' (Policy Press, 2020). It is a highly original book that was the first in Ireland to identify the emergence of Generation Rent, the distorting role of global investor funds in Irish housing, the profoundly damaging impact of homelessness on families, and identifying new solutions based on a based human rights vision for Irish housing and a practical policy pathway to ensure affordable, secure, decent quality and environmentally sustainable homes for everyone. It tackles one of the most pressing social crises facing contemporary Ireland. It makes a compelling case for enshrining the Right to Housing in our Constitution. It is written in a highly accessible, passionate way, that details the author\u2019s personal journey from community worker to academic and activist and how his housing story interwove with his commitment and drive to achieve a human right to housing for everyone ins this country. The book is highly inspirational as it is not just as description of the crisis, but also provides direct voices of those affected, outlines solutions and offers pathways for citizens to engage in action to change the situation. In a short space of time the book has made a major contribution to the Irish policy debate on housing and to empowering those affected by the crisis and those trying to change it. The President of Ireland, in recognition of this contribution as a scholarly resource of national importance, invited the author to present the book to him personally in Aras an Uachtarain in June 2021. An academic review in the international journal Critical Social Policy describes the book as \u201ca highly welcome and thoughtful addition to the debate about housing in Ireland, drawing on comparative examples, quantitative and qualitative data, and his engagement with the topic as both researcher and activist to do so\u201d. \nWhile Leilani Farha, Global Director of the Shift and former UN Rapporteur on Adequate Housing 2014-2020, describes the book as providing a really important and insightful contribution to the global debate on financialisation, inequality and the right to housing.\u201d The Irish Times described it as \u201ca valuable book. It is a tool for better understanding our current predicament and what we can do about it\u201d. \nIn 2011 I published an academic peer\nreviewed book, \u2018Public Private\nPartnerships in Ireland; Failed experiment or the way forward?\u2019 (Manchester\nUniversity Press in 2011). \nI have also published in high quality international peer reviewed journals. For example, drawing from praxis-based research on \u2018the right to the city\u2019 and human rights based approaches (undertaken as a community worker in Dolphin House, Dublin from 2007 to 2013) I have published in the international Journal of Human Rights Practice, Human Geography, and the Irish Journal of Community Work. While I have published on my innovative research into new social movements and civil society in Ireland in Interface, and in Geoforum\nOver\n2015-2017, I was a Senior Policy Analyst with the inequality research think\ntank, TASC where I researched the political economy of economic inequality and\nthe welfare state, with a particular focus on housing, financialisation, social\npolicy and inequality. I was lead author of Cherishing\nAll Equally 2016: Economic Inequality in Ireland and \u2018Home\nor wealth generator? Inequality, financialisation and the Irish Housing crisis\u2019 (TASC, 2017). \nI worked between 2017 and 2018 on the H2020 funded Re-InVEST (Rebuilding an Inclusive, Value-based Europe\nof Solidarity and Trust through Social Investments) project. It involved research (qualitative\nand quantitative) into EU and national state social policy (in the water,\nhousing, finance, childcare and early childhood education, labour market, and\nhealth sectors) across 13 EU countries. I co-developed, with the Irish Principal Investigator\non Re-InVEST, Dr Mary Murphy, the Re-InVEST project\u2019s methodological approach,\nthe Participatory Action Human Rights and\nCapabilities Approach (PAHRCA), and the PAHRCA Toolkit. \nI am also a public intellectual and regularly contribute to discussion of contemporary social, economic and political issues on national media and contribute to public events dealing with these issues.\""

Develop clear policy proposals to address these issues, including the right to housing, affordable housing, and addressing spatial disadvantage.\n2. Build a strong narrative: Connect your personal journey from community worker to academic and activist to your political campaign. Emphasize your commitment to creating a more just and equitable society, and use stories from your research and personal experience to illustrate the real-world impact of the issues you're addressing.\n3. Engage with grassroots movements and community organizations: Collaborate with local groups working on housing, social justice, and inequality issues. These partnerships can help amplify your message, mobilize supporters, and provide valuable insights from the community.\n4.

      "content": "Title: Government's Decision to Lift Eviction Ban Threatens Thousands of Families Amid Economic Uncertainty\n\n1. Introduction: Express deep concern over the government's decision to lift the eviction ban, which will put thousands of vulnerable families at risk of homelessness in a time of economic hardship.\n2. Impact on families: Highlight the devastating consequences for families who will face eviction, including increased stress, uncertainty, and the potential for long-term damage to children's wellbeing and development.\n3.

Lifting the eviction ban will only worsen these struggles, pushing families further into poverty and creating an even greater divide between the haves and have-nots.\n5. Call for a comprehensive housing policy: Urge the government to develop and implement a comprehensive housing policy that addresses the root causes of the crisis, including increased investment in social housing, rent control measures, and support for first-time homebuyers.\n6. Demand for immediate action: Insist that the government reinstate the eviction ban until a comprehensive housing policy is in place to ensure that no family is left without a safe and secure place to call home.\n7. Human rights perspective: Emphasize that housing is a fundamental human right, and the government has a moral and legal obligation to protect and uphold this right for all citizens.\n8. Community support: Encourage community members and organizations to stand in solidarity with families facing eviction and demand that the government takes immediate action to address this crisis.\n9. Offer of support: Reiterate your commitment to working with the government and other stakeholders to find long-term, sustainable solutions to the housing crisis in Ireland.\n10. Conclusion: Conclude by expressing hope that the government will reconsider its decision to lift the eviction ban and commit to prioritizing the wellbeing of Ireland's most vulnerable citizens."
