Boat pose (Paripurna Navasana) and side plank (Vasisthasana) are excellent choices to target your core muscles. Here are some tips to help you practice them correctly and effectively:\n\n**Boat Pose (Paripurna Navasana):**\n\n1. **Start with a strong foundation**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Engage your core by drawing your navel towards your spine.\n2. **Lengthen your spine**: Keep your back straight, chest open, and shoulders relaxed.\n3. **Lift your legs**: Bend your knees and lift your feet off the ground, keeping them a few inches apart. Avoid lifting your legs too high, as this can put pressure on your lower back.\n4. **Engage your core**: Draw your belly button towards your spine and maintain a gentle, steady contraction. This will help you balance and stabilize in the pose.\n5. **Breathe and hold**: Hold the pose for 3-5 breaths, feeling the engagement of your core muscles.\n6. **Modify or use props**: If you're struggling to balance, try using a block or strap to support your back or legs. You can also modify the pose by lifting one leg at a time or using a bent-knee variation.\n\n**Side Plank (Vasisthasana):**\n\n1. **Start in a high plank**: Begin in a high plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your feet hip-width apart.\n2. **Shift your weight**: Shift your weight onto one hand and the outer edge of the corresponding foot. Lift the other foot off the ground and stack it on top of the first foot.\n3. **Engage your core**: Draw your navel towards your spine and engage your core muscles to maintain balance and stability.\n4. **Straighten your body**: Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, avoiding any sagging or collapsing.\n5. **Breathe and hold**: Hold the pose for 3-5 breaths, feeling the engagement of your core and shoulder muscles.\n6. **Switch sides**: Repeat on the other side to ensure balanced strength and flexibility.\n\n**Additional Core-Strengthening Tips:**\n\n1. **Engage your transverse abdominis**: This deep abdominal muscle helps stabilize your core. Imagine pulling your belly button towards your spine and maintaining a gentle contraction.\n2. **Use your breath**: Practice deep, controlled breathing to help engage your core muscles and maintain balance in challenging poses.\n3. **Incorporate other core-focused poses**: Try incorporating other poses like plank, tree pose, eagle pose, and warrior III to target different aspects of your core strength.\n4. **Practice regularly**: Consistency is key when building core strength. Aim to practice these poses 2-3 times a week, and gradually increase the duration and frequency as you build strength and endurance.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and modify or come out of the pose if you experience any discomfort or pain. Happy practicing!",
