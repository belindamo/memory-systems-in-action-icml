  "content": "Yeah, I attended the University of Michigan for my undergraduate studies. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration back in 2018. The article mentioned how the university's business program has been consistently ranked among the top in the country, which wasn't surprising to me given my positive experience there.\n\nOne of my favorite professors was Dr. Johnson, who taught my finance class. He was really knowledgeable and made the subject matter engaging and accessible. I also had a great time participating in the university's business club, which gave me opportunities to network with professionals in the field and learn from their experiences.\n\nWhat about you? Have you had any experiences with the University of Michigan or its business program?",
