  "content": "The Enigma M4, like other Enigma machines, had a very large number of possible configurations, making it difficult to break the cipher without knowledge of the key settings.\n\nThe Enigma M4 used a total of eight rotors, which could be arranged in any one of 40,320 different ways (i.e., 8 factorial or 8!), if all eight rotors were different. However, in practice, not all rotors were different, and some were only used in specific positions.\n\nThe Enigma M4 also used a reflector and a plugboard, which further increased the number of possible encryption settings. In total, the Enigma M4 had an estimated number of possible configurations in the order of 10^22, or tens of trillions of possible settings.\n\nDespite the large number of possible configurations, the efforts of the codebreakers at Bletchley Park, working with captured Enigma machines and messages, were ultimately able to break the Enigma cipher and gain a significant advantage in the war. This was achieved through a combination of mathematical analysis, technological innovation, and human ingenuity, and remains one of the most significant achievements in the history of cryptography and codebreaking.",
