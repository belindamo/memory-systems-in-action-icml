What is your expected user base size, and do you anticipate rapid growth?\n2. Are there any specific identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub) you'd like to integrate with?\n3. Do you have existing authentication and authorization systems in place, or would you like to start from scratch?\n4. Are there any specific security or compliance requirements you need to meet (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?\n\nPlease feel free to provide any additional information that might help me better understand your requirements.",
