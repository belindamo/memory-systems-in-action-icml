Ensure it fits your schedule, learning style, and commitments.\n4. **Teaching style and experience**: Research the lead teachers' experience, teaching style, and philosophy. Ensure they're a good fit for you and can provide the guidance you need.\n5. **Curriculum and focus**: Review the program's curriculum, focusing on areas like asana practice, pranayama, anatomy, philosophy, and teaching methodology. Ensure it covers the aspects you're interested in.\n6. **Practicum and mentorship**: Look for programs that offer a practicum or mentorship component, where you'll receive guidance and feedback on your teaching skills.\n7. **Cost and value**: Compare prices, considering the program's length, quality, and reputation. Ensure you understand what's included in the cost and what additional expenses you might incur.\n8. **Graduation requirements**: Clarify the graduation requirements, including the number of hours, assignments, and exams. Ensure you're comfortable with the expectations.\n9. **Support and community**: Consider the program's support system, including access to teachers, mentors, and a community of fellow trainees.\n10. **Visit or observe**: If possible, visit the studio or observe a class to get a sense of the teaching style, atmosphere, and community.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to ask questions like:\n\n* What's the program's focus on safety, alignment, and modifications?\n* How will I be supported in developing my teaching skills and confidence?\n* Are there opportunities for continuing education and professional development?\n* What's the program's reputation in the yoga community?\n\nBy considering these factors, you'll be well on your way to finding a YTT program that's right for you.
