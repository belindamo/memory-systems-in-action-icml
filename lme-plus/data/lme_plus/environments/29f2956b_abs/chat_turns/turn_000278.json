To create a cohesive display, consider the following tips:\n\n1. **Unifying Theme**: Since both items are nostalgic collectibles, you can create a retro-themed display.

For a Star Wars theme, you could use a palette of red, white, black, and silver.

You could place the lunchbox on a pedestal or a stack of books, and the coin display case on a shelf or a smaller pedestal.\n4. **Contextualize the Display**: Add some context to the display by including other nostalgic items, such as vintage Star Wars or Marvel comics, action figures, or posters. This will create a sense of nostalgia and storytelling around your display.\n5. **Lighting**: Use soft, warm lighting to highlight the display. You could use table lamps or string lights with a warm tone to create a cozy, nostalgic ambiance.\n\nSome ideas for display arrangements:\n\n* Place the lunchbox on a shelf above the coin display case, with the coins arranged in a pattern or design that complements the lunchbox.\n* Create a diorama using the lunchbox as a centerpiece, surrounded by coins and other nostalgic items.\n* Use a riser or pedestal to create a multi-level display, with the lunchbox on one level and the coin display case on another.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with your display!",
