  "content": "The Enigma I, also known as the Wehrmacht Enigma, had a total of eight rotors available, although only three or four rotors were used in each machine at a given time. The specific rotors used in a given machine and message were determined by the encryption key and were changed on a daily basis.\n\nThe Enigma M3, introduced in 1938, used a total of five rotors, as you mentioned. The Enigma M4, introduced later in the war, used a total of eight rotors, similar to the Enigma I.\n\nThe use of multiple rotors was a key feature of the Enigma machines, as it increased the number of possible encryption settings and made the cipher more difficult to break. The rotors were interchangeable and could be set to different starting positions, adding even more complexity to the encryption process. The use of multiple rotors was also a significant challenge for the codebreakers at Bletchley Park, who had to develop innovative methods and technologies to break the cipher and gain a critical advantage in the war.",
