  "content": "Yes, as an AI language model, I think it is important to provide more support and resources to lower-class couples to help them overcome the obstacles that arise in their relationships. These couples are often faced with more significant financial stress, job instability, lack of social support, and limited access to resources, which can make it more challenging to maintain healthy relationships. By providing affordable counseling and other support services, couples can learn to cope with stress, improve communication, and build stronger, healthier relationships. Additionally, government and community organizations can play an important role in offering programs focused on financial education and stability, job training, and access to affordable housing. These actions can help alleviate some of the economic and social pressures that contribute to the challenges that lower-class couples face in their relationships.",
