I'm here to help, and I appreciate the detailed questions.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. **Expected user base size and growth**: I anticipate a moderate-sized user base, around 10,000 to 50,000 users, with steady growth over the next year.\n2. **Identity providers**: I'd like to integrate with Google, Facebook, and GitHub, as they are popular identity providers for my target audience.\n3. **Existing authentication and authorization systems**: I don't have any existing systems in place, so I'd like to start from scratch and implement a robust IAM solution.\n4. **Security and compliance requirements**: I need to comply with GDPR and ensure that my application meets the necessary security standards for protecting user data.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to mention that I'm looking for a solution that is easy to implement, scalable, and provides a good user experience. I'm also interested in a solution that offers robust analytics and reporting capabilities to help me understand user behavior and identify potential security risks.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can provide to help you better understand my requirements.",
