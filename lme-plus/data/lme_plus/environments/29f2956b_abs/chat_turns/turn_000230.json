Establish a clear, concise platform: Your platform should focus on the issues that matter most to you and where you have expertise, such as housing, economic inequality, and social justice. Develop clear policy proposals to address these issues, including the right to housing, affordable housing, and addressing spatial disadvantage.\n2. Build a strong narrative: Connect your personal journey from community worker to academic and activist to your political campaign. Emphasize your commitment to creating a more just and equitable society, and use stories from your research and personal experience to illustrate the real-world impact of the issues you're addressing.\n3. Engage with grassroots movements and community organizations: Collaborate with local groups working on housing, social justice, and inequality issues. These partnerships can help amplify your message, mobilize supporters, and provide valuable insights from the community.\n4. Utilize your academic and policy expertise: Highlight your research and publications as evidence of your deep understanding of the issues at hand. Use your experience working on EU and national social policy projects to demonstrate your ability to navigate complex policy environments and deliver results.\n5. Position yourself as a thought leader: Continue contributing to public discussions on social, economic, and political issues through media appearances, op-eds, and public events. Use these opportunities to emphasize your policy proposals and build your reputation as a knowledgeable and passionate advocate for change.\n6.

These endorsements can provide credibility and help broaden your appeal to voters.\n8. Engage with voters: Make an effort to connect with voters through town halls, community events, and social media. Listen to their concerns and be responsive to their needs. Use these interactions to refine your policy proposals and strengthen your message.\n9. Focus on key demographics: Target your campaign messaging and outreach efforts towards demographics most affected by the issues you're addressing, such as low-income households, renters, and marginalized communities.\n10.
