  "content": "**Technical expertise and resources**: My development team has a good understanding of web application development, but they don't have extensive experience with IAM implementations. They're skilled in languages like JavaScript, Node.js, and React, but they might need guidance on implementing and customizing an IAM solution. We have a dedicated team of 5-6 developers, and we're open to investing time and resources into learning and implementing an IAM solution.\n\n**Timeline and milestones**: We're looking to implement an IAM solution within the next 3-6 months. Our priority is to ensure the security and integrity of our users' data, so we're willing to invest time and resources into getting it right. We don't have any hard deadlines, but we'd like to have a solution in place before we launch our next major feature update, which is scheduled for Q3.\n\nIn terms of milestones, we're looking to:\n\n1. Research and select an IAM solution within the next 2 weeks\n2. Implement and integrate the IAM solution within the next 3-4 months\n3. Conduct thorough testing and QA to ensure the solution meets our security and compliance requirements\n4. Launch the IAM solution with our next feature update in Q3\n\nWe're open to guidance on the implementation process and would appreciate any recommendations on how to ensure a smooth and successful rollout.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any other information you need to help with your recommendation.",
