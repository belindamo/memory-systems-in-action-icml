  "content": "That's great to hear that the demo left a positive impression on you! The sense of accomplishment when overcoming challenges is a hallmark of FromSoftware's games, and it's excellent to hear that Elden Ring is carrying on that tradition.\n\nAs for multiplayer elements, FromSoftware has confirmed that Elden Ring will have some online features, but the extent of them is still unclear. In an interview, the game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, mentioned that the game will have \"some asynchronous online elements\" and that they're \"not ruling out the possibility of some kind of multiplayer\" in the future. However, he also emphasized that the game's primary focus is on the single-player experience.\n\nIt's likely that the online features will be similar to those in Dark Souls, where players can leave messages and summon each other for co-op play. However, it's unclear if Elden Ring will have more extensive multiplayer features, such as competitive PvP or large-scale co-op.\n\nIt's great that you pre-ordered the collector's edition, by the way! I'm sure it'll be a fantastic package. Are you planning on playing it on PC or console?",
