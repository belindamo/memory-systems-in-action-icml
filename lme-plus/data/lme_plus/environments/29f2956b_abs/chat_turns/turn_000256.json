  "content": "There are many design theories, but here are three popular ones:\n\n1. Gestalt Theory: This theory emphasizes that people tend to perceive visual elements as a whole rather than as individual parts. The Gestalt principles include proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, figure-ground, and common fate.\n2. Color Theory: This theory explains how color can be used to evoke emotions and create different moods. It involves understanding the color wheel, color harmony, color contrast, and color psychology.\n3. User-Centered Design: This theory focuses on designing products or services that are user-friendly and meet the needs and goals of the target audience. It involves understanding user behavior, conducting user research, creating personas, and iterating on design solutions based on user feedback.",
