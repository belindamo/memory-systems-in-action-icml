  "content": "A portable charger is a great idea! Having a reliable portable charger can be a lifesaver, especially when you're on-the-go and need to top up your phone's battery.\n\nI've got some recommendations for compact portable chargers with decent capacities. Here are a few options:\n\n**1. Anker PowerCore 5000:**\nThis is a super compact charger that's about the size of a lipstick. It has a capacity of 5000mAh, which is enough to charge most smartphones at least once. It's also very lightweight and has a sleek design.\n\n**2. Mophie Powerstation Mini:**\nMophie is a well-known brand in the portable charger space, and their Powerstation Mini is a great option. It has a capacity of 4000mAh and is about the size of a small wallet. It's also very stylish and has a premium feel to it.\n\n**3. Jackery Titan 20000mAh:**\nIf you need a charger with a higher capacity, the Jackery Titan is a great option. It has a massive 20000mAh capacity, which can charge your phone multiple times. It's a bit larger than the other two options, but it's still compact enough to fit in a backpack or purse.\n\n**4. Aukey Power Bank 10000mAh:**\nAukey is another popular brand in the portable charger space, and their 10000mAh power bank is a great value. It's compact, lightweight, and has a decent capacity. It also has multiple USB ports, so you can charge multiple devices at once.\n\nWhen choosing a portable charger, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Capacity:** How much power do you need? If you only need to top up your phone occasionally, a smaller capacity like 5000mAh might be sufficient. If you need to charge your phone multiple times, look for a higher capacity like 20000mAh.\n* **Size and weight:** How portable do you need the charger to be? If you want something that fits in your pocket, look for a compact charger like the Anker PowerCore 5000.\n* **Design and build quality:** Do you care about the design and build quality of the charger? If you want a premium feel, look for brands like Mophie or Aukey.\n* **Price:** Portable chargers can range from under $20 to over $100, depending on the capacity and features. Set a budget and look for chargers that fit within it.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect portable charger to complement your new screen protector!",
