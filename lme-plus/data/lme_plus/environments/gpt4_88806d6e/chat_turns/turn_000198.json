  "content": "Yes, breast cancer can be detected early through screening tests like mammograms. Mammograms are X-ray images of the breast that can detect early signs of breast cancer, such as lumps or abnormal tissue. The American Cancer Society recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer receive yearly mammograms from age 45 to 54, and then every two years from age 55 and older. Women with a higher risk of breast cancer may need to start getting mammograms earlier or more often. It is important for women to talk about their breast cancer risk and how often they should get screened with their healthcare provider.",
