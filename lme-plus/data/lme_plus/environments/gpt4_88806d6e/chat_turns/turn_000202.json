  "content": "While mammograms can be uncomfortable, they are an effective way to detect breast cancer early. Waiting until you have symptoms of breast cancer is not recommended as it may delay diagnosis and treatment, which could potentially worsen the outcomes. Additionally, not all breast cancers cause noticeable symptoms, especially in the early stages, so regular screenings are important. It is recommended that women with an average risk of breast cancer receive yearly mammograms starting at age 45. Women with higher risk factors, such as a family history of breast cancer, may need to start mammograms at an earlier age and/or receive them more frequently. It's always best to discuss your individual risk factors and screening recommendations with your healthcare provider. Regular mammograms can save lives by detecting breast cancer early, when it's most treatable.",
