  "content": "I'm going to try applying the Chipping Medium to the panel lines using the drybrushing technique. I'll make sure to use a fine detail brush and gentle strokes to achieve a subtle effect. I might also experiment with stippling and fading to add more depth and realism to the weathering. Do you think I should use a specific color for the Chipping Medium mixture, or can I just use the same color as the panel lines?",
