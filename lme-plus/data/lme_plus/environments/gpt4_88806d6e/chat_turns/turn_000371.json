  "content": "I really like the sound of the Fresh Fruit Salad and the Garlic and Herb Roasted Cherry Tomatoes. I think they'll pair really well with the Stuffed French Toast and the Southwestern Omelette. I've been experimenting with different brunch recipes on weekends and I'd love to have some inspiration for other dishes to serve with these sides. Do you have any suggestions for other main courses that would complement these sides well?",
