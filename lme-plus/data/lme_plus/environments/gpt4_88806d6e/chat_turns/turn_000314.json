I can provide general information and suggestions, but I wouldn't know about specific churches or events in your area.\n\nThat being said, it's great to hear that you had a moving experience at Our Lady of Lourdes Church on Good Friday! The Stations of the Cross is a powerful devotion that can be a meaningful way to reflect on Christ's passion and crucifixion.\n\nTo find Catholic churches in your local area, you can try the following tips:\n\n1. **Online Search**: Type in \"Catholic churches near me\" or \"Catholic churches in [your city/zip code]\" in a search engine like Google.\n2. **Google Maps**: Use Google Maps to search for Catholic churches in your area. You can filter the results by rating, distance, and hours of operation.\n3. **Diocesan Website**: Look up the website of your local Catholic diocese, which often has a directory of parishes and churches in the area.\n4. **Ask Around**: Ask your friends, family, or coworkers for recommendations.\n5. **Drive Around**: Take a drive around your neighborhood or nearby areas and keep an eye out for churches.\n\nWhen you find a church that interests you, be sure to:\n\n* Check the church's website or call the parish office to confirm hours of operation, Mass schedules, and any specific rules or guidelines for visitors.\n* Plan your visit during a time when the church is open, and try to avoid disrupting any services or events.\n* Be respectful of the church and its community. Remember to dress modestly, turn off your phone, and refrain from taking photos during services.\n\nI hope these tips help you find some beautiful and peaceful Catholic churches in your local area!",
