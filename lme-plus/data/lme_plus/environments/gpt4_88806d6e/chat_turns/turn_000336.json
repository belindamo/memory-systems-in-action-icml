The Affordable Digital Piano with Premium Features \ud83c\udfb9 - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"[Music] today we've got Roland's RP 107 this is Roland's entry-level digital 88 note piano with lots to offer when it comes to speaker detail love the action we're also going to listen to the supernatural piano sound very similar what they've got now on the gp3 let's get started with this right away [Music] oh [Music] the space that rp-107 is fighting for in the marketplace is a crowded one there are many many options in that sub 1500 US dollar range for an entry-level console piano you've got the KDP 75 and the KDP 120 from Kauai you've got the Yamaha Arias ydp 145 165 kind of flirting around that price range and now with Roland we've got the RP 107 which replaced the RP 102 and so where exactly does this fit in let's first start with the basics the rp-107 uses the new BMC chip and that is driving an updated Supernatural piano engine so this is going to be a very similar piano tone experience to what you might get out of say the fp30x or even the brand new Roland gp3 digital grand piano now we've got this line out plugged in out of the headphone jack because there's no discrete audio jacks out so I'm going to put the headphones on and do just a little bit of playing so you can get a sense of what the piano sound is on this rp107 foreign [Music] thank you [Music] so I find this generally with the supernatural engine not necessarily getting into the modeling because some of this changes but in the sample based Supernatural engine you have this really fat attack right across the range anytime you're in sort of the Forte and up range and that's one of the most characteristic elements I guess of the roll and sound I think this works incredibly well for a lot of contemporary playing I think this works super well as well for jazz because it gives you that that punch that energy behind the note sometimes that that type of attack starts to feel overbearing depending on the type of classical music that you might be playing but only once you get up into a really particularly high range because on the other hand sometimes the lack of aggressiveness you can get out of some of those other instruments I mentioned can be a little frustrating depending on again the type of music that you are wanting to play so Roland definitely giving you something different than any of the other brands in this price range in terms the piano sound foreign [Music] let's also now talk about the action because key action is really important especially for people who are just starting out and chances are if you're looking at this or any of the those other models I mentioned you probably are at the beginning of your journey this is as likely like your first console digital piano possibly the first one was 88 notes and weighted notes so action super important for you if if you fall into that category action and finding one that really connects with you is going to be a really big part of how connected you feel with the instrument but it also leads directly to good development of technique and muscle tone which is important because if you transition then from this up to an acoustic having a digital which is going to ease that transition the best as possible I think is a really big benefit and in this regard I think this is where the RP 107 holds its own and possibly leads the pack this has the PHA for Action in it and the pH j4 action is definitely a professional grade action this action is going into instruments such as the Phantom 08 it's going into instruments like the rd88 it's even in instruments such as their gp3 digital baby grand that was released not too long ago really widely used across the roll and range it has a triple sensor basically it's going to detect the motion of the key really quite well as it sends that information off to either a computer or the internal tone generator it also has escapement or let off which means that about two-thirds of the way down the key you can actually feel a little hiccup and I've you know I make mention of this a lot that little hiccup for me provides just a tiny bit of resistance um that you really only feel when you're playing kind of in the lower Dynamic ranges and that resistance adds just a touch more control in my opinion for me anyway for sure it adds that control and a little bit more realism when you're moving back and forth between this and an acoustic piano when it comes to the action I think the weighting of the key is also very similar to what you're going to find on a larger upright or a small well lubricated baby grand slightly on the heavier side so it's got a great sense of depth it's got a great sense of inertia behind it which I think is good for training your fingers and really lets you be expressive over a big wide dynamic range and then it's it's got nice accurate output thank you [Music] the specs on these speakers aren't very impressive I think they say that they're eight Watts aside which you know if we're just going off off the ink on this um means that this shouldn't sound much better than say a slab a basic you know portable instrument for you know a thousand dollars or something like that however the way that they have done the speaker boxes inside here and also that the way they've designed the key cover is actually linked to how you're hearing the sound because they leave this very intentional Gap right over top of the key cover where you're getting quite a bit of tone coming out the front a lot of detail and they've left distance between the top of the keyboard and the back of the speaker so you're getting some very directed treble that's coming through here so unlike most of the other instruments in this price range that have more powerful but exclusively down facing speakers with really no tone porting out the front this is taking advantage of a more efficient design where even though you are getting a little less bass and you really do notice it it's just it's um it's not that it feels like it's lacking projection but there's just that that lower warmth that you don't quite get like you get on say the kawhi's of this range um but there's way more detail that you're getting out of the speakers so the experience of playing this with headphones and the experience of playing it without headphones is actually a lot closer than what you get on some of the the other models that we've mentioned earlier in this review and you've heard the line out now we're going to actually listen to the speakers so you can get a sense of that so here is the rp107 through its speakers being picked up by two stereo microphones directly over top of my head [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] this comes with the stand and the triple pedal and a bench included so in that regard it is a very similar offering to what the others the interface on this very simple it's not loaded up with a ton of sounds so to me this reminds me a lot of what you would get say out of uh like one of the Kawaii KDP 75s or even one of the original es series I think there's 15 tones on here so it's going to give you some e pianos a few strings the ability to you know layer to those sounds on top of one another some basic but still engaging fun stuff it's only available in this black you can't get it in any other color comes with the music stand as you can see it's also got these little Twigs here that help to keep some of the thinner music sheet music in place this has a Bluetooth midi and Bluetooth audio you can connect it to the rolling piano app as I think we've mentioned a little earlier and that gives you the ability to kind of remote control the various settings as well as access all of the lesson programming in here because there's over 300 songs preloaded most of those are in the form of play along repertoire from some of the most popular method books that are out there so to wrap up this look at the rp107 here's where I think it has a place first of all you need to like the role in piano tone just like if you're buying a Yamaha you've got like the Yamaha piano tone or the Kauai or the Casio or the Korg or whatever it is so that is I think the first thing that you need to fall in love with before any of this other stuff matters it's based off the Steinway D Concert Grand and I know that there are a lot of people who do like the sound and the tone that Roland brings when we get to the action I think the action is an incredibly pianistic properly weighted very nuanced action that you can get tons of mileage out of definitely the first many years of playing even even if you're taking this at a at a very serious level this has lots of runway in which to develop your musculature etc etc and then when it comes to the speaker performance even though this is not going to give you this big Woofy warm base the detail you get out of this console even though they're relatively small speakers facing down because of these front toe ports is really impressive I I was extremely happy to hear the kind of detail and closeness that I was feeling with this piano because that's not very usual normally if you want that kind of super precise detail you've got to put headphones on but I didn't feel the need with the rp-107 so all in all I think the piano experience on the rp107 is as good as the very best instruments in this category and it's bringing a slightly different tone that that some people may really enjoy more than some of the others [Music] foreign [Music] if you want to check out more
