  "content": "The solution that will meet the requirements of making the student records in a PostgreSQL database available and online across multiple AWS Regions at all times with the least amount of operational overhead for an online learning company migrating to AWS is:\n\nC. Migrate the PostgreSQL database to an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. Create a read replica in another Region.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOption C is the best solution because it is designed to replicate data asynchronously to another Region, providing disaster recovery and availability benefits. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL offers the capability to create a read replica in another AWS Region, which can be used for disaster recovery and to serve read traffic from the Region where the replica is created. The read replica can also be promoted to become the new master in the event of a failure in the primary Region. This option has the least amount of operational overhead because Amazon RDS takes care of the replication and failover processes, and it requires minimal setup and management.\n\nOption A, migrating the PostgreSQL database to a PostgreSQL cluster on Amazon EC2 instances, is not the best option because it requires more operational overhead than Amazon RDS, including managing the instances, the data replication, and backups.\n\nOption B, migrating the PostgreSQL database to an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance with the Multi-AZ feature turned on, is not the best option because it only provides disaster recovery in the same AWS Region, and it may not be sufficient for the company's needs of having data available and online across multiple AWS Regions.\n\nOption D, migrating the PostgreSQL database to an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance and setting up DB snapshots to be copied to another Region, is not the best option because it is not designed for replication and it requires more operational overhead than using read replicas.",
