  "content": "Yes, there has been some research done on the current state of fish populations in Lake Huron.\n\nOne of the most significant changes in the fish populations in Lake Huron has been the decline of the native lake trout population. In the 1950s and 1960s, the combined effects of overfishing, habitat destruction, and invasive species led to a dramatic decline in the lake trout population. However, conservation efforts, such as the stocking of lake trout and the removal of invasive species, have helped to restore the population to healthy levels over the past few decades.\n\nAnother species that has been affected by overfishing and invasive species in Lake Huron is the whitefish. Whitefish populations have declined significantly in certain areas, and while they are still present in Lake Huron, they are smaller in size and number than in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, certain non-native species, such as the round goby and the alewife, have become very common in Lake Huron. While these species have negative impacts on the ecosystem, they have been thriving in Lake Huron and have become an important food source for some of the larger fish species, such as Chinook salmon and lake trout.\n\nOverall, the effects of overfishing, habitat destruction, and invasive species have had significant impacts on fish populations in Lake Huron. Conservation efforts, such as fishing regulations, stocking programs, and invasive species management, are essential to preserving the health and sustainability of the fish populations in the lake.",
