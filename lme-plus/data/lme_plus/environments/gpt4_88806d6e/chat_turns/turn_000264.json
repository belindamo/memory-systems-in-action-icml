  "content": "To find the current across the circuit, we can use Ohm's Law and the concept of total resistance in a series circuit.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total resistance of the circuit by adding the individual resistances:\n\nR\\_total = R1 + R2 + R3\nR\\_total = 3k\u03a9 + 10k\u03a9 + 5k\u03a9\nR\\_total = 18k\u03a9\n\nNext, we can use Ohm's Law to find the current flowing through the circuit:\n\nI = V / R\\_total\nI = 9V / 18k\u03a9\nI = 0.0005 A or 0.5 mA\n\nTherefore, the current flowing through the circuit is 0.5 mA.",
