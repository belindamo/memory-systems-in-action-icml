  "content": "The MOST cost-effective solution to configure the development environment would be to reconfigure the target group to have only one EC2 instance as a target. This would reduce the number of instances running in the development environment, which would reduce costs associated with running those instances. Additionally, having only one instance as a target in the development environment would also make it easier to test changes to the application before deploying to the production environment, as there would be less variability in the environment.",
