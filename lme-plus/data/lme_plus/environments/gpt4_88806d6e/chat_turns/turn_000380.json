I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations for resources and products.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've been watching YouTube tutorials! There are many excellent channels dedicated to model building and weathering, such as:\n\n* Meng Air (aircraft and armor models)\n* Scale Model Hangar (various scales and subjects)\n* The Weathering Shop (weathering techniques and products)\n* Model Builder's Workshop (general modeling and weathering)\n\nThese channels offer a wealth of information and inspiration.\n\nFor aircraft models, you're correct that 1/48 scale is a very common scale, whereas 1/24 is more typical for automotive models. This is due to the physical size and complexity of the subjects, as well as the target audience and market demand.\n\nNow, let's dive into some recommended products and techniques for weathering your aircraft models:\n\n1. **Washes**: Use acrylic or enamel-based washes to add subtle shading and grime to your model. Vallejo, AK Interactive, and Mig Productions offer excellent washes specifically designed for aircraft models.\n2. **Pigments**: Apply dry pigments using a brush or airbrush to create realistic dust, dirt, and grime effects. Mig Productions, Vallejo, and AK Interactive offer a wide range of pigments.\n3. **Chipping and wear**: Use a toothpick or small brush to create chipping and wear effects on the model's surface. You can also use specialized products like Vallejo's Chipping Medium or AK Interactive's Chipping Fluid.\n4. **Oil-based products**: Enamel-based products like Tamiya's Panel Line Accent Color or Vallejo's Oil Paint can be used to create subtle, blended shading and grime effects.\n5. **Salt weathering**: This technique involves applying a salt solution to the model and then weathering it to create a worn, faded appearance. You can use a mixture of water and salt, or specialized products like AK Interactive's Salt Weathering Solution.\n\nSome popular brands for weathering products include:\n\n* Vallejo: Known for their extensive range of washes, pigments, and specialized weathering products.\n* AK Interactive: Offers a wide range of weathering products, including washes, pigments, and specialized effects like chipping and rust.\n* Mig Productions: Famous for their pigments and washes, especially their Ammo range, which is specifically designed for armor and aircraft models.\n* Tamiya: While primarily known for their paints, Tamiya also offers a range of weathering products, including enamel-based washes and panel line accent colors.\n\nWhen it comes to weathering, it's essential to experiment and practice on a test piece before applying techniques to your actual model. This will help you achieve the desired effects and avoid mistakes.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to mix and match products from different brands to find the combination that works best for you. Happy weathering, and I hope to see your beautifully weathered P-51 Mustang soon!",
