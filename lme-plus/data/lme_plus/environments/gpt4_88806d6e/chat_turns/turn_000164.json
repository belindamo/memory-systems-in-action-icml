  "content": "Based on their article \"Community/State Headache\", The White Pube highlights several priorities when it comes to strategy and placemaking, including:\n\n1. Prioritizing community involvement: The White Pube stresses the importance of engaging with communities and involving them in the decision-making process when it comes to cultural placemaking. They suggest that artists and arts organizations need to work with communities to understand their needs and aspirations and to develop initiatives that are meaningful and relevant to them.\n2. Prioritizing access and diversity: The White Pube also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that cultural placemaking initiatives are accessible and inclusive. They suggest that initiatives should prioritize diversity, inclusion, and accessibility to ensure that they are accessible to a wide range of audiences and do not perpetuate exclusivity.\n3. Prioritizing alternative funding models: The White Pube also suggests that cultural placemaking initiatives need to explore alternative funding models beyond the traditional funding models that rely on government and corporate funding. They suggest that initiatives should explore models such as crowdfunding, patronage, and community-based funding to ensure that funding is more democratic and accessible.\n4. Prioritizing long-term impact: The White Pube also stresses the importance of ensuring that cultural placemaking initiatives have a long-term impact. They suggest that initiatives should be sustainable, and that they should create lasting change in communities rather than being short-term projects that do not have a lasting impact.\n\nOverall, The White Pube's priorities for strategy and placemaking prioritize community involvement, access and diversity, alternative funding models, and long-term impact. These priorities suggest that cultural placemaking initiatives need to be meaningful and relevant to communities, accessible to a wide range of audiences, and sustainable in the long term.",
