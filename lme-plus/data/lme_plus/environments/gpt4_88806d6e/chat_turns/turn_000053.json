Here's a breakdown of how to clean and maintain your CRUZ:\n\n**Cleaning the Fabric:**\n\n* **Washable Fabric:** The CRUZ's fabric is washable, but make sure to follow the care instructions on the label. You can machine wash the fabric in cold water with a mild detergent, and then air dry it.\n* **Spot Cleaning:** For tougher stains, you can use a gentle cleaning product like soap and water or a stain remover specifically designed for stroller fabric. Apply the product to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe it clean with a damp cloth.\n\n**Cleaning the Frame and Wheels:**\n\n* **Frame:** Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the frame, paying attention to any areas with visible dirt or grime.\n* **Wheels:** Use a soft-bristled brush or a cloth to remove any dirt or debris from the wheels. You can also use a mild soap and water solution to clean the wheels, but make sure to dry them thoroughly to prevent rust.\n\n**Regular Maintenance:**\n\n* **Check the Tires:** Regularly check the tire pressure and make sure it's at the recommended level. You can find the recommended pressure on the tire's sidewall or in the owner's manual.\n* **Lubricate the Wheels:** Apply a small amount of silicone-based lubricant to the wheels' axles to keep them running smoothly.\n* **Inspect the Harness:** Regularly inspect the harness for signs of wear and tear, such as fraying or broken straps. If you notice any damage, replace the harness immediately.\n* **Check the Brake:** Make sure the brake is functioning properly by testing it regularly. If the brake is stuck or not engaging properly, consult the owner's manual or contact UPPAbaby's customer service.\n\n**Deep Cleaning:**\n\n* **Every 3-6 Months:** Perform a deep clean of the stroller by disassembling the fabric and washing it according to the care instructions. Use a soft-bristled brush to clean the frame and wheels, and apply a mild soap and water solution to any areas with stubborn stains.\n\n**Tips and Tricks:**\n\n* **Use a Stroller Cleaner:** Consider investing in a stroller cleaner, which can help remove tough stains and odors from the fabric and frame.\n* **Dry the Stroller:** After cleaning the stroller, make sure to dry it thoroughly to prevent water spots and rust.\n* **Store the Stroller Properly:** When not in use, store the stroller in a dry, clean area to prevent damage and dirt buildup.\n\nBy following these tips, you can keep your UPPAbaby CRUZ looking and functioning like new for years to come.",
