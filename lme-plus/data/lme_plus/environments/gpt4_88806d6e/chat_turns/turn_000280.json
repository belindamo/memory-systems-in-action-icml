  "content": "There are several regulations in place to limit commercial fishing in Lake Huron and prevent overfishing. These include:\n\n1. Limits on the amount of fish that can be caught: The government sets annual catch limits for commercial fishermen, which they must adhere to while fishing in Lake Huron.\n\n2. Size limits: Commercial fishermen are not allowed to catch fish that are smaller than a certain size. This regulation helps prevent the overharvesting of young fish, which is necessary for maintaining healthy fish populations.\n\n3. Seasonal closures: There are certain times of the year when commercial fishing is not allowed in Lake Huron. These seasonal closures help protect fish populations during vulnerable periods such as spawning season.\n\n4. Gear restrictions: Commercial fishermen are required to use specific fishing gear that minimizes the impact on the ecosystem and helps prevent unintended catches of other species.\n\n5. Licensing and monitoring: Commercial fishermen must have a license to fish in Lake Huron, and their activities are monitored by government officials. This helps ensure that they are following regulations and not exceeding their catch limits.\n\nAll of these regulations work together to ensure that commercial fishing does not cause harm to the ecosystem in Lake Huron and that fish populations remain healthy and sustainable for future generations.",
