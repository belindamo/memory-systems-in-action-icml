  "content": "Incorporating flowers into your garden to repel pests is a fantastic approach to natural pest control. Here are some flowers that can help deter pests from your tomato plants:\n\n**Marigold**: As I mentioned earlier, marigold repels nematodes, which can harm tomatoes, and also attracts beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings.\n\n**Nasturtium**: These brightly colored flowers repel aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that target tomatoes. They also attract beneficial insects like lacewings and hoverflies.\n\n**Calendula**: Calendula repels pests like aphids, beetles, and nematodes, and attracts beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings.\n\n**Borage**: In addition to its benefits for tomatoes, borage repels pests like the tomato hornworm and attracts beneficial insects like bees.\n\n**Chrysanthemum**: Chrysanthemum repels nematodes, aphids, and other pests that target tomatoes.\n\n**Sunflowers**: While sunflowers are often thought of as a tall, statuesque flower, they also repel aphids and attract beneficial insects like ladybugs.\n\n**Dahlias**: Dahlias repel nematodes and other pests that target tomatoes, and add a pop of color to your garden.\n\n**Bee Balm**: Bee balm repels pests like the tomato hornworm and attracts beneficial insects like bees and butterflies.\n\n**Tips for Using Flowers for Pest Control:**\n\n* Plant flowers around the perimeter of your tomato bed or intersperse them among your tomato plants.\n* Choose a mix of annuals and perennials to ensure a constant supply of beneficial insects and pest-repelling properties.\n* Plant flowers that bloom at different times to provide a constant source of nectar and pollen for beneficial insects.\n* Consider planting a \"trap crop\" like nasturtium or calendula near your tomato plants to lure pests away from your tomatoes.\n* Remember, while flowers can be an effective way to repel pests, they shouldn't replace good gardening practices like crop rotation, sanitation, and monitoring for pests.\n\nBy incorporating these flowers into your garden, you'll be creating a more balanced ecosystem that encourages beneficial insects and deters pests. Happy planting!",
