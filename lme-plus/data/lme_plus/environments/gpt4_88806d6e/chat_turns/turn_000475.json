  "content": "I think I'll start by exploring TensorFlow and PyTorch, as they seem to be the most popular and widely used frameworks in the deep learning community. I've heard that PyTorch is more flexible and easier to use, but TensorFlow has better support for large-scale models. I'll probably start with PyTorch and see how it goes. I've also used OpenCV before, so I might use that for image preprocessing and data augmentation. Do you think I should focus on learning one framework thoroughly or try to learn multiple frameworks simultaneously?",
