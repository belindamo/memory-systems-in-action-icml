  "content": "The solution that will deploy the function in the most operationally efficient way for a new microservice that clients can call through an HTTPS endpoint and must use IAM authentication is:\n\nA. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure the method to use the Lambda function. Enable IAM authentication on the API.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOption A is the best solution because it is a fully managed service that is specifically designed for building and deploying APIs that can be used by clients. It also supports integrating with Lambda functions, which can be written in Go 1.x. With Amazon API Gateway, it is possible to configure the REST API method to use the Lambda function as the backend, and enable IAM authentication on the API, which ensures that only authorized clients can call the API. This option is also scalable, as it can handle high volumes of traffic without the need for managing and scaling infrastructure.\n\nOption B, creating a Lambda function URL for the function and specifying AWS\\_IAM as the authentication type, is not the best option because it does not provide a scalable or secure way to authenticate and authorize clients. This option requires clients to include an IAM user's access key and secret access key in the request, which is not recommended for security reasons.\n\nOption C, creating an Amazon CloudFront distribution and deploying the function to Lambda@Edge, is not the best option because it is more complex and expensive than using Amazon API Gateway. Additionally, integrating IAM authentication logic into the Lambda@Edge function can introduce additional complexity and security risks.\n\nOption D, creating an Amazon CloudFront distribution and deploying the function to CloudFront Functions, is not the best option because CloudFront Functions is currently in preview and does not support IAM authentication. Additionally, it is not designed for deploying and managing APIs, and may not be suitable for this use case.",
