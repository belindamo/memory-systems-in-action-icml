  "content": "It depends on your specific needs and how you want to use the databases.\n\nIf your main focus is to keep track of the items that you want to purchase and make purchasing decisions based on that information, then the \"Product Wishlist\" database should be the main database. You can use this database to keep track of the items that you want to purchase, their prices, and where they are sold.\n\nIf your main focus is to keep track of all the items that you own, including the items that you want to purchase and the items that you already own, then the \"Inventory\" database should be the main database. You can use this database to keep track of all the items that you own, including their expiration dates, maintenance requirements, location, quantity, and serial number.\n\nYou can also use both databases together and link them, so you can easily see the difference between the items that you want to purchase and the items that you already own.\n\nIt is also possible to use a single database and use the \"In Stock\" column to indicate whether the item is already owned or not, and use the above columns to track all the information.\n\nUltimately, the choice of which database to use as the main one is yours and you should choose the one that best fits your needs.",
