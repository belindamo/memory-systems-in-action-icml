Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n**Ratio:** The general starting point is to mix 1 part Chipping Medium to 1-2 parts Model Color paint. You can adjust this ratio to achieve the desired effect. A higher ratio of Chipping Medium will produce more pronounced chipping, while a lower ratio will result in more subtle effects.\n\n**Mixing:**\n\n1. Start by mixing a small amount of Chipping Medium with your Model Color paint on a palette or mixing surface. You can use a toothpick or a small brush to mix the two.\n2. Begin with a 1:1 ratio and mix well. If you're looking for a more subtle effect, you can add a tiny bit more paint to the mix. For a more pronounced effect, add a bit more Chipping Medium.\n3. Mix the two components thoroughly until they're fully incorporated. You should get a smooth, consistent mixture.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to mix the Chipping Medium with the paint on a surface that won't react with the Chipping Medium, such as a plastic palette or a ceramic tile. Avoid mixing on a paper palette, as the Chipping Medium might react with the paper.\n* When mixing, use a gentle, sweeping motion to combine the two components. Avoid over-mixing, as this can create air bubbles or affect the performance of the Chipping Medium.\n* If you're unsure about the ratio or the effect, start with a small test area on your model or a piece of scrap plastic. This will help you gauge the outcome before applying it to the entire model.\n* Keep in mind that the Chipping Medium will affect the consistency and flow of the paint. The mixture might be slightly thinner than the original paint, so adjust your brushstrokes and application accordingly.\n* Experiment with different ratios and techniques to achieve the desired level of chipping and wear on your model.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to achieve some amazing, subtle chipping effects on your F-16 model using Vallejo's Chipping Medium and Model Color paints.
