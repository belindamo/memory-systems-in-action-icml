  "content": "Sure, you can have a separate table for \"Mall\" and change the name to something more general, such as \"Marketplaces\". This table can include the name of the marketplace, whether it's an online or offline marketplace, and any other relevant information.\n\nTo denote whether a marketplace is online or offline, you can add a new column in the \"Marketplaces\" table called \"Type\" with a dropdown to select either \"Online\" or \"Offline\".\n\nYou can also add a new column in the \"Vendors\" table called \"Marketplace\" to indicate the marketplace(s) where the vendor sells their products, which can be linked to the \"Marketplaces\" table. This way, you can see all the vendors associated with a specific marketplace and filter vendors by online or offline marketplaces.\n\nTo differentiate between a mall that is a single vendor and a mall that has multiple vendors, you can add a new column in the \"Marketplaces\" table called \"Vendor Type\" with a dropdown to select either \"Single Vendor\" or \"Multiple Vendors\".\n\nHere is an updated version of the ERD:\n```\nProduct Wishlist\n+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+\n| Product Name   |-------| Price History   |       | Vendors        |\n+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+\n| Product Category|       | Product Name   |       | Vendor Name    |\n+----------------+       | Vendor         |-------| Contact Info   |\n| Product Description|    | Price          |       | Address        |\n+----------------+       | Date           |       | Marketplace    |\n| Product Image  |       | Promo          |-------|\n+----------------+       +----------------+\n| Current Price  |               \n+----------------+               \n| Normal Price   |               \n+----------------+               \n| Product URL    |               \n+----------------+               \n| Product Vendor |-------|\n+----------------+\n| Priority Level |\n+----------------+\n| Deadline       |\n+----------------+\n| Notes          |\n+----------------+\n\nMarketplaces\n+----------------+\n| Marketplace    | (multi-select)\n+----------------+\n| Type           | (dropdown: Online or Offline)\n+----------------+\n| Vendor Type    | (dropdown: Single Vendor or Multiple Vendors)\n+----------------+\n```\nBy keeping track of the vendors and marketplaces they're associated with, you can quickly identify which vendors are the best option to buy multiple items from, based on their location, the type of marketplace they're in, and the type of vendor they are. This way you can save on shipping costs and make better purchasing decisions.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if there's something else I can help you with.",
