  "content": "Option C is the correct answer.\n\nThe issue is that the EC2 instances are in private subnets and there is no route for internet traffic to reach them. The solution is to update the route tables for the private subnets to send internet traffic through the NAT gateway. This will allow internet traffic to reach the EC2 instances while still keeping them in private subnets for security reasons.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests replacing the ALB with a Network Load Balancer, which does not address the issue of private subnets and internet traffic.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests moving the EC2 instances to public subnets, which may not be desirable for security reasons.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests creating public subnets for the ALB, which again may not be desirable for security reasons. Additionally, there is no need to update the route tables for the public subnets with a route to the private subnets since the private subnets will already have a route to the public subnets via the NAT gateway.",
