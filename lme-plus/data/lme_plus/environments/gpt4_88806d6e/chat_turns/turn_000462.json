The controversy arose after the United States had what appeared to be a victory over the Soviet Union in the gold medal game. However, the final three seconds of the game were controversial, with multiple clock resets and Soviet timeouts. In the final seconds, the Soviets scored a basket to win the game by a margin of 51-50. The US team protested the result, but their protest was denied, and the Soviets were awarded the gold medal.\n\nThe controversy sparked outrage in the United States, and many people questioned the fairness of the Olympic officials in charge of the game. It also led to a boycott by some US athletes of the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal.\n\nOther controversies in Olympic history include the Black Power salute by African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos during the medal ceremony of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. The athletes raised their fists in a gesture of protest against racial inequality in the United States. The gesture was controversial, and Smith and Carlos were expelled from the Olympic Village.\n\nIn the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Jesse Owens, an African-American athlete, won four gold medals in track and field events, despite competing in a racially charged atmosphere created by Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime. Owens' victories were seen as a protest against Nazi racial ideology and a symbol of African-American perseverance in the face of racism and discrimination.\n\nOverall, the controversy surrounding the US men's basketball team at the 1972 Olympics ranks among the most controversial in Olympic history, but there have been numerous other controversies and protests in Olympic history.",
