The Dream Team was a world-class collection of athletes who dominated the competition, capturing the attention and admiration of fans around the world.\n\nAnother historic Olympic moment was at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, where Jesse Owens won four gold medals and shattered Adolf Hitler's belief that Aryan athletes were the superior race. Owens' victories were seen as a triumph for African-Americans and a blow to Nazi racism.\n\nThe 1972 Olympic Games in Munich are remembered for the controversial final seconds of the US men's basketball team's gold medal game against the Soviet Union. The controversial ending of the game led to a prolonged dispute over the final result, and the refusal of the US team to accept the outcome remains one of the most talked-about controversies in Olympic history.\n\nThe 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City were marked by Tommie Smith and John Carlos' Black Power salute during the medal ceremony of the 200m race. Their protest against racial inequality led to their expulsion from the Olympic Village, but they remain an iconic symbol of resistance to oppression, and a reminder of the potential for athletes to take a stand on political and social issues.\n\nOverall, the Olympics have been a stage for many iconic and impactful moments in sports and cultural history, and every Olympic Games produces new stories, controversies, and triumphs that inspire and move people around the world.",
