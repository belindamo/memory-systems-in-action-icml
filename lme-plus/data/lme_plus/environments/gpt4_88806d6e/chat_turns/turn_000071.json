Army: The Army ADC training covers a standard set of protocol rules and regulations, such as how to address military personnel of different rank, how to escort a VIP to an event, and how to handle the flag. In addition, they may receive training specific to the unique situation of their commanding officer, such as knowing their personal preference for greeting styles.\n\n2. Marine Corps: Marine Corps ADC training on protocol emphasizes the importance of military customs and courtesies. They receive training in military protocol, such as how to properly display and handle the US flag, how to conduct a military ceremony, and how to interact with foreign dignitaries.\n\n3. Navy: Navy ADCs are trained in diplomatic protocols and may receive specific training on foreign cultures and customs. They are also trained in the proper decorum for formal events, such as how to address high-ranking officials and how to execute a flag ceremony.\n\n4. Air Force: Air Force ADC training emphasizes the importance of protocol in international contexts. They receive instruction on diplomatic customs, the rules of military etiquette, and how to properly present and display the US flag.\n\nOverall, while the basic protocol training may be similar between branches, there may be differences in the specific protocols emphasized and the cultural contexts in which the training is conducted.",
