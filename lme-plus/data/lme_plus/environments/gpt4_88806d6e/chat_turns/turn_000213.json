  "content": "It sounds like you want to expand the \"Product Wishlist\" database to include all of the items that you own, not just the items that you want to purchase. One way to do this would be to create a separate database called \"Inventory\" or \"Home Inventory\" and link it to the \"Product Wishlist\" database.\n\nYou can use the existing columns in the \"Product Wishlist\" database, such as \"Product Name\", \"Product Description\", \"Product Image\", and \"Product URL\", to catalog all the items that you own. Additionally, you can add new columns to the \"Inventory\" database to track information specific to the items that you own, such as:\n\n* \"Expiration Date\": for items that have a limited lifespan, such as food or skincare products\n* \"Maintenance\": for items that require regular maintenance, such as appliances or vehicles\n* \"Location\": for items that are stored in different parts of your house, such as pouches or shelves\n* \"Quantity\": for items that you have multiple of, such as books or dishes\n* \"Serial Number\" (if applicable)\n\nYou can also create a new table \"Category\" to categorize your items by their type, such as Electronics, Clothing, Furniture, etc.\n\nThe \"Inventory\" database can be linked to the \"Product Wishlist\" database to show the difference between the items that you own and the items that you want to purchase. This way, you can easily see which items need to be restocked or replaced and which items you no longer need.\n\nHere is an example of an ERD for your case:\n```\nInventory\n+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+\n| Product Name   |-------| Product Wishlist|       |Category        |\n+----------------+       +\n```",
