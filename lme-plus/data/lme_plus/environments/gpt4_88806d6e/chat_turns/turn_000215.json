This way, you can see the difference between the items that you own and the items that you want to purchase.\n\nYou can also use the \"Category\" table to group the items by their type, such as Electronics, Clothing, Furniture, etc. This can help you to quickly find and organize the items that you own.\n\nBy keeping track of all the items that you own, you can also see which items need to be restocked or replaced, and which items you no longer need. Additionally, you can also track information specific to the items, such as their expiration date, maintenance requirements, location, quantity, and serial number.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or if there's something else I can help you with.",
