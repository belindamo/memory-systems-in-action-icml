  "content": "Unfortunately, without the exact name of the town, it's a bit challenging to provide specific restaurant recommendations. However, I can offer a few suggestions to help you narrow down your search:\n\n1. **Ask Mark and Sarah**: Reach out to your friends and ask them about their hometown's name. They can also give you some personalized recommendations for great seafood restaurants in their area.\n2. **Check your beach trip conversations**: Go through your phone or social media conversations from your beach trip and see if you mentioned the town's name or any other details that might help you identify it.\n3. **Use online directories**: You can try searching online directories like Yelp or TripAdvisor for seafood restaurants in towns near the mountains in the state or region where you met Mark and Sarah. This might give you a list of possibilities to work with.\n\nOnce you have the town's name, you can use online review sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Maps to find highly-rated seafood restaurants in the area.\n\nIf you're still unable to find the exact town, you could also ask Mark and Sarah about the general region they live in (e.g., a specific state, mountain range, or proximity to a major city). This might help you narrow down your search.",
