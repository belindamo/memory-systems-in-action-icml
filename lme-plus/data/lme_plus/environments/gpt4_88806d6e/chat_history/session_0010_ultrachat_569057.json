Addiction is a complex and challenging issue, and it's not uncommon for it to take time and multiple attempts to address it successfully. Don't lose hope and know that your support is important, even if it doesn't seem like it's making a difference right now. It's important to remember that addiction is not a personal failure and that setbacks can happen on the road to recovery. Encourage your loved one to continue seeking help and treatment and let them know that you are there for them. Consider joining a support group for families and loved ones of people with addiction to connect with others who understand what you are going through."

Ultimately, the decision to address and overcome addiction is up to the individual struggling with it. However, there are still things you can do to support your loved one. Here are some additional suggestions:\n\n1. Be consistent and dependable: Show your loved one that you are there for them, even when they are struggling.\n\n2. Celebrate successes: Celebrate any small victories on the path to recovery, such as attending a support group meeting or staying sober for a day.\n\n3. Practice tough love: Sometimes, tough love is necessary to encourage your loved one to seek help or to stick with their treatment plan.\n\n4. Offer practical support: Offer to help with specific tasks such as finding a treatment program, offering rides to appointments, or helping with household chores.\n\n5. Don't enable addiction: Be mindful of your actions and avoid enabling your loved one's addiction. This might mean not giving them money or declining to participate in activities that could trigger their addiction.\n\nRemember that addiction recovery is a long journey, and setbacks can happen. The important thing is to stay supportive and continue encouraging your loved one to seek help and treatment."
