I'd be happy to share a simple and delicious recipe to get you started.\n\n**Simple Naan Bread Recipe:**\n\nThis recipe uses a yeast-based dough, which will give your naan a light, airy texture and a slightly tangy flavor.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast\n* 1/2 cup lukewarm water\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1/4 cup yogurt (optional, but recommended for a more tender crumb)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, sugar, and yeast.\n2. Gradually add lukewarm water to the dry ingredients and mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. Add olive oil and mix until the dough comes together in a sticky ball.\n4. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n6. Preheat a non-stick skillet or tava over medium heat.\n7. Divide the dough into 6-8 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball.\n8. Roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter.\n9. Place a naan in the preheated skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes, until it starts to puff and the edges start to curl.\n10.
