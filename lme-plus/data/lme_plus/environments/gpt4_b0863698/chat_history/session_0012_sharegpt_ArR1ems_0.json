      "content": "In economics, markets can be broadly classified into the following types:\n\n1. Perfect competition: In a perfectly competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers, and no individual buyer or seller has the power to influence the market price. Products sold in this market are homogeneous, and there are no barriers to entry or exit.\n2. Monopoly: A monopoly market is characterized by a single seller who has complete control over the market. There are no close substitutes for the product, and entry into the market is difficult. The monopolist sets the price and quantity of the product sold.\n3. Monopolistic competition: In a monopolistically competitive market, there are many firms producing differentiated products. Each firm has some degree of market power, but there are no significant barriers to entry or exit.\n4. Oligopoly: An oligopoly market is dominated by a few large firms, and each firm has a significant degree of market power. The actions of one firm can have a significant impact on the prices and profits of other firms in the market.\n5. Duopoly: A duopoly market is a special case of an oligopoly, where there are only two firms competing in the market.\n6. Monopsony: In a monopsony market, there is only one buyer of a particular product or service. This gives the buyer significant market power, and they can influence the price and quantity of the product.\n7. Oligopsony: An oligopsony market is a special case of monopsony, where there are only a few buyers in the market.\n8. Bilateral monopoly: In a bilateral monopoly market, there is only one seller and one buyer of a particular product or service. Both the buyer and the seller have significant market power, and the price and quantity of the product are determined through negotiation.\n\nIt's worth noting that these types of markets are idealized models and actual markets may exhibit characteristics of multiple market structures."
