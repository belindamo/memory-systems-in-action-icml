  "content": "These tips are really helpful, thank you! I think the most important one for me is to start small and be consistent. I've tried to meditate before, but I always feel like I need to do it for at least 30 minutes, and if I can't do that, then I don't do it at all. But starting with just 5-10 minutes a day feels much more manageable. And I like the idea of tracking my progress and rewarding myself for milestones. That will definitely help me stay motivated.\n\nI also like the idea of focusing on the process, not perfection. I think that's where I go wrong sometimes - I get too caught up in trying to do it \"right\" and then I get discouraged when my mind starts wandering. But if I can just focus on showing up and being present, that feels much more achievable.\n\nOne thing I'm still wondering about is how to incorporate mindfulness into my daily activities, like eating or walking. Do you have any tips",
