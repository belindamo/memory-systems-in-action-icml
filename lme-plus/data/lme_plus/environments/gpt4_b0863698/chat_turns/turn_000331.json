  "content": "I think the seasoning is quite spicy, so it might be one of the first two options you mentioned, sriracha sauce or Korean chili flakes. It's definitely a sauce, not a powder. The flavor profile is spicy and savory, but I'm not sure about the other components. It's a pretty intense flavor, so I'm guessing it's not a mild seasoning. Do you think I could try mixing sriracha sauce with some other ingredients to get closer to the flavor?",
