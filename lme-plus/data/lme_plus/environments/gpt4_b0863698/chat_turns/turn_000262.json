  "content": "I am not sure about the outdoor seating options for \"Imam Reza Restaurant\", but \"Kale Pache Sabzeh\" does have outdoor seating options available. The restaurant is located in a beautiful area surrounded by nature, so you can enjoy the scenic beauty while you try their local vegetarian dishes. They also have indoor seating options available if you prefer. Just keep in mind that during the winter months, some restaurants may not have outdoor seating due to the cold weather.",
