It's great that you're taking steps to make healthier choices. Here are some ideas for healthy snacks that are easy to prepare, pack, and take to work:\n\n1. **Fresh Fruits**: Apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, or any other seasonal fruits are a great option. You can also cut them up and store them in containers for a quick grab-and-go.\n2. **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or sunflower seeds are nutritious and filling snacks. Look for unsalted or low-sodium options.\n3. **Veggie Sticks with Hummus**: Carrot, celery, and cucumber sticks with a side of hummus make for a healthy and satisfying snack.\n4. **Protein-Rich Snack Balls**: Mix rolled oats, nuts, seeds, and dried fruits to create bite-sized energy balls that are high in protein and fiber.\n5. **Yogurt Parfait**: Layer Greek yogurt with fresh berries, granola, and a sprinkle of honey for a protein-packed snack.\n6. **Hard-Boiled Eggs**: Boil a dozen eggs on the weekend and keep them in the fridge for a quick protein-rich snack.\n7. **Trail Mix**: Create your own trail mix with nuts, seeds, and dried fruits to avoid added sugars and preservatives found in store-bought options.\n8. **Cut Veggies with Guacamole**: Cut up carrots, cucumbers, and bell peppers and serve them with a side of guacamole for a healthy and filling snack.\n9. **Whole Grain Crackers with Avocado or Peanut Butter**: Spread whole grain crackers with mashed avocado or peanut butter for a healthy dose of healthy fats and protein.\n10. **Edamame**: Steam or cook edamame and season with sea salt for a high-protein snack that's easy to pack.\n11. **Cottage Cheese**: Individual cups of cottage cheese are a great source of protein and can be paired with fruit or veggies for added nutrition.\n12. **Homemade Granola Bars**: Make your own granola bars with rolled oats, nuts, and seeds to avoid added sugars and preservatives.\n\nRemember, portion control is key when it comes to snacking. Aim for snacks that are around 100-200 calories per serving to keep you full and focused throughout the day.\n\nDo you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, dairy-free) that I can take into account for future snack suggestions?",
