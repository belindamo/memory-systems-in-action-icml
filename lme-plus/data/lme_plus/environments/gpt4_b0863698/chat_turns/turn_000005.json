It's great that you're taking proactive steps to break out of your shell and connect with your neighbors.\n\nHosting a game night is a fantastic way to do just that. Not only will it help you get to know your neighbors, but it'll also give you a chance to make your new space feel more like home. It's amazing how having people over can make a place feel more welcoming and lived-in.\n\nSince you're still getting used to the quiet, you might find that having some friendly chatter and laughter in your apartment will help make it feel more lively and comfortable. Plus, having a social event will give you something to look forward to, which can help with the adjustment period.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take time to settle into a new space and find your rhythm. It's normal to feel a bit uncomfortable or cooped up when you're still getting used to a new environment. But by taking small steps like hosting a game night, you're taking control of your situation and creating opportunities to build connections and make memories in your new home.\n\nDon't be too hard on yourself if things don't go exactly as planned, either. The goal is to have fun and be yourself, not to create a perfect event. Your neighbors will likely appreciate the effort you're putting into getting to know them, and they might even be feeling similarly about getting to know you.\n\nSo, take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy the experience. Your game night is a great step towards making your new space feel more like home, and who knows, you might just discover some new friendships along the way!",
