  "content": "John, unfortunately, assaulted his roommate at the halfway house where he was living and the halfway house called the police. I had to go chat with them. Thankfully the roommate didn't press charges, but John got kicked out of the halfway house for violating their policies. He's currently in the shelter on Oak street. I'm working to see if I can find an emergency housing organization for him to work with. John's mother also died last week, so he's been in a bad mental state -- I'm concerned that he's going to relapse so I'm trying to get him into a stable housing situation as soon as I can.",
