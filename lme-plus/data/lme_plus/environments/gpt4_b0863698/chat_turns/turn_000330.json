  "content": "I'm happy to help you crack the code on the spicy seasoning used by Sushi Haven. Since you're familiar with the flavor, let's try to narrow down the possibilities. Here are a few questions to help us get started:\n\n1. **Level of heat**: How spicy is the seasoning? Is it mildly warm, medium-hot, or extremely spicy?\n2. **Flavor profile**: Does the seasoning have a sweet, savory, smoky, or umami flavor component?\n3. **Texture**: Is the seasoning a paste, a sauce, or a powder?\n4. **Color**: Is the seasoning red, orange, yellow, or clear?\n\nBased on your description, I'm going to take a few educated guesses:\n\n* **Sriracha sauce**: A popular spicy sauce made from chili peppers, vinegar, garlic, and sugar. It's a common ingredient in many spicy sushi rolls.\n* **Korean chili flakes (Gochugaru)**: A spicy, smoky, and slightly sweet powder made from dried and crushed Korean chili peppers. It adds a intense heat and flavor to dishes.\n* **Spicy mayo**: A combination of mayonnaise and hot sauce, such as sriracha or hot sauce, which adds a creamy and spicy kick.\n* **Furikake**: A Japanese seasoning blend that often includes spices, seaweed, and chili peppers. It can add a savory, slightly spicy flavor to sushi rolls.\n* **Togarashi**: A Japanese chili powder blend that typically includes chili peppers, orange peel, and other spices. It adds a warm, slightly sweet, and smoky flavor.\n\nIf none of these options sound familiar, please provide more details about the flavor and texture of the spicy seasoning used by Sushi Haven. You can also try contacting the restaurant directly and asking about their secret ingredient (they might be willing to share or give you a hint).\n\nOnce we narrow down the possibilities, I can help you create a homemade version of the spicy seasoning to use in your sushi roll recipe.",
