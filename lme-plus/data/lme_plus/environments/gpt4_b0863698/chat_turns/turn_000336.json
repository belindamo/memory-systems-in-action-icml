Here are some tips to help you assemble a delicious and visually appealing spicy tuna roll:\n\n**Tips for Assembling the Spicy Tuna Roll:**\n\n1. **Prepare your ingredients**: Make sure you have all the necessary ingredients ready, including the sushi rice, spicy tuna mix (see below), nori (seaweed sheets), and any other desired fillings (e.g., cucumber, avocado).\n2. **Spicy tuna mix**: Mix the sriracha-mayonnaise sauce (or your modified version) with the canned tuna (drained and flaked) in a small bowl. Adjust the amount of sauce to your taste, but make sure it's not too runny.\n3. **Lay out your nori**: Place a nori sheet flat on a sushi mat or a piece of parchment paper. If using a sushi mat, make sure it's covered with plastic wrap to prevent the rice from sticking.\n4. **Spread the sushi rice**: Spread a thin, even layer of sushi rice onto the nori, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top. Use your fingers or a spatula to shape the rice into a rectangular shape.\n5. **Add the spicy tuna mix**: Place the spicy tuna mix in the middle of the rice, leaving a small border around it. You can use a small amount or a generous amount, depending on your preference.\n6. **Add other fillings (optional)**: If desired, add sliced cucumber, avocado, or other fillings on top of the spicy tuna mix.\n7. **Roll the sushi**: Using your sushi mat or parchment paper, roll the nori and fillings into a compact cylinder. Apply gentle pressure to form a tight roll.\n8. **Slice the roll**: Once the roll is formed, slice it into 8 equal pieces using a sharp knife. Cut in a gentle sawing motion to avoid applying too much pressure, which can cause the fillings to ooze out.\n\n**Tips for a Professional-Looking Roll:**\n\n* Use short-grain Japanese rice, which is stickier and better suited for sushi.\n* Handle the rice gently to avoid breaking the grains.\n* Make sure the nori is flat and even, as wrinkles can affect the roll's shape.\n* Use a bamboo sushi mat or parchment paper to help shape and roll the sushi.\n* Apply gentle pressure when rolling the sushi to avoid applying too much pressure.\n* Slice the roll when it's still slightly firm, as this will help it hold its shape better.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to create a delicious and visually appealing spicy tuna roll that rivals Sushi Haven's version!",
