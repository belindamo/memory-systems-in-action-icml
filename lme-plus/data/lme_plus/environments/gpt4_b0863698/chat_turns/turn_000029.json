  "content": "Classic spaghetti Bolognese is a great choice! You can't go wrong with a comforting, familiar dish like that.\n\nOut of the places I mentioned earlier, I think **Carmine's** would be an excellent choice for a traditional spaghetti Bolognese. They're a family-style Italian restaurant that serves up classic dishes, and their spaghetti Bolognese is a popular item on their menu. It's made with ground beef, tomato sauce, and served with a generous portion of spaghetti.\n\n**Porsena** might also have a variation of spaghetti Bolognese on their menu, although it might be a slightly more modern take on the classic dish. They're known for their house-made pastas, so their spaghetti would likely be freshly made in-house.\n\n**Brio Tuscan Grille** might have a Bolognese-style pasta dish on their menu, but it might be a bit more upscale and creative, with ingredients like prosciutto or mushrooms added to the sauce.\n\nThe other places I mentioned might not have a traditional spaghetti Bolognese on their menu, but they might have other pasta dishes that could scratch that comfort food itch.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a classic, no-frills spaghetti Bolognese, I'd recommend heading to **Carmine's**. They're a reliable choice for a satisfying, comforting meal.\n\nWould you like me to make a reservation for you at Carmine's or would you like to explore other options?",
