  "content": "I think joining a running group or club is a great idea. I've been meaning to explore more of the city on my runs, and getting route suggestions from experienced runners would be super helpful. I've also been enjoying the social aspect of playing volleyball and tennis with friends, so I think I'd really benefit from running with a group too. Do you know if any of these groups offer beginner-friendly routes or training programs for someone like me who's just getting back into running?",
