Alternate legs.\n3. **Calf Raises**: Strengthens calf muscles.\n\t* Stand on a step or platform, raise up onto balls of feet, and then lower back down.\n4. **Step-Ups**: Targets quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core muscles.\n\t* Stand in front of a step or bench, raise one foot up onto the step, and bring the other foot up to meet it.\n\t* Step back down to starting position. Alternate legs.\n\n**Core and Glutes:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Strengthens core muscles, including abs and obliques.\n\t* Start in a push-up position, with hands shoulder-width apart and body in a straight line from head to heels.\n\t* Hold for 30-60 seconds.\n2. **Glute Bridges**: Targets glute muscles.\n\t* Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the ground, then lift hips up towards ceiling.\n\t* Lower back down to starting position.\n3. **Side Plank**: Strengthens core muscles, including obliques.\n\t* Lie on your side with feet stacked, lift hips up off the ground, and balance on forearm and side of foot.\n\t* Hold for 30-60 seconds, then switch sides.\n\n**Upper Body:**\n\n1. **Push-Ups**: Strengthens chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n\t* Start in a plank position, lower body down until chest almost touches ground, then push back up to starting position.\n2. **Rows**: Targets back and shoulder muscles.\n\t* Hold a dumbbell or resistance band in each hand, bend knees slightly, and lean forward at the hips.\n\t* Let arms hang straight down, then lift elbows up and back, squeezing shoulder blades together.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* Start with lower weights and higher reps (12-15) to focus on endurance and muscle activation.\n* Gradually increase weight and lower reps (8-10) as you build strength.\n* Incorporate exercises 2-3 times a week, allowing for rest days in between.\n* Focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury.\n* Make sure to stretch after strength training to maintain flexibility and range of motion.\n\nRemember to consult with a healthcare professional or certified running coach to create a personalized strength training plan tailored to your specific needs and goals.",
