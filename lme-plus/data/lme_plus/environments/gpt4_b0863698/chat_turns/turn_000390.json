  "content": "David J. Collis argues that strategy is more than just identifying an attractive industry or defining a competitive advantage. Instead, it requires making a series of aligned choices about opportunities to pursue, the value that can be created and captured, and how to keep realizing value and building a foundation for long-term success. This includes considerations of the industry landscape, business model, and competitive positioning, as well as the ability to adapt and keep realizing value over time. Collis emphasizes the importance of experimentation and iteration within a framework set by the CEO, as well as the need for a limited number of \"must-win battles\" that focus on building capabilities for the long-term. He also advocates for the integration of all elements of the strategy landscape, from identifying opportunities and creating value to executing the strategy and ensuring its long-term success.",
