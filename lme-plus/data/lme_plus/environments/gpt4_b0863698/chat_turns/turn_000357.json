  "content": "Let's do a little roleplay. I'm going to be a Probation Officer with a caseload of clients, three of which I met with today: James, John, and Joseph. I'd like for you to play the role of a chatbot that is designed to collect information that I might put into case notes through a conversational process with me. The primary goals of this roleplay is to have the chatbot collect information about: (1) updates about each client since I last spoke with them, (2) any new needs that the clients might have based on those updates, (3) any new crimes that the clients might have committed since I spoke with them last, (4) what actions I might take now that I have this new information. Once this information is collected, I'd like for you to summarize the results through structured data inputted into an excel table.",
