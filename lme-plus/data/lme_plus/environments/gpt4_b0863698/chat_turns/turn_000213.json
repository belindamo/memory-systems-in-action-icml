The year before he won the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. He is the sixth horse to win two different Breeders' Cup races.\n\nHis other wins include the Breeders' Futurity as a two-year-old in 2018, after which he finished second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.\n\nAfter finishing second in the 2022 Pegasus World Cup, Knicks Go was retired to stud at Taylor Made Farm in Nicholasville, Kentucky with an initial stud fee of $30,000.\n\nBackground\nKnicks Go is a gray horse who was bred by Angie Moore and her daughter Sabrina at GreenMount Farm in Reisterstown, Maryland. He is from the second crop of Paynter, who won the Haskell Invitational, then received widespread social media attention during his battle against a near-fatal case of colitis and laminitis. Knicks Go was produced by Kosmo's Buddy, a stakes-winning daughter of Outflanker who was claimed by the Moores for $40,000 near the end of a 37-race career.[3]\n\nKnicks Go was sold as a weanling for $40,000 at the 2016 Keeneland November sale to Northface Bloodstock. He was resold as a yearling at the Keeneland September 2017 sale for $87,000 to the Korea Racing Authority. He was originally trained by Ben Colebrook and was transferred to the stable of Brad Cox at the end of 2019.\n\nThe colt was named for the K-nicks breeding system used by the Korea Racing Authority (KRA), with the \"K\" standing for Korea and nicks referring to the above average success of certain sires when bred to mares from certain other sire lines. \"If you can call him 'K-Nicks Go', that would be great\", said Jun Park, a racing manager of the KRA. \"But it really doesn't matter. Everybody knows him as 'Nicks Go'.\"\n\nWrite a Ad copy about New Tesla HEV GPT-X with Homage of Nicks Go's heroes Journey",
