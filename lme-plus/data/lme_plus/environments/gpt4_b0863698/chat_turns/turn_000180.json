College orientation can be a whirlwind experience, but it's an exciting time for students to get familiar with their new surroundings and start building connections with their peers.\n\nI'm sure Emma will appreciate having a familiar face on campus, and it's wonderful that you're taking an interest in her college life. Enjoy your visit and make the most of your time together!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask. Otherwise, have a fantastic trip to Ann Arbor, and I hope you create some wonderful memories with Emma!",
