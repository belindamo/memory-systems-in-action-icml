  "content": "This appears to be an email sent by Jawed Karim to Chad Hurley and Steve Chen discussing an idea for a video-based website. The sender mentions that the timing is good for the idea because video digital cameras are becoming more popular, and suggests that the site should be video-only to emphasize its unique aspect. The email also mentions several issues that will need to be addressed in order to make the site successful, including converting uploaded AVI files to Flash movies, bandwidth costs, and web server scalability. The sender suggests that the site should have matchmaking functionality built in from the beginning to make it immediately useful, and invites Chad and Steve to meet at Chad's house the following night to discuss the idea further.",
