I'd be happy to recommend some popular party games that are perfect for a large group and easy to learn. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Charades or Pictionary**: Classic games that are always a hit. Divide the group into two teams, and have them take turns acting out words or drawing pictures to guess.\n2. **Codenames**: A word-guessing game where players try to identify words based on one-word clues given by their teammate. Simple to learn, but lots of fun!\n3. **What Do You Meme**: A party game where players compete to create the funniest meme by combining caption cards with a random image.\n4. **Taboo**: A fast-paced word-describing game where players take turns explaining a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases.\n5. **Jenga**: A classic physical game that's easy to learn and plays well with a large group. Players take turns removing blocks from a tower, trying not to be the one who makes it fall.\n6. **Two Truths and a Lie**: A simple, conversational game where players take turns telling two true statements and one false statement about themselves. The others have to guess which one is the lie.\n7. **Scattergories**: A creative game where players have to come up with words that fit certain categories, all starting with the same letter.\n8. **Would You Rather**: A thought-provoking game where players are presented with difficult choices and have to decide which option they prefer.\n9. **Karaoke**: If you have a karaoke machine or access to one, this can be a hilarious way to get everyone laughing and having fun together.\n10. **Group Storytelling**: Have each player contribute to a group story, either orally or in writing, with each person adding a sentence or two to the story.\n\nThese games are all easy to learn, promote social interaction, and are suitable for a large group. You can always adjust the rules or gameplay to fit your group's preferences and energy level.\n\nTips for hosting a successful game night:\n\n* Keep the games short and sweet, with 15-30 minute play sessions.\n* Provide snacks and refreshments to keep everyone energized and comfortable.\n* Encourage everyone to participate, but don't force anyone to play if they're not interested.\n* Have a variety of games available to cater to different interests and preferences.\n* Designate a few volunteers to help explain the rules and facilitate gameplay.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you have a fantastic game night with your neighbors!",
