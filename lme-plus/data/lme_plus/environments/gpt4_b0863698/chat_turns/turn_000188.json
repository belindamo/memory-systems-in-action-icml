Pursuing an advanced degree can be a significant investment in your future, and it's wonderful that you're taking the first steps.\n\nRegarding Emma's graduation ceremony, I'm happy to chat with you about it, but I have to clarify again that I wasn't present at the ceremony on June 15th or any other event. I'm an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories. I exist solely to provide information and assist with inquiries.\n\nHowever, I'm sure Emma appreciated your presence and pride at her graduation ceremony. It's wonderful that you're a supportive and involved family member, and I'm sure she'll appreciate your guidance and encouragement as she navigates her college journey.\n\nFeel free to ask me any more questions about the application process or anything else. I'm here to help!",
