Speaking of cultural heritage, I've been thinking about my own roots and how they influence my daily life. My cousin recently shared our family tree with me, and I was surprised to learn that we have a significant amount of Irish blood in our family, which explains my pale skin and freckles. But what really caught my attention was discovering that my maternal great-grandmother was of Portuguese descent, which must be why I've always had a strong affinity for Brazilian music and my mom's cooking always has a hint of Mediterranean flavor. Do you have any recommendations for learning more about Portuguese culture and history?",
