  "content": "Joseph is doing great. Last time I checked up on him he had gotten a new job working at the front desk of a reentry organization in the valley called ReStart. He had been working with ReStart to find a job and they eventually just employed him themselves. He's now able to pay a greater portion of his rent, and will be in a good place when the subsidy runs out three months from now. He was having some challenges with his girlfriend, but it sounds like they have been working it out and that's less of a stressor for him - it's probably a good thing he's out of the house all day working.",
