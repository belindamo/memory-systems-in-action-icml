You should receive a confirmation email shortly.\n\nRegarding transportation from JFK to Midtown Manhattan, I'd recommend taking a ride-hail service like Uber or Lyft. It's generally more convenient and easier to navigate than hailing a yellow cab, especially if you're not familiar with the city. Plus, you can track your ride and get an estimate of the fare beforehand.\n\nIf you do decide to take a yellow cab, make sure to follow the signs to the taxi stands at JFK, and be prepared for a flat rate of $52 to Midtown Manhattan (plus tolls and tip). Just be aware that traffic can be unpredictable, and you might encounter some congestion.\n\nIf you're new to ride-hailing, don't worry! It's easy to use, and you can even get a ride estimate and reserve a car in advance. Just download the app, set your pickup location to JFK, and choose your destination in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nWhichever option you choose, make sure to plan ahead and leave some extra time for traffic. You want to make it to your dinner reservation on time!\n\nEnjoy your dinner at Carmine's, and let me know if you need any more assistance or recommendations during your stay in NYC!",
