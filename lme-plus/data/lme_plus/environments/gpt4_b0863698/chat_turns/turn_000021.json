  "content": "Since you're planning to visit Yosemite in late August, you can expect similar weather conditions to what you experienced last time, assuming it was also in the summer season.\n\nLate August is typically a warm and dry time in Yosemite, with average high temperatures ranging from 75\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F (24\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C) in the valley floor. However, it's not uncommon to experience temperature fluctuations, especially in the mornings and evenings.\n\nKeep in mind that Yosemite's weather can be unpredictable, and it's always a good idea to pack layers for your trip. You may want to bring:\n\n1. Lightweight, breathable clothing for warm days\n2. Insulating layers for cooler mornings and evenings\n3. Waterproof gear or a rain jacket (just in case!)\n4. Sun protection, such as hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen\n\nAdditionally, late August is still peak fire season in California, so be prepared for potential wildfires and air quality issues. Check the park's website and air quality forecasts before your trip to stay informed.\n\nOverall, while the weather can be unpredictable, late August is generally a great time to visit Yosemite, with warm weather and plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy!",
