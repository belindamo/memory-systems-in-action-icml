  "content": "There are many other factors that contribute to road accidents in India, including:\n\n1. Lack of enforcement of traffic laws: In many parts of India, traffic laws are not strictly enforced, which can lead to a culture of disregard for road safety rules.\n2. Poor lighting: Inadequate lighting on roads, particularly at night, can make it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians, other vehicles, and other hazards, increasing the risk of accidents.\n3. Overcrowding: India's roads are often congested, which can increase the risk of accidents due to the close proximity of vehicles to each other.\n4. Lack of driver training: Many drivers in India do not receive formal training or licensure, which can lead to a lack of knowledge about safe driving practices and traffic laws.\n5. Lack of seat belts and helmets use: Many drivers and passengers in India do not use seat belts or helmets, which can increase the risk of injury or death in the event of an accident.\n6. Animal-drawn vehicles: In many parts of India, animal-drawn vehicles such as carts and rickshaws are a common sight on the roads, and they can be involved in accidents with motorized vehicles.",
