That's a great way to combine your love for running and theme parks while also exploring their conservation efforts.\n\nWhile there might not be environmental organizations that exclusively focus on conservation efforts in theme parks or amusement parks, there are some organizations and initiatives that work with theme parks and amusement parks to promote sustainability and environmental stewardship. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA)**: IAAPA is a trade association that represents the global theme park and attractions industry. They have a sustainability committee that focuses on environmental sustainability, energy efficiency, and waste reduction in the industry.\n2. **The Green Theme Park Initiative**: This is a collaborative effort between theme parks, zoos, and aquariums to reduce their environmental footprint. They provide resources, guidance, and best practices for sustainability in the industry.\n3. **The Association for Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)**: While not exclusively focused on theme parks, AZA has a strong focus on conservation, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability. Many theme parks with zoos or aquariums are accredited by AZA and follow their standards for sustainability.\n4. **The Sustainable Tourism International (STI)**: STI is a nonprofit that promotes sustainable tourism practices, including in the theme park industry. They offer certifications and guidance for theme parks to reduce their environmental impact.\n5. **Local and national park conservation organizations**: Some theme parks, like Disney, have their own conservation organizations or foundations that focus on local conservation efforts, wildlife conservation, and environmental education.\n\nWhen you visit the theme park for your 5K run, you can ask park staff or volunteers about their sustainability initiatives, conservation efforts, or environmental programs. You might be surprised by the work they're doing behind the scenes to reduce their environmental footprint!\n\nRemember to also look for signs, exhibits, or interactive displays that showcase the park's conservation efforts. Many theme parks proudly highlight their sustainability initiatives and educational programs, so be sure to keep an eye out for those during your visit.",
