  "content": "What a great idea! Packing the small cross-body bag is a fantastic decision. It's perfect for carrying just the essentials when you're out and about, and it'll allow you to travel light while still having what you need.\n\nThe cross-body bag will come in handy when you're exploring the city with your sister or running errands. You can store your phone, wallet, keys, and any other small items you need quick access to, and keep your hands free. Plus, it's always nice to have a smaller bag to carry when you don't need to lug around your entire backpack.\n\nSince you mentioned you got the bag from a thrift store, I'm sure it's got a unique charm to it. It's great that you're giving new life to a previously loved item, and it'll add a fun touch to your outfit.\n\nNow that you've got your packing list and your trusty cross-body bag, you're all set for a fantastic weekend adventure with your sister! Don't forget to take plenty of photos and make some amazing memories together.\n\nSafe travels, and have a blast!",
