That's great!\n\nVisiting both the 360 Chicago Observation Deck and the Willis Tower Skydeck is definitely doable, but it ultimately depends on your personal preferences, interests, and time constraints. Here's a brief comparison to help you decide:\n\n**Similarities:**\n\n* Both offer stunning views of the Chicago skyline and Lake Michigan.\n* Both have observation decks with floor-to-ceiling windows and outdoor areas.\n* Both provide a unique perspective on the city's architecture and layout.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n* **Height:** Willis Tower Skydeck is on the 103rd floor (1,353 ft / 412 m), while 360 Chicago is on the 94th floor (1,030 ft / 314 m). If you want to experience the highest viewpoint in Chicago, Willis Tower is the way to go.\n* **View:** While both offer panoramic views, Willis Tower's Skydeck provides a slightly more expansive view of the city, thanks to its higher elevation. 360 Chicago, on the other hand, offers a more intimate view of the city's North Side and Lake Michigan.\n* **Atmosphere:** Willis Tower Skydeck is often more crowded and noisy, while 360 Chicago tends to be less crowded and has a more relaxed atmosphere.\n* **Exhibits and Features:** Willis Tower Skydeck has a more extensive exhibit area, including interactive displays and a glass balcony that extends 4.3 feet outside the building (if you're feeling brave!). 360 Chicago has a smaller exhibit area, but offers the TILT experience, which I mentioned earlier.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nIf you have the time and budget, visiting both observation decks can be a great way to experience different perspectives on the city. However, if you need to choose one, consider the following:\n\n* If you want the highest viewpoint and a more extensive exhibit area, choose Willis Tower Skydeck.\n* If you prefer a more relaxed atmosphere and a unique TILT experience, choose 360 Chicago.\n\nKeep in mind that both observation decks are popular attractions, so plan your visits accordingly to avoid long lines and crowds.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision! Enjoy your trip to Chicago!",
