      "content": "I've checked the ticket availability for the Panic! At The Disco show on September 18th at the Wells Fargo Center, and here's what I found:\n\n**Floor Seats:**\n\n* According to Ticketmaster, there are some floor seats available for the show, but they're limited and scattered throughout the floor section. You can find single seats or pairs of seats in rows 10-20, mostly on the sides or behind the soundboard. Prices range from around $150 to $300 per ticket.\n* On the secondary market, websites like StubHub, Vivid Seats, and SeatGeek have a wider selection of floor seats available, including some closer to the stage. Prices vary widely depending on the row and proximity to the stage, but expect to pay between $200 to $600 per ticket.\n\n**Pit Tickets:**\n\n* Unfortunately, it looks like the pit tickets for this show are sold out on Ticketmaster.\n* On the secondary market, I found a few pit tickets available on StubHub and Vivid Seats, but they're extremely limited and expensive. Prices range from around $800 to $1,500 per ticket.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be cautious when buying tickets on the secondary market, as prices can fluctuate, and make sure to check the seller's ratings and reviews.\n* If you're willing to take a chance, you can try checking Ticketmaster or the Wells Fargo Center's website periodically for returned or released tickets, which might become available closer to the show date.\n* Consider looking into VIP packages or experiences, which might include floor seats or pit access, along with other perks like meet-and-greets or exclusive merchandise.\n\nKeep in mind that ticket availability and prices are subject to change, so it's essential to act quickly if you find a ticket that suits your needs. Good luck, and I hope you score a great ticket to the show!"
