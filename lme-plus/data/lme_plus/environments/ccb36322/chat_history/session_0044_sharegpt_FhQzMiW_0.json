      "content": "hey lovelies if you find yourself in a dinner rut then I have got your back because today I am sharing my new favorite way to prepare chicken for dinner and it is so easy and so delicious it's this incredible garlic butter chicken and it comes together in under 15 minutes on the stove so there is just so much to love now just before I get to that I want to remind you guys I've got lots more dinner inspiration in my two ebooks I've got a one pot dinners ebook as well as a 30 minute meals ebook so if you're looking for quick and easy dinner ideas these two books have totally got you covered you can find them on the domesticgeek.com or Linked In the description box below the video now let's talk about this absolutely unreal chicken recipe that is about to change your life I make it at least once a week in my house because the kids have absolutely love it and so do I so it's a win-win all the way around it starts with the most amazing seasoning blend you know in my bowl I'm combining some paprika with some garlic powder onion powder dried oregano and some dried thyme and I'm also going to add a little bit of salt to that super easy breezy probably spices you already have on hand in your pantry am I right this has become a really go-to blend in my cooking I recommend mixing up a big batch of it because you can put it not only on things like chicken but also on shrimp and salmon pork it's really versatile once your blend is prepared it's time to go ahead and start seasoning up your chicken now here I've opted for boneless skinless chicken thighs you guys know how much I sing the Praises of boneless because those chicken thighs especially for busy weeknight cooking they're relatively affordable and easy to find and they just have a lot better texture I think than sableness skinless chicken breast I'm going to season each of my chicken thighs up really liberally with this blend it's pretty mild in flavors so you don't have to worry about overdoing it and it's also going to create this really nice sort of crust on your chicken just me guys I have your back you're not going to be sad about this okay once we're seasoned up on that first side I'm gonna fire up my pan now I'm doing this in a non-stick ceramic pan in fact this is my new favorite pan to cook with and no they didn't pay me to say that it just is I love it because of course ceramic is a little better for you better for the environment I will link it in the description box below if you're in the market for a new non-stick pan but even though it's non-stick I'm still going to go ahead and add a little bit of oil to it to make sure things are extra nonstick when you're talking about weeknight cooking you do not need to be a hero you want to make your life as easy as possible you don't want to spoil your dinner by you not using enough oil am I right am I right and just as soon as that oil is nice and hot I'm going to transfer my chicken thighs into the pan seasoning side down and we're gonna let that cook until it's nice and golden and starting to get a bit crispy while these are upside down on my pan I'm gonna go ahead and season up the other side because we eat both sides after all right so four or five minutes is all it's going to take for you to develop this really incredible crust on the top side and that means it's time to flip these guys over like so and we're going to start to develop that same really nice crust on the underside maybe another say three minutes or so on this side before I go ahead and start to get to the best part of this recipe which is the butter and the garlic yes everything is made better by butter and garlic am I right so at this point I'm going to go ahead and add two tablespoons of butter into my pan of course because my pan is nice and hot that butter is going to melt instantly and then with that butter I'm gonna get in here with two cloves of minced garlic and just start sort of moving my chicken thighs in and around so it gets nice and coated no it's really important not to add your garlic any sooner than this in this recipe because we don't want our garlic to burn while our chicken is cooking adding it at this point make sure that your chicken is almost fully cooked before it starts getting infused with that amazing garlic Flavor now after about 30 seconds to a minute of that garlic thing in the pan you'll know good things are happening because your whole kitchen is going to smell like delicious butter and garlic and that means it's time to add just a splash of chicken broth to your pan this is going to help you get all those delicious chicken bits off the bottom of the pan and finish cooking our chicken and I'm just going to get in here and Spoon this mixture over top of our chicken so it's garlicky buttery goodness now at this point your chicken should be pretty much fully cooked you'll want to check it with a meat thermometer to make sure it's reached a safe internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit and that's how you know it is ready to serve and guys you can serve this chicken with so many things you can serve it with a salad or roast potatoes it is so versatile it's so flavorful today I'm serving it with some cooked rice and some sauteed greens not only is this chicken perfect for weeknight cooking because it's so fast it also meal preps beautifully so if you're doing your meal prepping for the week during your Sunday meal prep add this chicken to your rotation you will not regret it you can enjoy it for two to three days as long as
