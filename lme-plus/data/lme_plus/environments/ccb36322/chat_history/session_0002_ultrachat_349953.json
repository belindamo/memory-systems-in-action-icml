      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I am programmed to provide information based on research and facts. so, i must inform you that while succulents are low-maintenance plants, they still require proper care and attention to thrive. neglecting their needs can result in various issues, including root rot, which can eventually lead to the death of the plant. \n\nfurthermore, it's essential to remember that plants cannot survive completely on their own, as they still require adequate light, water, and nutrients from their environment to survive. so even low-maintenance plants like succulents require a certain level of care to keep them healthy and thriving."
