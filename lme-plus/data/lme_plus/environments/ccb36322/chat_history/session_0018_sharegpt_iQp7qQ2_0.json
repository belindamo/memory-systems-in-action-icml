Generally, an eBook retailer buys eBooks from publishers or authors at a wholesale price and then sells them to customers at a retail price, making a profit from the difference. The eBooks can be sold through their own website or through third-party retailers such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble. Some eBook retailers may also offer a subscription-based model where customers pay a monthly fee to access a library of eBooks. Additionally, some eBook retailers may offer self-publishing services for authors who want to sell their own eBooks. The business model for an eBook retailer may vary depending on their target market, the types of eBooks they sell, and their pricing strategies."
