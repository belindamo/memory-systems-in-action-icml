  "content": "How to Make the Perfect Garlic Butter Chicken for Dinner\n\nAre you in need of some dinner inspiration? Look no further! This garlic butter chicken recipe is an absolute game-changer. Not only is it incredibly easy to make, but it's also super delicious and takes less than 15 minutes to prepare.\n\nSeasoning the Chicken\n\nTo start, you'll need to create a seasoning blend by combining paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, and dried thyme. Add a bit of salt to the mixture, and you're ready to go. This blend is incredibly versatile and can be used not only on chicken but also on shrimp, salmon, and pork.\n\nNext, season your boneless skinless chicken thighs with the seasoning blend. Chicken thighs are a great choice for this recipe because they're affordable, easy to find, and have a better texture than boneless skinless chicken breasts. Be sure to season the chicken liberally on both sides to create a nice crust.\n\nCooking the Chicken\n\nHeat up a non-stick ceramic pan with a little bit of oil. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken thighs seasoning side down. Cook for 4-5 minutes until the top is golden and starting to get crispy. Flip the chicken over and cook the other side for another 3 minutes or so until it's crispy and cooked through.\n\nAdding the Garlic Butter\n\nThe best part of this recipe is the garlic butter. Add two tablespoons of butter to the pan and let it melt. Then, add two cloves of minced garlic and coat the chicken in the garlic butter mixture. Be sure not to add the garlic too soon, as it can burn. Wait until the chicken is almost fully cooked before adding the garlic.\n\nAfter 30 seconds to a minute, the garlic butter will have infused the chicken with an amazing flavor, and your kitchen will be filled with the delicious scent of butter and garlic. Add a splash of chicken broth to the pan to finish cooking the chicken, and spoon the mixture over the top of the chicken.\n\nServe the garlic butter chicken hot, and enjoy the amazing flavors!\n\nRecipe\n\nDescription: This garlic butter chicken recipe is incredibly easy to make and takes less than 15 minutes to prepare.
