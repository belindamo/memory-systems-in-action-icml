However, here are some approximate price ranges for each hotel I mentioned earlier:\n\n**The Cosmopolitan**:\n\n* Deluxe Room: $150-$300 per night (average)\n* City View Room: $200-$400 per night (average)\n* Strip View Room: $300-$600 per night (average)\n* Suites: $500-$1,500 per night (average)\n\n**Bellagio**:\n\n* Deluxe Room: $180-$350 per night (average)\n* City View Room: $250-$450 per night (average)\n* Strip View Room: $350-$700 per night (average)\n* Suites: $600-$2,000 per night (average)\n* Fountain View Room: $400-$1,000 per night (average)\n\nKeep in mind that these are approximate price ranges and can vary depending on the time of year, day of the week, and availability. For example:\n\n* Peak season (Friday-Sunday, holidays, and summer): Prices tend to be higher, often 20-50% more than the average.\n* Off-peak season (Monday-Thursday, winter): Prices tend to be lower, often 10-30% less than the average.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the hotel's website or a hotel booking website like Expedia, Booking.com, or Hotels.com for the most up-to-date prices and deals. You can also consider booking a package deal that includes extras like show tickets, dining credits, or spa treatments, which can sometimes be a better value than booking a room alone.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following tips to save money:\n\n* Book in advance: The earlier you book, the better your chances of getting a lower rate.\n* Be flexible with your dates: If you have flexibility in your travel plans, you may be able to find better deals on certain days of the week or during off-peak seasons.\n* Look for promotions and discounts: Keep an eye on the hotel's website and social media for special offers, discounts, or package deals.\n* Consider a luxury hotel's loyalty program: If you frequent a particular hotel or chain, joining their loyalty program can provide perks like room upgrades, early check-in, and exclusive discounts.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your luxurious Las Vegas getaway!",
