It can also lead to unnecessary pressure, criticism, or expectations from fans and the media.\n\nIn these situations, the team and management can take various actions to address the issue. They can work with players to provide support or guidance on managing their social media accounts, or they can take a more proactive approach to monitor or moderate online interactions to prevent abuse or negative comments.\n\nMoreover, players can also be encouraged to take a break from social media if it is becoming too distracting or affecting their mental health. Still, it is essential to note that each situation is unique, and the approach taken might vary depending on the circumstances.\n\nOverall, social media's impact on players and their game can be both positive and negative, and it is essential to manage it carefully to ensure that it does not have too many negative consequences.",
