  "content": "I'm hoping to find some unique gifts for my friends' birthdays, maybe something handmade or personalized. I've had some good experiences with buying gifts from local vendors in the past, like at the holiday market I attended last year in my neighborhood. They had some really talented artisans selling handmade crafts, jewelry, and food, and I ended up buying a few gifts for my family, including a scarf, a candle, and some chocolates.",
