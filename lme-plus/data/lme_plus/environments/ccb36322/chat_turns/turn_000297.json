  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but depending on the context, feedback from attendees who are not experts in the field can be just as valuable as feedback from experts. \n\nWhile experts may have more specialized knowledge and experience, attendees who are not experts can provide unique perspectives and insights that experts might miss. Some attendees may have questions or concerns that experts may have overlooked, or they may have suggestions for improving the delivery of the session that experts may not have considered.\n\nThat being said, organizers may need to use discretion when weighing feedback from different sources. Expert feedback can be particularly valuable in helping organizers refine the content and delivery of the session, while feedback from non-experts can provide insight into how the session is perceived by a broader audience. Both types of feedback can be useful in identifying areas for improvement and planning for future sessions.\n\nUltimately, what is most important is to gather feedback from a diverse and representative group of attendees, regardless of their level of expertise, and to use the feedback to make meaningful changes that will benefit all participants.",
