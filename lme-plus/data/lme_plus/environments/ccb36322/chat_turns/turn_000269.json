  "content": "Canva is a fantastic choice for designing a flyer, and I'm sure you'll find it easy to use.\n\nRegarding the TechXpo, I'm glad to hear that you were able to restock on brochures just in time. It's always stressful when you run out of materials at an event, but it sounds like you handled it like a pro!\n\nHowever, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I wasn't involved in helping you with brochures for the TechXpo. I'm here to assist you with your design needs and answer any questions you may have, but I don't have personal experiences or recall previous conversations.\n\nNow, let's focus on creating a fantastic flyer for your wireless charging pad with Canva! If you have any questions about using Canva or need design tips, feel free to ask. I'm here to help.",
