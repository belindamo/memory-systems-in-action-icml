  "content": "Summary:\n\nThis study focused on three New Jersey communities with different characteristics and assessed their information needs. Key takeaways from the study include the desire for service journalism, the heavy reliance on Facebook for news and information, and the need for more local news in different languages. Despite some difficulties in conducting the study, the publishers were appreciative of the opportunity to better understand their audiences.\n\nTo further strengthen the connection with their audiences, the study suggests that similar research should be conducted in six months or a year, and improvements should be made based on the findings.",
