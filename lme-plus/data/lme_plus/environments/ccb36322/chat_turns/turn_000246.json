I think I'll add a short message to the introduction of the album, something like \"To my dear friends, thanks for being part of my life's adventures\" or something similar. By the way, speaking of adventures, I'm actually planning to go to a craft fair with my mom this weekend, they will have local artisans selling handmade jewelry, pottery, and other crafts. I'm hoping to find a few unique gifts for my friends' birthdays. Have you heard of any popular craft fairs or markets in the area?",
