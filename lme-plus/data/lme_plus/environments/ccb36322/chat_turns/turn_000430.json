This helps to crisp up the crust.\n4. **Bake for 10-12 minutes:** Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted.\n5. **Broil for extra crispiness:** If you want an extra crispy crust, broil the pizza for an additional 1-2 minutes.
