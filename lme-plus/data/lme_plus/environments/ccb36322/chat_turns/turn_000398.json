Here's a revised routine for those days:\n\n**6:30 AM - Wake Up**\n\n* Wake up 30 minutes earlier than usual to accommodate your training session\n\n**6:40 AM - 20-minute Walk**\n\n* Fit in a shorter 20-minute walk to get some fresh air and energize yourself\n* You can still get some benefits from a shorter walk, and it'll help you wake up and feel more alert\n\n**7:00 AM - Shower and Get Ready**\n\n* Take a quick shower and get dressed in your training attire\n* Keep your morning prep simple and efficient to save time\n\n**7:15 AM - Quick Breakfast**\n\n* Prepare a quick and easy breakfast that'll give you energy for your training session\n* Something light like a banana, energy bar, or a smoothie should do the trick\n\n**7:25 AM - Final Prep**\n\n* Double-check that you have everything you need for your training session\n* Make any final adjustments to your outfit or gear\n\n**7:30 AM - Training Session**\n\n* You're now ready to tackle your training session!\n\nOn Mondays and Thursdays, you'll need to prioritize your time more carefully, but this revised routine should help you fit in the essentials before your training session. Remember to adjust the timing as needed to fit your individual pace and preferences.\n\nFor the other days of the week, you can stick to the original routine I suggested earlier.",
