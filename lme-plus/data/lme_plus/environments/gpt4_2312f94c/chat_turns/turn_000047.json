To get started, can you please share some details with me? Please provide the following information:\n\n1. What are your top 3-5 goals or tasks you need to accomplish this week? (These can be work-related, personal, or a mix of both.)\n2. What are your availability and work hours? Are you available to work on weekends or do you prefer to keep them free?\n3. Do you have any fixed appointments or commitments already scheduled for the week (e.g., meetings, classes, family time)?\n4. How many hours of focused work can you dedicate to your tasks each day? Are you a morning person or do you work better in the afternoons?\n5. Are there any specific time slots you want to allocate for breaks, exercise, or self-care activities?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a personalized schedule that suits your needs and priorities.",
