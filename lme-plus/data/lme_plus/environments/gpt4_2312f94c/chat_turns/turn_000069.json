  "content": "I think those ideas are fantastic! Providing a stimulating environment for your pigs is crucial for their physical and mental well-being. Mud pits, tunnels, and obstacles will not only keep them entertained but also help to reduce stress and boredom.\n\nThe fruit trees or bushes are a great idea, too! Pigs love to forage and having a constant supply of fresh fruits and vegetables will be a wonderful treat for them. Just make sure to choose varieties that are safe for pigs to eat and plant them in a way that prevents the pigs from uprooting the entire tree or bush.\n\nYou might also consider adding some other enrichment activities, such as:\n\n1. **Sensory stimulation**: Add different textures like sand, straw, or wood chips to create varied surfaces for the pigs to explore.\n2. **Digging areas**: Pigs are natural diggers, so designating an area for them to dig and root around can be very satisfying for them.\n3. **Climbing structures**: Pigs are surprisingly agile, and adding climbing structures like wooden or metal frames can provide them with exercise and mental stimulation.\n4. **Water features**: Consider adding a small pond or water trough to provide a cooling spot for the pigs during hot weather.\n5. **Rotational grazing**: Divide the pigpen into sections and rotate the pigs through them to provide a varied diet and prevent overgrazing.\n\nRemember to always prioritize the pigs' safety and health when designing the new pigpen. Make sure the area is well-ventilated, has adequate drainage, and provides sufficient shelter from the elements.\n\nYou're on the right track, and with a little creativity, you can create a wonderful and engaging environment for your pigs!",
