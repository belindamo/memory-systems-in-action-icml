  "content": "I'm excited to try out making gyoza wrappers from scratch! I've heard that using a combination of all-purpose flour and cornstarch can help create a more delicate and tender wrapper. Have you heard of this technique, and do you have any thoughts on it?\n\nAlso, I've been experimenting with different types of fillings for my gyoza, and I'm curious to know if you have any favorite fillings or recommendations. I've tried using ground pork, shrimp, and vegetables, but I'm open to trying out new ingredients and flavor combinations!",
