Pilav (rice): A common side dish served with kebabs in Turkey, pilav is typically made with long-grain rice, vermicelli noodles, onions, and chicken or vegetable broth.\n\n2. Haydari: This creamy dip is made with strained yogurt, garlic, and fresh herbs like dill and mint. It's perfect for dipping meat into or spreading on bread.\n\n3. \u015eak\u015fuka: This vegetable dish is made with eggplant, bell peppers, and tomatoes that have been saut\u00e9ed and stewed in a tomato sauce with onions and garlic. \n\n4. Piyaz: This classic Turkish salad is made with white beans, onions, parsley, and sometimes tomatoes. It's flavorful and refreshing and a perfect palate cleanser.\n\nThese are all popular and delicious options that would complement a lamb kebab nicely. Of course, other dishes that may be available at the restaurant would also be worth exploring to find your favorite pairing!",
