Congratulations on completing your solo trip and hiking 20 miles to see the geysers and hot springs!\n\nNow, about your upcoming Rocky Mountains backpacking trip, I'd be happy to help you with some recommendations for campsites and trails suitable for beginners.\n\n**Campsites:**\n\n1. **Bear Lake Campground**, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado: This campground is located near the popular Bear Lake trailhead and offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains. It's a great spot for beginners, with access to amenities like flush toilets and potable water.\n2. **Aspen Grove Campground**, Mount Evans, Colorado: This campground is situated near the base of Mount Evans, the highest paved road in North America. It's a bit more secluded than Bear Lake, but still has basic amenities and offers beautiful views of the surrounding aspen forests.\n3. **Maroon Lake Campground**, Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness, Colorado: This campground is located near the picturesque Maroon Lake and offers stunning views of the Maroon Bells. It's a more remote location, but the scenery is breathtaking.\n\n**Trails:**\n\n1. **Bear Lake Trail**, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado: This 0.8-mile loop trail is a great introduction to backpacking in the Rockies. It's relatively flat and offers stunning views of Bear Lake and the surrounding mountains.\n2. **Alberta Falls Trail**, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado: This 3.8-mile out-and-back trail takes you to a beautiful waterfall and offers scenic views of the surrounding forest and meadows.\n3. **Maroon Lake Scenic Trail**, Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness, Colorado: This 1.5-mile out-and-back trail takes you to Maroon Lake, offering stunning views of the Maroon Bells and surrounding mountains.\n\n**Tips for Beginners:**\n\n1. **Check the weather forecast**: The Rocky Mountains can be unpredictable, so make sure to check the weather forecast before heading out.\n2. **Pack layers**: The temperature can drop significantly at higher elevations, so bring layers to stay warm and comfortable.\n3. **Bring a map and compass**: Even with a GPS device, it's always a good idea to bring a map and compass as a backup.\n4. **Start small**: Begin with shorter trails and gradually increase your distance and elevation gain as you become more comfortable.\n5. **Practice bear safety**: The Rocky Mountains are home to black bears and grizzly bears, so make sure to practice bear safety by storing food and trash properly and making noise while hiking.\n\nRemember to always check the regulations and permits required for each campground and trail, and to practice Leave No Trace principles to minimize your impact on the environment.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited for your Rocky Mountains backpacking adventure!",
