  "content": "I see that the deals on toilet paper are pretty similar across the three stores. For laundry detergent, I think I'll go with the 100-load bottle from Walmart since it's the cheapest option after the digital coupon. Do you know if there are any cashback opportunities or rewards available for purchasing these items? Also, I was thinking of trying out a new brand of paper towels - do you have any recommendations or deals on those?",
