These sockets operate at a standard voltage of 120V and a frequency of 60Hz.\n\nFor your devices:\n\n1. **Dell XPS 13 Laptop:**\nYour laptop likely comes with a USB-C power adapter, which is a universal standard. You won't need a separate power adapter for Hawaii, as USB-C is designed to be compatible with various power standards worldwide. However, it's always a good idea to bring a portable power adapter or a travel adapter with multiple USB ports to keep your devices charged.\n2. **Samsung Galaxy S22 Smartphone:**\nYour smartphone also uses a USB-C charging port, which is compatible with the same standards as your laptop. You can use the same travel adapter or a compact USB-C charging adapter to keep your phone charged.\n\nTo summarize, you won't need any specific power adapters for Hawaii. However, consider packing a:\n\n* Portable power bank to keep your devices charged on-the-go\n* Travel adapter with multiple USB ports to charge multiple devices at once\n* Compact USB-C charging adapter for convenience\n\nAs a side note, I'm glad you finally received your laptop after the delay!\n\nEnjoy your trip to Hawaii, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions!",
