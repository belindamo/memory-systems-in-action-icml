As you approach, he looks up and raises an eyebrow, seemingly impressed that you've returned so soon.\n\n\"You've got the map?\" he asks, a note of excitement in his voice.\n\nYou unfurl the parchment, revealing the detailed chart that marks the supposed location of the Crimson Marauder. Captain Remy scrutinizes the map, nodding in approval. \"Well, I'll be. It looks like you've found something genuine here, my friend. I'll honor my part of the deal. We'll set sail tomorrow morning, provided you're ready. I suggest you get any supplies or equipment you might need and rest up for the journey ahead. The seas can be unpredictable, and we'll need to be prepared for whatever we might face.\"\n\nYou now have the rest of the day to gather supplies, rest, or take care of any other business before setting sail with Captain Remy in search of the Crimson Marauder. Is there anything you'd like to do before departing?",
