  "content": "Calculating the profit margin for each sale is a great way to understand the profitability of your products. To calculate the profit margin, you'll need to know the selling price and the cost of goods sold (COGS) for each item.\n\nHere's the formula:\n\n**Profit Margin = (Selling Price - COGS) / Selling Price**\n\nLet's use the example of your lavender candles. Let's say you sold 10 lavender candles at the farmers' market last Saturday, and you want to calculate the profit margin for each candle.\n\n**Selling Price:** $15 per candle (the price you sold each candle for)\n**COGS:** $8 per candle (the cost of making each candle, including materials, labor, and overhead)\n\n**Profit Margin Calculation:**\n\nProfit Margin = ($15 - $8) / $15\n= $7 / $15\n= 0.47 or 47%\n\nThis means that for each lavender candle you sold, you made a 47% profit margin.\n\nYou can add a new column to your Sales Tracker to calculate the profit margin for each sale. Here's an updated template:\n\n**Sales Tracker**\n\n| Date | Sales Type | Amount | Description | COGS | Profit Margin |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023-03-18 | Lavender Candles | $150 | Farmers' Market | $80 | = (B2-C2)/B2 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nIn this example, the formula `= (B2-C2)/B2` calculates the profit margin for each sale, where:\n\n* B2 is the selling price ($150)\n* C2 is the COGS ($80)\n\nYou can copy and paste this formula down the column to calculate the profit margin for each sale.\n\nTips:\n\n* Make sure to update your COGS regularly to reflect changes in material costs, labor rates, or overhead expenses.\n* Consider calculating the profit margin for each product category or sales channel to identify areas for improvement.\n* You can also use the profit margin calculation to set prices for new products or to determine the minimum price you need to charge to break even.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",
