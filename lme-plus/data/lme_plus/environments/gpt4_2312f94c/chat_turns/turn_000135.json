  "content": "A ceramic planter with a wide base can be a great compromise. The wide base will provide stability, making it less likely to tip over, and can help distribute the weight more evenly. This can make it easier to move the planter around, especially if you need to rotate it for optimal sunlight or to change its location.\n\nHowever, it's still important to consider the weight of the planter, especially if you plan to move it frequently or up and down stairs. Ceramic planters can be heavy, and a large one with a wide base can be quite substantial.\n\nHere are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Lightweight ceramic**: Look for ceramic planters made from lightweight materials or with a hollow design. These can be a good compromise between style and weight.\n2. **Ceramic with a built-in handle**: Some ceramic planters come with built-in handles or grips, making it easier to lift and move them.\n3. **Durable plastic or resin**: If you're concerned about weight, consider a high-quality plastic or resin planter. These materials are often lighter and more durable than ceramic. Look for planters with a sturdy design and a wide base for stability.\n4. **Composite materials**: Some planters combine materials, like a ceramic or stone exterior with a lighter weight interior. These can offer the best of both worlds: style and ease of movement.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to consider your specific needs and priorities. If you're willing to lift and move a heavier planter, a ceramic one with a wide base can be a beautiful and durable choice. However, if you need something lighter, one of the alternative materials might be a better fit.\n\nRemember to also consider the size and weight of the ficus tree itself, as well as the soil and any decorative elements you plan to add. This will give you a better idea of the overall weight and mobility of the planter.",
