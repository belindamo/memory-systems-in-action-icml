Rooting them in water first can make a big difference in their success rate. Water rooting helps to:\n\n1. **Develop stronger roots**: By allowing the roots to develop in water, you're giving them a head start on establishing a strong root system. This makes it easier for the plant to adapt to soil and reduces the risk of root rot.\n2. **Reduce transplant shock**: When you plant the baby directly into soil, it can be a shock to the system. By rooting in water first, you're giving the plant a chance to adjust to its new environment before introducing soil.\n3. **Increase success rates**: Water rooting can increase the chances of successful propagation. It's a more controlled environment, and you can monitor the roots' development more easily.\n\nRemember to be patient and gentle when handling the baby plants, as they can be delicate. With a little care and attention, you should be able to propagate your spider plant babies successfully.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your propagation attempts, and I hope you'll soon be enjoying a bunch of new, healthy spider plants!",
