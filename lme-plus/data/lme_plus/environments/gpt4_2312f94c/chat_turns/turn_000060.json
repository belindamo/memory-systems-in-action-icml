  "content": "I've got a barbed wire fence, and I'm looking to repair and extend about 500 feet of it. I currently use 12.5 gauge wire, and I'd like to stick with that. For the wooden stakes, I need a mix of corner posts and line posts, and I prefer them to be around 6 feet long and 4 inches in diameter. As for surplus, I'd like to order enough for the next two repair jobs, just to be safe.",
