Here are some tips to help you keep your online shopping in check:\n\n1. **Set a budget**: Determine how much you can afford to spend on online shopping each month and stick to it.\n2. **Create a wishlist**: Instead of buying impulsively, add items to a wishlist and wait 24-48 hours before making a purchase. This can help you determine if you really need the item.\n3. **Avoid browsing**: Try to avoid browsing online stores when you're feeling bored or stressed. This can lead to mindless shopping.\n4. **Unsubscribe from newsletters**: Remove yourself from newsletters that tempt you to buy unnecessary items.\n5. **Use the 30-wear rule**: Ask yourself if you'll wear an item at least 30 times before buying it. This can help you prioritize quality over quantity.\n6. **Practice mindful shopping**: Be honest with yourself about why you're buying something. Is it to fill a emotional void or to keep up with trends?\n7. **Consider the cost per wear**: Calculate the cost per wear for an item to help you prioritize purchases. This can help you focus on buying timeless pieces that'll get frequent use.\n8. **Use cashback apps**: Use cashback apps like Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates) or TopCashback to earn rewards on your purchases. This can help you feel more mindful of your spending.\n9. **Create a shopping ban**: Consider implementing a shopping ban for a specific period, like a month or a season, to help you reset your spending habits.\n10. **Seek accountability**: Share your shopping goals with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to indulge occasionally. The key is to find a balance that works for you and your budget.\n\nBy the way, have you considered implementing a \"one in, one out\" policy for your wardrobe? This means that for every new item you bring in, you remove or donate an old one to maintain a balanced and curated wardrobe.",
