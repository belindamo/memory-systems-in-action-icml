  "content": "You approach a group of sailors gathered around a small wooden barrel, which serves as their makeshift table. They're engaged in a lively game of dice, with coins changing hands as the players cheer and groan in response to each roll.\n\nOne of the sailors, a burly man with a bushy beard, notices your interest and grins. \"Ahoy, mate! Care to join us for a game? It's a simple wager \u2013 highest roll wins the pot. Just toss in a coin and give the dice a throw!\"\n\nThe game is played with a d6, and the player with the highest roll takes the pot. You can decide how much you want to wager \u2013 a silver or a gold piece, perhaps \u2013 and roll the d6 to see if you can come out on top.\n\nTo make your roll, type /roll d6, and let me know how much you're wagering. I'll describe the outcome based on your roll and the rolls of the other players.",
