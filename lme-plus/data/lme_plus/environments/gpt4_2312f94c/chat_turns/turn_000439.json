It's a common drink for pairing with Turkish kebabs.\n\n2. Ayran: A refreshing and savory drink made from strained yogurt mixed with water and salt, Ayran is often served with meals to balance out the spices and heat in meat dishes like kebabs.\n\n3. Raki: Raki is a traditional Turkish alcoholic drink that is often served with meze dishes or as an aperitif. It's an anise-flavored drink that is usually mixed with water, which turns it milky white.\n\n4. Turkish tea, or \u00e7ay as it is called in Turkish, is a popular drink in Turkey that is often served after meals. It is typically brewed strong and black, and served with sugar cubes on the side.\n\nYou may want to try \u015ealgam or Ayran with your lamb kebab and haydari. They are both delicious and refreshing choices!",
