The time of year you're planning to visit (or the current month)\n\nWith this information, I can provide you with a list of bird species that are commonly found in that area during that time of year.\n\nAnd congratulations on starting a birding journal! That's a great way to keep track of your sightings, note your observations, and reflect on your experiences. It's also a wonderful way to monitor your progress and identify areas where you'd like to improve. Do you have a favorite entry or observation in your journal so far?\n\nLet me know the details about the state park, and I'll do my best to help you prepare for your trip!",
