  "content": "Definitely! Modules are a way to organize your Terraform code and promote code reusability. A module is a collection of Terraform resources that can be combined and reused as a single unit.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can create a module in Terraform:\n```javascript\nmodule \"web_server\" {\n  source = \"./web_server_module\"\n\n  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `module` block declares a module named `web_server`. The `source` argument specifies the path to the directory containing the module code, in this case `./web_server_module`. The `instance_type` argument is passed to the module and can be used within the module code to specify the instance type for the web server.\n\nHere's an example of what the module code in the `./web_server_module` directory might look like:\n```javascript\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  region = \"us-west-2\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"web_server\" {\n  ami           = \"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0\"\n  instance_type = var.instance_type\n}\n```\nIn this example, the module code creates an AWS EC2 instance using the `aws_instance` resource. The instance type is set to the value of the `instance_type` argument passed to the module.\n\nYou can use the module in your Terraform code just like any other resource, and you can even call the same module multiple times with different arguments to create multiple instances of the same resources.\n\nThis is a simple example, but modules can become much more complex and powerful as you work with Terraform. They're a great way to make your Terraform code more organized and reusable.",
