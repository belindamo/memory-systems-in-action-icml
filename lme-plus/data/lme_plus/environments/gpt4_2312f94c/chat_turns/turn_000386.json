  "content": "In a sense, that is correct. In a pure democracy, the majority's will would be supreme and the minority would have little recourse to protect their rights. However, most modern democracies operate within a constitutional framework that establishes limits on the power of the majority and enshrines certain individual rights and protections for minorities.\n\nThe idea behind this is that while democracy provides citizens with the opportunity to participate in government decision-making, it is also essential to ensure that the rights of minority groups are protected and that individual freedoms are not unduly restricted. This can be achieved through a system of checks and balances, independent institutions, and a constitution that sets limits on the power of the majority and enshrines certain individual rights.\n\nIn this way, a democracy that protects individual rights and minority interests is not a \"pure\" democracy in the sense that the will of the majority is always supreme, but it is a more just and equitable system that allows all citizens to participate in government decision-making and enjoy equal protection under the law.",
