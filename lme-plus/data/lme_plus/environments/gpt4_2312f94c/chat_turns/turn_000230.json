  "content": "Nut butters are an excellent binding agent for energy balls, and they add healthy fats and protein to boot! Here are some healthy nut butter options you can consider:\n\n1. **Peanut Butter**: A classic choice, peanut butter is a popular binding agent for energy balls. Look for natural peanut butter with minimal added ingredients and no hydrogenated oils.\n2. **Almond Butter**: Almond butter is a great option for those with peanut allergies or intolerances. It's high in healthy fats and protein, and has a rich, nutty flavor.\n3. **Cashew Butter**: Cashew butter is creamy and rich, with a subtle sweetness. It's a good choice for those who want a slightly sweeter energy ball.\n4. **SunButter**: Made from sunflower seeds, SunButter is a great option for schools and workplaces with peanut-free policies. It's also high in protein and healthy fats.\n5. **Tahini**: While not a traditional nut butter, tahini is a sesame seed butter that's high in healthy fats and protein. It has a strong, nutty flavor, so use it sparingly.\n6. **Coconut Butter**: Coconut butter is a creamy, rich option that's high in healthy fats. It's a good choice for those who want a dairy-free, vegan energy ball.\n7. **Hazelnut Butter**: Hazelnut butter is a tasty option with a rich, nutty flavor. It's high in healthy fats and protein, and pairs well with chocolate chips or cocoa powder.\n\nWhen choosing a nut butter, make sure to read the ingredient label and look for options with minimal added ingredients, no hydrogenated oils, and no added sugars.\n\nRemember to use a small amount of nut butter, as it can be high in calories. A general rule of thumb is to use about 1-2 tablespoons of nut butter per batch of energy balls. You can always adjust the amount to your liking, but start with a small amount and add more as needed.",
