  "content": "That's a great approach! Clearing the debris and trash is a crucial step in preparing the area for your pigpen expansion. And kudos to you for thinking ahead and checking for hazards that could harm your pigs. Safety should always be a top priority when it comes to animal care.\n\nI'm glad to hear that selling the excess roosters worked out well for you, too! It's always satisfying to find a solution that benefits both you and the animals. The extra cash will surely come in handy for the expansion project.\n\nRemember to take your time and pace yourself while clearing the area. It can be a labor-intensive task, but it's worth it in the end. If you need any more advice or guidance, feel free to ask. I'm here to help.\n\nBy the way, have you considered what kind of enrichment activities or features you'll include in the expanded pigpen to keep your pigs happy and engaged?",
