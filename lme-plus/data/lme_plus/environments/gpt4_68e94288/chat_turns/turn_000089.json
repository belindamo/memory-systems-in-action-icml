I like the idea of a compact tenkeyless design for my keyboard, and the long battery life of both devices is a big plus. Thanks for the recommendation!\n\nBy the way, have you heard about the new smart home devices that can help automate and control various aspects of your home? I've been thinking about investing in some smart plugs to control my lights and other appliances remotely. Do you have any experience with smart home devices or recommendations for a beginner like me?",
