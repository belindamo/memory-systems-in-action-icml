Adding a few decorative items to the shelf can enhance the visual interest and create a cozy, inviting atmosphere. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n* **Less is more**: Remember, you're going for a minimalist look, so don't overcrowd the shelf. 2-3 decorative items are enough.\n* **Choose items that complement the planters**: Select items that share a similar style, material, or color palette with the planters. For example, if your planters are white, you could add a small white vase or a book with a white cover.\n* **Vary the heights and textures**: Mix different heights and textures to create visual interest. For example, you could place a small vase next to a book, and add a small decorative object like a sculpture or a paperweight.\n\nSome ideas for decorative items:\n\n* Small vases or bud vases\n* Art books or coffee table books with a minimalist cover design\n* Decorative objects like sculptures, paperweights, or small figurines\n* A small, framed photo or art print\n\n**Affordable floating shelves:**\n\nYou can find affordable floating shelves at a variety of online retailers and home decor stores.
