  "content": "In the period leading up to World War II, Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, pursued a policy of aggressive expansionism and territorial ambitions in Europe.\n\nThe Nazis believed in the concept of Lebensraum or \"living space\", which called for the annexation of territories in Eastern Europe to provide resources and living space for the German people. They also sought to unite all Germans under a single state, which meant taking control of territories with significant ethnic German populations.\n\nIn 1938, Germany annexed Austria, and the following year, it invaded Czechoslovakia, both of which were met with little resistance from the international community. This emboldened Hitler to continue his expansionist ambitions, and in 1939, Germany invaded Poland, which triggered the outbreak of World War II.\n\nDuring the war, Germany occupied much of Europe and engaged in atrocities such as the Holocaust, which targeted Jews, Romani people, homosexuals, and other minority groups for extermination.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, Germany's aggressive expansionism and territorial ambitions were widely recognized as a major factor in the conflict, and the Allies sought to prevent Germany from ever again posing a threat to European peace and stability. This led to the division of Germany and the imposition of various limitations on its sovereignty, including the cession of territory to Poland and the Soviet Union.",
