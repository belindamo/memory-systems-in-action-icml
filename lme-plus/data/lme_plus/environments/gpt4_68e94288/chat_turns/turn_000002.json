  "content": "I'm thinking of a modern and minimalist style, and my living room has a lot of natural light. The planters are white and I'm thinking of getting some small succulents to put in them. I'm open to any ideas you have, but I was thinking of placing them on a shelf or side table. Do you have any suggestions on what kind of shelf or side table would complement the planters and the overall style I'm going for?",
