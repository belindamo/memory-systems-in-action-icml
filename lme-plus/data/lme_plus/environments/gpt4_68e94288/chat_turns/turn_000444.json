  "content": "I understand how you feel. Jocelin's stubbornness and arrogance caused him to overlook the dangers he was putting others in. It is frustrating when someone is so focused on their own goals and ambitions that they are unable to see the potential harm they are causing to those around them. However, it is important to remember that Jocelin is a representation of the human flaws we all share. Golding uses Jocelin's character to explore the themes of pride and ambition, and how they can alter one's judgment and perspective. The frustration you feel towards Jocelin's character is a testament to Golding's ability to create complex characters with realistic flaws that readers can connect with emotionally.",
