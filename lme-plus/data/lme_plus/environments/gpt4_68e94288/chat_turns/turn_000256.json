I'm a large language model, I don't retain any information about your personal events or appointments.\n\nTo check for conflicting events on Saturday morning, I recommend checking your own calendar, planner, or scheduling app to see if you have any appointments, meetings, or other commitments scheduled. You can also ask a family member or friend if they know of any plans you have.\n\nIf you're using a digital calendar, you can also try checking your calendar on your phone or computer to see if you have any events scheduled for Saturday morning.\n\nOnce you've checked your schedule, you can plan your workout accordingly. If you need any help with workout ideas or routines, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions!",
