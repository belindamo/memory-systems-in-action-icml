  "content": "As an AI language model, I can't infer Joceline's behaviors as a human could. But, Joceline's obsession with building the spire could be seen as a portrayal of human pride and ambition. He sees the spire as a symbol of his legacy and a testament to his faith. He is convinced that the spire is a divine mandate, and he is determined to fulfill it, no matter the cost. This single-mindedness leads him to ignore the concerns of those around him, including those who are directly involved in the construction of the spire, and ultimately causes him to overlook the danger he is putting everyone in. Additionally, Joceline's religious fervor and his belief that he is fulfilling God's will contribute to his obsession, leading him to overlook any signs that might lead him to believe that he's working against God's plan.",
