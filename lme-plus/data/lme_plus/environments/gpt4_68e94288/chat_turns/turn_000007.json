  "content": "**Adding a small decorative box or coasters:**\n\nA small decorative box or coasters can be a great addition to the shelf, but it depends on the overall look you're going for. Here are some considerations:\n\n* **Small decorative box:** A small decorative box can add a nice touch of elegance to the shelf, especially if it's made of a material that complements the planters (e.g., wood, ceramic, or glass). Just be mindful of the size and make sure it's not too large or overwhelming.\n* **Coasters:** Coasters can be a nice addition if you plan to use the shelf as a coffee table or side table. However, if the shelf is primarily for decorative purposes, coasters might not be the best choice.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep the shelf simple and uncluttered. If you do decide to add a small decorative box or coasters, make sure they're not competing with the planters and other decorative items for attention.\n\n**IKEA floating shelves for planters or vases:**\n\nIKEA does offer some floating shelves that are specifically designed for holding planters or vases. Here are a few options:\n\n* **KVARTERSKLIPPER**: This floating shelf is designed specifically for holding small planters or vases. It's a simple, minimalist design that's easy to install and comes in a few different sizes. (Starting at around $10)\n* **FYNDIG**: This floating shelf has a slightly more decorative design and is also suitable for holding small planters or vases. It's a bit more expensive than the KVARTERSKLIPPER, but still very affordable. (Starting at around $20)\n* **LACK wall shelf with railing**: This floating shelf has a built-in railing that can help prevent items from falling off. It's a great option if you plan to place the shelf in a high-traffic area or have young children or pets. (Starting at around $20)\n\nKeep in mind that these shelves are designed for smaller planters or vases, so make sure to check the dimensions before purchasing.\n\nI hope this helps!",
