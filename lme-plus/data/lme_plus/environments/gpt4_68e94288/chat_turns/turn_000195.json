Here are some tips to help you declutter and prepare your products for their new home:\n\n**1. Take Everything Out:**\nGather all your skincare products from your cabinets, drawers, and countertops. This will give you a good idea of what you have and help you decide what to keep, toss, or donate.\n\n**2. Sort Products into Categories:**\nGroup your products into categories, such as:\n\t* Cleansers\n\t* Toners\n\t* Essences\n\t* Serums\n\t* Moisturizers\n\t* Face masks\n\t* Exfoliants\n\t* Eye care\n\t* Lip care\n\n**3. Check Expiration Dates:**\nCheck the expiration dates or period-after-opening (PAO) symbols on each product. Discard any expired or old products that may no longer be effective or safe to use.\n\n**4. Identify Duplicates:**\nIf you have multiple products with similar functions or ingredients, consider keeping only your favorite or the one that works best for your skin.\n\n**5. Consider Product Condition:**\nEvaluate the condition of each product. If a product is almost empty, has an unpleasant smell, or has separated, it might be time to replace it.\n\n**6. Keep Only What You Use:**\nBe honest with yourself \u2013 if you haven't used a product in the past month, it's likely you won't miss it. Consider donating gently used products or passing them along to friends.\n\n**7. Clean and Prepare Products:**\nClean and dry each product before placing it in your new skincare organizer. Remove any used cotton pads, applicators, or packaging materials.\n\n**8. Purge Samples and Travel Sizes:**\nIf you have a collection of sample sizes or travel-sized products, consider using them up or donating them. These can clutter your skincare station and make it harder to find what you need.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to declutter your skincare products and create a more organized, streamlined collection that's perfect for your new InterDesign Linus Skincare Organizer.\n\nRemember, decluttering is an ongoing process. Set a reminder to revisit your skincare collection every 3-6 months to maintain your organized space and ensure you're using products that work best for your skin.",
