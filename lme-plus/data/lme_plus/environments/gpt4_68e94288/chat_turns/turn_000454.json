  "content": "The modern-day border between Germany and Poland is a result of a complex history of border changes and territorial disputes that took place over several centuries.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the region that is now Poland was divided into several smaller principalities, while what is now Germany was divided into various states and territories. The borders between these regions were often fluid and contested, with various conflicts and wars over control of territory.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was partitioned by its neighboring powers - Russia, Prussia (a predecessor state to modern-day Germany), and Austria - with each taking control of different parts of the territory. This led to the disappearance of the Polish state from the map for more than a century.\n\nAfter World War I, Poland regained its independence and borders were redrawn once again. The new borders placed significant portions of ethnic German populations within Poland, leading to tension between the two countries.\n\nIn 1939, Germany invaded Poland, which led to the outbreak of World War II. After the war, Poland's borders were shifted further westward, with significant portions of pre-war German territory becoming part of Poland.\n\nToday, the border between Germany and Poland is largely based on the post-World War II borders, with some minor changes in the years since. The two countries share a 467 km-long border, with several checkpoints and crossing points allowing for the free movement of people and goods.",
