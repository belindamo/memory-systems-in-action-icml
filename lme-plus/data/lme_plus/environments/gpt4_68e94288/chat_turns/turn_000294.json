  "content": "Absolutely! The filmmakers who were able to produce critically-minded work during Franco's regime were often brave and resourceful, taking risks to express themselves in a time of great danger and repression. Despite all of the obstacles they faced, they were able to create important works of cinema that reflected the complexity of the human experience and pushed back against the narrow confines of Francoist propaganda. It is important to celebrate their bravery and honor the legacy of their creative work.",
