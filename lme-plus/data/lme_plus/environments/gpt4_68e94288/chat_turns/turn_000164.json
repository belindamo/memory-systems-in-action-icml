Combining both methods will make it easy to find specific books and authors, while also creating a visually appealing display.\n\nGrouping series together is especially useful when you have multiple books in a series, as it makes it easy to follow the story arc and keeps them organized. And having a section for your favorite authors is a great way to showcase your love for their work and make it easy to find their books.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that your living room rearrangement has made a positive impact on your daily routine! It's amazing how a simple change can influence our behavior and make a space more inviting. The fact that you're spending more time in the living room, enjoying activities like watching TV and reading, is a testament to the power of good design and organization.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention the evenings specifically. Research has shown that the way we design our spaces can affect our mood, energy levels, and even our sleep patterns. By creating a cozy and comfortable atmosphere in your living room, you're setting yourself up for a relaxing and rejuvenating experience in the evenings.\n\nDo you find that you're more productive or focused when you're reading or watching TV in your newly rearranged living room?",
