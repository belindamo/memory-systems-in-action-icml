  "content": "I can understand your anger towards Jocelin's character and his actions. As I mentioned before, Jocelin's actions are driven by his sense of religious conviction and personal ambition, which unfortunately blind him to the potential dangers that his project is posing. However, his character is also a reflection of the wider human condition, where people's obsessions and ambitions can lead them to overlook the needs and safety of others. Golding uses Jocelin's character to demonstrate the consequences of such self-centered behavior, and how it can lead to tragic outcomes. In the end, Jocelin's character is both frustrating and tragic, a reminder of how personal ambition and pride can lead people to overlook the needs of others and themselves.",
