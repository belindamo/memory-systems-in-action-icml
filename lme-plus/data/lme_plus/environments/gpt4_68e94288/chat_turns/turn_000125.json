I'm happy to share some tips on meal prep and planning:\n\n1. **Plan your meals around your schedule**: Take a look at your upcoming week and plan your meals around your busiest days. If you have a lot of meetings or long work hours, prep meals that can be easily reheated or grabbed on-the-go.\n2. **Shop smart**: Make a grocery list based on your meal plan and try to buy ingredients that can be used in multiple dishes. This will help reduce food waste and save you time and money.\n3. **Prep in bulk**: Consider prepping ingredients in bulk, like cooking a large batch of rice or roasting a big tray of vegetables. This can save you time during the week when you're assembling individual meals.\n4. **Use a \"cook once, eat twice\" approach**: Prep a large batch of a single ingredient, like chicken or beans, and use it in multiple meals throughout the week.\n5. **Keep it simple**: Don't feel like you need to make complicated, Instagram-worthy meals. Simple meals like soups, salads, and stir-fries can be just as delicious and easy to prep.\n6. **Label and store wisely**: Label and date your prepped meals, and store them in airtight containers to keep them fresh and easy to grab.\n7. **Involve your family**: Get your kids involved in the meal prep process! Let them help with simple tasks like washing veggies or assembling their own lunches. This can be a great way to teach them about healthy eating and responsibility.\n\nFor your Sunday meal prep, you might consider prepping a few staple ingredients like:\n\n* Grains: Cook a big batch of rice, quinoa, or pasta to use throughout the week.\n* Proteins: Grill a batch of chicken breasts or cook a big pot of beans to use in various meals.\n* Veggies: Roast a tray of vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes to add to meals throughout the week.\n* Meal prep containers: Prep individual portions of meals like salads, soups, or stir-fries to grab and go during the week.\n\nBy prepping these ingredients, you can quickly assemble healthy meals throughout the week and save time during the busy weekdays.\n\nWhat do you think?
