  "content": "Congratulations on the upgrade to a hardcase for your Kawai ES110!\n\nNow, let's talk about the Yamaha PSR-E263. The PSR-E263 is a portable keyboard that was released around 2014-2015, and it's an entry-level model in Yamaha's PSR-E series. It's a great keyboard for beginners, but it's not a high-end model.\n\nThe market value of a used Yamaha PSR-E263 can vary depending on several factors, such as:\n\n1. Condition: Is the keyboard in good working condition, with no damage or issues?\n2. Age: As it's an older model, the value will be lower compared to newer models.\n3. Location: Prices can vary depending on your location and the demand for used keyboards in your area.\n4. Accessories: Do you have any original accessories, such as a power adapter, music rest, or soft case?\n\nBased on online marketplaces like eBay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace, here are some rough estimates of what you might expect to get for a used Yamaha PSR-E263:\n\n* Good condition, with minimal wear and tear: $50-$100 USD\n* Average condition, with some signs of use: $30-$70 USD\n* Poor condition, with damage or issues: $10-$30 USD\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual selling price may vary depending on your specific situation.\n\nIf you're looking to sell your keyboard, I recommend taking clear photos of it from multiple angles, highlighting its condition and any included accessories. You can also research similar listings in your area to determine a competitive price.\n\nGood luck with the sale, and I hope you find a buyer who will appreciate your keyboard!",
