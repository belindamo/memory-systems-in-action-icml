You've already explored some great options, but here are a few more creative ideas to consider:\n\n1. **Luxardo Cherry Variations**: Try using Luxardo cherries in different flavors like maraschino, cherry-bourbon, or even cherry- orange. You can also experiment with different cherry sizes or use cherry \" buttons\" for a unique look.\n2. **Citrus Twists**: Move beyond traditional orange peels and try using twists of lemon, grapefruit, or even yuzu. You can also express the oils from the citrus peel over the drink for added aroma.\n3. **Smoked Ice Cubes**: Infuse your ice cubes with smoke from wood chips like applewood, cherrywood, or even bacon (if you want to stick with the candied bacon theme). This adds a subtle smoky flavor and aroma to the drink.\n4. **Herbal Garnishes**: Experiment with herbs like mint, basil, or rosemary to add a fresh, fragrant flavor to your old fashioned. You can muddle the herbs with the sugar and bitters for added depth.\n5. **Spiced Cherry Pits**: Soak cherry pits in a spiced simple syrup (e.g., cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves) and use them as a garnish. This adds a warm, aromatic flavor to the drink.\n6. **Candied Ginger**: Slice thin pieces of ginger and candied them in a simple syrup. Use these as a garnish to add a spicy, sweet flavor.\n7. **Bourbon-Soaked Cherries**: Soak cherries in a mixture of bourbon, sugar, and spices for a few weeks. Use these cherries as a garnish for an intense, boozy flavor.\n8. **Edible Flowers**: Use edible flowers like lavender, hibiscus, or rose petals to add a delicate, floral flavor to your old fashioned.\n9. **Smoked Salt Rim**: Rim the glass with smoked salt (e.g., applewood-smoked salt) for a subtle, savory flavor.\n10. **Garnish Picks**: Use garnish picks or skewers to create a visually appealing arrangement of garnishes. You can combine multiple garnishes, like a cherry, orange peel, and sprig of rosemary, to create a stunning presentation.\n\nRemember, the key to a great garnish is to balance flavors and textures. Experiment with different combinations to find the perfect fit for your signature old fashioned.",
