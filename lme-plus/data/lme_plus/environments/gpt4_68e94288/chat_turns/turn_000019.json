However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some events may be held virtually. \n\nThe program's website lists upcoming events on their homepage: https://responsible-robotics.org/. You can also sign up for their mailing list to receive announcements about upcoming events. \n\nAdditionally, some past speaker series events and panel discussions are available to watch online on the program's YouTube channel. You can access the channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJnP_y1n2GKZB9OW5vN8fJQ\n\nI hope this helps, and that you enjoy exploring the speaker series events at the Robotics, Ethics, and Society program at CMU!",
