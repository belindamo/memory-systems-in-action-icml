Here are some recommendations for gentle cleansers that you can use with your new moisturizer:\n\n**1. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser:** A classic, fragrance-free, and non-comedogenic cleanser that's suitable for all skin types.\n**2. Neutrogena Hydrating Facial Cleanser:** A gentle, non-foaming cleanser that cleans and moisturizes the skin without stripping it of its natural oils.\n**3. La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid Face Wash:** A lightweight, oil-free cleanser that's perfect for sensitive skin and gentle enough for daily use.\n**4. Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant:** A gentle, daily exfoliating cleanser that removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritating the skin.\n**5. CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser:** A gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser that effectively removes dirt and impurities while maintaining the skin's natural barrier.\n\nWhen choosing a cleanser, consider your skin type and concerns:\n\n* If you have dry or sensitive skin, look for a fragrance-free, gentle, and non-comedogenic cleanser.\n* If you have oily skin, look for a lightweight, oil-free cleanser that won't clog pores.\n* If you have combination skin, look for a balanced cleanser that's gentle and effective.\n\nRemember, always read the ingredient list and patch test a new cleanser on a small area of your skin before using it on your face.\n\nI hope this helps you find a great gentle cleanser to pair with your new moisturizer!",
