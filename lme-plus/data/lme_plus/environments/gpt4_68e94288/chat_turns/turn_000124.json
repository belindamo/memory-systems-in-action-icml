As for me, I'm a big fan of their lasagna, so I'll probably stick with that. It's always a comforting and satisfying option.\n\nBut anyway, back to my admin day tasks... I'm thinking of also using some of my admin day to plan out my meal prep for the week. I've been trying to meal prep on Sundays, and it's been really helpful in saving time during the week. Do you have any tips on meal prep or planning?",
