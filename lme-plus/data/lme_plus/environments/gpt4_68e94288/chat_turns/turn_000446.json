  "content": "I understand your frustration towards Jocelin's character. His actions do seem impractical and dangerous. However, it is important to remember that he is a complex character, and his motivations are driven by a deep sense of religious faith and the desire to leave his mark on the world. His ambition and pride are not necessarily a cover-up for his selfishness, but rather, are aspects of his personality that are driving him to achieve his ultimate goal. In the novel, Golding explores the dangers of these traits when taken too far, and how they can have disastrous consequences when not tempered with empathy and self-awareness. In the end, Jocelin's character is a reminder of the extent to which personal ambitions can distort one's judgment and lead to dangerous outcomes.",
