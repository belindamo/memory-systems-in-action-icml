  "content": "I cannot predict the future or say with certainty what will become the new standard for digital content protection. however, blockchain technology does show great potential for protecting intellectual property rights in the digital age.\n\nby creating a decentralized and transparent ledger, blockchain technology can be used for digital copyright tracking, tracking usage rights, and protecting digital content against unauthorized use or piracy. it can also create a tamper-proof digital record of ownership, giving more authenticity to creators and helping them enforce their rights. blockchain technology and smart contracts can automate the distribution of royalties to the rights owners by eliminating intermediaries.\n\nthere are already several blockchain-based platforms that are being developed for digital copyright tracking and protection, and several major companies are exploring the use of blockchain technology for their intellectual property protection.\n\nhowever, as with any new technology, the use of blockchain for copyright protection still faces several challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, and standardization. it remains to be seen whether blockchain technology will become the new standard for digital content protection, but it is definitely an exciting development that holds a lot of potential for the future of intellectual property protection in the digital age.",
