However, it's important to remember that finding the right person can be a journey, and it doesn't need to be tied to a strict timeline. It's also important to take care of yourself, enjoy your hobbies and interests, and cultivate a supportive social network.\n\nRemember that there are many ways to find happiness and fulfillment in life beyond romantic relationships. Focus on building a fulfilling life for yourself, and if the right person comes along, then that can be a wonderful bonus.\n\nIf you continue to feel stuck, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist or professional counselor who can provide guidance and support.",
