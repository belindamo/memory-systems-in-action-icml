It supports a wide range of formats, including EPUB, MOBI, AZW, and PDF. Calibre allows you to organize your books by author, title, genre, series, and more. It also has features like automatic metadata downloads, cover art management, and conversion tools.\n2. **LibraryThing**: LibraryThing is a popular online platform for cataloging and managing your book collection. You can add books by ISBN, title, or author, and it will fetch metadata and cover art automatically. It also has features like tagging, rating, and reviews. LibraryThing offers a free account option, as well as a premium subscription for additional features.\n3. **Shelfari** (now part of Goodreads): Shelfari is a social networking site for book lovers, but it also has a robust e-book management system. You can add books, rate, review, and categorize them. Shelfari syncs with Goodreads, so if you're already a Goodreads user, you can access your library across both platforms.\n4. **BookNerd**: BookNerd is a user-friendly e-book management software for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

BookNerd allows you to organize your books by author, title, genre, and series, and it also has features like automatic metadata downloads and cover art management.\n5. **Kobo Book Management**: If you have a Kobo eReader or use the Kobo app, their book management software is a great option. It allows you to organize your books, sync them across devices, and even borrow eBooks from your local library.\n\nAll of these options have their strengths and weaknesses, so you might want to explore each one to see which one fits your needs best. Some popular features to consider when choosing an e-book management software include:\n\n* Format support (EPUB, MOBI, AZW, PDF, etc.)\n* Automatic metadata downloads and cover art management\n* Customizable categorization and tagging options\n* Syncing capabilities across devices\n* Conversion tools (if you need to convert between formats)\n* Integration with online bookstores or libraries\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect e-book management software for your digital book collection!",
