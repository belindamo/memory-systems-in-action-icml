  "content": "I'm so excited to start making my own skincare products! I've been thinking about switching to more eco-friendly and sustainable options, and DIY skincare seems like a great way to do that. I've been using La Mer and Drunk Elephant products, which are great for my skin, but I'm concerned about the environmental impact of all the packaging waste. Can you recommend some good resources for finding natural ingredients and supplies for DIY skincare?",
