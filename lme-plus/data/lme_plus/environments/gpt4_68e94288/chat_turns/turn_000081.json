  "content": "I live in a roughly 1,200 sq ft apartment with 3 bedrooms. Currently, I have a weak signal in my bedroom and home office. My router is about 2 years old, and I have around 10-12 devices connected to my network, including my TV, laptop, and smart speaker. I'm open to different brands, but I'm leaning towards the Google Wifi system due to its ease of setup and integration with my existing Google ecosystem.",
