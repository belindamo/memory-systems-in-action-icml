If you're looking for a pair of sandals that will last for several summers, Tevas might be a good investment.\n2. **Comfort**: Tevas are often praised for their comfort and support. If you plan on wearing them frequently or for extended periods, the comfort factor might be worth the splurge.\n3. **Style and versatility**: Do you like the style of the Tevas you're eyeing? Will they go with multiple outfits and occasions? If you think you'll wear them frequently and they'll become a staple in your summer wardrobe, the cost might be justified.\n4. **Alternative options**: Have you looked at other brands or options in a similar price range?
