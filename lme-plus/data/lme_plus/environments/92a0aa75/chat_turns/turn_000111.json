  "content": "A creative coder with a Master of Design degree who is interested in adding therapy to their work may consider pursuing a degree or certification in art therapy or expressive arts therapy.\n\nHere are some options to consider:\n\n1. Art Therapy: A Master of Design degree can provide a strong foundation in the visual arts, and an additional degree or certification in art therapy can help the individual learn the clinical skills necessary to practice as an art therapist. The American Art Therapy Association (AATA) offers a list of accredited graduate programs in art therapy, which typically require a minimum of 2 years of coursework and clinical experience.\n2. Expressive Arts Therapy: Another option for a creative coder with a Master of Design degree is to pursue a degree or certification in expressive arts therapy. Expressive arts therapy incorporates multiple art forms, such as visual arts, music, movement, and drama, to facilitate emotional expression and healing. The International Expressive Arts Therapy Association (IEATA) offers certification programs in expressive arts therapy, which typically require completion of a graduate-level program in a related field, such as art, psychology, or counseling.\n3. Recreational Therapy: A Master of Design degree can also provide a foundation for a career in recreational therapy. Recreational therapists use leisure activities, such as sports, arts and crafts, and games, to promote physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being. To become a certified recreational therapist, individuals typically need a bachelor's or master's degree in recreational therapy or a related field, as well as clinical experience and certification from the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC).\n\nOverall, individuals with a Master of Design degree can explore various degree and certification options to add therapy to their work. Art therapy, expressive arts therapy, and recreational therapy are all viable options, and each offers a unique approach to therapy that can be tailored to the individual's strengths and interests.",
