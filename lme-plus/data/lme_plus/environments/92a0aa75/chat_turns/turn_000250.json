  "content": "In circular knitting, a roll refers to a cylindrical roll of finished fabric that has been taken off the machine using the take-down system. The roll of fabric is wound onto a spindle and can be easily transported, stored, and processed for further finishing steps such as cutting, sewing, and dyeing. The size and weight of the roll will depend on the gauge of the machine and the type of fabric being produced. The use of rolls in circular knitting helps to increase efficiency and minimize waste, as the fabric can be unwound from the roll as needed.",
