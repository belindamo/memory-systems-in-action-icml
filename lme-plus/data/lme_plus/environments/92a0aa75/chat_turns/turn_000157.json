  "content": "I'm excited to help you discover new music and refresh your playlist! Five weeks is a great milestone to shake things up and explore new sounds. I'd be happy to recommend some indie rock and alternative artists and songs that might strike a chord with you.\n\nBefore I dive into suggestions, could you give me a hint about your current playlist? What kind of vibe are you into? Are you more into:\n\n1. Mellow, laid-back indie rock (e.g., Arctic Monkeys, The 1975)?\n2. High-energy, guitar-driven alternative (e.g., Foo Fighters, Royal Blood)?\n3. Quirky, indie-pop infused with electronic elements (e.g., Tame Impala, MGMT)?\n4. Moody, atmospheric soundscapes (e.g., The National, Interpol)?\n5. Something else entirely?\n\nAlso, are there any specific moods or emotions you'd like your new music to evoke? Do you want something to energize your commute, or perhaps something more relaxing?\n\nLet me know, and I'll curate a list of fresh recommendations tailored to your tastes!",
