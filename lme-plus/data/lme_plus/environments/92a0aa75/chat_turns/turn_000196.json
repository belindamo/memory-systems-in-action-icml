I'm here to help and provide information, so feel free to ask me anything.\n\nYou're absolutely right, though. The trade tensions have created significant challenges for companies in the AI sector, and NVIDIA and Alphabet (Google) are no exception. Diversifying revenue streams, optimizing supply chains, forming partnerships, and investing in research and development are all important strategies for navigating these challenges.\n\nIt's also important for investors to take a long-term view and consider the potential risks and opportunities presented by the trade war.
