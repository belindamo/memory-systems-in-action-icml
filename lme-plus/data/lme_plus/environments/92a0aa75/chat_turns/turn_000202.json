Now, let's talk about making your design more durable and long-lasting.\n\nWhen combining decoupage and painting on a mug, it's essential to ensure that the design can withstand regular use. Here are some tips to help you achieve a durable and long-lasting design:\n\n**Decoupage:**\n\n1. **Choose the right decoupage medium:** Look for a decoupage medium specifically designed for ceramics or glass, such as Mod Podge Dishwasher Safe or varnish. These products are formulated to withstand heat, water, and detergents.\n2. **Apply thin coats:** Apply multiple thin coats of decoupage medium, allowing each coat to dry completely before adding the next. This will help prevent the medium from pooling or becoming too thick.\n3. **Seal the edges:** Make sure to apply a thin layer of decoupage medium around the edges of the design to seal them and prevent peeling.\n\n**Painting:**\n\n1. **Use ceramic paint:** Choose acrylic or enamel paint specifically designed for ceramics or glass. These paints are formulated to adhere well to ceramic surfaces and withstand heat and water.\n2. **Apply thin coats:** Just like with decoupage, apply thin coats of paint, allowing each coat to dry completely before adding the next.\n3. **Bake the mug:** If you're using ceramic paint, bake the mug in a preheated oven at 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) for 20-30 minutes to set the paint. This will help the paint adhere better and make it more durable.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use a primer:** Apply a coat of gesso or a ceramic primer to the mug before decoupaging or painting. This will help create a smooth surface and improve adhesion.\n2. **Avoid using regular paper:** When decoupaging, use paper specifically designed for decoupage or print your design on a ceramic-friendly paper. Regular paper may not be suitable for ceramics and may not last long.\n3. **Handle with care:** While the design should be durable, it's still important to handle the mug with care. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrubbers, as they can scratch the design.\n4. **Test the design:** Before giving the mug as a gift, test the design by washing it by hand with mild soap and water. This will help ensure that the design is durable and long-lasting.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to create a beautiful, durable, and long-lasting design on your mug. Good luck, and I hope your sister loves the final product!",
