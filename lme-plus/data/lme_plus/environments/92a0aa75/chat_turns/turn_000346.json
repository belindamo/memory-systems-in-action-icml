  "content": "I'm thinking of visiting the city about 2 hours away from where I live. Budget-wise, I'm looking to spend around $150-200 per night for a hotel. I'm open to trying different types of cuisine, but something casual and affordable would be great. As for amenities, a hotel with free parking and a gym would be ideal. I'm planning to spend 3-4 days in the city.",
