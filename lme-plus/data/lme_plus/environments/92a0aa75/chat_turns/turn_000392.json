Since you're new to meditation, it might be helpful to start with a gentle commitment, like 3-4 times a week, and then adjust as needed.\n\nAs you explore Headspace and Calm, remember to focus on finding a meditation style that resonates with you. Both apps offer guided meditations, but they have different approaches and tones. You might find that one app's approach works better for you than the other.\n\nAlso, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance on developing a meditation practice. I'm here to help you on your mindfulness journey!",
