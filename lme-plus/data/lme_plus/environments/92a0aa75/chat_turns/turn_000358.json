I've been thinking about my 3 years and 9 months experience in the company and I've realized that I've built a strong understanding of our target audience. I think I can leverage that to identify the right influencers and create a successful UGC campaign. Can you provide more information on how to measure the success of these campaigns and what kind of budget I should allocate for them?",
