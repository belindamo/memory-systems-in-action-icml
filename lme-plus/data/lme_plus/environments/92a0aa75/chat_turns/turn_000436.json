  "content": "To access a remote system without its IP address, you will need to use a naming system that can map the computer name to an IP address. The most common naming system used for this purpose is DNS (Domain Name System), which is used to translate domain names (such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) to IP addresses.\n\nTo access a remote system without its IP address using DNS, you will need to ensure that the remote system is registered in a DNS server and that you have access to the DNS server. Here are the general steps you can follow:\n\n1. Determine the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote system. This is the computer name followed by the domain name (such as computername.example.com).\n2. Ensure that the remote system is registered in a DNS server. This can be done manually by adding a DNS record for the remote system in the DNS server, or automatically by configuring the remote system to register itself in DNS.\n3. Ensure that your local system is configured to use the DNS server that contains the DNS record for the remote system. This can be done by configuring the DNS settings in your network connection settings.\n4. Once your local system is configured to use the correct DNS server, you can access the remote system using its FQDN instead of its IP address. For example, if the FQDN of the remote system is computername.example.com, you can access it using commands such as \"ping computername.example.com\" or \"nslookup computername.example.com\".\n\nNote that the specific steps for configuring DNS will depend on your specific environment and configuration.",
