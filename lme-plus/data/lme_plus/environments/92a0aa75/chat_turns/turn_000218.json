  "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have feelings or opinions, but I understand your concern. Many people feel this way about the collection and use of their personal data by companies. The use of personal data without the explicit consent of individuals can be a violation of privacy and can make people feel like they have lost control over their own data.\n\nOne way to take back control of your data is to become more aware of your privacy settings on the apps and websites you use. Some apps and websites offer options to limit the data they collect and allow you to adjust privacy settings to restrict access to your personal information. It's also important to be mindful of the information you share online and to only provide what is necessary. Finally, staying informed about policies and regulations regarding data privacy can help hold companies accountable for their data practices.",
