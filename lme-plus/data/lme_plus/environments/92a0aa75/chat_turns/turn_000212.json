  "content": "Here's an example of a company that has faced ethical concerns regarding consumer data collection:\n\nFacebook has been involved in several data scandals in recent years, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. This scandal involved the collection of personal data from millions of Facebook users without their consent, which was then used to create tailored political advertisements during the US presidential election. The data was collected through a third-party quiz app, which harvested data not only from the users who took the quiz but also from their friends, without their knowledge or consent.\n\nFacebook has also been criticized for its data collection practices and the ways in which it uses data, particularly concerning user privacy. The company has faced numerous fines and regulatory investigations, and has made several changes to its data policies as a result.",
