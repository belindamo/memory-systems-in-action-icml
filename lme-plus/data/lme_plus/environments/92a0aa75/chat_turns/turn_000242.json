  "content": "The stitch dial and cam system in a circular knitting machine are components that control the knit and purl patterns in the fabric. The stitch dial, which is typically a circular disc, determines the type of stitch that is produced. The cam system, which consists of cams and levers, control the movement of the needles to produce the desired stitch pattern. The combination of the stitch dial and cam system allows for a wide range of stitch patterns and textures to be created, such as ribbing, cable knit, and seed stitch, among others.",
