They are often used in sound meditation to create a sense of expansiveness and release.\n\n3.

They can be used in sound meditation to create a sense of subtle movement and transition.\n\n4. Flutes and Didgeridoos: These are wind instruments that produce a deep, resonant sound. They are often used in sound meditation to create a sense of grounding and connection to the natural world.\n\n5.
