  "content": "I'm excited to try making my own protein balls. I've been using peanut butter banana overnight oats as my go-to breakfast for the past month, so I think the peanut butter flavor will be a great fit. Speaking of flavors, I've been loving the spicy kick from the Korean BBQ flavored potato chips I've been having with my lunch almost every day for the past week. Do you have any recommendations for other spicy snacks that I might enjoy?",
