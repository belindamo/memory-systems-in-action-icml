  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or experiences. However, sound meditation can be done at home, and it can also be helpful to attend a group or professional session. Meditating at home can be convenient, cost-effective, and flexible, allowing you to personalize your experience. You can create a peaceful and comfortable space, play music or sounds that soothe you, and practice sound meditation techniques that resonate with you. On the other hand, attending a group or professional session can provide opportunities for deeper relaxation, guidance, and community support. The facilitator can offer personalized recommendations, create a safe and sacred space, and help you navigate any challenges that arise during the practice. Ultimately, the choice to practice sound meditation at home or in a group or professional setting depends on your preferences, goals, and circumstances.",
