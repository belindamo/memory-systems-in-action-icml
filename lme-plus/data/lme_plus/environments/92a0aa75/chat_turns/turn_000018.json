Who is the target audience for this cold email campaign?\n4. What is the main goal of the campaign (e.g., lead generation, promoting a sale, etc.)?\n5. What type of output are you hoping to achieve (e.g., open rates, click-through rates, conversions, etc.)?\n6. Do you have any ideas or specific messages you would like to convey in the cold email?\n\nOnce I have this information, I'll be able to create cold emails in the style of Alex Berman that are not only creative and attention-grabbing but also straight to the point and focused on maximizing reply rates. Here are two examples for each prompt:\n\n1. Who is the client?\n\nVariation 1:\nSubject: Help Us Expand Your Business Online\n\nHi [Client],\n\nI came across your business online and noticed that you have a strong presence in your local area.
