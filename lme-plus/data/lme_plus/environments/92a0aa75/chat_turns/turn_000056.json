  "content": "Iowa does not have a National Park. The closest National Park to Iowa is the National Park of America Samoa, which is located thousands of miles away in the South Pacific Ocean. However, there are several state parks in Iowa that offer activities for children such as hiking, camping, fishing, and educational programs. Some examples include Maquoketa Caves State Park, Ledges State Park, and Backbone State Park. These parks have playgrounds, picnic areas, and nature centers that are perfect for family outings.",
