We're planning to roll out a series of targeted campaigns to generate buzz and drive leads. I'm responsible for creating the marketing materials, including email campaigns, social media content, and sales enablement tools, while Tom is working on developing the sales playbook and training the sales team on the new product.\n\nWe're also exploring ways to measure the success of our campaigns and track key metrics, such as lead generation, conversion rates, and customer acquisition costs. Tom and I meet bi-weekly to discuss progress, share feedback, and make adjustments to our strategy as needed. It's a collaborative effort, and I'm excited to see the results of our hard work!",
