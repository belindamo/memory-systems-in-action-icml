  "content": "Stir-fries are a great option for meal prep, and a good marinade can make all the difference in flavor and tenderness. Here are a few marinade suggestions for chicken that would pair well with a stir-fry:\n\n1. **Soy Sauce and Ginger**: Mix 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1-inch piece of grated ginger, and 1 tablespoon honey. This marinade is a classic Asian-inspired flavor combination that pairs well with stir-fried veggies.\n2. **Korean-Style Gochujang**: Combine 1/2 cup gochujang (Korean chili paste), 1/4 cup soy sauce, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon rice vinegar. This marinade has a sweet, spicy, and savory flavor profile that's perfect for a Korean-inspired stir-fry.\n3. **Lime and Cilantro**: Mix 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon ground cumin. This marinade is bright, citrusy, and herby, making it a great match for a colorful stir-fry with bell peppers, onions, and snow peas.\n4. **Simple Sesame**: Combine 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon honey. This marinade has a nutty, slightly sweet flavor that complements the nutty flavor of sesame oil.\n\nFor each marinade, place the chicken breast or thighs in a ziplock bag or a shallow dish, pour the marinade over the chicken, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n\nSome general tips for marinating chicken:\n\n* Always marinate in the refrigerator, not at room temperature, to prevent bacterial growth.\n* Acidic ingredients like citrus juice or vinegar help break down the proteins and tenderize the chicken.\n* Don't over-marinate, as this can make the chicken mushy or develop off-flavors.\n* Always pat the chicken dry with paper towels before cooking to remove excess moisture and promote browning.\n\nFeel free to experiment with these marinades or combine them to create your own flavor profile. Enjoy your stir-fry!",
