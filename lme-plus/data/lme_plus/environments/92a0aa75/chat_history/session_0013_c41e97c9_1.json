I'm happy to help you with that.\n\nFirst, kudos to you for recognizing the importance of reapplying sunscreen frequently, especially during peak sun hours.

Pressing them between book pages is a great way to keep them flat and dry. You can also use them to create beautiful fall-themed crafts or decorations.\n\nNow, about that pumpkin pie... Making a pie crust from scratch can be a bit intimidating, but with some tips and tricks, you'll be a pro in no time!\n\n**Tips for Cooking a Pie Crust from Scratch:**\n\n1. **Use cold ingredients:** Cold butter, cold water, and cold flour are essential for creating a flaky, tender crust.\n2. **Don't overmix:** Mix the dough just until the ingredients come together in a ball. Overmixing can lead to a tough crust.\n3. **Use the right ratio:** Aim for a 3:2:1 ratio of flour to fat (butter or shortening) to water.\n4. **Chill the dough:** Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll out.\n5. **Roll it out gently:** Roll the dough out to the desired thickness (about 1/8 inch) and use a light touch to avoid developing the gluten.\n6. **Don't overbake:** Bake the crust until it's lightly golden, about 15-20 minutes for a single-crust pie.\n7. **Use a pie shield or weights:** To prevent the crust from shrinking or burning, use a pie shield or fill the pie crust with pie weights or dried beans.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Use a food processor:** A food processor can help you mix and cut the butter into the flour more efficiently.\n2. **Don't overwork the dough:** If the dough becomes too warm or sticky, refrigerate it for a few minutes to firm it up.\n3. **Make ahead:** You can make the pie crust dough ahead of time and store it in the fridge for up to 2 days or freeze it for up to 2 months.\n\nI hope these tips help you create a delicious, flaky pie crust for your pumpkin pie! Do you have a favorite pumpkin pie recipe or any special spices you like to add?"
