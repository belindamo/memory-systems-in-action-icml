  "content": "I apologize for the confusion earlier!\n\nRegarding Levitate Music and Arts Festival, parking can be a bit of a challenge, but the festival organizers have a plan in place to make it as smooth as possible. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Parking Options:**\n\n1. **On-Site Parking:** There is limited on-site parking available at the festival grounds, but it's mostly reserved for VIP ticket holders and those with mobility issues. If you're not eligible for on-site parking, don't worry \u2013 there are other options!\n2. **Off-Site Parking:** The festival offers off-site parking at nearby locations, with shuttle buses running continuously throughout the day. The off-site parking lots are located about 1-2 miles from the festival grounds, and the shuttle ride takes around 10-15 minutes. You can purchase off-site parking passes in advance through the festival's website.\n3. **Ride-Sharing and Drop-Off:** If you're using a ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft, there's a designated drop-off area near the festival entrance. You can also get dropped off by a friend or family member.\n4. **Carpooling:** Encourage your friends to carpool with you! Not only is it more environmentally friendly, but you'll also reduce the number of cars on the road. Plus, carpoolers might get priority parking or other perks (check the festival's website for details).\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Plan ahead and arrive early to account for parking and shuttle times.\n* Consider carpooling or using ride-sharing services to reduce traffic and parking congestion.\n* Be prepared for some walking, as the off-site parking lots may be a short distance from the festival entrance.\n* Follow the festival's social media accounts and website for updates on parking and traffic conditions.\n\nKeep in mind that parking options and availability may change from year to year, so be sure to check the festival's website for the most up-to-date information.",
