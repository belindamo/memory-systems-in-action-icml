Here it is:\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\nStress and Back Pain\nFrom Chris\n\nThe day I sat down to edit this chapter for the last time, there was an obituary in the New York Times for John E. Sarno, MD, who \u201cwrote the book\u201d (Healing Back Pain) on what he claimed (without support, I\u2019m afraid) were the psychological origins of back pain. As the Times put it, he was \u201crevered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack.\u201d That is still roughly the state of his reputation today: some people believe him, some don\u2019t.\n\nWhat he said was that many (most?) cases of chronic back pain were caused by repressed anger. That\u2019s right: anger. You were angry at your boss, your spouse, your kids, or yourself, and you couldn\u2019t admit it to yourself. So you bottled it up and the stress of that repressed anger somehow \u201csuffocated\u201d your oxygen-starved back muscles, and your back \u201cwent out.\u201d The solution was to admit the anger and other \u201crepressed feelings,\u201d forgive the people involved (including yourself), and try to \u201cexpress\u201d the feelings more openly.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you find that plausible?\n\nI have no idea. It\u2019s a fascinating idea, and the testimonials on Sarno\u2019s web site are, well, impressive. But then, so are the testimonials on the web sites of other self-help gurus. I do know that a very wise person (a man who has helped me with many of my personal demons over the years) has long believed that a good deal of back pain is psychologically induced. And I have also read that back pain is one of the leading causes of doctor visits in the United States, and that many (most?) of the expensive back operations and other treatments have no long-lasting benefit.\n\nSo here is my contribution to the debate. I have an old friend, a retired psychoanalyst, who tells me that one of his patients was a man who had had multiple back operations, and his back still hurt all the time. So the analyst asked him to try this: every time he felt back pain coming on, he was to write down what he was thinking and feeling at that moment. After a few weeks of this, the patient came back to the analyst and said: \u201cYou know what? My back doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d\n\nCan this be true? I have no idea. But it is worth noting that the biofeedback folks, who are not given to frivolous claims, use \u201cstress management\u201d techniques to alleviate back pain. And there is a ton of literature on the close relationship between stress and back pain.\n\nIt is certainly true that stress affects us all in many ways. Stress causes or exacerbates heart disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cancer, infections, and a host of other maladies. But the relationship between stress and pain is not always easy to understand. I personally have found that back pain is a great stress barometer. If I am upset about something (which is most of the time, unfortunately), my back muscles tense up and, sometimes, spasm. Conversely, when I am \u201crelaxed,\u201d my back feels fine. I\u2019m sure this is true of many people.\n\nIt is also true that the stress-related symptoms of back pain can be treated. It seems to me that, at a minimum, we can avoid making our back pain worse by avoiding stress as much as possible (duh), meditating or doing something similar (yoga is wonderful for this), and focusing hard on the moment.
