  "content": "Yes, you can definitely meal prep this salad for the week ahead. It's a great option for a quick lunch or dinner on busy weekdays. To do this, simply store the salad in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4-5 days. It's important to keep the sliced avocado and almonds separate from the rest of the salad until you're ready to eat so they don't get mushy. When you're ready to enjoy your salad, just mix in the avocado and almonds to add some extra flavor and crunch. Enjoy!",
