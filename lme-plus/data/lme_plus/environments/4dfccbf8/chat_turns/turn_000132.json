  "content": "Hilton has several properties in Manhattan, and I'd be happy to recommend a few options that are within walking distance to Times Square.\n\nHere are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Hilton Times Square**: This hotel is literally right in the heart of Times Square, with many rooms offering views of the bustling square. It's a modern hotel with comfortable rooms and a rooftop bar with great views.\n2. **Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central**: This hotel is just a block away from Times Square and offers a more affordable option while still being in the thick of things. It's a great value for the price, and the staff is known for being friendly and helpful.\n3. **DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New York Times Square West**: This hotel is a bit farther west than the other two options, but still within a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square. It's a great choice if you want to be close to the action but also want a slightly more laid-back atmosphere.\n\nAll three of these hotels are well-reviewed and offer a comfortable stay. However, keep in mind that Times Square is a very busy area, so be prepared for crowds and noise.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more off the beaten path, you could also consider the **Hilton Midtown**, which is a larger hotel located a few blocks away from Times Square. It's still within walking distance, but offers a more tranquil atmosphere.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more information on any of these hotels!",
