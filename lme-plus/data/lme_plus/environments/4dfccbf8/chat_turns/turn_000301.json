It's been helpful, but I'm looking to upgrade to a more advanced system that can provide more detailed data and analysis. I've heard good things about AiM Sports and VBox Motorsport, but they seem quite expensive. Do you think it's worth investing in a high-end data logger, or would a more affordable option like a Garmin Catalyst be sufficient for a track enthusiast like myself?",
