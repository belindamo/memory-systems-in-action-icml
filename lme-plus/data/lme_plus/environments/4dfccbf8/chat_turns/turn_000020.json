  "content": "We definitely had some intense discussions about the Avengers, especially when it came to their motivations and actions. One of my friends was really critical of Tony Stark's decisions in Avengers: Age of Ultron, while another friend thought he was justified in creating Ultron. It was interesting to see how our opinions differed, and it made for some great conversations.\n\nAs for emotional moments, yeah, there were definitely some tears shed during Avengers: Endgame. The scene where Tony Stark says goodbye to his daughter was a real tear-jerker, and we were all getting a bit emotional during the final battle. It was a really powerful and satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga, and it felt like a culmination of everything we'd been watching over the past few days.\n\nSpeaking of conclusions, I was wondering if you had any recommendations for other movie franchises or series that have a similar scope and scale to the MCU? I'm looking for something to fill the void now that our marathon is over!",
