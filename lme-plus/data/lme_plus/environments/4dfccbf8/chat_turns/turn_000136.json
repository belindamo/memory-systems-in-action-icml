  "content": "Hilton hotels do offer breakfast options, but it depends on the specific property and your Hilton Honors loyalty program status.\n\n**Hilton Times Square**: They have a restaurant on site called Herb N' Kitchen, which serves breakfast, but it's not a free breakfast buffet. However, if you're a Hilton Honors Gold or Diamond member, you'll get a complimentary continental breakfast. If you're not a loyalty program member, you can purchase breakfast \u00e0 la carte or opt for a breakfast package when booking your room.\n\n**Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central**: This hotel offers a free breakfast buffet for all guests, which includes a variety of hot and cold items, including made-to-order omelets and waffles. It's a great perk, especially if you're looking to fuel up for a busy day in the city!\n\n**DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New York Times Square West**: Similar to the Hilton Times Square, they have a restaurant on site called the Hudson Yard Caf\u00e9, which serves breakfast, but it's not a free breakfast buffet. However, if you're a Hilton Honors Gold or Diamond member, you'll get a complimentary continental breakfast. If you're not a loyalty program member, you can purchase breakfast \u00e0 la carte or opt for a breakfast package when booking your room.\n\n**Hilton Midtown**: They have a restaurant on site called Herb N' Kitchen, which serves breakfast, but it's not a free breakfast buffet. However, if you're a Hilton Honors Gold or Diamond member, you'll get a complimentary continental breakfast. If you're not a loyalty program member, you can purchase breakfast \u00e0 la carte or opt for a breakfast package when booking your room.\n\nSo, if a free breakfast buffet is a top priority, the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central might be the way to go! However, if you're a Hilton Honors member or don't mind purchasing breakfast, the other options might still be a great fit.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
