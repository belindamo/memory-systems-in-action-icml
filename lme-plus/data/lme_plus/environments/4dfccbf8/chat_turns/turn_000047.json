I'm a fresh start every time you interact with me!\n\nRegarding your question, though, a mixed-methods approach can be a great way to triangulate your findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic. Combining survey data with social network analysis, as seen in the Burke et al. (2010) study, can help to:\n\n1. Validate survey responses with objective network data\n2. Identify patterns and relationships in social media interactions that may not be captured through self-reported data\n3. Provide a more nuanced understanding of how social media use is embedded in participants' social networks\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the following:\n\n1. Research questions: Are your research questions best addressed through a mixed-methods approach, or would a single method be more suitable?\n2. Data collection and integration: How will you collect and integrate the survey and social network data? Will you be using existing datasets or collecting new data?\n3. Analytical complexity: Mixed-methods approaches can add complexity to your analysis. Do you have the necessary skills and resources to handle the integration and analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data?\n4. Study design: Will you be using a concurrent or sequential design? How will you ensure the integration of the two methods is coherent and meaningful?\n\nUltimately, the decision to use a mixed-methods approach depends on your research goals, resources, and expertise. Take your time to carefully consider the pros and cons and discuss your ideas with your thesis committee or peers to get their input.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions or share your thoughts, and I'll do my best to help!",
