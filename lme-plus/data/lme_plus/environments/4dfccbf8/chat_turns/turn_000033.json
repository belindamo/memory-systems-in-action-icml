  "content": "The way animals see the world around them is influenced by several factors apart from color vision, including:\n\n1. Vision acuity: Vision acuity is the sharpness of vision, or the ability to distinguish two closely spaced objects. Some animals, like eagles and hawks, have better visual acuity than humans, allowing them to spot distant prey from great heights.\n\n2. Field of vision: Field of vision is the area within which an animal can see. Predators such as lions have a greater field of vision as their eyes are located in the front of the skull, allowing them to focus on their prey, while prey animals like horses have eyes located on the side of their heads giving them a wide field of vision but sacrificing depth perception.\n\n3. Night vision: Nocturnal animals, such as cats and owls, have larger pupils than humans, which lets in more light and helps them see better in low light conditions.\n\n4. Motion detection: Some animals, like birds and insects, can detect movement at great distances, allowing them to avoid potential predators or capture prey.\n\n5. Ultraviolet (UV) vision: Some animals, like bees, can see in the ultraviolet range, which helps them detect flowers that have patterns not visible to humans and detect markings on potential mates.\n\nThese factors interact to influence the way animals perceive the world around them, allowing them to adapt to their environments and survive in their natural habitats.",
