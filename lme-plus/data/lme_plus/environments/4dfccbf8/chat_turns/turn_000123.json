I'm happy to help you with that.\n\nOrganizing your vinyl records by genre can be a challenging task, especially when dealing with sub-genres and crossover artists. Here are some tips to help you categorize your classic rock albums and other records:\n\n**Genre Categories:**\n\n1. **Main Genre:** Start by categorizing your records into main genres, such as:\n\t* Rock\n\t* Pop\n\t* Jazz\n\t* Classical\n\t* Folk\n\t* etc.\n2. **Sub-Genres:** Within each main genre, create sub-genres to further categorize your records. For example:\n\t* Rock:\n\t\t+ Classic Rock\n\t\t+ Hard Rock\n\t\t+ Progressive Rock\n\t\t+ Punk Rock\n\t\t+ etc.\n\t* Pop:\n\t\t+ Soft Rock\n\t\t+ Power Pop\n\t\t+ New Wave\n\t\t+ etc.\n3. **Hybrid Genres:** Some records may fit into multiple genres or sub-genres. In this case, you can create hybrid categories, such as:\n\t* Rock/Folk\n\t* Jazz/Rock\n\t* Classical/Crossover\n\t* etc.\n\n**Categorizing Your Classic Rock Albums:**\n\n1. **Research and Reference:** Look up online resources, such as AllMusic, Wikipedia, or music blogs, to research the genres and sub-genres associated with each album.\n2. **Artist's Style:** Consider the artist's overall style and sound. For example, Led Zeppelin is often classified as Hard Rock, but they also have elements of Blues Rock and Folk Rock.\n3. **Album-Specific:** Focus on the specific album's sound and style. For example, Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" is often classified as Progressive Rock, while their earlier work may be more Psychedelic Rock.\n4. **Your Personal Interpretation:** Ultimately, categorize your records based on your personal interpretation of the music. If you feel a particular album fits into multiple genres, create a hybrid category or use a slash (/) to separate the genres (e.g., Hard Rock/Progressive Rock).\n\n**Tips for Organizing Your Records:**\n\n1. **Use Dividers:** Use dividers or separators to separate your records by genre or sub-genre.\n2. **Label Your Sections:** Label each section with the genre or sub-genre to make it easy to find specific records.\n3. **Keep It Flexible:** Be prepared to adjust your categorization system as you acquire new records or discover new genres.\n4. **Make it Fun:** Organizing your records should be an enjoyable process! Experiment with different categorization systems until you find one that works for you.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a logical and functional system for organizing your vinyl records by genre. Happy organizing!",
