  "content": "That sounds like an amazing experience! Having discussions and debates during the marathon must have added a whole new level of engagement and enjoyment to the event. It's great that you and your friends were all invested in the story and wanted to keep going, even though it was a massive undertaking.\n\nThose conversations and debates are a big part of what makes a movie marathon so special. You get to share your thoughts and reactions with others, and hear their perspectives, which can deepen your understanding and appreciation of the movies. It's fascinating to see how different people can interpret the same scene or character in different ways, and it's a great way to bond over your shared love of the MCU.\n\nI'm sure you must have had some lively discussions about the Avengers themselves, like who's the most powerful, who's the most heroic, or who's the most relatable. Did you find that anyone's opinions on the characters changed over the course of the marathon, or were there any surprising revelations or insights that came out of your discussions?\n\nAlso, were there any particularly memorable or emotional moments during the marathon? Were there any scenes or plot twists that caught you off guard, or did you find yourselves getting emotional during certain scenes (e.g., during Avengers: Endgame)?",
