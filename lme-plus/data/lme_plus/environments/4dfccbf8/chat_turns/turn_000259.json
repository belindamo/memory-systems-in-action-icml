  "content": "My family members are all adults, and we're interested in a mix of culture, history, and outdoor activities. We're thinking of a 10-14 day trip, and we're open to a moderate budget. We prefer milder weather, and we're okay with flying or taking trains between destinations. My parents are really keen on visiting Italy and Spain, while my siblings and I would love to explore Greece and Croatia.",
