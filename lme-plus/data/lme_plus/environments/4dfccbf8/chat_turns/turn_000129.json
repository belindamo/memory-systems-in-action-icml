  "content": "I'm planning a trip to New York City this summer and I'm considering staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Battery Park. I've heard great things about it, and the views of the Statue of Liberty are supposed to be amazing. I recently earned some points from my stay at the Hilton in downtown Chicago for a business conference three weeks ago, and I'm hoping to redeem them for a free night. Do you know how many points I need for a free night at the Ritz-Carlton?",
