You'll have a better chance to explore the State Apartments, Hall of Mirrors, and Royal Chapel without the hustle and bustle.\n2. **Late afternoon**: Visit the palace between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM, when the morning crowds have dissipated, and the afternoon visitors haven't yet arrived. This is a great time to explore the gardens, fountains, and Trianon Palaces.\n3. **Weekdays**: If possible, plan your visit on a weekday instead of a weekend, when Parisians and tourists often take day trips to Versailles. You'll encounter smaller crowds and a more relaxed atmosphere.\n4. **Avoid peak season**: If you can, plan your visit during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October), when the crowds are smaller compared to the peak summer months (June-August).\n5. **Consider a guided tour**: Join a guided tour that starts early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the crowds. These tours often have priority access, which means you'll skip the long lines.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Buy your tickets online in advance to avoid queuing at the ticket counter.\n* Take a stroll in the gardens before visiting the palace to enjoy the beautiful scenery and get a feel for the estate.\n* Wear comfortable shoes, as you'll be walking and standing for several hours.\n* Bring a picnic lunch or snacks to enjoy in the gardens, as the on-site restaurants can be crowded and pricey.\n* Don't forget to explore the Trianon Palaces, which are often less crowded than the main palace.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to make the most of your day trip to Versailles and enjoy a more relaxed, crowd-free experience.\n\nNow, go ahead and enjoy your extra legroom on the flight, and get ready for a fantastic day in Versailles!",
