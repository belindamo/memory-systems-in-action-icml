  "content": "No, animals do not see colors the same way we do as color vision is species-specific and varies depending on the number and types of cone cells in their eyes. For example, dogs have fewer cones than humans, which limits their ability to distinguish between colors. They have only two types of cones that are sensitive to yellow and blue colors, and they perceive other colors as shades of gray.\n\nIn contrast, birds and many fish have four types of cones, which allow them to perceive a wider range of colors.\n\nFurthermore, even among animals that have similar numbers of cones as humans, differences in the position and structure of the cones can affect the way they perceive colors.\n\nTherefore, the way animals perceive colors is specific to their species and is adapted to their habitat and lifestyle.",
