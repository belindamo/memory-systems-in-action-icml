I'd like to improve my driving skills and habits, both on the track and on the road. The Garmin Catalyst seems like a good compromise, as it can provide some insights into my daily driving habits while still being focused on track driving. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons and decide whether the additional features of a high-end system are worth the extra cost.\n\nBy the way, I've been thinking about my suspension upgrade, and I'm leaning towards the Tein Flex Z coilovers. I've heard good things about their adjustability and durability. Do you think they'd be a good choice for my 2018 Honda Civic Si, given my track day and daily driving habits?",
