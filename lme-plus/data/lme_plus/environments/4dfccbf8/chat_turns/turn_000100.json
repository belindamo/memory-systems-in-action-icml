  "content": "Thank you for the feedback. Here's the revised section:\n\n\"No problem. Just be back by six,\" she said, returning her attention to the papers on her desk.\n\nJack nodded and made his way into the exhibit halls, where he was greeted by the familiar sights and sounds of the museum. He loved coming here after school \u2013 the quiet hush of the galleries, the smell of old wood and paper, and the feeling that he was surrounded by things that had survived centuries.\n\nAs he wandered through the halls, he passed by a friendly security guard and a few employees, some of whom knew his mother. He exchanged polite nods with them but didn't stop to chat. His mind was elsewhere, lost in memories of visits to the museum with his parents when he was much younger.\n\nHe remembered how excited his dad had been to show him and his mom around the exhibits, how he would explain the stories behind the artifacts in a booming voice that echoed through the halls. His mom had been quieter, but she had pointed out interesting details and asked questions that sparked his curiosity. Those were happier times, before his dad got sick and everything changed.\n\nJack pushed the memories aside and focused on the present, stopping here and there to take in the displays. He marveled at the intricate carvings on a medieval suit of armor, and he admired the lifelike paintings of landscapes and people. He paused in front of a giant sculpture of a Greek god, taking in the way the marble seemed to ripple like water under the chisel marks.\n\nA few visitors bustled past him, chattering in French or Japanese, but he didn't pay them much attention. He was lost in his own world, exploring the museum's secrets and wondering what stories lay behind each artifact.",
