  "content": "**Classic Aviator vs. Trendy Cat-Eye:**\n\nBoth styles can look great with a cognac handbag, but it ultimately depends on your personal taste and face shape.\n\n* **Aviator:** A classic aviator style is a timeless choice that will never go out of fashion. It's a great option if you want a versatile pair that will complement your handbag without drawing too much attention. Aviators tend to suit most face shapes, especially oval, square, and heart-shaped faces.\n* **Cat-Eye:** A cat-eye style is a great choice if you want to add some sass and glamour to your look. It's a trendy option that can add a touch of sophistication to your outfit. Cat-eyes tend to suit round, oval, and heart-shaped faces.\n\nConsider your personal style, face shape, and the occasion you'll be wearing the sunglasses for. If you want a safe bet, go for the classic aviator. If you want to make a statement, try the trendy cat-eye.\n\n**ASOS Promo Codes and Sales:**\n\nASOS often has promotions and sales, so it's always a good idea to check their website for deals. Here are a few ways to find discounts:\n\n1. **Sign up for their newsletter:** ASOS frequently sends exclusive promo codes and sale notifications to their subscribers.\n2. **Check the ASOS website:** Look for a \"Deals\" or \"Sale\" section on their website, where they often feature discounted products.\n3. **Use a promo code aggregator:** Websites like RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, or VoucherCodes.co.uk aggregate promo codes and discounts for various retailers, including ASOS.\n4. **Follow ASOS on social media:** ASOS sometimes shares exclusive promo codes or flash sales on their social media channels.\n\nAs of our conversation, I couldn't find any specific promo codes or sales on ASOS's website. However, they often have deals on sunglasses, so keep an eye on their website or sign up for their newsletter to stay informed.\n\nRemember to filter your search by \"cognac\" or \"brown\" to find sunglasses that match your handbag. You can also use the \"Price: Low to High\" filter to find more affordable options. Happy shopping!",
