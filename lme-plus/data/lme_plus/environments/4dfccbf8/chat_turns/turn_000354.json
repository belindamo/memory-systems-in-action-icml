Here's a brief rundown to help you decide:\n\n**Polarized Lenses:**\n\n* **Reduce glare:** Polarized lenses are excellent for reducing glare from reflective surfaces like water, snow, or car windshields. They're perfect for outdoor activities like fishing, boating, or driving.\n* **Improve color perception:** Polarized lenses can enhance color vibrancy and contrast, making them ideal for outdoor enthusiasts who want to appreciate the scenery.\n* **Reduce eye strain:** By reducing glare, polarized lenses can minimize eye strain and fatigue.\n\n**Non-Polarized Lenses:**\n\n* **General use:** Non-polarized lenses are suitable for everyday use, including casual wear, walking, or running errands.\n* **Less expensive:** Non-polarized lenses are often less expensive than polarized lenses.\n* **Better for screen time:** Non-polarized lenses are a better choice if you plan to wear your sunglasses while looking at screens (e.g., phones, tablets, or computers), as polarized lenses can create a \"screen door\" effect.\n\nConsidering you're looking for sunglasses to match your cognac handbag, I'd recommend non-polarized lenses. Since you didn't mention any specific outdoor activities, non-polarized lenses should be sufficient for everyday use. However, if you plan to use your sunglasses for outdoor activities like driving, fishing, or boating, polarized lenses might be a better choice.\n\n**Other factors to consider:**\n\n* **Lens material:** ASOS offers sunglasses with lenses made from polycarbonate, acrylic, or Trivex materials. Polycarbonate lenses are lightweight and impact-resistant, while Trivex lenses are known for their clarity and durability.\n* **Lens tint:** Brown or cognac frames look great with brown, neutral, or gradient lens tints. You can also consider mirrored or anti-reflective coatings to reduce glare and improve visibility.\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of polarized vs. non-polarized lenses, you can make an informed decision. Remember to check the product description or reviews to see if the lenses are polarized or non-polarized. Happy shopping!",
