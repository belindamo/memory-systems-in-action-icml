Do some reading. \nTo get an idea how pervasive a concern about stress has become, consider the fact that Division I college football players in many schools devote twelve minutes a day to practicing meditation for stress relief, and they say it helps a lot. Meditation is all over the place. We gently submit that it is well worth it to almost all of us to take a look at stress in our lives. And for those of us with serious back pain, we should try to figure out if we are part of the small minority whose back pain is primarily emotionally based. \nOne more bit of isolated information. The great goal in stress management is to enhance your resilience: your ability to switch quickly from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system. And that lovely gift turns out to be trainable. I am sure you will be thrilled to learn that what you are doing is training your \u201cvagus nerve\u201d (a nerve in your brain that regulates this stuff). A \u201chigher vagal tone\u201d means you have \u201cgreater calm and resilience,\u201d and so on. Again, I\u2019m in no position to prescribe here, but I urge you to look at some of the many books on the subject. I will note that they often recommend a lot of slow breathing, which I used to think was stupid. Wrong again. It is apparently the case that doing breathing exercises\u2014and especially going slow on the exhale\u2014actually heightens your vagal tone. So does exercise. A few years ago, a heart doc said that I had \u201ca high vagal tone, common amongst serious athletes.\u201d Not quite high enough, apparently, to see me through this recent crisis. \nDoes all this stuff matter? Well, yeah. I have read that, by one measure, one person may be thirty times as resilient as another. Of course, my pathetic competitive juices started flowing: I wanted to be more resilient. I thought maybe it would not be so bad to be, say, thirty times as resilient as the other kids. Super-important for serious executives, hotsy-totsy litigators, and, maybe, you and me. \nListen\u2014big caveat: This is anything but a comprehensive and well-informed discussion. What I do hope is that there has been enough here to catch your interest and get some of you to dig further. Stress is very real indeed, dealing with it is trainable, and some level of stress-avoidance and mindfulness will help.",
