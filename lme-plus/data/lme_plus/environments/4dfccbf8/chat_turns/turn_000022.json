Now that I've finished my Marvel movie marathon, I think it's the perfect opportunity to start a new one!\n\nBy the way, have you seen any of the Star Wars movies? Do you have a favorite character or storyline in the saga? I'm completely new to the franchise, so I'd love any recommendations or tips for a beginner.",
