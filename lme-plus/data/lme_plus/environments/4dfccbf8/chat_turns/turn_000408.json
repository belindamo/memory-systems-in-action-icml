He can clean and condition the fretboard, as well as dress or replace frets if necessary.\n4. **Bridge and saddle**: Check the bridge and saddle for any signs of wear or damage. Joe can adjust or replace them if necessary to ensure proper string alignment and tone.\n5. **Intonation**: Ask Joe to check the intonation of your guitar to ensure that the strings are playing in tune all the way up the neck.\n6. **String height and spacing**: Make sure the strings are at a comfortable height and spacing for your playing style.\n7. **Electronics**: If your GS Mini has electronics, ask Joe to check the pickups, tone controls, and output jack to ensure everything is functioning properly.\n8. **Body and neck joints**: Inspect the body and neck joints for any signs of separation or cracks.
