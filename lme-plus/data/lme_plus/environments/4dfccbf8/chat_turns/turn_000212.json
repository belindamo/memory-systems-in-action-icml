Incorporating relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. 2. Use heat and cold therapy: Applying heat or cold to affected joints can help reduce pain and stiffness. Try using a warm compress or taking a warm bath for joint pain or a cold compress for swelling. 3. Get enough sleep: Getting enough sleep is important for reducing inflammation and promoting healing. It is recommended that adults get 7-9 hours of sleep per night. 4. Maintain a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein sources can help reduce inflammation and improve overall health. 5. Stay active: Regular exercise can help reduce joint pain and stiffness, improve flexibility, and promote overall health. Be sure to choose low-impact exercises that are gentle on the joints. Remember to talk to your doctor if your arthritis pain is severe or affecting your ability to perform daily activities.
