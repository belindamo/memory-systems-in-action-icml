  "content": "The Fresh Earth Token (FET) is a digital token that serves as the native currency of the Fresh Earth Ecosystem (FEE). It is built on the Hashgraph HTS (Hedera Hashgraph Token Service) platform and uses Guardian nodes from the Hedera network, providing a secure and efficient token form that can be easily integrated into the FEE. The FET serves several functions within the ecosystem, including as fractional ownership, a means of access, a medium of exchange, a governance tool, and a store of value. These functions are facilitated by its integration with the Hashgraph HTS platform and the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance structure. The FET is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the food ecosystem business. It is governed by a set of smart contracts and is controlled by token holders. The FET is structured as a utility token, with a finite supply that is determined by the ecosystem's needs and growth. The token is also designed to be divisible, which allows for fractional ownership and increased accessibility within the ecosystem.",
