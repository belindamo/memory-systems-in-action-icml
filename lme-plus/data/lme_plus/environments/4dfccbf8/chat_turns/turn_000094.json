  "content": "What Do You Meme sounds like a great choice! It's a fantastic party game that's easy to learn, and it's perfect for a light-hearted and casual game night. The gameplay is simple: players compete to create the funniest meme by combining caption cards with a random image. It's a great way to get everyone laughing and having a good time. I think it'll pair really well with Deception, as it's a nice change of pace from the more intense social deduction game.\n\nSince you're hosting the game night at your place, I'm sure your friends will appreciate the variety of games you're offering. You've got the more strategic Deception, and now you're adding a fun, light-hearted party game like What Do You Meme. It's a great combination that'll cater to different tastes and keep everyone entertained.\n\nIf you need any more recommendations or have any questions about What Do You Meme, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you and your friends",
