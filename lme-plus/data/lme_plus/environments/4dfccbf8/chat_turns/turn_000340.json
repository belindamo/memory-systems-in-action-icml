  "content": "Imagine Dragons at the Xfinity Center sounds like an incredible experience!\n\nConsidering your taste in music and the energetic vibe of the Imagine Dragons concert, Levitate Music and Arts Festival might not be the best fit for you. Levitate's lineup tends to lean more towards jam bands, indie rock, and folk music, which is quite different from Imagine Dragons' high-energy, arena-rock sound.\n\nThe atmosphere at Levitate is also more relaxed and laid-back, with a focus on art installations, yoga classes, and a generally chill vibe. While it's a great festival in its own right, it might not provide the same level of energy and excitement you experienced at the Imagine Dragons concert.\n\nIf you're looking for a festival that might be a better fit for your tastes, you might want to consider other options in the Northeast that feature more rock and pop-oriented lineups. Some examples include:\n\n1. **Panorama Music Festival** (New York City, NY) - July 22-24\n\t* This festival features a more diverse lineup, including rock, pop, and electronic music. The atmosphere is more fast-paced and energetic, with a focus on art installations and technology.\n2. **Boston Calling Music Festival** (Boston, MA) - May 27-29 (already happened this year, but keep an eye on next year's lineup)\n\t* This festival has a more eclectic lineup, with a mix of indie, rock, pop, and hip-hop acts. The atmosphere is lively, with a focus on food, drinks, and activities.\n\nKeep in mind that festival lineups and atmospheres can vary greatly, so it's always a good idea to research and explore different options to find the best fit for your tastes!",
