  "content": "Congratulations on your new Coach handbag! Cognac is a great color, and finding the perfect pair of sunglasses to match will really elevate your style.\n\nBoth Forever 21 and ASOS offer a wide range of affordable sunglasses, but I'd recommend checking out ASOS first for earthy tones. Here's why:\n\n1. **Wider selection**: ASOS has a more extensive collection of sunglasses in earthy tones, including cognac, tortoiseshell, and brown shades. They offer over 1,000 styles, so you're likely to find a pair that matches your handbag perfectly.\n2. **More filter options**: ASOS allows you to filter by color, price, brand, and style, making it easier to narrow down your search. You can even filter by \"earth tones\" or \"brown\" to see a curated selection of sunglasses that might match your Coach handbag.\n3. **Better quality control**: While both stores offer affordable options, ASOS is known for its quality control, which ensures that their sunglasses meet certain standards. This might be important if you're looking for a pair that will last longer.\n\nForever 21 is still a great option, but their selection might be more limited in terms of earthy tones. They do have a \"Natural\" or \"Brown\" filter option, but it might not be as extensive as ASOS'.\n\nBefore making a final decision, consider the following:\n\n* **Check the lens color**: Make sure the lens color complements your skin tone and personal style. If you have cool undertones, look for sunglasses with blue or purple undertones. If you have warm undertones, look for sunglasses with yellow or golden undertones.\n* **Think about the style**: Do you prefer classic and simple, or trendy and statement-making? ASOS has a wide range of styles, from minimalist to bold and flashy.\n* **Read reviews**: Check the reviews for each pair you're considering to get an idea of the quality, fit, and overall satisfaction from other customers.\n\nI'm glad to hear you're impressed with your Coach handbag! Enjoy your search for the perfect sunglasses to match!",
