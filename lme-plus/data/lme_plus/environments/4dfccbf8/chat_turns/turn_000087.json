  "content": "The original Ticket to Ride is a fantastic starting point, and I'm sure you'll have a blast playing it with your friends.\n\nWerewolf (also known as Mafia) is a classic social deduction game that's perfect for larger groups. It's a great addition to any game night, and it's easy to learn but challenging to master.\n\nHere's a quick rundown:\n\n**Number of players:** 7-15 players (although some variations can accommodate more)\n\n**Objective:** The game is divided into two teams: the Villagers and the Werewolves. The Villagers aim to eliminate all the Werewolves, while the Werewolves try to outnumber the Villagers.\n\n**Gameplay:** The game consists of two phases: Night and Day.\n\n1. **Night:** All players close their eyes. The moderator (or a designated player) asks the Werewolves to open their eyes and identify each other. The Werewolves then silently point to a Villager to attack.\n2. **Day:** All players wake up, and the moderator announces which Villager was attacked and killed during the Night. The remaining players then discuss and vote on a player to lynch, suspecting them of being a Werewolf.\n\nThe game continues until either all Werewolves are eliminated or the Werewolves outnumber the Villagers.\n\n**Roles:** In addition to the Villagers and Werewolves, some versions of the game include special roles, such as:\n\n* Seer: Can investigate a player's alignment (Villager or Werewolf) during the Night.\n* Bodyguard: Can protect a player from being killed during the Night.\n* Hunter: Can kill a player during the Day, in addition to the regular lynch.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Make sure to have a good moderator who can keep the game moving and maintain the atmosphere.\n* You can customize the game by adding or removing roles, adjusting the number of Werewolves, or introducing new mechanics.\n* Werewolf is a great game for larger groups, but it can be played with as few as 7 players.\n\nIf you're interested in trying Werewolf, I recommend starting with a smaller group (7-10 players) to get a feel for the game. As you become more comfortable, you can add more players and roles to increase the complexity and fun.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
