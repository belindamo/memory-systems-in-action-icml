This can help reduce garbage overflow and cut down on costs.\n\n2. Solar-Powered Toilets - Solar-powered toilets use renewable energy to power the toilet's flushing system and reduce the environmental impact of traditional toilets.\n\n3. UV-C Sanitation Devices - These devices use ultraviolet light to kill germs and pathogens on surfaces, including those found in public areas and in food establishments.\n\n4. Automated Public Toilets - These self-cleaning toilets can help improve hygiene and cleanliness as they are equipped with self-cleaning mechanisms and sensors that prevent misuse and vandalism.\n\n5. Waterless Urinals - Waterless urinals can help conserve water and save money on water bills. They also require less maintenance compared to conventional urinals.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the adoption of these technologies may depend on factors such as availability, affordability, and compatibility with existing infrastructure."
