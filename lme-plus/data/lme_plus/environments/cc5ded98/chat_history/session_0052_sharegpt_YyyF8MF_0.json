It is often used to describe something or someone that has exceeded or surpassed the boundaries or limitations of their respective field or category. For example, a work of art or a person's abilities that are considered to be \"out of this world\" or \"extraordinary\" would be described as \"\u6b21\u5143\u3092\u8d85\u8d8a\u3057\u305f\"."
