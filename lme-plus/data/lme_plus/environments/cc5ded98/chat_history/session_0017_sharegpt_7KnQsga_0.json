      "content": "JD-R theory refers to the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, which states that work stress and well-being are influenced by the interplay between job demands (i.e., challenging aspects of the job) and job resources (i.e., supportive factors that facilitate job performance).\n\nOrganizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, and norms that define an organization and influence its behavior.\n\nOrganizational behavior refers to the study of how individuals and groups behave within an organizational context.\n\nThe \"too much of a good thing\" effect refers to the idea that when job resources (i.e., good things) become too demanding, they can actually become negative stressors and lead to burnout.\n\nJustice in organizations refers to perceptions of fairness and equity in the workplace. It can include issues related to distributive justice (e.g., fair distribution of rewards and resources), procedural justice (e.g., fair procedures for making decisions), and interpersonal justice (e.g., respectful treatment of employees)."
