It's excellent that you're thinking about what you already have at home and what you need to pick up.\n\nIt's also fantastic that you remembered about the chicken breasts you bought last Saturday and used them to make chicken sandwiches yesterday. That's a great way to reduce food waste and make the most of your groceries.\n\nNow, let's build on that momentum. Take a few minutes to review what you have in your pantry, fridge, and freezer. You can even take a quick glance at your receipts from last Saturday's Walmart trip to refresh your memory.\n\nAs you plan your meals for the next few days, consider the following questions:\n\n* What protein sources do you have available (e.g., chicken breasts, ground beef, tofu)?\n* What veggies and fruits do you have on hand?\n* Do you have any leftovers that you can use in upcoming meals?\n* Are there any staples like rice, pasta, or canned goods that you need to restock?\n\nOnce you have a better idea of what you have at home, you can start making a more targeted shopping list. Remember to include the milk and any other essentials you need to pick up.\n\nIf you need any help or have questions, feel free to ask. I'm here to support you in your meal planning and grocery shopping adventure!",
