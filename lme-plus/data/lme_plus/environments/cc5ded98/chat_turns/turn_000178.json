  "content": "WD-40 can be used on car wipers in some cases, but it is not recommended as a regular maintenance practice. Using WD-40 on car wipers can cause the rubber blades to become brittle and crack over time, which can reduce their effectiveness and shorten their lifespan.\n\nIf you want to lubricate your car's wipers, it is best to use a silicone-based lubricant specifically designed for that purpose. Silicone lubricants are safe to use on rubber and will not cause it to become brittle or crack.\n\nIf you are having trouble with your car's wipers, it is best to try troubleshooting the problem before using any lubricants. Check the wipers for signs of wear or damage, such as fraying, splitting, or tearing. If the wipers are in good condition, the problem may be with the wiper blades or the wiper motor. In either case, it is best to have the problem diagnosed and repaired by a qualified mechanic rather than trying to fix it yourself with a lubricant like WD-40.",
