  "content": "I'd be happy to help you update your doll collection inventory list.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about how you'd like to organize your list? Would you like to categorize your dolls by:\n\n1. Type (e.g. Barbie, antique, porcelain, fashion, etc.)?\n2. Era (e.g. vintage, modern, specific decades like 1960s, 1980s, etc.)?\n3. Brand (e.g. Mattel, Tonner, Ashton-Drake, etc.)?\n4. Condition (e.g. mint, near-mint, used, restored)?\n5. Value (e.g. price range, estimated value, or a specific category like \"under $100\", \"$100-$500\", etc.)?\n\nAlso, do you have any specific information you'd like to track for each doll, such as:\n\n* Doll name or description\n* Purchase date and price\n* Original packaging and accessories\n* Any restoration or repair work done\n* Special features or unique characteristics\n\nLet me know your preferences, and I can help you create a system that works for you!",
