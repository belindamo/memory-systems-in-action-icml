  "content": "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is organized as a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization with a national headquarters located in New York City, supported by state affiliates and legal offices in every state. The organizational structure of the ACLU includes a national board of directors that sets policy and oversees the work of the organization, along with a national executive director who manages the day-to-day operations of the organization. The executive director, who is appointed by the board of directors, reports to the board and serves as the public face of the organization.\n\nIn addition, the ACLU has a network of state affiliates that are responsible for carrying out the organization's work on the ground. Each affiliate is governed by a volunteer board of directors, similar to the national board, and has its own executive director who reports to the national executive director.\n\nThe national office sets the overall agenda for the organization and works closely with state affiliates to coordinate strategies and support their work. According to the ACLU's website, decisions are made at the national level through a collaborative process that involves input from staff, board members, volunteers, and partners, with a focus on maximizing impact and advancing the organization's core values of liberty and justice.\n\nOverall, the ACLU operates as a decentralized organization, with a national headquarters providing leadership and support to state affiliates that are responsible for carrying out the organization's mission at the local level. Decisions are made through a collaborative process that involves input from stakeholders at all levels, with a focus on promoting civil liberties and protecting individual rights.",
