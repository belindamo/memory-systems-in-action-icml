  "content": "Sure! The second step in the process of converting a Short Term Acute Care Hospital (STACH) to a Critical Access Hospital (CAH) is to submit an application to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nWhen submitting the application, the STACH must provide information about its location, ownership, and services, as well as a detailed plan for how it will meet the CAH requirements. Here's a bit more detail about what each of these requirements entails:\n\n1. Location: The STACH must be located in a rural area that meets the CMS definition of \"rural.\" The location must be specified in the application, along with evidence that it meets the CMS definition.\n2. Ownership: The application must include information about the ownership of the hospital, including any changes in ownership that have taken place in the past.\n3. Services: The application must include a description of the services that the hospital currently provides, as well as a plan for how it will meet the CAH requirements. This plan should include information about how the hospital will staff its emergency department, what diagnostic services it will offer, and how it will provide patient care and manage patient information.\n4. Detailed plan: The application must include a detailed plan for how the hospital will meet the CAH requirements. This plan should be specific and detailed, and should outline how the hospital will staff its emergency department, what diagnostic services it will offer, and how it will provide patient care and manage patient information.\n\nFor example, if a STACH located in a rural area is converting to a CAH, it may need to provide evidence that it meets the CMS definition of \"rural.\" This evidence might include a map showing the location of the hospital and surrounding population centers, or it might include data on the population density of the area.\n\nThe application might also need to include information about the hospital's ownership, such as who owns the hospital and any changes in ownership that have taken place in the past.\n\nRegarding services, the application might include a description of the hospital's current services, such as the number of inpatient beds and the types of medical procedures that are performed at the hospital. It might also include a plan for how the hospital will meet the CAH requirements, such as hiring additional staff to meet the 24-hour emergency services requirement.\n\nFinally, the detailed plan might include specific information about how the hospital will meet each of the CAH requirements. For example, the plan might outline how the hospital will staff its emergency department, what diagnostic services it will offer, and how it will provide patient care and manage patient information. The plan might also include details about how the hospital will monitor and evaluate the quality of care provided to patients.",
