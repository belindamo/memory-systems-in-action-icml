  "content": "The movie was about a group of people who discover a way to travel through parallel universes, and it explored the consequences of playing with the fabric of reality. I loved the mind-bending plot twists and the stunning visuals. I'm open to watching older films, and I'd love to explore more international sci-fi. By the way, I attend the Chicago International Film Festival today, so I'm still in a film festival mode. Do you have any recommendations for some thought-provoking sci-fi films from Japan or Europe that I might enjoy?",
