  "content": "Shooting with a 1950s-era Canon rangefinder is a great way to capture some amazing black and white photos, and Tri-X is an excellent choice for high-contrast images.\n\nDeveloping the film yourself can be a great way to have more control over the process and save some money. However, if you're new to film development, it might be better to send it to a lab, especially if you're not familiar with the process or don't have the necessary equipment.\n\nHere are some pros and cons of each option to consider:\n\n**Developing the film yourself:**\n\nPros:\n\n* More control over the development process\n* Can customize the development to your liking\n* Can save money in the long run\n* Can develop the film as soon as you finish shooting\n\nCons:\n\n* Requires specialized equipment and chemicals\n* Can be time-consuming and labor-intensive\n* May require some trial and error to get the desired results\n* May not have the expertise or experience to get the best results\n\n**Sending the film to a lab:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Convenience - just send the film to the lab and they'll take care of the rest\n* Expertise - labs have experienced technicians who know how to get the best results from your film\n* Quality control - labs have quality control measures in place to ensure consistent results\n* Can get your film developed quickly and efficiently\n\nCons:\n\n* May cost more than developing the film yourself\n* May have less control over the development process\n* May have to wait for the film to be developed and returned\n\nIf you're new to film development, I would recommend sending the film to a lab, at least for your first few rolls. This will give you a chance to get a feel for the process and see how the film turns out without having to invest in equipment and chemicals.\n\nHowever, if you're comfortable with the process and have the necessary equipment, developing the film yourself can be a great way to save money and have more control over the final product.\n\nAs for the grain, Tri-X is a high-ISO film, so it will naturally have more grain than a lower-ISO film. However, the grain can add a nice texture and character to your photos, especially when shot with a rangefinder camera like the Canon.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm excited to see how your photos turn out!",
