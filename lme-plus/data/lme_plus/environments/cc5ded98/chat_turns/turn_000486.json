  "content": "Without additional context, the basic interpretation of \"\u6b21\u5143\u3092\u8d85\u8d8a\u3057\u305f\" would likely be referring to dimensionality, as the phrase literally means \"transcended dimensions\". However, as mentioned earlier, it is often used figuratively to convey the idea of something or someone surpassing or exceeding the boundaries or limitations of their respective field or category. So, it would be understood as figurative term, and the specific meaning would depend on the context in which it is used.",
