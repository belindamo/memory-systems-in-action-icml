Two hours a day is a good amount of time to dedicate to coding exercises, and with consistent effort, you'll definitely see progress.\n\nFor learning data structures and algorithms, here are some top-notch resources that can help you:\n\n**Online Courses:**\n\n1. **Coursera - Algorithms Specialization** by University of California San Diego: This is a comprehensive course that covers algorithms and data structures in-depth.\n2. **edX - Data Structures and Algorithms** by Microsoft: This course covers the basics of data structures and algorithms, with a focus on problem-solving.\n3. **Udemy - Data Structures and Algorithms in Python**: This course uses Python to teach data structures and algorithms, with a focus on practical implementation.\n\n**Practice Platforms:**\n\n1. **LeetCode**: This is one of the most popular platforms for practicing algorithms and data structures. It has a large collection of problems, and you can track your progress.\n2. **HackerRank**: Similar to LeetCode, HackerRank offers a wide range of problems in algorithms, data structures, and other areas of computer science.\n3. **CodeForces**: This platform offers a variety of problems, including algorithmic and data structure challenges.\n\n**Books:**\n\n1. **\"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Thomas H. Cormen**: This is a classic textbook that covers algorithms and data structures in-depth.\n2. **\"Data Structures and Algorithms in Python\" by Michael T. Goodrich**: This book is a great resource for learning data structures and algorithms in Python.\n3. **\"Cracking the Coding Interview\" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell**: While not exclusively focused on data structures and algorithms, this book provides excellent practice problems and insights into the interview process.\n\n**YouTube Channels:**\n\n1. **Neso Academy**: Offers video explanations and solutions to LeetCode problems.\n2. **freeCodeCamp**: Covers a range of topics, including data structures and algorithms.\n3. **MIT OpenCourseWare**: Offers video lectures on algorithms and data structures from MIT courses.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Practice consistently**: Try to solve at least one problem per day, and review the concepts regularly.\n2. **Start with the basics**: Make sure you have a solid understanding of data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues before moving on to more advanced topics.\n3. **Analyze your code**: Take the time to review your code, optimize it, and think about how you can improve it.\n4. **Join a community**: Participate in online forums, like Reddit's r/learnprogramming, to connect with other programmers and get feedback on your progress.\n\nRemember, learning data structures and algorithms takes time and practice. Stay motivated, and you'll see improvement over time. Good luck!",
