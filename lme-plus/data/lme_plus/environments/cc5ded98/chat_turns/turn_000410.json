  "content": "A simple notebook is a great way to start tracking your expenses.\n\nIncluding non-grocery items, like the Diet Coke and cereal you mentioned, is a good idea. Here's why:\n\n1. **Accurate picture of spending**: By tracking all your purchases, not just groceries, you'll get a more accurate picture of your overall spending habits. This can help you identify areas where you can cut back and make adjustments to your budget.\n2. **Crossover items**: Many stores like Walmart, Target, and Costco sell both groceries and non-grocery items. By tracking all your purchases, you'll be able to see how much you're spending on these crossover items and make informed decisions about where to shop for them.\n3. **Impulse buys**: Including non-grocery items can help you identify impulse buys, which can add up quickly. By tracking these purchases, you may find that you're spending more on non-essential items than you thought.\n\nHowever, to keep your tracking simple and focused, you might consider creating separate categories or columns for:\n\n* Groceries (food, household essentials, and pet food)\n* Non-grocery items (personal care, household supplies, electronics, etc.)\n* Miscellaneous (gifts, subscriptions, unexpected expenses, etc.)\n\nThis will allow you to see how much you're spending in each category and make adjustments accordingly.\n\nWhen tracking your expenses, remember to include the following information:\n\n* Date\n* Store name\n* Item(s) purchased\n* Total cost\n* Category (if you're using separate categories)\n\nYou can also add additional columns or notes to track other details, such as:\n\n* Whether the item was on sale or discounted\n* If you used coupons or cashback apps\n* If the item was an impulse buy or a planned purchase\n\nRemember, the key is to be consistent and honest with your tracking. The more accurate and detailed you are, the better you'll understand your spending habits and the easier it will be to make positive changes.",
