It sounds like you've got a solid plan in place to work on both your endurance and strength while having a fun climbing session with your brother.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and take breaks when needed. Climbing can be physically demanding, and it's essential to pace yourself and not push yourself too hard, especially if you're just getting back into it.\n\nAlso, don't forget to focus on your technique and movement efficiency throughout your climbs. Good technique will help you conserve energy and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and enjoy the experience with your brother! Climbing is a great way to challenge yourself and spend quality time with friends and family.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, get out there and crush those routes!",
