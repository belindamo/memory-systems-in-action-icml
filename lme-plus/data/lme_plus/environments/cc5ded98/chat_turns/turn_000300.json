I'd be happy to help you find some films that might scratch that sci-fi itch.\n\nCan you tell me more about the South Korean sci-fi movie you saw at the festival? What was it about, and what did you love about it? Was it a thought-provoking exploration of humanity, an action-packed adventure, or something else entirely? Any details you can provide will help me give you more tailored recommendations.\n\nAlso, are you open to watching older films, or are you looking for more recent releases? And are you interested in exploring other international sci-fi films, or would you prefer something from the US or UK?\n\nLet's get started, and I'll do my best to recommend some films that'll transport you back to the excitement of the festival!",
