  "content": "In the text, the criticism of Logically is raised by individuals who submitted Subject Access Requests (SARs) under the Data Protection Act 2018. The analysis of SARs revealed that Logically monitored and recorded views of elected politicians and ex-Ministers, including Conservative MP David Davis, who raised concerns about the modeling put forward at the start of the pandemic. The monitoring of Mr. Davis was criticized as unjustifiable for a government unit, and a threat to free speech. Logically was also criticized for stretching its remit and broadening the definition of disinformation unjustifiably to include comments critical of the government. For example, the monitoring of journalist, broadcaster and political commentator Julia Hartley-Brewer was criticized for including her tweets that drew attention to negative impacts of the lockdown.",
