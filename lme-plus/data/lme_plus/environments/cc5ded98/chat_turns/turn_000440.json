Adjustable Arm Lamps**: These lamps allow you to direct the light exactly where you need it, making them perfect for task lighting or creating pools of light. Look for lamps with a sturdy base and a adjustable arm that can be moved up or down, and swiveled left or right.\n\n**2. Table lamps with a slim profile**: If you have a small space or a crowded coffee table, consider slim-profile table lamps that won't take up too much real estate. These can be placed on side tables or consoles to add ambient light.\n\n**3. Floor lamps with a USB port**: If you want to keep your devices charged while you're using them, look for floor lamps with built-in USB ports. This feature is especially handy for guests who need to charge their phones.\n\n**4. Dimmable lamps**: Dimmable lamps are a great choice for living rooms, as they allow you to adjust the light level to suit different moods and activities.
