Here are some tips to ensure they turn out delicious and succulent:\n\n**Shrimp Preparation:**\n\n1. **Peel and Devein:** Peel the shrimp, leaving the tails intact. Devein them by making a shallow cut along the top of each shrimp and removing the dark vein.\n2. **Rinse and Pat Dry:** Rinse the shrimp under cold water, then pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the marinade adhere and prevents steam from building up during grilling.\n3. **Marinate:** Place the shrimp in a shallow dish and pour the Spicy Mango Marinade (mango chutney, lime juice, and cayenne pepper) over them. Make sure they're coated evenly, then cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.\n4. **Skewer:** Thread the marinated shrimp onto skewers, leaving a small space between each shrimp to allow for even cooking. You can also add some onion, bell pepper, or mango chunks to the skewers for added flavor and texture.\n5. **Preheat Grill:** Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C). Make sure the grates are clean and brush them with oil to prevent sticking.\n6. **Grill Shrimp:** Place the shrimp skewers on the grill and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until they're pink and cooked through. They should be slightly charred and firm to the touch.\n7. **Serve:** Remove the shrimp from the grill and serve immediately with your chosen sides, such as Cilantro Lime Rice and Grilled Pineapple Salad.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Use large, succulent shrimp for the best results.\n* Don't overcrowd the skewers, as this can lead to undercooked or overcooked shrimp.\n* Keep an eye on the grill temperature and adjust as needed to prevent burning.\n* If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes before grilling to prevent them from catching fire.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be on your way to grilling delicious Spicy Mango Shrimp that will impress your guests!",
