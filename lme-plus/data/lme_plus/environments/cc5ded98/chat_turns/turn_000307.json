I've always been fascinated by the concept of virtual reality and its potential impact on our understanding of reality. I'll definitely keep an eye out for the themes of free will and consciousness as I watch the film. By the way, have you got any recommendations for other films that explore the intersection of technology and humanity? I'm really interested in this theme and would love to explore more films that delve into it.",
