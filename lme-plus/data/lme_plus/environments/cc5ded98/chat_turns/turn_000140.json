Two hours a day is a significant amount of time to dedicate to coding exercises, and with consistent effort, you'll definitely see progress in your skills.\n\nRemember, the key is to be consistent and persistent. It's better to practice coding regularly for a shorter period each day than to try to cram all your practice into one or two long sessions a week.\n\nAs you continue to practice, you'll start to notice improvements in your coding skills, such as:\n\n* Increased speed and efficiency in solving problems\n* Improved problem-solving strategies and approaches\n* Enhanced coding skills, including syntax, semantics, and programming concepts\n* Better understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns\n* Improved ability to debug and troubleshoot your code\n\nAdditionally, as you progress, you may start to notice improvements in your overall thinking and problem-solving skills, such as:\n\n* Improved analytical and critical thinking skills\n* Enhanced creativity and ability to approach problems from different angles\n* Better time management and organization skills\n* Increased confidence in your ability to tackle complex problems\n\nRemember to be patient and kind to yourself as you learn. Coding can be challenging, and it's normal to encounter frustrations and setbacks. But with persistence and dedication, you'll overcome these obstacles and continue to grow as a programmer.\n\nKeep track of your progress, celebrate your successes, and don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it. You got this!\n\nHow do you plan to track your progress and stay motivated? Do you have any goals or milestones you're working towards?",
