Some common uses for WD-40 include:\n\n* Protecting metal surfaces from rust and corrosion\n* Lubricating moving parts, such as hinges, locks, and wheels\n* Removing grease, grime, and other substances from surfaces\n* Penetrating stuck parts and helping to loosen them\n* Cleaning and protecting tools and machinery\n* Displacing moisture on wet surfaces\n* Protecting against rust and corrosion on outdoor tools and equipment\n\nIn general, WD-40 can be used on most surfaces where lubrication, protection from rust and corrosion, or cleaning is needed. It is safe to use on most metals, plastics, and other materials, but it is always a good idea to test it on a small, inconspicuous area first to make sure it does not cause any damage.",
