  "content": "In this text, it is more likely that the phrase \"\u6b21\u5143\u3092\u8d85\u8d8a\u3057\u305f\" is being used figuratively rather than literally referring to dimensionality. The text is describing the gods of the \"heavenly kingdom\" as having a level of existence that is beyond human comprehension. It is saying that they can see everything in the world, and have a view of the world that is impossible for humans to have.\nIt is emphasizing on their power and advanced level rather than their physical dimensionality. It is using the metaphor of transcending dimensions to convey the idea that the gods have surpassed the boundaries and limitations of the human world in every way.",
