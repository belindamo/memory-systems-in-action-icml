  "content": "CDHR Article 12: \"Every man shall have the right, within the framework of the Shari'ah, to free movement and to select his place of residence whether within or outside his country and if persecuted, is entitled to seek asylum in another country. The country sought refuge in shall be obliged to provide protection to him against any danger and to provide him with any aid he may require. If it happens to be established that a person has sought refuge in another country for any reason of a criminal nature, or because he was involved in some criminal act, or if it should be proved that he has committed a breach of peace in the country he has come from, he shall not be entitled to any such asylum or protection.\"\n\nComment: CDHR Article 12 does address the right to seek asylum, but it qualifies this right within the framework of the Shari'ah and includes the caveat that a person is not entitled to asylum or protection if they have committed a criminal act or a breach of peace in their country of origin. This differs from the UDHR Article 14, which emphasizes the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution, without any mention of religious or legal qualifications.",
