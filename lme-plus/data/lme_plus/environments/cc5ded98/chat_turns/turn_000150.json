Their laid-back, beachy tunes will transport your guests to a tropical paradise.\n2. **Latin/Caribbean Music:** Genres like salsa, merengue, and calypso will add a spicy kick to your BBQ. Try artists like Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, or modern acts like J Balvin and Bad Bunny.\n3. **Summer Pop and Indie:** Upbeat, feel-good tracks from artists like Vampire Weekend, The Beach Boys, and Jason Mraz will keep the mood light and carefree.\n4. **Tropical House and Electronic:** DJs like Kygo, Robin Schulz, and Felix Jaehn create a fun, sun-kissed atmosphere with their tropical-infused electronic tracks.\n\nHere's a sample playlist to get you started:\n\n**Spicy Mango Shrimp BBQ Playlist**\n\n1.
