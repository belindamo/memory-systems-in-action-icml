He is known for his intricate counterpoint and harmonic genius, as well as his innovations in keyboard music, particularly the fugue. His works have had a profound influence on subsequent music in Europe and beyond.\n\n-Classical era:\n-Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791): He was an Austrian composer, and one of the most influential composers of the Classical era. He composed over 600 works, including symphonies, operas, chamber music, and piano music. His music is known for its lyricism, elegance, and emotional depth, and has had a lasting impact on Western music.\n\n-Romantic era:\n-Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827): He was a German composer and pianist, and one of the most famous and influential composers in the history of music.

Here are a few more recommendations:\n\n- Ludwig van Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 14 (\"Moonlight Sonata\") - a solo piano work that is one of Beethoven's most popular and recognizable works, known for its haunting beauty and emotional intensity. - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Requiem in D minor - Mozart's final work, left unfinished at his death, is a requiem (a musical setting of the Catholic Mass for the Dead) that is hauntingly beautiful and intensely emotional. It is also shrouded in mystery and controversy, as Mozart died before he could complete it, and the work was finished by others. - Johann Sebastian Bach: Goldberg Variations - a set of 30 variations on a bass line, performed on the harpsichord. It is considered one of Bach's greatest masterpieces, known for its complexity, virtuosity, and kaleidoscopic range of styles and moods. - Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin: Nocturne in E-flat Major - a solo piano work that is one of Chopin's most famous and beloved compositions, known for its lyrical beauty, delicate filigree, and emotional depth. There are countless other classical music pieces to explore and appreciate, and I hope you enjoy discovering them!"
