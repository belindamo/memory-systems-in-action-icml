    {

      "content": "If you're a newbie to adventure activities and are looking for a less extreme experience, I would recommend trying out jet boating. It's a thrilling ride that takes you through the scenic Shotover Canyon, but doesn't require the same level of physical exertion or risk-taking as some of the other activities on the list. It's also a good way to get a feel for the adrenaline rush that's characteristic of Queenstown's adventure activities. From there, you can gradually work your way up to the more extreme activities based on your comfort level."

      "content": "That sounds like a good plan. After jet boating, what would be the next step up if I want to try something more adventurous?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "If you wanted to try something more adventurous than jet boating, but still slightly less intense than bungee jumping or skydiving, I'd suggest trying out zip lining. This activity will take you on a high-speed adventure through the forest canopy, allowing you to take in breathtaking views of Queenstown from above. Ziplining typically involves minimal physical exertion and is generally considered a safe and beginner-friendly activity. It's a great intermediate step before moving on to more extreme adventures like bungee jumping or skydiving."

      "content": "That sounds like a good progression plan. Do you have any recommendations for the best place to go zip lining in Queenstown?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, there are a few great places to go zip lining in Queenstown. Here are some of the most popular options:\n\n1. Ziptrek Ecotours - This company offers a variety of zip line tours that take you through the forest canopy and offer incredible views of Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu.
