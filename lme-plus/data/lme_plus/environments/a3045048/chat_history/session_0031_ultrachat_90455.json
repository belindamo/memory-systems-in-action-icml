This will help ensure that you make time for it and don't skip it.\n\n2. Choose something you enjoy: Pick an activity that you actually enjoy doing. This will make it easier to stick to your exercise routine and it will feel less like a chore.\n\n3. Take advantage of your lunch break: Use your lunch break to go for a walk, run or hit the gym. If you have access to a gym near your workplace, try to go during your lunch break.\n\n4. Try mini workouts: You don't have to do a full workout to reap the benefits of exercise. Try doing quick exercises throughout the day, like squats or lunges while you're on a phone call.\n\n5. Get up and move: Make an effort to get up and move around regularly throughout the day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, pace while you're on the phone, or go for a quick walk around the office.\n\n6. Find a workout buddy: Having a workout buddy can help you stay accountable and motivated. Find a coworker who also wants to exercise during the workday and make a plan to do it together.\n\nRemember, even small amounts of exercise can have a big impact on your health and stress levels. Try to find a routine that works for you and stick with it!"
