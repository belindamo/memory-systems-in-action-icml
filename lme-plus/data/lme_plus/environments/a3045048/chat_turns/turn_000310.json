Sorry to hear that you had a disappointing experience with American Airlines' in-flight entertainment system.\n\nWhile it's understandable that you might be hesitant to fly with them again, it's worth considering a few factors before making a decision:\n\n1. **One-off issue:** It's possible that the issue with the in-flight entertainment system was an isolated incident. Airlines can have technical glitches, and it might not be a recurring problem.\n2. **Airline improvements:** American Airlines might have addressed the issue and made improvements to their in-flight entertainment system since your last flight.\n3. **Route and schedule:** If American Airlines offers the most convenient flight schedule and route for your needs, it might be worth considering giving them another chance.\n4. **Loyalty program:** If you're invested in American Airlines' AAdvantage loyalty program, you might want to continue flying with them to earn more miles and maintain your status.\n\nThat being said, if you're not comfortable flying with American Airlines again, there are other airlines that operate the New York to LA route. You could consider alternatives like:\n\n* Delta Air Lines\n* United Airlines\n* JetBlue Airways\n* Alaska Airlines\n\nResearch these airlines' in-flight entertainment options, amenities, and customer reviews to find one that better suits your needs.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours. If you do decide to give American Airlines another chance, you could consider:\n\n* Contacting their customer service to report the issue and ask about any improvements they've made\n* Checking online reviews and forums to see if other passengers have reported similar issues recently\n* Bringing a tablet or laptop with your own entertainment content as a backup\n\nI hope this helps you make a more informed decision!",
