I've had a great experience with Manfrotto tripods in the past, and I think this one would be a great upgrade for you. Now that I've got my new sensor cleaning kit from B&H Photo, which I ordered on February 20th, I'm feeling more confident about keeping my camera gear in top condition. A sturdy tripod like the MT057CXPRO4 would be a great addition to my kit. Can you tell me more about the tripod's warranty and customer support?",
