Other variables that may be included in the dataset, such as the age and gender of the victims, the race or ethnicity of the suspects, and the outcome of the crime (e.g. arrested, cleared, etc.) can also provide important insights into crime patterns and trends.\n\nIt's always recommended to look at the dataset documentation or the field descriptions to have a better understanding of the data.",
