  "content": "Styling throw pillows with a geometric pattern can be a lot of fun, and with a few simple tips, you can create a cozy and inviting atmosphere in your bedroom. Here are some suggestions to get you started:\n\n1. **Mix and match**: Combine the geometric patterned pillows with solid-colored pillows in complementary colors to create a visually appealing contrast. For example, pair the blue, yellow, and coral geometric pillows with solid gray, beige, or cream pillows.\n2. **Vary the sizes**: Use a combination of large, medium, and small pillows to add depth and visual interest to your bed or seating area. A large pillow can make a statement, while smaller pillows can add a touch of whimsy.\n3. **Layer them up**: Layer two or three pillows in front of each other to create a cozy, inviting look. This works especially well with a mix of patterns and textures.\n4. **Play with arrangements**: Experiment with different arrangements to find the one that works best for you. Try placing two or three pillows side by side, or create a pyramid shape with the pillows.\n5. **Add a statement piece**: Use a single, bold geometric pillow as a statement piece on your bed or chair. This can add a pop of color and create a focal point in the room.\n6. **Balance with neutrals**: Balance the bold, geometric pattern with neutral-colored pillows or a neutral-colored throw blanket to prevent the space from feeling overwhelming.\n7. **Consider the shape**: Use geometric pillows with a shape that complements the shape of your furniture. For example, use square or rectangular pillows on a rectangular bed, or round pillows on a round ottoman.\n8. **Add some texture**: Mix different textures, like velvet, linen, or cable knit, to add depth and interest to your pillow arrangement.\n9. **Don't overdo it**: Remember, less is often more. Avoid over-accessorizing your bed or seating area with too many pillows. Three to five pillows are usually enough to create a cozy, inviting atmosphere.\n10. **Experiment and have fun**: Don't be afraid to try out different arrangements and styles until you find the one that makes you happy!\n\nBy following these tips, you can create a cozy and inviting atmosphere in your bedroom that reflects your personal style and complements your Moroccan-inspired rug and gray paint. Have fun experimenting and finding the perfect combination that works for you!",
