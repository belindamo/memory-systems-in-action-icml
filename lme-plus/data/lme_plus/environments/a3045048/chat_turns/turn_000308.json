However, the change fee would need to be a result of the covered event, not just a voluntary change.\n\nIn your case, since you had to change your flight due to a last-minute change in your work schedule, it's unlikely that the Trip Cancellation/Interruption Insurance would cover the change fee. This benefit is designed to cover unforeseen events beyond your control, not voluntary changes.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to reach out to Chase's benefits administrator, AXA Travel Assistance, to inquire about your specific situation. They might consider your claim on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAdditionally, Chase Sapphire Preferred cardmembers also have access to **Trip Delay Reimbursement**, which can provide up to $500 per ticket for reasonable expenses (like food, lodging, and transportation) if your flight is delayed by 12 hours or more.\n\nTo file a claim, you'll need to contact AXA Travel Assistance and provide documentation supporting your claim, such as receipts, flight itineraries, and proof of payment.\n\nKeep in mind that these benefits are subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, and not all claims may be approved.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things! Do you have any other questions about the Chase Sapphire Preferred card's travel protection benefits or the claims process?",
