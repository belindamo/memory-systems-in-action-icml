  "content": "The iPhone 12 is a high-performance smartphone, so using it as a baseline for the average smartphone performance would give a high estimate for the total performance of all smartphones in each region.\n\nTo calculate the total performance of smartphones in each region, we can multiply the number of smartphones in each region by the performance of a single iPhone 12. The iPhone 12 has a performance score of 479, according to the Geekbench 5 benchmark test.\n\nHere is an updated version of table T1 with the revised data and the added column for the total performance of smartphones in each region:\n\nLabel: T1[4]\n\n| Region | Number of smartphone users (in millions) | Number of PCs (in millions) | Number of gaming consoles (in millions) | Total performance of smartphones (in millions) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United States | 298 | 284.87 | 50 | 144,442 |\n| Canada | 32.3 | 20 | 5 | 15,507 |\n| Mexico | 132.4 | 40 | 10 | 63,976 |\n| Europe | 474 | 308 | 100 | 225,546 |\n| Australia | 31.9 | 10.29 | 3 | 15,157 |\n| China | 1,040 | 300 | 15.9 | 499,960 |\n| India | 829 | 247.3 | 15.9 | 397,441 |\n| Pakistan | 186.9 | 45.13 | 50 | 89,921 |\n| Africa | 495 | 450 | 186 | 237,605 |\n| Latin America | 410 | 295 | 242 | 195,490 |\n| Total | 3,981 | 1,862.43 | 662.8 | 2,119,037 |\n\nI hope this table is helpful for your needs.
