Here are the details:\n\n* **All Mighty Guarantee:** Osprey offers a lifetime guarantee on all its products, including the Daylite 20L. If your bag is damaged or defective, Osprey will repair or replace it free of charge, no matter the reason.\n* **Customer Service:** Osprey's customer service team is highly rated and responsive. They can be reached through their website, phone, or email, and they typically respond to inquiries within 24-48 hours.\n* **Warranty Process:** If you need to make a warranty claim, Osprey's process is straightforward. You'll need to provide proof of purchase and a description of the issue, and Osprey will guide you through the repair or replacement process.\n\n**Fitting Gym Clothes and Shoes:**\nThe Osprey Daylite 20L has a capacity of 20L, which is sufficient for carrying a laptop, clothes, and other daily essentials. However, the amount of space available for gym clothes and shoes will depend on how you pack and what you need to carry.\n\n* **Gym Clothes:** You can fit a change of clothes, including a shirt, pants, socks, and undergarments, in the main compartment of the Daylite 20L. You might need to roll your clothes to make the most of the space.\n* **Shoes:** The bag has two stretchy side pockets that can fit small to medium-sized shoes, such as running shoes or sneakers. However, if you have larger shoes or boots, they might not fit in the side pockets.\n\nIf you need to carry a lot of gym gear or larger shoes, you might still want to consider carrying a separate, smaller bag for your gym clothes and shoes. However, if you're looking to minimize the number of bags you carry, the Daylite 20L can accommodate a reasonable amount of gym gear, especially if you pack strategically.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some dimensions to consider:\n\n* Main compartment: 18.5 x 11.8 x 5.5 inches (47 x 30 x 14 cm)\n* Side pockets: 6.7 x 3.5 x 2.4 inches (17 x 9 x 6 cm)\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could consider adding a small, packable gym bag or shoe bag to your Daylite 20L. This would give you a dedicated space for your gym gear and keep your main bag organized.\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to know about the Osprey Daylite 20L or Osprey's warranty and customer service?",
