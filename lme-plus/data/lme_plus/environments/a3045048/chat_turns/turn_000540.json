  "content": "During the Vietnam War, Lyndon B. Johnson and his administration attempted to censor images and reports of the war that portrayed the United States in a negative light. For instance, the Pentagon Papers, a classified study of American involvement in the Vietnam War, revealed that Johnson's administration had secretly expanded the war and misled the public about it. Johnson's administration tried to prevent the New York Times and other news outlets from publishing the papers, claiming that doing so would harm national security. However, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the New York Times, allowing them to publish the papers in 1971. Despite Johnson's attempts to censor the papers, they played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and contributing to the shift in public opinion against the Vietnam War.",
