Make a mental note to add it to your seasonal tasks or set a reminder on your calendar to flip and rotate the rug every few months.\n\nIt was a pleasure helping you organize your tasks and reminders. You've got a solid plan in place for the weekend, and you're taking great care of your new furniture and belongings. If you need any more assistance or just want to chat, feel free to reach out anytime!\n\nHave a wonderful weekend, and happy cleaning and organizing!",
