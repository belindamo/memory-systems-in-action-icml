It's great that you're already used to carrying a separate bag for your gym gear, so it shouldn't be too much of an inconvenience.\n\nThe Osprey Daylite 20L is still an excellent choice for your daily commute bag, and you can use it to carry your laptop, clothes, and other essentials. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can simply add your separate gym shoe bag to your loadout.\n\nRemember, it's all about finding a system that works for you and your lifestyle. If carrying a separate bag for your gym shoes is something you're already comfortable with, then it's not a big deal.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your new Osprey Daylite 20L and that it serves you well for your daily commutes!",
