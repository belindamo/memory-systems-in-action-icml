Please provide me with the following details:\n\n1. **Which social media platforms do you use regularly?** (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.)\n2. **Do you have access to your login credentials for each platform?** (You'll need to log in to each platform to retrieve your usage data.)\n3. **Do you use any third-party apps or browser extensions to track your screen time or social media usage?** (e.g., RescueTime, Freedom, Moment, etc.)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can guide you through the process of retrieving your usage data and provide insights to help you understand your online habits.\n\n**If you're using a smartphone**, you can also check your phone's built-in features to track your screen time and app usage. For example:\n\n* On iOS devices, go to **Settings** > **Screen Time**.\n* On Android devices, go to **Settings** > **Digital Wellbeing** (on Android 10 and later) or **Settings** > **Device** > **Digital Wellbeing** (on Android 9).\n\nPlease provide the necessary information, and we'll get started on analyzing your social media usage over the past month!",
