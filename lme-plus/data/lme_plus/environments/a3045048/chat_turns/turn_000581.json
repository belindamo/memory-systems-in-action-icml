  "content": "You are correct, `git format-patch` by default will omit merge commits from the output. However, there are options that you can use with the command to include merge commits in the output.\n\nOne option is to use the `--m<parent-number>` option to specify the parent number of the merge commit that you want to include in the output. For example, if the merge commit has two parents, you can use the `--m2` option to include the changes introduced by the second parent:\n```lua\ngit format-patch --m2 <merge-commit>\n```\nThis will create a patch file that includes the changes introduced by the second parent of the merge commit.\n\nAnother option is to use the `--cc` option to include a commit message that describes the merge commit in the patch file. This option can be used in combination with the `--stdout` option to print the output to the console:\n```css\ngit format-patch --cc --stdout <merge-commit>\n```\nThis will print a patch file to the console that includes the changes introduced by the merge commit, along with the commit message that describes the merge.\n\nNote that including merge commits in patch files can sometimes result in conflicts when applying the patches to other repositories or branches, especially if the merge commits introduced changes that conflicted with other changes in the code. It's usually best to review the changes introduced by the merge commit and make any necessary adjustments before creating a patch file.",
