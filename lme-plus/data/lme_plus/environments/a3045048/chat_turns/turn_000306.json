However, it's great that you have some business trips lined up, which should help you earn some points.\n\nRegarding your question, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card doesn't require you to book flights with a specific airline to earn the bonus points. The 2X points on travel purchases apply to a broad range of travel-related expenses, including:\n\n* Airlines\n* Hotels\n* Motels\n* Timeshares\n* Car rental agencies\n* Travel agencies\n* Tour operators\n* Travel booking websites (like Expedia, Orbitz, etc.)\n\nAs long as you use your Chase Sapphire Preferred card to pay for these types of expenses, you'll earn 2X points. This means you can book flights on multiple airlines, hotels, or other travel-related services, and still earn the bonus points.\n\nTo give you a better understanding, here are some examples of travel-related expenses that would earn 2X points:\n\n* Flights on American Airlines, Delta, United, or any other airline\n* Hotel stays at Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, or any other hotel chain\n* Car rentals with companies like Hertz, Avis, or Enterprise\n* Bookings made through travel websites like Expedia, Booking.com, or Airbnb\n\nJust keep in mind that some travel-related expenses might not qualify, such as:\n\n* Travel insurance\n* Travel agency fees\n* Traveler's checks\n* Travel-related services like trip cancellation insurance or travel visas\n\nIf you're still concerned about meeting the $4,000 spending requirement, you could consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Plan ahead:** Try to schedule some of your business trips or personal travel during the first 3 months to maximize your earnings.\n2. **Use the card for daily expenses:** In addition to travel expenses, use your Chase Sapphire Preferred card for daily purchases, like groceries, dining, or office supplies, to help reach the spending requirement.\n3. **Ask your employer to reimburse you:** If you're booking travel for business, ask your employer to reimburse you directly onto your Chase Sapphire Preferred card. This way, you'll earn points on the reimbursed amount.\n4. **Consider a different sign-up bonus:** If you're really struggling to meet the spending requirement, you could explore other credit cards with more achievable sign-up bonuses.\n\nRemember, it's essential to only spend what you can afford to pay back in full each month to avoid interest charges.\n\nDo you have any other questions or concerns about the Chase Sapphire Preferred card or meeting the spending requirement?",
