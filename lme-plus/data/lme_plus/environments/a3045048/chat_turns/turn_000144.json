However, most of the tours offered take between 2-3 hours in total, from start to finish, which includes time for gearing up, training, and the actual zip lining. \n\nFor instance, their popular 'Kea' tour takes approximately 3 hours which consists of a series of six exhilarating ziplines, with the first line being 300 m long, and final zipline flying over the skyline luge track, allowing you to reach speeds of up to 70 km/h. \n\nOverall, you can expect an exciting and unforgettable adventure with stunning views of Queenstown that can vary based on the tour, but the experience is sure to be unforgettable!",
