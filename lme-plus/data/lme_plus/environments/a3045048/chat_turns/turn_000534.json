Here are some tips to help you reduce your environmental impact while at the beach:\n\n1. Properly dispose of trash: Make sure you dispose of all trash in designated waste bins, or take it with you if there are no bins available. It's easy for trash to blow away and end up in the ocean, causing pollution and harm to marine life.\n\n2. Use eco-friendly products: Choose eco-friendly sunscreen, which is free of oxybenzone and other harmful chemicals that can wash off and affect marine life. You can also use reusable water bottles, and bring your own bags and containers to reduce waste.\n\n3. Respect coastal wildlife: Avoid interfering with wildlife, such as sea turtles, birds, and marine mammals. Do not disturb their habitats or feed them human food.\n\n4. Avoid single-use plastics: Avoid using single-use plastics, such as straws, plastic bags, and plastic cutlery. These items can be easily blown away and end up in the ocean.\n\n5. Respect beach rules: Follow beach rules and regulations, such as no littering, no smoking, and staying in designated areas. Keep off dunes and other sensitive habitats.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help protect the beach and the marine ecosystem. And don't forget, you can also participate in local beach clean-up efforts to help remove litter and debris from the area.",
