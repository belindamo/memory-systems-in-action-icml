  "content": "The number of items on your scavenger hunt will depend on the specific goals and needs of your group, as well as the length of time that you have available for the activity. In general, it's a good idea to start with a smaller number of items and build up gradually as participants become more comfortable with the process. This can help to prevent overwhelm and ensure that the scavenger hunt is enjoyable and engaging for all participants.\n\nAs a rough guide, you might consider starting with around 5-10 items on your scavenger hunt, and then adding more as needed. You could also consider breaking the scavenger hunt into smaller, more manageable chunks and focusing on one area at a time, rather than trying to cover everything all at once.\n\nIt's also a good idea to provide participants with clear instructions and guidelines for the scavenger hunt, and to make sure that they understand what is expected of them. This can help to ensure that the activity is enjoyable and productive for everyone involved.",
