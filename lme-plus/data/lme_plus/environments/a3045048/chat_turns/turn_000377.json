Carbon pricing: Canada has implemented carbon pricing to put a price on carbon emissions and encourage individuals and businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This policy was implemented under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, and it applies a price on carbon emissions on fossil fuels used in industry, transportation, and buildings.\n\n2. Ban on single-use plastics: Canada has banned single-use plastics, including items like straws, cutlery, and bags, to reduce plastic pollution in the environment. The ban is aimed at encouraging people to use more sustainable alternatives and reduce waste.\n\n3. Renewable energy target: Canada has set a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and various renewable energy targets, including a commitment to get 90% of Canada's electricity from non-emitting sources by 2030. This would encourage a shift away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.\n\n4. National parks and protected areas: Canada has established numerous national parks and protected areas to conserve biodiversity and habitats. Examples include Banff National Park and Jasper National Park, which together comprise the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n5. Sustainable agriculture: Canada has implemented several programs to promote sustainable agriculture practices, including the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, which provides funding for farmers to implement sustainable practices, such as erosion control and soil conservation measures. The program also promotes climate-smart agriculture techniques to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the sector.",
