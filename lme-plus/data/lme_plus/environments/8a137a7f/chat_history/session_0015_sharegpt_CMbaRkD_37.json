      "content": "Implementing export options is an important step in implementing the features of your web-based commercial appraisal report writing application. Here are some steps you can follow to implement export options for exporting the final appraisal report in a variety of formats:\n\n1. Define the export formats: Define the export formats that users should be able to choose from, such as PDF, Word, and Excel.\n2. Implement the export functions: Implement the export functions for each format using PHP libraries or external APIs. For example, you can use the PHPWord library to export the report to a Microsoft Word document, or the PHPExcel library to export the report to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.\n3. Add export options to the user interface: Add export options to the user interface, such as a drop-down menu or a set of radio buttons, to allow the user to choose the desired export format.\n4. Generate the export: Generate the export in the chosen format by using the appropriate PHP library or external API. Here is an example of exporting a report to a PDF using the TCPDF library:\n```php\nrequire_once('tcpdf/tcpdf.php');\n\n$pdf = new TCPDF(PDF_PAGE_ORIENTATION, PDF_UNIT, PDF_PAGE_FORMAT, true, 'UTF-8', false);\n\n$pdf->AddPage();\n$pdf->writeHTML($report, true, false, true, false, '');\n$pdf->Output('appraisal_report.pdf', 'D');\n```\n5. Test the exports: Test the exports by generating sample reports and exporting them in different formats. If the exports are generated correctly, the export options are working as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you can implement export options for exporting the final appraisal report in a variety of formats in your web-based commercial appraisal report writing application. If you need further assistance, please let me know."
