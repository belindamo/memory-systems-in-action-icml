  "content": "Sure, here is some information on the history of sea-level changes on the Korean Peninsula and Japan islands over the past million years, as well as some references:\n\nThe Korean Peninsula and Japan islands are located in close proximity to each other, and both have been affected by changes in sea level over the past million years. These changes have been driven by a variety of factors, including changes in global temperature, changes in ocean currents, and changes in the amount of ice on land.\n\nSeveral studies have reconstructed the history of sea-level changes on the Korean Peninsula and Japan islands using various methods such as analyzing fossil coral reefs, studying sediment cores, and examining shorelines. These studies have generally found that sea levels in the region have fluctuated over the past million years, with periods of rising sea levels and periods of falling sea levels.\n\nOne study published in 2018 analyzed fossil coral reefs on the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula and the eastern coast of the Japan islands to reconstruct sea-level changes over the past million years. The study found that sea levels were relatively low during glacial periods, and that there were significant increases in sea level during interglacial periods. The study also found that sea levels during the last interglacial period, which occurred about 125,000 years ago, were higher than they are today.\n\nAnother study published in 2020 analyzed sediment cores from a coastal wetland on the eastern coast of the Japan islands to reconstruct sea-level changes over the past 140,000 years. The study found that sea levels were relatively low during glacial periods, and that there were significant increases in sea level during interglacial periods. The study also found that sea levels during the last interglacial period were higher than they are today, and that sea levels during the last glacial maximum, which occurred about 20,000 years ago, were about 130 meters lower than they are today.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Lee, J.
