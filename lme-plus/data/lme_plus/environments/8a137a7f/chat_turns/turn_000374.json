  "content": "Wittgenstein's theory of meaning, as expressed in his later philosophy, holds that meaning is determined by the use of language in a given context and that there is no inherent meaning in language itself. He argues that words acquire meaning through the way they are used in practices, forms of life, and language games. Thus, meaning is not a matter of private mental content, but is instead a social, public phenomenon that arises from the shared norms and agreements of a language community.",
