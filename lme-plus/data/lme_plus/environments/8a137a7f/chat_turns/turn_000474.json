  "content": "In the vision, Aylen is walking down a busy street when she sees the figure standing in front of her, its form constantly shifting between different people. It has a sinister smirk on its face as it taunts her, its voice changing to match whoever it is currently resembling.\n\n\"You can't escape me, Aylen,\" it says in a menacing tone. \"I'm always here, always watching.\"\n\nAylen tries to confront it, but her words stumble out of her mouth as she tries to form a sentence. The thing's taunts become more cruel, it starts to mock her appearance, her abilities, her friends, her family, her life.\n\n\"You know what you have to do, Aylen. Don't you?\" it says with a terrifying sense of understanding. \"Just give in to me. Surrender your mind and body to me, and I'll make all the pain go away.\"\n\nAylen tries to protest, but her voice is barely audible over the thing's taunts. It starts to reach out its hand towards her, and she can feel the fear creeping over her as she realizes that it has the power to hurt her, even in the real world.\n\nAs Aylen tries to run, the thing lets out a sinister laugh and disappears, leaving Aylen standing alone in the middle of the crowded street, shaking and terrified.",
