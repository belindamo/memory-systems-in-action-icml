You can check their website or visit a store near you. They usually have a variety of brands and styles to choose from.\n2. **Amazon**: Amazon has an enormous selection of dog collars in different colors, including red. You can filter by brand, price, and customer reviews. You can also check out the \"Frequently Bought Together\" section to see what other customers have paired with their red collars.\n3. **Chewy.com**: Chewy is an online pet supply store that often has a wide selection of collars, including red ones. They usually offer fast shipping and competitive prices.\n4. **Etsy**: If you're looking for a unique, handmade collar, Etsy is a great place to search. Use keywords like \"red dog collar,\" \"Labrador collar,\" or \"custom dog collar\" to find relevant listings.\n\nWhen shopping for a collar, make sure to consider the following factors:\n\n* **Size**: Ensure the collar is adjustable and fits Max comfortably.\n* **Material**: Choose a durable, easy-to-clean material that suits Max's needs (e.g., nylon, leather, or rubber).\n* **Width**: Select a collar that's appropriate for Max's neck size and comfort.\n* **Buckle type**: Decide between a traditional buckle, snap buckle, or a martingale collar (if Max is prone to slipping out of his collar).\n\nIf you have a specific brand or style in mind, feel free to share, and I can try to help you find it!\n\nAs for the water bowl, $25 sounds like a great price for a stainless steel bowl. If you're happy with the quality and design, you might consider purchasing it for Max.",
