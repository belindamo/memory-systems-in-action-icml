It's a huge milestone, and you should definitely take a moment to celebrate and relax after all the hard work you've put in. You're one step closer to completing your thesis!\n\nAdjusting the hanging indent in your reference list should be a relatively quick fix. Just make sure to check the rest of your thesis for any formatting consistency, and you'll be all set.\n\nRemember, if you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. You're almost there, and I'm rooting for you to cross that finish line!",
