Designing and planning a larger, more complex piece like a vase or sculptural piece requires some careful consideration and planning. Here are some online resources and tutorials that can help you get started:\n\n**Online Resources:**\n\n1. **Ceramics Monthly**: This website has an extensive library of articles, tutorials, and videos on ceramics and pottery. They often feature projects and techniques for creating larger, more complex pieces.\n2. **The Pottery School**: This website offers online classes, tutorials, and workshops on various pottery techniques, including hand-building and sculpting. They have a range of projects suitable for beginners and experienced potters.\n3. **Handbuilt Ceramics**: This website is dedicated to hand-building techniques and features online classes, tutorials, and workshops. They cover a range of projects, from functional pieces to sculptural forms.\n\n**Design and Planning Tutorials:**\n\n1. **Sketching and Planning**: This tutorial by Ceramics Monthly covers the importance of sketching and planning your design before starting to build. It provides tips and techniques for creating a successful design.\n2. **Designing a Sculptural Piece**: This tutorial by The Pottery School covers the basics of designing a sculptural piece, including considerations for form, texture, and balance.\n3. **Planning a Large Vase**: This tutorial by Handbuilt Ceramics provides guidance on planning and building a large vase, including tips for creating a stable base and achieving the desired shape.\n\n**Software and Tools:**\n\n1. **Adobe Illustrator**: This software can be used to create digital sketches and designs for your pottery project. You can also use it to create templates and patterns for your piece.\n2. **SketchUp**: This 3D modeling software can be used to create digital models of your pottery project, allowing you to visualize and refine your design before starting to build.\n3. **Paper and Pencil**: Sometimes, the simplest tools are the most effective. Don't underestimate the value of sketching out your design by hand to get a feel for the shape and proportions of your piece.\n\n**Tips and Considerations:**\n\n1. **Start with a clear idea**: Before you begin, have a clear idea of what you want to create. Collect inspiration, sketch out your design, and refine your concept.\n2. **Break it down into smaller parts**: Large, complex pieces can be overwhelming. Break your project down into smaller, manageable parts, and focus on one section at a time.\n3. **Test and refine**: Don't be afraid to test and refine your design as you go. Clay is a forgiving medium, and it's better to make changes early on than to be stuck with a piece that doesn't turn out as planned.\n4. **Seek inspiration**: Look to other artists, nature, and architecture for inspiration. Take note of shapes, forms, and textures that resonate with you, and incorporate them into your design.\n\nRemember, designing and planning a larger, more complex piece takes time and patience. Don't rush the process, and be willing to make changes as needed. Good luck, and have fun!",
