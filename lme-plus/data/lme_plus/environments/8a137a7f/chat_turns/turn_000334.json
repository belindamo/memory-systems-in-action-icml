A. (Year of publication). Title of book. Publisher.\nExample: Smith, J. (2020). The history of psychology. Routledge.\n\n* **Journal Article:**\nAuthor, A. A. (Year of publication). Title of article. Title of Journal, Volume(Issue), pp.-pp.\nExample: Johnson, K. (2020). The impact of climate change. Journal of Environmental Studies, 20(3), 12-20.\n\n* **Conference Paper:**\nAuthor, A. A.

If you're not sure how to do this, refer to your citation manager's documentation or online resources.\n\n**Step 5: Double-Check Your References**\nCarefully review your reference list to ensure:\n\n* All sources are cited in your thesis.\n* All references are formatted correctly in APA style.\n* There are no errors in author names, publication dates, or page numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a well-organized reference list in APA style.
