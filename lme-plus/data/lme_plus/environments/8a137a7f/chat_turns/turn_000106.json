  "content": "**Brake Pad Replacement Intervals:**\n\nThe brake pad replacement interval varies depending on several factors, including driving conditions, driving style, and the type of brake pads used. Here are some general guidelines for the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord:\n\n* **Toyota Camry:**\n\t+ Average brake pad replacement interval: 30,000 to 50,000 miles\n\t+ Some models (e.g., 2018 and newer) may have longer-lasting brake pads, with replacement intervals up to 70,000 miles\n* **Honda Accord:**\n\t+ Average brake pad replacement interval: 30,000 to 50,000 miles\n\t+ Some models (e.g., 2018 and newer) may have longer-lasting brake pads, with replacement intervals up to 60,000 miles\n\n**Signs It's Time to Replace Brake Pads:**\n\nTo avoid waiting until it's too late, keep an eye out for these signs that indicate it's time to replace your brake pads:\n\n1. **Squealing or grinding noises:** If you hear strange noises when you press the brake pedal, it may be a sign that the brake pads are worn out.\n2. **Spongy brake pedal:** If the brake pedal feels soft or spongy, it could be a sign of worn-out brake pads or a problem with the brake system.\n3. **Vibrations when braking:** If your vehicle vibrates or pulsates when you apply the brakes, it may indicate worn-out brake pads or warped brake rotors.\n4. **Low brake pad warning light:** Many modern vehicles, including the Camry and Accord, have a brake pad wear sensor that illuminates a warning light on the dashboard when the brake pads are worn out.\n5. **Visual inspection:** Look for signs of wear on the brake pads, such as excessive wear on the surface, uneven wear, or a thickness of less than 1/8 inch.\n\n**Tips to Extend Brake Pad Life:**\n\nTo get the most out of your brake pads, follow these best practices:\n\n1. **Avoid aggressive driving:** Rapid acceleration, hard braking, and frequent stops can wear out brake pads faster.\n2. **Drive smoothly:** Gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and maintaining a consistent speed can help extend brake pad life.\n3. **Avoid carrying heavy loads:** Heavy loads can put additional stress on the brakes, leading to faster wear.\n4. **Use the correct brake fluid:** Ensure you're using the recommended brake fluid type and level to prevent corrosion and premature wear.\n\nBy monitoring your brake pads and addressing any issues promptly, you can ensure your safety on the road and avoid more costly repairs down the line.",
