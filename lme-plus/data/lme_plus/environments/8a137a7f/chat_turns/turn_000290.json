  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future, but I can provide some insights on the possible changes in the interaction between customers and store employees due to technology.\n\nWhile the rise of online shopping and self-service kiosks has reduced face-to-face interaction with store employees, some retailers are now embracing technology to enhance customer experience in physical stores. For example, some stores have implemented augmented reality technology that allows customers to try on clothes virtually or preview furniture in their homes.\n\nMoreover, store employees are being trained to use technology to provide personalized recommendations and solve customer problems more efficiently. For instance, some stores have introduced chatbots, which are automated customer service tools that can help customers with simple inquiries or complaints.\n\nSo, it is possible that in the future, technology may enhance the interaction between customers and store employees rather than replace it entirely.  However, the pandemic condition has made the need for contactless purchasing, but it is expected to change once the situation is resolved.",
