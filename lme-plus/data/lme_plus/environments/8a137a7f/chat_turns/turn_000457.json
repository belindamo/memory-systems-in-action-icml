I hope you're able to find it at Petco or PetSmart, but if not, online retailers like Chewy.com or Amazon are great alternatives.\n\nAnd don't forget to pick up that new water bowl for Max! The stainless steel one you saw downtown for $25 sounds like a great deal. I'm sure Max will appreciate the upgrade.\n\nRemember to always prioritize your pets' needs and comfort, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more recommendations or advice. Have a great day, and happy shopping!",
