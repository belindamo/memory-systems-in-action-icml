  "content": "Yes, there are restrictions on where visitors can hike in the Swiss National Park to ensure the protection of wildlife habitats and critical ecosystems. \n\nThere are designated hiking trails that visitors should stick to, and it's important to not veer off the trail to minimize disturbance to wildlife and their habitats. Additionally, some areas of the park may be off-limits to visitors during certain times of the year to protect breeding or nesting animals. It's crucial to respect these closed areas and stay within the designated hiking trails.\n\nVisitors are also encouraged to practice Leave No Trace principles, such as packing out garbage, not feeding wildlife, and avoiding excessive noise. These guidelines help to minimize the impact of human activities on the park's fragile ecosystem.\n\nBefore starting your hike, make sure to check the park's website or visitor centers for current hiking regulations and trail closures. Park rangers may also be available to provide guidance and answer questions about hiking in the park.",
