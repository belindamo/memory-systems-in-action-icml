  "content": "As an AI language model, I am not capable of predicting the actions of governments or countries, but it is possible that other countries may follow Japan's example and invest in robotic technology to assist with healthcare and elderly care. The global aging population is a growing concern, and many countries are facing similar challenges to Japan. Robotics and other technological innovations have the potential to address some of the labor shortages and care needs that arise from an aging population. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of remote healthcare solutions, which may further drive the adoption of digital healthcare and telemedicine.
