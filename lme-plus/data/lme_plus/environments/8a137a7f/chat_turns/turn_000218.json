It analyzes client load and background noise and dynamically assigns a channel.\n\nIn a Cisco Unified Wireless Network, the access points (APs) are configured to automatically select the optimal channel for operation. This helps to minimize interference and maximize the performance of the wireless network. The APs use a feature called ChannelFly to dynamically select the best channel based on factors such as the client load and background noise on each channel.\n\nChannelFly works by continuously analyzing the wireless environment and adjusting the channel assignment as needed. For example, if an AP detects that a particular channel is experiencing high client load or interference, it may switch to a less crowded or less noisy channel to improve performance. This helps to ensure that the wireless network is able to operate efficiently and effectively in the presence of overlapping Wi-Fi channels.",
