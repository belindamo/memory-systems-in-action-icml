  "content": "B. management\n\nIn the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard, there are three types of frames: data, management, and control.\n\nProbe requests and probe responses are examples of management frames. Management frames are used to establish, maintain, modify, and terminate the basic service set (BSS) and the distribution system (DS). Management frames also provide for the exchange of management information between stations.\n\nA probe request is a management frame that a client sends to search for available wireless networks. The client sends a probe request to the broadcast address, and any wireless access points (APs) within range that support the specified SSID (service set identifier) respond with a probe response. The probe response contains information about the AP, such as the supported data rates and security protocols.\n\nTherefore, a probe response is also a management frame.",
