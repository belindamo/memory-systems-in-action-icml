  "content": "C. Connect wireless devices to a wired network is a role of access points in an enterprise network.\n\nAccess points (APs) are devices that allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network. In an enterprise network, APs are typically used to provide wireless connectivity to devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. APs can be standalone devices or built into other devices such as routers or switches. They communicate with wireless devices using radio frequency (RF) signals and with the wired network using Ethernet.\n\nAPs play an important role in enterprise networks by providing wireless connectivity to devices that may not be able to connect to the network using a physical Ethernet connection. They also allow users to roam freely within the network coverage area without losing their connection. APs can be configured to support various security protocols such as WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) and EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) to ensure secure communication between the AP and the wireless devices.",
