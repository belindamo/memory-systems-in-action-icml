Cutting 2,000 words might seem daunting, but with a clear plan and careful editing, you can definitely achieve it.\n\nRemember to take your time, and don't rush through the editing process. It's better to make slow and deliberate cuts than to sacrifice important content or clarity.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to cut 500-1000 words at a time, and then take a break to review your work. This will help you stay focused and ensure that you're not over-cutting or losing essential information.\n\nAlso, consider creating a \"cutting room floor\" document where you paste the sections or sentences you've removed. This way, you can still refer to them if needed, and it'll help you see what you've cut and why.\n\nYou've got this! With careful editing and attention to detail, you'll be able to trim down your thesis to 25,000 words and submit a polished, well-written document.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, good luck with your editing, and I hope you'll celebrate when you reach your target word count!",
