I've been meaning to explore more music blogs and websites, and I'll definitely give those a try. I've also been thinking about attending more concerts and music events in my area, so that's a great reminder.\n\nSpeaking of concerts, I'm actually going to see Tameca Jones live next month, and I'm super excited! Have you heard of any good live music venues in my city that I should check out?",
