Here's a breakdown of the calorie counts for some of Subway's popular chip options:\n\n**Subway Chip Options and Calorie Counts:**\n\n* **Lays Classic Potato Chips** (medium bag): 170 calories\n* **Lays Sour Cream & Onion Potato Chips** (medium bag): 180 calories\n* **Doritos Nacho Cheese Tortilla Chips** (medium bag): 190 calories\n* **SunChips Whole Grain Chips** (medium bag): 140 calories\n* **Baked! Lay's Potato Chips** (medium bag): 120 calories\n\nAs you can see, the calorie counts range from 120 to 190 calories per medium bag, depending on the type of chips.\n\n**Baked vs. Fried Chips:**\n\nSubway offers both baked and fried chip options. The **Baked! Lay's Potato Chips** are a baked option, which is a lower-calorie alternative to traditional fried chips. These chips are baked in the oven instead of fried, resulting in a crispy texture with fewer calories and less fat.\n\nOn the other hand, the other chip options (Lays, Doritos, etc.) are fried chips, which generally have a higher calorie count due to the frying process.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If you're watching your calorie intake, consider opting for the baked chip option or a smaller bag of chips.\n* You can also ask your Subway sandwich artist to hold the chips or substitute them with a side salad or fruit to reduce your calorie count.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision about your chip choice at Subway!",
