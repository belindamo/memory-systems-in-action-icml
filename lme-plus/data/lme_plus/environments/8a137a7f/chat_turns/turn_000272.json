  "content": "Subway is a great option for a quick and easy lunch outing with colleagues.\n\nSince you mentioned the original price of the lunch combo was $23, I'll suggest a combo that should fit your budget. Here's a recommendation for a group of 4:\n\n**Combo Suggestion:**\n\n* 2 Footlong sandwiches (choose 2 different options to cater to different tastes)\n\t+ Sandwich 1: BMT (Pepperoni, Salami, Ham) or Italian (Salami, Ham, Pepperoni)\n\t+ Sandwich 2: Turkey Breast or Veggie Delite (for a vegetarian option)\n* 1 bag of Chips (choose a flavor that everyone will like, such as Classic or Sour Cream & Onion)\n* 4 Drinks ( fountain drinks or bottled water)\n\n**Tips to stay within budget:**\n\n* Opt for the Footlong sandwiches, which are a better value than the smaller 6-inch sandwiches.\n* Choose a bag of chips instead of individual bags to save money.\n* Consider water or fountain drinks instead of bottled beverages to reduce costs.\n* If you want to splurge, you could add a cookie or a side salad, but this might put you over the $23 budget.\n\nWith this combo, you should be able to stay within your budget of $23. Of course, prices may vary depending on your location and any customizations or add-ons.\n\nI hope this helps, and enjoy your lunch outing with your colleagues!",
