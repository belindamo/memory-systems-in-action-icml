Hiking boots - to keep your feet dry, comfortable, and protected.\n\n3. Warm layers - temperatures in the mountains can change quickly throughout the day, so it's good to bring layers that you can easily add or remove.\n\n4.

First aid kit - be prepared for any accidents that may happen during the hike.\n\n6. Snacks and water - bring enough snacks and water to keep you fueled and hydrated throughout the day.\n\n7.
