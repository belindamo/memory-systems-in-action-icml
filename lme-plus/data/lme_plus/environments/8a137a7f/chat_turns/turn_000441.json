  "content": "Sure, here's some information on the history of sea-level changes on the Korean Peninsula and some references:\n\nThe Korean Peninsula has a long coastline, and sea-level changes have had significant impacts on the region's geography and ecology. Sea-level changes have been driven by a variety of factors, including changes in global temperature, changes in ocean currents, and changes in the amount of ice on land.\n\nSeveral studies have reconstructed the history of sea-level changes on the Korean Peninsula using various methods such as analyzing fossil coral reefs and studying sediment cores. These studies have generally found that sea levels in the region have fluctuated over the past few thousand years, with periods of rising sea levels and periods of falling sea levels.\n\nOne study published in 2017 analyzed fossil coral reefs on the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula to reconstruct sea-level changes over the past 7,000 years. The study found that sea levels were relatively stable from about 7,000 to 4,000 years ago, but that there was a significant increase in sea level from about 4,000 to 2,000 years ago. The study also found that sea levels were relatively stable from about 2,000 to 1,000 years ago, but that there was a significant decrease in sea level from about 1,000 to 500 years ago.\n\nAnother study published in 2020 analyzed sediment cores from a coastal wetland on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula to reconstruct sea-level changes over the past 3,000 years. The study found that sea levels were relatively stable from about 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, but that there was a significant increase in sea level from about 2,000 to 1,000 years ago. The study also found that sea levels were relatively stable from about 1,000 to 500 years ago, but that there was a significant decrease in sea level from about 500 years ago to the present.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Park, S., Ahn, J., Shin, E., Park, Y.
