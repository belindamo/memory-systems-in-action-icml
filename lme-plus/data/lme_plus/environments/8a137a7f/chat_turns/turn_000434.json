Here are a few types of games that might help you take a break from storytelling and offer a different gaming experience:\n\n1. **Roguelikes or Action-Adventure games with procedural generation**: Games like Hades, Dead Cells, or Enter the Gungeon offer a high level of replayability, with procedurally generated levels, items, and enemies. These games focus on gameplay mechanics, combat, and exploration, rather than storytelling.\n2. **Strategy or Simulation games**: Games like Into the Breach, They Are Billions, or Cities: Skylines challenge you to build, manage, and optimize systems, rather than follow a narrative. These games often have a strong focus on gameplay mechanics and problem-solving.\n3. **Racing games**: Games like Forza Horizon 4, Dirt Rally 2.0, or TrackMania offer a high-speed, adrenaline-fueled experience that's all about racing, tuning, and improving your skills.\n4. **Puzzle games**: Games like Tetris Effect, Celeste, or Portal Knights challenge you to solve puzzles, complete levels, and improve your skills. These games often have a strong focus on gameplay mechanics and problem-solving.\n5. **Multiplayer games**: Games like Overwatch, Rocket League, or Apex Legends offer a competitive or cooperative multiplayer experience that's all about playing with others, improving your skills, and climbing the ranks.\n\nThese types of games can provide a nice change of pace from narrative-driven games and help you take a break from storytelling. You can always come back to narrative-driven games when you're ready to dive back into a rich story.\n\nRemember, it's essential to take breaks and try different types of games to avoid burnout. Gaming is all about having fun, so don't be afraid to explore different genres and find what works best for you!",
