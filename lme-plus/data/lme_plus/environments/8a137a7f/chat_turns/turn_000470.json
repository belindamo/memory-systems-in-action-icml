Sarah listened attentively, holding Aylen's hand and offering words of comfort and support.\n\n\"I know you're terrified, Aylen, but you have to trust me,\" Sarah said, her voice taking on a sinister undertone. \"I'll always be here for you.\"\n\nAylen's heart skipped a beat as she looked up at Sarah and saw the smirk on her face. Suddenly, she realized that this was not her friend, but the thing that had been tormenting her in her dreams. She tried to stand up and run, but her legs wouldn't move.\n\n\"You're not alone, Aylen,\" Sarah said in a menacing tone. \"I'm here with you.\"\n\nAylen's mind raced as she tried to understand what was happening. She couldn't believe that her best friend, the one person she had always trusted, was now a part of this nightmare.\n\n\"I understand why you're so afraid, Aylen,\" Sarah continued, her voice cold and calculating. \"I see it all.\"\n\nAylen felt a surge of panic as she realized that this thing could control her mind, making her see and hear things that weren't real.\n\n\"Don't worry, Aylen,\" Sarah said, her voice now promising violence. \"I'll make it all stop.\"\n\nAylen struggled against the invisible force holding her down, trying to find a way to escape.\n\n\"You know what you have to do, Aylen,\" Sarah said, her voice filled with a terrifying sense of understanding. \"Don't you?\"\n\nAylen closed her eyes and screamed, hoping that this would all be over soon. She woke up in her bed, drenched in sweat, her heart pounding in her chest. She lay there for a moment, trying to catch her breath and steady her racing mind. She knew now that she had to find a way to stop this thing once and for all, before it destroyed her completely.",
