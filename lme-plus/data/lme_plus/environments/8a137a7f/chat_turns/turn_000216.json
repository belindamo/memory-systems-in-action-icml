  "content": "B. hypervisor is needed to provide communication between hardware and virtual machines.\n\nVirtualization allows a single physical computer to host multiple virtual machines (VMs) that can run their own operating systems and applications. This is made possible by a software layer called a hypervisor, which sits between the hardware and the VMs. The hypervisor provides the necessary communication between the hardware and the VMs, allowing the VMs to access the resources of the physical computer as if they were running on their own dedicated hardware.\n\nThere are two main types of hypervisors: type 1 (or \"bare metal\") hypervisors, which run directly on the physical hardware, and type 2 (or \"hosted\") hypervisors, which run on top of an operating system. The choice of hypervisor depends on the specific requirements and capabilities of the hardware and the VMs.",
