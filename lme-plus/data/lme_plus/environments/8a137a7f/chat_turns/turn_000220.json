There is limited unique address space, and traffic on the new subnet will stay local within the organization.\n\nPrivate IPv4 addressing is appropriate for a new subnet when there is limited unique address space available and the traffic on the subnet will stay local within the organization. Private IPv4 addresses are used in situations where the devices on the subnet do not need to be accessible from the Internet, but rather are intended for use within a private network.\n\nPrivate IPv4 addresses are defined in the range of 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. These ranges are reserved for use in private networks and are not routed on the Internet. Using private IPv4 addresses allows organizations to conserve their public address space and use it more efficiently.\n\nOn the other hand, if the new subnet needs to be accessible from the Internet, or if it needs to communicate with other networks outside of the organization, then public IPv4 addressing would be more appropriate.",
