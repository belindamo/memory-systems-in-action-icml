Tire rotation is a regular maintenance task that's essential for ensuring even tire wear, improving fuel efficiency, and maintaining vehicle safety.\n\n**Tire Rotation Costs for Toyota Camry and Honda Accord:**\n\nHere are the estimated tire rotation costs for the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord:\n\n* **Toyota Camry:**\n\t+ Tire rotation cost: $20-$30\n\t+ Recommended interval: Every 5,000 to 7,500 miles\n* **Honda Accord:**\n\t+ Tire rotation cost: $20-$30\n\t+ Recommended interval: Every 5,000 to 7,500 miles\n\n**Why Your Recent Experience Was Higher:**\n\nBased on your experience, it's likely that the $250 you paid at the dealership included both tire rotation and brake pad replacement. This is a common practice at dealerships, where they bundle multiple services together to simplify the process and increase revenue.\n\n**Factors Affecting Tire Rotation Costs:**\n\nKeep in mind that tire rotation costs can vary depending on:\n\n1. **Dealership vs. independent shop:** Dealerships often charge more for tire rotations than independent shops.\n2. **Type of vehicle:** Some vehicles, like those with larger or high-performance tires, may require more complex or specialized tire rotation procedures, increasing the cost.\n3. **Additional services:** If other services, like brake pad replacement, are performed simultaneously, the total cost will be higher.\n\n**Incorporating Tire Rotation Costs into Your Decision:**\n\nTo factor tire rotation costs into your decision, you can add the estimated tire rotation cost to the average annual maintenance cost I provided earlier. This will give you a more comprehensive understanding of the total maintenance expenses for each vehicle.\n\nFor example, if you assume a tire rotation cost of $25 every 6,000 miles (a reasonable estimate), you can add:\n\n* $25 (tire rotation) x 2 (per year, assuming 12,000 miles driven) = $50 per year\n\nto the average annual maintenance cost for each vehicle.\n\nI hope this helps you better understand the maintenance costs associated with the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.",
