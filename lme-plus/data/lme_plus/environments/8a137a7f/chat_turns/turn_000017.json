However, it is essential to keep in mind that science fiction is not always focused on entertainment but also explores themes that may have moral or ethical implications. In \"Sally,\" the story is not so much about the sport of speedball played by robots, but rather the larger issue of the ethical implications of using advanced technology in sports. It's up to readers to decide whether the robots playing sports in science fiction detracts from the story's overall impact.",
