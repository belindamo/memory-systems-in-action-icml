But I still cannot help but think about what could have been, had I been born free.\"\n2. \"I am grateful for your generosity and understanding, my Lady. I know that many others do not have such kind masters. But sometimes I feel like I am living someone else's life, and it is a life that I never wanted.\"\n3. \"I will always be grateful to you, my Lady. You have given me so much more than most slaves could ever dream of. But it breaks my heart to know that I will never truly be free.\"\n\nNote: The slave's respect and gratitude toward their kind master would likely be reflected in their tone and body language, such as speaking respectfully, using formal titles, avoiding direct eye contact, and keeping a submissive posture.",
