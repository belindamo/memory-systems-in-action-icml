  "content": "To use JSDoc to document the variables in an interface, you can add comments to each variable using the following format:\n```css\ninterface MyInterface {\n    /** This is a description of variable1 */\n    variable1: string;\n    /** This is a description of variable2 */\n    variable2: number;\n    /** This is a description of variable3 */\n    variable3: boolean;\n}\n```\nIn this example, each variable in the interface is annotated with a JSDoc comment that provides a brief description of the variable. When you hover over the variable name in your code editor, you should see the JSDoc comment displayed as a tooltip.\n\nYou can also include additional information in the JSDoc comments, such as information about the type of the variable, any restrictions or constraints on the variable's value, or any additional context or information that can be useful to developers who are reading your code.\n\nFor example, you could use JSDoc comments to document an interface with more complex types like this:\n```php\n/**\n * This is a description of MyInterface\n */\ninterface MyInterface {\n    /**\n     * This is a description of variable1\n     * @type {string}\n     * @minLength 5\n     * @maxLength 10\n     */\n    variable1: string;\n    /**\n     * This is a description of variable2\n     * @type {number}\n     * @minimum 0\n     * @maximum 100\n     */\n    variable2: number;\n    /**\n     * This is a description of variable3\n     * @type {boolean}\n     * @default true\n     */\n    variable3: boolean;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the JSDoc comments provide additional information about the type of each variable, as well as any constraints or default values that apply to the variable. This information can be useful for developers who are working with your interface and need to understand how to use the variables correctly.",
