  "content": "\"The Song of Achilles\" is an amazing book! If you're looking for more mythology-inspired books, I've got some fantastic recommendations for you. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Circe** by Madeline Miller: Another beautifully written novel by the same author as \"The Song of Achilles\". This one retells the story of Circe, the witch from Homer's \"The Odyssey\".\n2. **The Silence of the Girls** by Pat Barker: A retelling of the Trojan War from the perspective of Briseis, a Trojan princess who becomes a concubine to Achilles. It's a powerful and thought-provoking novel that explores the experiences of women in war.\n3. **The Penelopiad** by Margaret Atwood: A novella that retells Homer's \"The Odyssey\" from the perspective of Penelope, Odysseus's wife. It's a witty and clever reimagining of the classic tale.\n4. **The Women of Troy** by Pat Barker: The sequel to \"The Silence of the Girls\", this novel continues the story of Briseis and the women of Troy as they navigate the aftermath of the war.\n5. **The Heroes of Olympus** series by Rick Riordan: If you're looking for a more YA-oriented series, Riordan's books are a great blend of mythology and adventure. This series is a continuation of his Percy Jackson series, but can be read as a standalone.\n6. **The Golem and the Jinni** by Helene Wecker: While not strictly mythology-inspired, this novel draws heavily from Jewish and Middle Eastern mythological traditions. It's a beautifully written tale of a golem and a jinni living in early 20th-century New York City.\n7. **The Buried Giant** by Kazuo Ishiguro: A novel set in post-Arthurian England, exploring the intersection of myth and reality. It's a haunting and thought-provoking read.\n8. **The Odyssey** by Gareth Hinds: If you're interested in a graphic novel adaptation of Homer's classic epic, Hinds' version is a stunning and engaging retelling.\n9. **Lore Olympus** by Rachel Smythe: A webcomic that reimagines Greek mythology in a modern setting, with a focus on the gods and goddesses as complex, relatable characters.\n10. **The Myths of Greece and Rome** by Michael Grant: If you're interested in delving deeper into the original myths themselves, Grant's collection is a comprehensive and engaging retelling of the classic stories.\n\nI hope you find something that piques your interest in this list!",
