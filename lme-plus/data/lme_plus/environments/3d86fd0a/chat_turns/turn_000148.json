  "content": "Traditional boxing and Olympic-style boxing are two different sports with different rules and objectives.\n\nTraditional boxing typically refers to professional boxing, where the primary goal is to knock out or incapacitate the opponent. In traditional boxing, rounds last between 3-12 rounds, with each round lasting 1-3 minutes, depending on the level of the match. Fighters can win by a knockout, technical knockout, or decision. Fighters wear gloves that are often smaller than those used in Olympic boxing.\n\nOlympic-style boxing, on the other hand, is the amateur version of boxing and is focused on scoring points rather than knocking out the opponent. It involves a set of specific rules and regulations, which limits the amount, size, and duration of hits or strikes allowed. In Olympic-style boxing, bouts are divided into three rounds, each lasting three minutes. Fighters are awarded points for landing punches on the head or torso of their opponent, and the fighter with the most points at the end of the match wins. Fighters must wear protective gear, such as a head guard, to minimize the risk of injury.\n\nIn short, the main difference between traditional and Olympic-style boxing is that traditional boxing focuses on knocking out the opponent, while Olympic-style boxing emphasizes scoring points through landing punches on the opponent's head or torso.",
