Both chicken and beef can work well in bibimbap, and the spicy Gochujang sauce and gojugaru will complement them nicely.\n\nHere are some tips for substituting the pork with chicken or beef:\n\n* **Chicken:** Chicken breast or thighs work well in bibimbap. You can marinate the chicken in a similar way to the pork, using the same Gochujang sauce and gojugaru. Chicken will cook faster than pork, so adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n* **Beef:** Thinly sliced beef, such as ribeye or sirloin, can be used in place of pork. You can marinate the beef in a similar way to the pork, using the same Gochujang sauce and gojugaru. Beef will cook faster than pork, so adjust the cooking time accordingly.\n\nKeep in mind that the cooking time and method may vary depending on the protein you choose. Make sure to cook the protein to the recommended internal temperature to ensure food safety.\n\nAlso, if you're using chicken or beef, you may want to adjust the amount of Gochujang sauce and gojugaru to your taste. Chicken and beef can be more delicate in flavor than pork, so you may want to start with a smaller amount of sauce and adjust to taste.\n\nOverall, feel free to experiment with different proteins and adjust the recipe to your taste preferences. The spicy Gochujang sauce and gojugaru will add plenty of flavor to your bibimbap, regardless of the protein you choose!",
