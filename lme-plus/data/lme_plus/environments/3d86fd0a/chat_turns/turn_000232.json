The Kayano 28 is a great option for runners with medium to high arches, and it offers a comfortable, cushioned ride.\n2. **Brooks Ghost 14**: The Ghost series is a popular choice among runners, and the 14th iteration is no exception. It features a segmented crash pad for smooth heel-to-toe transition, and the BioMoGo DNA midsole provides customized cushioning and support.\n3. **New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v12**: New Balance is known for its comfortable, supportive shoes, and the 1080v12 is a great option for runners with medium to high arches. It features a supportive and cushioned ride, with a Fresh Foam midsole that provides excellent shock absorption.\n4. **Saucony Guide 14**: The Guide series is designed for runners who need a little more support, and the 14th iteration features an EVERUN topsole for added cushioning and comfort. It's a great option for runners with medium to high arches who need a balance of support and flexibility.\n\nAll of these shoes should provide good arch support and comfort for your road runs. Since you mentioned you prefer shoes with good arch support, I'd recommend trying on the ASICS Kayano 28 or the Saucony Guide 14, as they're both known for their supportive features.\n\nIf you're interested in trying out a different brand, the Brooks Ghost 14 or New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v12 are also great options.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I'd recommend trying on a few different models to see which one feels the most comfortable for you. You might also want to consider visiting a specialty running store, where the staff can help you find the right fit and provide guidance on your running form and gait.\n\nHope this helps, and happy running!",
