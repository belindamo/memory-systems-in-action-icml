I needed it, I've been feeling a bit under the weather.\" (said in a slightly hesitant tone, conveying gratitude while also expressing physical discomfort)\n2. \"I'm glad to be able to serve you, Master. I hope I've been able to fulfill my duties to your satisfaction.\" (said in a monotone voice, conveying a sense of obligation and dissatisfaction with the slave's current situation)\n3. \"It's always a pleasure to be in your presence, Master. Your kindness means so much to me.\" (said with a forced smile, conveying gratitude while also expressing a sense of unease and discomfort)\n4. \"I will do my best, Master. I only hope I can live up to your expectations.\" (said in a low voice, conveying a sense of pressure and obligation)\n\nThese quotes aim to convey the slave's gratitude and affection for their kind master, while also expressing the frustration and anger they feel at their situation as a slave. The tone, pace, and inflection of the slave's voice can help emphasize their true feelings, while still appearing obedient and submissive to their Luxian master.",
