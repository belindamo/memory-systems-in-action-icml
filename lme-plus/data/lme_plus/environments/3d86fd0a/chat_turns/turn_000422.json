This might be shown as \"available\" or \"open\" on the airline's website or through their customer service.\n2. **Mileage required**: Verify the number of miles needed for the upgrade. This might vary depending on the airline, route, and travel dates.\n3. **Upgrade fees**: Some airlines might charge additional fees for upgrading using miles, so factor those into your calculation.\n4. **Taxes and surcharges**: Even if you're upgrading using miles, you might still need to pay taxes and surcharges on the original ticket price.\n\nIf you're having trouble finding available award space or need assistance with the upgrade process, consider reaching out to the airline's customer service or a travel agent specializing in award bookings. They can help you navigate the process and find the best options for your needs.\n\nFingers crossed that you'll be able to redeem your miles for a business class upgrade and enjoy a more comfortable flight from Tokyo to Osaka!",
