  "content": "The ASICS Kayano 28 and the Brooks Ghost 14 are both high-quality running shoes that offer excellent support and cushioning, but they have some key differences:\n\n**Support:**\n\n* **Kayano 28:** The Kayano series is known for its supportive features, and the 28th iteration is no exception. It's designed for runners with high arches or plantar fasciitis, and it features a more substantial and supportive heel counter to help reduce excessive pronation. The Kayano 28 has a more pronounced medial post (the denser material on the medial side of the shoe) to correct overpronation and provide additional support.\n* **Ghost 14:** The Ghost series is known for its balance of support and flexibility. While it doesn't have the same level of support as the Kayano, it still offers a supportive ride with a BioMoGo DNA midsole that adapts to your running style. The Ghost 14 has a more neutral support profile, making it suitable for runners with neutral to mild overpronation.\n\n**Cushioning:**\n\n* **Kayano 28:** The Kayano 28 features a FlyteFoam midsole that provides a softer and more cushioned ride compared to its predecessors. It also has a Spacer Mesh upper that allows for more breathability and flexibility. However, the Kayano 28 is still a more supportive shoe, so the cushioning is slightly firmer than the Ghost 14.\n* **Ghost 14:** The Ghost 14 features a DNA LOFT midsole that provides a softer and more cushioned ride than the Kayano 28. The Ghost 14 is designed for runners who need a balance of support and cushioning, and it delivers a smooth, comfortable ride with excellent shock absorption.\n\n**Key differences:**\n\n* The Kayano 28 is more supportive and stable, making it suitable for runners with high arches or plantar fasciitis.\n* The Ghost 14 is more cushioned and flexible, making it suitable for runners who need a balance of support and comfort.\n* The Kayano 28 has a more pronounced medial post and a more substantial heel counter, which provides additional support and stability.\n* The Ghost 14 has a more neutral support profile and a softer, more cushioned midsole.\n\nUltimately, the choice between the Kayano 28 and the Ghost 14 depends on your personal preferences and running style. If you need more support and stability, the Kayano 28 might be the better choice. If you prefer a more cushioned and flexible ride, the Ghost 14 could be the way to go.",
