What's the brand name, and what type of polish is it (e.g. wax-based, oil-based, cream-based)? Also, have you tried using it on your boots yet? If so, how did it turn out?\n\nAs for your boots looking a bit dull, that's completely normal, especially if you wore them on Thursday and haven't polished them since. Leather needs regular conditioning and polishing to maintain its appearance and prevent it from drying out.\n\nFor brown leather boots, you'll want to look for a polish that's specifically designed for brown leather. Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Choose a polish that matches the color of your boots**: If your boots are a dark brown, look for a polish that's labeled as \"dark brown\" or \"chestnut.\" If they're a lighter brown, look for a polish that's labeled as \"medium brown\" or \"tan.\"\n2. **Opt for a high-quality, wax-based polish**: Wax-based polishes are great for brown leather because they provide a nice shine and help to protect the leather from water and scratches. Look for a polish that contains natural waxes like beeswax or carnauba wax.\n3. **Consider a polish with conditioning properties**: If your boots are looking dry or cracked, look for a polish that contains conditioning ingredients like lanolin or coconut oil. These will help to moisturize the leather and keep it soft and supple.\n\nSome popular shoe polish brands that are great for brown leather boots include:\n\n* Kiwi\n* Allen Edmonds\n* Saphir\n* Lincoln\n* Chamber's\n\nIf you're still unsure about the kit you bought, you could try using it and see how it turns out. If you're not happy with the results, you could consider trying a different polish.\n\nDo you have any other questions about shoe polish or leather care? I'm here to help!",
