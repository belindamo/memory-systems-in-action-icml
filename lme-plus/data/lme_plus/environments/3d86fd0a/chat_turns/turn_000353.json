What do you think about this:\n\n\"Hi, I'm a fiction novelist looking for a writing group focused on novel writing. I came across your group and was impressed by [something I like about the group]. I've been invited to a writing group before, but it didn't work out. Now I'm looking for a group that can provide constructive feedback and support. Can you tell me more about your group's format, experience with novel writing, and expectations for member participation?\"\n\nDoes that sound good?",
