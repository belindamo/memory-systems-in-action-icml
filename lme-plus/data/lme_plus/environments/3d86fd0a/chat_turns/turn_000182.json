  "content": "I do not have real-time information to provide, but according to the national science foundation (nsf) website, the application deadline for the graduate research fellowship program (grfp) typically falls in late october. the specific date for the grfp application deadline varies from year to year, so it is important to check the official nsf website to get the updated information. \n\ni would like to note that the application process for the grfp can be quite involved and requires careful planning, so it is recommended that interested students begin the application process well in advance of the deadline. starting early will give applicants enough time to work on their research proposals, obtain reference letters, and other materials required for the application.",
