  "content": "Yes, there are many contemporary works that use setting in a similar way to \"A Rose for Emily.\" One example is Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"The Underground Railroad.\" The story is set in the American South during the 1800s and follows the journey of a slave, Cora, who escapes from a Georgia plantation and travels north via the Underground Railroad. The different settings that Cora encounters -- from the brutal conditions of the plantation to the seemingly idyllic town of South Carolina -- create a stark contrast that underscores the brutality and inhumanity of slavery. The setting also plays a role in creating a sense of tension and suspense, as Cora must navigate the dangers of the underground railroad and evade the slave-catchers who pursue her.\n\nAnother example is the novel \"There There\" by Tommy Orange, which is set in modern-day Oakland, California. The setting of the novel, with its blend of urban and natural landscapes, serves as a metaphor for the struggles of Native Americans in contemporary society. The novel follows a group of characters who are preparing for a powwow, and the setting contributes to the novel's themes of displacement, identity, and cultural heritage. The stark contrast between the urban landscape and the traditional powwow grounds creates a sense of tension and conflict that underscores the novel's exploration of Native American experience in modern America.\n\nBoth these examples demonstrate how setting can play a crucial role in creating mood, themes, and tension in contemporary literature, continuing the tradition of earlier works like \"A Rose for Emily.\"",
