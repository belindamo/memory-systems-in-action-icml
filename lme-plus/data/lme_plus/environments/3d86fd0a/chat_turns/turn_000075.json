  "content": "Intelligentsia Coffee is a fantastic choice! They're a Chicago-based coffee roaster with a reputation for serving some of the best coffee in the city.\n\nAs it happens, there is an Intelligentsia Coffee location near the Lakefront Trail. The closest location to the trail is their Millennium Park cafe, which is located at 53 E. Randolph St. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from the trail, depending on where you are along the lake shore.\n\nThis location is actually one of their flagship cafes, and it's a beautiful spot to grab a coffee or snack. They offer a variety of specialty drinks, including their famous Black Cat espresso, as well as pastries, sandwiches, and salads.\n\nIf you're looking for an alternative, there's also an Intelligentsia Coffee location at 312 W. Randolph St, which is about a 10-15 minute walk from the trail. This location is a bit larger and has a more extensive food menu, but both locations offer the same high-quality coffee and excellent service.\n\nEither way, I'm sure you'll enjoy your coffee and snack at Intelligentsia!",
