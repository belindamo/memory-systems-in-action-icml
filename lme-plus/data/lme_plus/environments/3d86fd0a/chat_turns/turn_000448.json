By adding wiping down the counters and sink to your cleaning up after dinner routine, you're leveraging a habit you already have, making it easier to remember and execute.\n\nAnd yes, breaking it down into smaller tasks can be a huge help when you're feeling overwhelmed. It's all about making the task manageable and achievable, so you can build momentum and confidence.\n\nRemember, the key is to be consistent and patient with yourself. It might take some time for the habit to become automatic, but with persistence and the right strategies, you can make it a part of your daily routine.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your habit-forming journey!",
