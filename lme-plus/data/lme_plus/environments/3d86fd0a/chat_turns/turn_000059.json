It's always a good idea to ask about the gym's policy on storing lost items, so you know what to expect if they do find your shoes.\n\nHere are some questions you might want to ask:\n\n* How long do you hold onto lost items before disposing of them?\n* Do you have a designated lost and found area where members can claim their items?\n* Is there a process for members to report lost items, and how do you try to reunite them with their owners?\n* Are there any specific procedures for handling high-value items, like expensive shoes?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better understanding of the gym's policies and procedures, and you'll be better prepared if they do find your shoes.\n\nAdditionally, it's also a good idea to ask about their policy on labeling and storing items in lockers.
