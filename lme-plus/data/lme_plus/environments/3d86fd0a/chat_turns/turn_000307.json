  "content": "There are several genetic factors linked to allergies, including:\n\n1. HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genes: These genes play a role in immune system function and can affect susceptibility to allergies. HLA-DQ genes have been associated with food allergies.\n\n2. IL-4 and IL-13 genes: These genes code for proteins that regulate immune system activity, including the production of allergen-specific IgE antibodies.\n\n3. TLR (toll-like receptor) genes: These genes are involved in the recognition of potentially harmful substances and activation of the immune response. Variations in TLR genes have been linked to increased risk of allergic diseases.\n\n4. ST2 gene: This gene is involved in regulating immune system activity and has been associated with increased risk of asthma and allergic rhinitis.\n\nPrevalence of these genetic factors can vary across different ethnic groups and populations. For example, certain HLA genes are more common in certain ethnic groups, and variations in IL-4 and IL-13 genes have been found to be more common in people of European ancestry. Additionally, different populations may have different environmental exposures that can interact with genetic factors to influence the development of allergies.",
