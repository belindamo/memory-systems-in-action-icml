Here are some suggestions to help you make this habit stick:\n\n1. **Anchor it to a routine**: Attach the habit to something you already do daily, like washing dishes or cleaning up after dinner. This way, wiping down the counters and sink becomes a natural part of your routine.\n2. **Make it a mindless task**: Try to make the task as automatic as possible. Keep the cleaning supplies in an easy-to-reach location, so you can quickly grab them and get to work.\n3. **Create a visual reminder**: Place a sticky note or a reminder on your fridge to remind you to wipe down the counters and sink after dinner.\n4. **Break it down into smaller tasks**: Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the task, break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. For example, focus on wiping down the counters one day and the sink the next.\n5. **Create a ' habit stack'**: Stack this habit onto another habit you already have, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. This helps to create a chain of habits that become automatic over time.\n6. **Make it a part of your ' shutdown routine'**: Incorporate wiping down the counters and sink into your evening routine, when you're winding down and preparing for bed. This helps to signal to your brain that it's time to start wrapping up the day.\n7. **Track your progress**: Keep a habit tracker or a calendar to mark off each day you complete the task. Seeing your progress can motivate you to continue.\n8. **Make it a habit loop**: Create a habit loop by setting a specific cue (e.g., finishing dinner), performing the action (wiping down counters and sink), and then rewarding yourself (e.g., taking a few deep breaths or enjoying a cup of tea).\n9. **Get accountability**: Share your goal with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can provide an added motivation to stick to your habit.\n10. **Celebrate small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate each small victory, even if it's just a quick wipe-down. This helps to build momentum and reinforces the habit.\n\nRemember, the key is to make the habit as easy and convenient as possible, so it becomes second nature.\n\nWhich of these suggestions resonates with you the most?",
