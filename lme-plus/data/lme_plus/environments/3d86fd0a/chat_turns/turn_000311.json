  "content": "If someone has a family history of allergies, they may be at increased risk of developing allergies themselves. However, there is no sure way to prevent the development of allergies. Avoiding certain foods or environments may reduce the risk of exposure to allergens, but it is not a guaranteed prevention method. It is important to note that allergen exposure does not always lead to the development of an allergy, and the risk of developing an allergy may also be influenced by other factors such as genetics and the immune system. If someone is concerned about their risk of developing allergies, they should discuss their concerns with a healthcare professional who can provide more personalized advice and screening if necessary.",
