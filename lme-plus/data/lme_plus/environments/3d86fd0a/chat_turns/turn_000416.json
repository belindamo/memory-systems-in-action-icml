Cherry blossoms might be gone, but the weather is mild and perfect for exploring the city.\n\nYou've earned those miles, and splurging on a nice hotel is a great way to treat yourself! Shinjuku is an excellent area to stay in, but depending on your preferences, there are other areas that might suit your taste and budget better. Here's a breakdown of popular areas to stay in Tokyo:\n\n1. **Shinjuku**: A major hub with great connections to the rest of the city. It's known for its skyscrapers, department stores, and Tokyo's largest park, Shinjuku Gyoen. Many hotels, from budget-friendly to luxurious, are available in this area.\n2. **Shibuya**: Famous for its scramble crossing and vibrant atmosphere, Shibuya is a great spot for shopping, dining, and nightlife. It's a bit more expensive than Shinjuku, but you'll find plenty of high-end hotels and boutique options.\n3. **Roppongi**: An upscale area with a more international feel, Roppongi is home to many luxury hotels, embassies, and high-end shopping centers like Roppongi Hills. It's a bit more laid-back than Shibuya and Shinjuku.\n4. **Ginza**: Known for its luxury shopping and dining, Ginza is a great area for those who want to indulge in high-end experiences. It's a bit more expensive than the other areas, but you'll find some of the best hotels in Tokyo here.\n5. **Asakusa**: A more traditional area with a rich history, Asakusa is home to the famous Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise Shopping Street. It's a bit farther from the city center, but offers a unique atmosphere and some great hotel options.\n6. **Odaiba**: A man-made island in Tokyo Bay, Odaiba offers a more relaxed atmosphere and great views of the city skyline. It's a bit farther from the city center, but has some fantastic hotels and attractions like the Miraikan science museum.\n\nConsidering your miles and desire for a luxurious stay, I'd recommend exploring options in Roppongi or Ginza. Both areas offer top-notch hotels with excellent service and amenities. Here are a few examples:\n\n* **Roppongi**:\n\t+ The Ritz-Carlton, Tokyo: Located on the top floors of the Tokyo Midtown complex, this hotel offers stunning views and luxurious amenities.\n\t+ Grand Hyatt Tokyo: A modern hotel with a great location and excellent service.\n* **Ginza**:\n\t+ The Peninsula Tokyo: A luxurious hotel with a great location and top-notch service.\n\t+ Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi: A 5-star hotel with elegant rooms and a great location.\n\nWhen booking your hotel, be sure to consider the following:\n\n* Distance to the airport: If you're arriving at Narita or Haneda airport, choose a hotel with a convenient location and transportation options.\n* Subway and train access: Tokyo's public transportation system is extensive, so look for hotels with easy access to major subway and train lines.\n* Amenities: Think about what matters most to you \u2013 fitness center, spa, restaurants, or a particular view.\n\nEnjoy your trip to Tokyo, and happy hotel hunting!",
