It's always better to be informed and prepared.\n\nRegarding your boots, getting a waterproofing spray or cream is a great idea! It'll help protect the leather from water and stains, and keep them looking their best. You can also consider conditioning the leather regularly to keep it soft and supple.\n\nIf you do decide to get a waterproofing spray or cream, make sure to read the instructions carefully and follow the recommended application process. You might also want to test a small, inconspicuous area of the boot first to make sure the product doesn't affect the color or texture of the leather.\n\nBy taking care of your boots and being mindful of your belongings at the gym, you'll be able to enjoy your activities without worrying about your gear. Happy trails, and I hope you get your shoes back soon!",
