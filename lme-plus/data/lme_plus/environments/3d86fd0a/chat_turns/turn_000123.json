It's fantastic that you wanted to challenge yourself to go beyond the basics and explore new flavors and cuisines.\n\nCooking classes are an excellent way to do just that, and it's great that you're taking advantage of them. Not only do you learn new techniques and recipes, but you also get to meet like-minded people who share your passion for food.\n\nExperimenting with different flavors and ingredients is a big part of the fun in cooking, and it's awesome that you're enjoying that process. Korean cuisine, in particular, is known for its bold flavors and spices, so it's a great choice for adventurous cooks like yourself.\n\nNow, I'm curious - what's been your favorite dish or cuisine to cook so far? Have you discovered any new ingredients or techniques that you're particularly excited about?",
