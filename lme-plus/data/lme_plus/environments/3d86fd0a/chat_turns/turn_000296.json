  "content": "Let's zero in on a particular dynamic in the story. A Luxian woman owns a slave whose species, though unknown to the Luxians, has managed to preserve their language and culture secretly. Thus, though they're still born into slavery, they have a concept of freedom that other slaves don't. The woman isn't aware of this. However, she makes a conscious effort to be kind and humane to her slave even though he ultimately is still her property. The slave knows his situation is much, much better than others and is grateful she's doing the best she can, is not afraid of her since he knows she won't punish him and has a lot of genuine respect for her, though he is painfully aware of the power differential. How might he talk to her? How might he express affection and anger, or frustration and gratitude, if at all?",
