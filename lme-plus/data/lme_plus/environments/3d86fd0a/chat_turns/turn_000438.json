Here are some quick tips to help you stay on top of your closet organization:\n\n1. **5-Minute Rule**: Set a timer for 5 minutes each morning to quickly tidy up your closet.

This will keep them from getting scattered throughout the closet.\n5. **Keep Frequently Worn Items Accessible**: Store your most frequently worn items in easy-to-reach locations, so you can quickly grab them in the morning.\n6. **Use Storage Containers**: Use bins, baskets, or bins to store items like socks, underwear, and accessories. Label them so you can easily find what you need.\n7. **Schedule a Monthly Maintenance**: Set a reminder to do a deeper clean of your closet once a month to maintain its organization and keep it looking great.\n\nRemember, the key is to create habits that you can stick to, even on busy Mondays! By following these tips, you'll be able to maintain your organized closet and keep it looking great.\n\nIf you need an extra motivation, try setting a reminder on your phone or putting a note on your closet door to remind you of your 5-minute tidy-up routine.
