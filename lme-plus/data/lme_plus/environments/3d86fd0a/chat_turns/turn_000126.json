  "content": "Certainly! Here are some more modern poems that can be used to teach figurative language to 7th grade students:\n\n1. \"Phenomenal Woman\" by Maya Angelou\nThis poem contains examples of metaphor, such as \"I'm a woman/Phenomenally\" and \"It's the fire in my eyes/And the flash of my teeth/The swing in my waist/And the joy in my feet.\"\n2. \"Still I Rise\" by Maya Angelou\nThis poem includes examples of metaphor and personification, such as \"I am a black ocean, leaping and wide/Welling and swelling I bear in the tide\" and \"Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave/I am the dream and the hope of the slave.\"\n3. \"The Road Not Taken (Modern Version)\" by Randall Munroe\nThis is a humorous modern take on Robert Frost's classic poem, and includes examples of metaphor and irony, such as \"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--/I took the one less traveled by/And that has made all the difference.../I'm not sure if it was a good difference, though.\"\n4. \"Mirror\" by Sylvia Plath\nThis poem contains examples of personification, as the mirror is given the ability to speak and reflect the truth about the woman who looks into it.\n5. \"The Red Wheelbarrow\" by William Carlos Williams\nThis poem includes examples of imagery and symbolism, such as \"So much depends/Upon/a red wheel/barrow\" and \"Glazed with rain/Water/Beside the white/Chickens.\"\n6. \"The Caged Bird\" by Maya Angelou\nThis poem contains examples of metaphor and personification, as the caged bird is used as a symbol for the oppression of African Americans, and is given human-like qualities such as singing and dreaming of freedom.\n\nThese modern poems can be used in a similar way as the classic poems to introduce and analyze different types of figurative language, and can be a great way to engage students with more contemporary works of literature.",
