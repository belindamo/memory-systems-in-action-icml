  "content": "Making Gochujang sauce from scratch can be a bit involved, but it's definitely worth the effort. Gochujang is a fermented Korean chili paste that's made from a mixture of chili peppers, rice, and fermented soybeans. Here's a recipe to make a basic Gochujang sauce from scratch:\n\n**Homemade Gochujang Sauce Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups Korean chili peppers (gochugaru), stemmed and seeded\n* 1 cup short-grain rice\n* 1/2 cup fermented soybean paste (doenjang)\n* 1/2 cup water\n* 1/4 cup brown sugar\n* 1/4 cup salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Roast the chili peppers:** Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Place the chili peppers on a baking sheet and roast for 10-15 minutes, or until fragrant and slightly charred.\n2. **Make the chili pepper paste:** Let the roasted chili peppers cool, then blend them into a smooth paste using a blender or food processor.\n3. **Prepare the rice:** Rinse the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for at least 4 hours or overnight. Drain the rice and blend it into a smooth paste using a blender or food processor.\n4. **Mix the ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine the chili pepper paste, rice paste, fermented soybean paste, water, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper. Mix everything together until you get a smooth, thick paste.\n5. **Ferment the mixture:** Transfer the mixture to a ceramic or glass container with a wide mouth. Cover the container with a cloth or paper towel, and let it ferment in a warm place (around 70\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F or 21\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C) for 2-3 days. You'll start to see bubbles and a slightly puffed texture on the surface.\n6. **Age the Gochujang:** After fermentation, transfer the Gochujang to an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator. Let it age for at least 2 weeks, shaking the container every day or two. The longer it ages, the thicker and more complex the flavor will become.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use Korean chili peppers (gochugaru) for the best flavor. You can find them at Asian markets or online.\n* Adjust the level of heat to your liking by using more or fewer chili peppers.\n* If you can't find fermented soybean paste (doenjang), you can substitute it with miso paste or omit it altogether.\n* Be patient and don't rush the fermentation process. The longer it ferments, the better the flavor will be.\n* Store the Gochujang sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.\n\nNow that you have your homemade Gochujang sauce, you can use it in the Spicy Pork Bibimbap with Gochujang Sauce recipe I provided earlier. Enjoy!",
