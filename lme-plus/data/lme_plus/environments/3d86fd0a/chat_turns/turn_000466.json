Here's what you need to know to make the most of your visit:\n\n**Best Time to Visit:**\nThe best time to visit Tsukiji Fish Market is early in the morning, around 5:00-6:00 AM. This is when the fish auction takes place, and you can witness the bustling atmosphere of the market. If you're not a morning person, you can still visit the market later in the day, but be prepared for larger crowds and higher prices for fresh sushi.\n\n**What to Expect:**\n\n1. **Fish Auction:** The tuna auction, also known as the \"Tsukiji Fish Auction,\" is a popular attraction. However, please note that the inner market has moved to a new location called Toyosu Market in 2018. The tuna auction is no longer held at Tsukiji, but you can still visit the outer market, which offers a fascinating glimpse into Tokyo's seafood culture.\n2. **Outer Market:** The outer market, known as \"Tsukiji Outer Market\" or \"Jogai Shijo,\" is still located at the same site and offers a variety of fresh seafood, sushi restaurants, and kitchenware shops. You can find plenty of food stalls and restaurants serving fresh sushi, sashimi, and other Japanese delicacies.\n3. **Fresh Sushi:** Be prepared to try some of the freshest sushi you've ever had! Many restaurants in the outer market offer high-quality, reasonably priced sushi options. Just be prepared for long lines, especially during peak hours.\n4. **Crowds:** Tsukiji Fish Market is a popular tourist destination, so expect large crowds, especially during peak travel seasons (March-May and September-November).\n5. **Getting There:** The nearest station is Tsukiji Shijo Station on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line. From the station, follow the signs to the market.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Arrive early to beat the crowds and secure a spot at popular sushi restaurants.\n* Wear comfortable shoes, as you'll be doing a lot of walking.\n* Bring cash, as not all vendors accept credit cards.\n* Be respectful of the market's rules and traditions. No flash photography is allowed, and be mindful of the vendors' workspace.\n* Consider purchasing a guided tour to help you navigate the market and gain a deeper understanding of its history and culture.\n\nEnjoy your visit to Tsukiji Fish Market, and I hope you have a fantastic time in Japan!",
