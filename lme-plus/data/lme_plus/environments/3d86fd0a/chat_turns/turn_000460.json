Here are some pros and cons of each option to consider:\n\n**Specific Gray Set:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Convenience: A gray set usually includes a range of grays specifically designed to work together, making it easier to achieve a cohesive look.\n* Cost-effective: Buying a set can be more cost-effective than purchasing individual bottles, especially if you need multiple shades.\n* Color harmony: The grays in a set are often designed to work together, ensuring a more natural transition between shades.\n\nCons:\n\n* Limited flexibility: You might not need all the grays in the set, and you might end up with some unused bottles.\n* Limited customization: If you need a specific shade that's not in the set, you might need to purchase an additional bottle.\n\n**Individual Bottles:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Flexibility: You can choose exactly the shades you need, without committing to a larger set.\n* Customization: You can select the specific grays that match your reference images or personal preferences.\n* No waste: You won't end up with unused bottles.\n\nCons:\n\n* More expensive: Buying individual bottles can be more costly than purchasing a set.\n* Color matching: You'll need to ensure the individual grays work well together, which can be more challenging.\n\nFor your F-16 project, I'd recommend starting with individual bottles of the specific grays you need. This will give you the flexibility to choose the exact shades you want and avoid any unnecessary purchases.\n\nGunze Sangyo's Mr. Color range includes several grays that are suitable for the F-16, such as:\n\n* Mr. Color 308 (Light Gray FS36375)\n* Mr. Color 309 (Medium Gray FS36270)\n* Mr. Color 310 (Dark Gray FS36118)\n\nYou can start with these three bottles and see how they work for your model. If you need additional shades or find that you need to adjust the colors, you can always add more bottles to your collection.\n\nRemember to always read the descriptions and reviews for each product to ensure you're getting the right shades for your model.",
