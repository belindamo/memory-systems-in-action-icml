You can recharge them at ticket vending machines, convenience stores, or online.\n\nHere's how IC cards work:\n\n1. Purchase the IC card at a train station, convenience store, or online.\n2. Charge the card with the desired amount (minimum recharge amount varies by card).\n3. Tap the card on the reader at the train station or bus stop to pay for your fare.\n4. The fare will be deducted from your card balance.\n5. You can check your balance and transaction history at ticket vending machines or online.\n\nWhen choosing an IC card, consider the following:\n\n* If you plan to use JR trains frequently, ICOCA or SUICA might be a better option.\n* If you only need to use subways and buses, PiTaPa or the Kansai One Pass might be a better choice.\n* If you're a tourist, the Kansai One Pass provides unlimited travel and is a convenient option.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!",
