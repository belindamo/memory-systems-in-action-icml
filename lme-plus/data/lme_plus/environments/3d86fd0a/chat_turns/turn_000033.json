Regeneration projects can certainly benefit other deprived areas in the city, but they should be approached carefully and with consideration for the needs and desires of the local community. There should be a balance between regeneration and preservation of the area's identity and culture. Additionally, regeneration projects should be inclusive, affordable, and accessible to the existing community, rather than alienating them. Regeneration should also take into account the wider social, economic, and environmental impacts, such as job creation, environmental sustainability, and reducing social inequalities. Overall, the success of regeneration projects in deprived areas depends on careful planning, community involvement, and long-term commitment to sustainability and inclusivity.",
