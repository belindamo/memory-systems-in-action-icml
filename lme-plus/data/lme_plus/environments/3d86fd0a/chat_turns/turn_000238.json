  "content": "The upper materials and breathability of the Kayano 28, Ghost 14, and Fresh Foam 1080v12 are all designed to provide a comfortable and supportive fit, but they have some differences:\n\n**Kayano 28:**\n\n* The Kayano 28 features a Spacer Mesh upper that provides excellent breathability and flexibility.\n* The upper is designed to be more supportive and structured, with a more substantial heel counter and a comfortable, padded tongue.\n* The Spacer Mesh material is lightweight and breathable, allowing for airflow and moisture management.\n* The Kayano 28 also features a Heel Clutching System that provides a snug, secure fit around the heel.\n\n**Ghost 14:**\n\n* The Ghost 14 features a BioMoGo DNA upper that provides a comfortable, soft, and adaptive fit.\n* The upper is designed to be more flexible and accommodating, with a roomier toe box and a more relaxed fit through the midfoot.\n* The BioMoGo DNA material is lightweight and breathable, with a 3D-printed design that provides ventilation and airflow.\n* The Ghost 14 also features a Segmented Crash Pad for smooth heel-to-toe transition and a comfortable ride.\n\n**Fresh Foam 1080v12:**\n\n* The Fresh Foam 1080v12 features a Hypoknit upper that provides a comfortable, soft, and flexible fit.\n* The upper is designed to be more supportive and structured, with a comfortable, padded tongue and a secure heel fit.\n* The Hypoknit material is lightweight and breathable, with a knit construction that provides ventilation and airflow.\n* The Fresh Foam 1080v12 also features a supportive heel counter and a comfortable, cushioned collar.\n\nIn general, all three shoes have breathable upper materials that provide excellent airflow and moisture management. However, the Kayano 28 has a more structured and supportive upper, while the Ghost 14 has a more flexible and accommodating upper. The Fresh Foam 1080v12 falls somewhere in between, with a supportive and comfortable upper that's designed for runners who need a balance of support and flexibility.\n\nWhen trying on the shoes, pay attention to how the upper materials feel against your foot. Do you prefer a more structured and supportive fit, or a more flexible and accommodating fit? Do you need a roomier toe box or a more snug fit through the midfoot? These are all important factors to consider when choosing the right shoe for your running needs.",
