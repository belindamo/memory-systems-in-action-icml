  "content": "Question 3 is asking for the length of the other leg of a right triangle, given the length of one leg (x) and the length of the hypotenuse (y). The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs.\n\nIn this question, the Pythagorean Theorem is written in the form x^2 + (y-5)^2 = y^2. This means that the square of one leg (x^2) plus the square of the other leg (y-5)^2 is equal to the square of the hypotenuse (y^2).\n\nThe question is asking for the value of x in terms of y. To find x, you can isolate x on one side of the equation by subtracting (y-5)^2 from both sides, and then take the square root of both sides.\n\nx=sqrt(y^2 - (y-5)^2)\nx=sqrt(y^2 - y^2 +10y - 25)\nx=sqrt(10y-25)\n\nSo the value of x in terms of y is sqrt(10y-25)",
