You'll get a better feel for which one suits your foot and running style better.\n\nRegarding the New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v12, it's actually a great option for runners with medium to high arches, not just low arches. The Fresh Foam 1080 series is known for its supportive and cushioned ride, making it suitable for runners with a variety of foot types.\n\nThe Fresh Foam 1080v12 features a supportive and comfortable ride, with a Fresh Foam midsole that provides excellent cushioning and shock absorption. It's a great option for runners who need a balance of support and flexibility, and it's suitable for runners with medium to high arches.\n\nThe main difference between the Fresh Foam 1080v12 and the Kayano 28 is that the 1080v12 has a more neutral support profile, whereas the Kayano 28 has a more substantial medial post and a more supportive heel counter. The Ghost 14, on the other hand, has a more cushioned and flexible ride compared to the 1080v12.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a more supportive and stable ride with a focus on arch support, the Kayano 28 might be the better choice. If you prefer a more cushioned and flexible ride with a neutral support profile, the Ghost 14 could be the way to go. And if you're looking for a balance of support and cushioning with a comfortable ride, the Fresh Foam 1080v12 is definitely worth considering.\n\nTrying on all three shoes will give you a better sense of which one feels the most comfortable and supportive for your foot and running style.",
