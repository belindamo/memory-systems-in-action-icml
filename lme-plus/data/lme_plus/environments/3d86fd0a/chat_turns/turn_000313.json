  "content": "Yes, it is common for allergies to worsen during certain seasons. Seasonal allergies are typically caused by allergens such as pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds. Pollen counts tend to be highest during the spring and fall and can vary depending on the climate and geography of the area. When a person with allergies is exposed to pollen, their immune system produces an allergic response which can result in symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, congestion, and itchy eyes. If you notice that your allergy symptoms tend to worsen during certain seasons, it may be helpful to track your symptoms and identify the specific allergens that are causing your symptoms. This can help you to better manage your allergies with strategies like avoiding exposure to allergens, taking over-the-counter or prescribed medications, and seeking allergy testing and treatment from a healthcare provider.",
