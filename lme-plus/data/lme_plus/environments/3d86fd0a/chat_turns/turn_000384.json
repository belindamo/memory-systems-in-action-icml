Toasted almonds will provide a nice crunch and flavor contrast.\n\n**Preparing the Vegetables:**\n\nFor a hearty and flavorful tagine, you can chop the vegetables into bite-sized pieces or leave them in larger chunks, depending on your preference. Here's a suggestion:\n\n* Carrots: Peel and chop into 1-inch thick slices or chunks.\n* Zucchini: Slice into 1/2-inch thick rounds or chunks.\n* Bell Peppers: Slice into 1-inch thick strips or chunks.\n\nYou can cook the vegetables separately before adding them to the tagine, but it's not necessary. Since you're using chicken thighs, which take a bit longer to cook, you can add the vegetables to the pot along with the chicken. This way, they'll cook together and absorb all the flavorful spices and sauce.\n\nHowever, if you prefer your vegetables more tender, you can saut\u00e9 them separately before adding them to the tagine. Here's how:\n\n1. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan over medium heat.\n2. Add the chopped carrots and cook until they start to soften, about 5 minutes.\n3. Add the sliced zucchini and bell peppers and cook until they're tender-crisp, about 5-7 minutes.\n4. Add the cooked vegetables to the tagine pot along with the chicken and spices.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to adjust the cooking time based on the size and type of vegetables you're using.\n* If using larger chunks of vegetables, you may need to adjust the cooking time of the tagine accordingly.\n* You can also add other vegetables like onions, potatoes, or sweet potatoes to the tagine if you like.\n\nBy cooking the vegetables along with the chicken, you'll create a rich and flavorful sauce that's infused with the aromas of the spices and the natural sweetness of the vegetables. The toasted almonds will add a nice crunch and texture contrast to the dish.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
