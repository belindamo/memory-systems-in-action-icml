Here are some poems about nature that could be used to teach figurative language to 7th grade students:\n\n1. \"The Peace of Wild Things\" by Wendell Berry\nThis poem uses metaphor and imagery to convey a sense of peace found in nature. For example, \"When despair for the world grows in me/and I wake in the night at the least sound/in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be,/I go and lie down where the wood drake/rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.\"\n2. \"Blackberry-Picking\" by Seamus Heaney\nThis poem uses metaphor and sensory imagery to describe the experience of picking blackberries in nature. For example, \"At first, just one, a glossy purple clot/Among others, red, green, hard as a knot./You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet/Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it.\"\n3. \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost\nThis poem uses extended metaphor to explore the idea of choices and the paths we take in life. For example, \"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014/I took the one less traveled by,/And that has made all the difference.\"\n4. \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" by William Wordsworth\nThis poem uses simile and imagery to describe the beauty of nature and the emotions it can inspire. For example, \"I wandered lonely as a cloud/That floats on high o'er vales and hills,/When all at once I saw a crowd,/A host, of golden daffodils.\"\n5. \"The Fish\" by Elizabeth Bishop\nThis poem uses imagery and metaphor to describe the experience of catching and releasing a large fish. For example, \"He hung a grunting weight,/Battered and venerable/and homely./Here and there/his brown skin hung in strips/like ancient wallpaper.\"\n\nThese poems about nature can be used to explore the use of figurative language, as well as to encourage students to appreciate the natural world around them.",
