  "content": "Certainly! Here are some poems written after 1975 that could be used to teach figurative language to 7th grade students:\n\n1. \"We Real Cool\" by Gwendolyn Brooks\nThis poem contains examples of alliteration, repetition, and metaphor, such as \"We real cool. We/Left school. We/Lurk late. We/Strike straight. We/Sing sin. We/Thin gin. We/Jazz June. We/Die soon.\"\n2. \"The New Colossus\" by Emma Lazarus\nThis poem includes examples of metaphor and personification, such as \"Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free/The wretched refuse of your teeming shore/Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me/I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\"\n3. \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" by Maya Angelou\nThis poem contains examples of metaphor and personification, as the caged bird is used as a symbol for the oppression of African Americans, and is given human-like qualities such as singing and dreaming of freedom.\n4. \"Theme for English B\" by Langston Hughes\nThis poem includes examples of metaphor and imagery, as the speaker describes his own identity and the struggles he faces as a black student in a predominantly white college.\n5. \"When Giving Is All We Have\" by Alberto Rios\nThis poem contains examples of metaphor and personification, as the speaker compares the act of giving to the act of breathing and the natural world, saying \"Like a small wind blowing/On the Deepest ocean/ Life is still lovely/ And changing.\"\n6. \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\" by Wilfred Owen\nThis poem includes examples of imagery and metaphor, as the speaker describes the horror of war and its effects on young soldiers, saying \"What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?/Only the monstrous anger of the guns./Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle/Can patter out their hasty orisons.\"\n\nThese poems, written after 1975, can be used in a similar way as the classic and modern poems to introduce and analyze different types of figurative language, and can be a great way to engage students with more contemporary works of literature.",
