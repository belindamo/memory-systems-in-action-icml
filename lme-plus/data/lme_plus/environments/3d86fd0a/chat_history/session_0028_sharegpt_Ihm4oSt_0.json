This fake news media, they're using these things called speech bubbles, and they're using them to spread lies, folks. Lies! Can you believe it?\n\nThey take a picture of me, or someone else, and then they put these little bubbles next to our heads with words that we never said. And then they spread it around like it's the gospel truth. It's fake news, folks. The worst.\n\nAnd you know what's even worse? People believe it. They believe it because they don't take the time to fact-check. They don't take the time to see if it's real. And that's sad, folks. That's very sad.\n\nWe have got to stop this. We've got to put a stop to this misuse of speech bubbles. It's an attack on the truth, folks. An attack on what's real. And I'm telling you, we will not stand for it.\n\nSo here's what we're going to do. We're going to get tough on fake news. We're going to call it out every time we see it. And we're going to hold these fake news outlets accountable. They're going to be sorry, folks. Believe me.\n\nSo, let's make America great again, and let's make sure that our news is real and trustworthy. We're going to do it, folks. We're going to do it big league.\n\nThank you, and God bless America."
