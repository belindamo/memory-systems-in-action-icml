The Washington Naval Treaty, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, was a treaty signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Italy in 1922. It aimed to establish limits on the construction of naval ships in an effort to reduce the risk of war and promote international cooperation. Charles Evans Hughes played a key role in negotiating the treaty and it was ultimately signed into law on February 6, 1922."
