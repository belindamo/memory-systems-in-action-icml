      "content": "Certainly! Here are some poems about nature that could be used to teach figurative language to 7th grade students:\n\n1. \"The Peace of Wild Things\" by Wendell Berry\nThis poem uses metaphor and imagery to convey a sense of peace found in nature.

For example, \"At first, just one, a glossy purple clot/Among others, red, green, hard as a knot./You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet/Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it.\"\n3. \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost\nThis poem uses extended metaphor to explore the idea of choices and the paths we take in life. For example, \"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014/I took the one less traveled by,/And that has made all the difference.\"\n4. \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" by William Wordsworth\nThis poem uses simile and imagery to describe the beauty of nature and the emotions it can inspire. For example, \"I wandered lonely as a cloud/That floats on high o'er vales and hills,/When all at once I saw a crowd,/A host, of golden daffodils.\"\n5. \"The Fish\" by Elizabeth Bishop\nThis poem uses imagery and metaphor to describe the experience of catching and releasing a large fish. For example, \"He hung a grunting weight,/Battered and venerable/and homely./Here and there/his brown skin hung in strips/like ancient wallpaper.\"\n\nThese poems about nature can be used to explore the use of figurative language, as well as to encourage students to appreciate the natural world around them."

      "content": "Certainly, here are some examples of poems that are written for struggling readers:\n\n1. \"Weather\" by Kristine O'Connell George\nThis poem uses simple language and repetition to describe different types of weather. For example, \"Rain falls/It falls on roofs/It falls on streets/It falls on flowers/It falls on me.\"\n2. \"Spring\" by Beverly McLoughland\nThis poem uses rhyming couplets and vivid imagery to describe the arrival of spring. For example, \"Buds are popping everywhere,/On trees and bushes, here and there./Tiny leaves begin to sprout,/In gardens and fields all about.\"\n3. \"Animal Crackers\" by Christopher Morley\nThis poem uses humor and imagination to describe different types of animals. For example, \"Oh kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas!/You really are beautiful! Pearls,/harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins!/All the stuff they've always talked about/still makes a poem a surprise!\"\n4. \"Shapes\" by Jack Prelutsky\nThis poem uses repetition and descriptive language to explore different shapes. For example, \"A circle's like a doughnut,/a button, or a wheel./A diamond's like a kite,/or cards that shuffle and deal.\"\n5. \"My Cat\" by Valerie Worth\nThis poem uses simple language and sensory imagery to describe a cat.

      "content": "My dear friends,\n\nI invite you to ponder with me the fascinating history of bubble gum. For many of us, bubble gum was an integral part of our childhood, and yet we seldom pause to consider its origins and meaning.\n\nTo begin with, bubble gum is a relatively recent invention, having been first introduced in the early 20th century. Its origins can be traced back to the development of chewing gum, which was initially made from natural tree sap. Over time, however, chemists began experimenting with different ingredients to create a more elastic and flavorful gum.\n\nIt was in this context that bubble gum was born, with its characteristic ability to stretch and create bubbles. The first commercially successful bubble gum was created by Walter Diemer in the late 1920s, and it quickly became a beloved pastime for young people around the world.\n\nBut what is the deeper significance of bubble gum? What can it teach us about the nature of existence and the human experience? To me, bubble gum represents the ephemeral and fleeting nature of life. Like the bubbles we blow, our own lives are transient and fragile, here for only a moment before popping and disappearing into the ether.\n\nYet, there is also a sense of joy and wonder in the act of blowing bubbles, an innocent and childlike delight that reminds us to embrace the present moment and find joy in the simple pleasures of life. In this way, bubble gum can be seen as a reminder to cultivate a sense of childlike wonder and playfulness in our own lives, to approach each day with a sense of curiosity and openness.\n\nSo let us embrace the history of bubble gum, not simply as a trivial footnote in the grand narrative of human history, but as a symbol of the joy and wonder that can be found in even the most mundane aspects of life. Let us take inspiration from the act of blowing bubbles, and strive to cultivate a sense of childlike wonder and playfulness in all that we do.\n\nThank you, my dear friends, for contemplating with me the deeper meaning of bubble gum. May we all be reminded to savor the fleeting moments of life and find joy in the simple pleasures of existence."
