In some cases, private sessions with a yoga therapist may be recommended. A well-trained yoga teacher can help you modify poses, provide necessary props to support you, and offer alternatives to help you practice yoga safely and effectively. Remember, yoga is not a one-size-fits-all practice, and modifications can be made to suit your unique needs."
