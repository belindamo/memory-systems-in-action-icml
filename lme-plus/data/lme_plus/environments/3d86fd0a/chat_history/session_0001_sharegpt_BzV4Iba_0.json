      "content": "To create documentation of a method in TypeScript that will provide mouse-over information in VS Code, you can use JSDoc comments. JSDoc comments are a standard way of documenting code in JavaScript and TypeScript, and they provide a way to annotate your code with information about the types of parameters, return types, and any additional context or information that can be useful to developers who are reading your code.\n\nTo use JSDoc comments in TypeScript, you can simply add comments to your method using the following format:\n```php\n/**\n * This is a description of your method\n * @param {string} param1 - This is a description of the first parameter\n * @param {number} param2 - This is a description of the second parameter\n * @returns {boolean} This is a description of the return value\n */\nfunction myMethod(param1: string, param2: number): boolean {\n    // Your method code here\n}\n```\nIn this example, the JSDoc comments provide information about the types of the method parameters and return value, as well as a brief description of the method itself. When you hover over the method name in VS Code, you should see the JSDoc comments displayed as a tooltip.\n\nYou can also generate documentation from your JSDoc comments using tools like TypeDoc, which can create a set of HTML pages that provide detailed documentation for your code."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To use JSDoc to document the variables in an interface, you can add comments to each variable using the following format:\n```css\ninterface MyInterface {\n    /** This is a description of variable1 */\n    variable1: string;\n    /** This is a description of variable2 */\n    variable2: number;\n    /** This is a description of variable3 */\n    variable3: boolean;\n}\n```\nIn this example, each variable in the interface is annotated with a JSDoc comment that provides a brief description of the variable. When you hover over the variable name in your code editor, you should see the JSDoc comment displayed as a tooltip.\n\nYou can also include additional information in the JSDoc comments, such as information about the type of the variable, any restrictions or constraints on the variable's value, or any additional context or information that can be useful to developers who are reading your code.\n\nFor example, you could use JSDoc comments to document an interface with more complex types like this:\n```php\n/**\n * This is a description of MyInterface\n */\ninterface MyInterface {\n    /**\n     * This is a description of variable1\n     * @type {string}\n     * @minLength 5\n     * @maxLength 10\n     */\n    variable1: string;\n    /**\n     * This is a description of variable2\n     * @type {number}\n     * @minimum 0\n     * @maximum 100\n     */\n    variable2: number;\n    /**\n     * This is a description of variable3\n     * @type {boolean}\n     * @default true\n     */\n    variable3: boolean;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the JSDoc comments provide additional information about the type of each variable, as well as any constraints or default values that apply to the variable. This information can be useful for developers who are working with your interface and need to understand how to use the variables correctly."
