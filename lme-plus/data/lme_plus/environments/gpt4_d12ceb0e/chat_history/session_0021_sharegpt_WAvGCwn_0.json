The objective was to create three separate networks each having two subnets with an equal number of addresses, and to connect two nodes in each subnet. The goal was to configure the arrangement so that any node is able to communicate with the remaining nodes within the subnet, as well as in other subnets. The plan was to use the Ping diagnostic command to verify the communication setup and reachability.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe objective of this lab was to explore the process of creating subnets for a network and extending the network using the given blocks of IP addresses. We also aimed to understand the configuration requirements and verify the communication setup and reachability using the Ping diagnostic command.\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. First, we used the Cisco Packet Tracer software to set up three separate networks, each with two subnets.\n2. In each subnet, we connected two nodes (computers or devices).\n3. We configured the arrangement so that any node was able to communicate with the remaining nodes within the subnet, as well as in other subnets.\n4. We identified and analyzed the configuration requirements for the setup.\n5. Finally, we used the Ping diagnostic command to verify the communication setup and reachability.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nTo set up the three separate networks and subnets, we used a combination of routers and switches. The routers were used to connect the different networks, while the switches were used to create the subnets within each network. We also had to configure the IP addresses and subnet masks for each device, as well as set up the default gateway for the nodes.\n\nWe were able to confirm that the configuration was achieved according to the plan, as all of the nodes were able to communicate with each other within the subnets and across the different networks. The Ping diagnostic command was used to verify the communication setup and reachability, and we were able to successfully ping all of the nodes from each other.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn this lab, we explored the process of creating subnets for a network and extending the network using the given blocks of IP addresses. We were able to successfully set up the three separate networks and subnets, and configure the arrangement so that any node was able to communicate with the remaining nodes within the subnet, as well as in other subnets.

One important aspect of networking is subnetting, which involves dividing a network into smaller subnetworks or subnets. This process allows for better organization and utilization of the available IP addresses within the network.
