I realized I need something to keep my phone charged on the go. By the way, I just got a new phone case with a built-in screen protector, and I'm really happy with it - especially since my sister dropped my phone a couple of weeks ago and got a small scratch on the screen, but it's not too bad."

Look for at least 10,000mAh to get multiple charges.\n2. **Size and weight**: A compact and lightweight power bank is easier to carry around.\n3. **Output ports**: Ensure the power bank has enough USB ports to charge multiple devices at once.\n4. **Speed**: Look for power banks with fast charging capabilities (e.g., QuickCharge, VOOC, or USB-C Power Delivery) to charge your phone quickly.\n5. **Durability**: A rugged design and protection from water, dust, and shocks can be important if you plan to use the power bank outdoors.\n\nWith those factors in mind, here are some excellent portable power bank options:\n\n1. **Anker PowerCore 20000 PD**: A high-capacity power bank with 20,000mAh, two USB ports, and fast charging capabilities (up to 18W).

      "content": "The average lifespan of a portable power bank can vary depending on several factors, including the quality of the battery, usage patterns, and storage conditions. However, with regular use, you can expect a well-maintained power bank to last for around 2-3 years, with some lasting longer or shorter depending on the factors mentioned above.\n\nHere are some general guidelines to expect:\n\n1. **Cycle life**: A power bank's battery has a limited number of charge cycles it can handle before its capacity starts to degrade. A typical power bank battery can handle around 300-500 charge cycles. If you charge your power bank daily, it may last for around 1-2 years.\n2. **Capacity retention**: Over time, a power bank's capacity to hold a charge will decrease. A good quality power bank may retain around 80% of its original capacity after 1 year, and around 50% after 2 years.\n3. **Usage patterns**: If you use your power bank regularly, it will naturally have a shorter lifespan compared to one that's used occasionally. Heavy usage, such as charging multiple devices simultaneously or using it to power devices for extended periods, can reduce its lifespan.\n4. **Storage conditions**: Extreme temperatures, humidity, and physical damage can affect a power bank's lifespan. Storing it in a cool, dry place and avoiding physical stress can help extend its lifespan.\n5. **Quality of the power bank**: A high-quality power bank with a reputable brand and good build quality can last longer than a cheaper, low-quality option.\n\nTo extend the lifespan of your portable power bank:\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures (below 32\u00b0F or above 95\u00b0F)\n* Store it in a cool, dry place\n* Avoid physical stress, such as drops or crushing\n* Keep it away from water and moisture\n* Update the power bank's firmware regularly (if possible)\n* Avoid overcharging or undercharging\n* Clean the power bank's contacts and ports regularly\n\nBy following these tips and using your power bank responsibly, you can expect it to last for around 2-3 years with regular use. However, it's essential to monitor its performance and replace it when you notice a significant decline in its capacity or overall performance."
