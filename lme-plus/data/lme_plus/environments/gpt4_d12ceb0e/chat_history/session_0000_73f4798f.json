She was a simple person with simple tastes, so nothing too fancy. And yeah, a cozy atmosphere would be great. Oh, and by the way, I'm planning to visit them on a Wednesday, which is kind of a nostalgic day for me since that's when I got the call about grandma's passing."

Keaton (played by Michael J. Fox) was the conservative, wise-cracking, and lovable teenager who often found himself at odds with his liberal parents. The show aired from 1982 to 1989 and was a huge hit during that time.\n\nIs that the show your grandma loved?"
