Here are a few things that posture can indicate:\n\n1. Confidence: People who stand up straight with their shoulders back and head held high are often perceived as more confident and self-assured. On the other hand, slouching or hunching over can convey insecurity or lack of confidence.\n2.

On the other hand, leaning back or avoiding eye contact can indicate disinterest.\n3.
