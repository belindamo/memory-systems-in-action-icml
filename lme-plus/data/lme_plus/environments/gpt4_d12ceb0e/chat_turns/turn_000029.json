  "content": "Excellent choice on using panko breadcrumbs and parmesan for your chicken parmesan! Adding Italian seasoning will definitely elevate the flavor. The ratio of breadcrumbs to parmesan to Italian seasoning can vary depending on personal preference, but here's a general guideline:\n\n**Breadcrumbs:** Use 1-2 cups of panko breadcrumbs per pound of chicken breasts. Panko breadcrumbs are lighter and crisper than regular breadcrumbs, which helps them adhere better to the chicken.\n\n**Parmesan:** Use 1/2 to 1 cup of grated parmesan cheese per pound of chicken breasts. You can use more or less depending on how cheesy you like your chicken parmesan.\n\n**Italian Seasoning:** Add 1-2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning per cup of breadcrumb mixture. Italian seasoning is a blend of herbs, so start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste. You can always add more, but it's harder to remove excess seasoning.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of a breadcrumb mixture:\n\n* 1 cup panko breadcrumbs\n* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese\n* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nMix the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl until well combined. You can also add other seasonings like garlic powder, dried basil, or oregano to the mixture if you prefer.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Use freshly grated parmesan cheese for the best flavor.\n* If you're using a store-bought Italian seasoning blend, check the ingredients list to ensure it doesn't contain any added salt. You can always add salt separately if needed.\n* Don't overmix the breadcrumb mixture, as it can become dense and heavy.\n* For an extra crispy coating, you can chill the breaded chicken in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before frying.\n\nRemember, the key to a great chicken parmesan is to not overpower the chicken with too much breading. You want a delicate balance of flavors and textures. Experiment with the ratios and seasonings to find your perfect combination!",
