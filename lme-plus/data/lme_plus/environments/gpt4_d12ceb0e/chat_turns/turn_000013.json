I'd be happy to help you with some herbal tea recommendations!\n\nFirst, let me ask: Do you have a preferred flavor profile or any specific benefits you're looking for in an herbal tea? (e.g., calming, energizing, fruity, spicy, etc.)?\n\nIn the meantime, I'll offer a few popular herbal tea options that might intrigue you:\n\n1. **Peppermint**: A classic choice, peppermint tea is refreshing, calming, and great for digestion.\n2. **Rooibos**: A caffeine-free, nutty-flavored tea from South Africa, rich in antioxidants and perfect for a soothing evening cup.\n3. **Hibiscus**: A fruity, cranberry-like tea that's packed with vitamins and minerals, and may help lower blood pressure.\n4. **Lemon Balm**: A light, citrusy tea that promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and supports a good night's sleep.\n5. **Ginger**: A spicy, invigorating tea that aids digestion, reduces nausea, and can help alleviate cold and flu symptoms.\n\nIf you're open to trying something new, I can suggest a few more options. And, of course, I'd love to hear more about your morning coffee routine! What's your go-to coffee blend or brewing method?\n\nLet me know, and I'll do my best to recommend an herbal tea that complements your coffee love!",
