It can be easy to overlook those details, especially when you're excited about a new purchase.\n\nIf you're curious about the brand, you can always check the packaging or the case itself for the brand name or logo. You can also try searching online for \"clear phone case with built-in screen protector\" along with your phone model to see if you can find the exact case you purchased.\n\nAs for well-known brands, Spigen and Case-Mate are indeed popular options, but there are many other great brands out there as well. Some other popular brands include OtterBox, Tech21, and UAG (Urban Armor Gear). These brands often offer high-quality cases with great protection and stylish designs.\n\nThat being said, smaller brands can also offer excellent cases at competitive prices. Sometimes, these smaller brands can offer more unique designs or features that set them apart from the bigger brands.\n\nIf you do happen to find out the brand of your case, feel free to share it with me! I'm always curious to hear about people's experiences with different brands and products.",
