  "content": "That's a lot of great information, thank you for providing it. I think I'll focus on creating a meal plan that is high in protein and fiber, and low in processed foods and added sugars. Since I've been going to the gym three times a week, I'll make sure to increase my protein intake to support muscle growth and recovery. I'll also try to cook at home most nights instead of ordering takeout, and prep my meals for the week on Sundays. Can you give me some healthy recipe ideas for protein-rich meals that are easy to make and won't break the bank?",
