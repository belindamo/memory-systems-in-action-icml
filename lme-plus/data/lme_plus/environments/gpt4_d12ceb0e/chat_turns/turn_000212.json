Here are some pros and cons of each approach to consider:\n\n**Direct Message (DM):**\n\nPros:\n\n* More personal and private conversation\n* Can be a better way to ask more in-depth or personal questions\n* Less likely to get lost in the noise of comments on a popular post\n\nCons:\n\n* May come across as more intrusive or sudden, especially if Emma doesn't know you well\n* Can be seen as more formal or serious, depending on the tone\n\n**Comment on a recent post:**\n\nPros:\n\n* More public and can help start a conversation that others can join in on\n* Can be a more natural way to start a conversation, as you're responding to something specific she's shared\n* Can help Emma feel more comfortable responding, as it's a more public conversation\n\nCons:\n\n* May get lost in the noise of comments on a popular post\n* Can be more difficult to have a more in-depth or personal conversation\n\nConsidering you've already exchanged comments on each other's posts, I think commenting on one of her recent posts could be a great way to start a conversation. This approach can help you build on the existing connection you have and make it feel more natural.\n\nHere's an example of a comment that could start a conversation:\n\n\"Hey Emma, loved your latest post about [topic]! I've been meaning to try [related activity] myself. What inspired you to get into it?\"\n\nThis comment shows you're interested in her content, asks a question, and opens the door for a conversation. If Emma responds, you can take the conversation from there and potentially move it to a DM if you both want to discuss something more in-depth.\n\nRemember to be respectful of Emma's time and boundaries, and don't be discouraged if she doesn't respond right away or at all. Good luck, and I hope you have a great conversation! \ud83d\ude0a",
