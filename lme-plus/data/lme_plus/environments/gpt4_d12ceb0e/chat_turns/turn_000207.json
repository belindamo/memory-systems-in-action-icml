Speaking of which, I recently commented on a post from an old high school friend, Alex, about their new job promotion, saying \"So proud of you, you totally deserve it!\" and we ended up exchanging a few messages catching up about each other's lives, today. Do you have any tips on how to keep the conversation going and maybe even plan a meetup or collaboration in the future?",
