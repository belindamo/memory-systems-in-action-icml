However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to directly access or track your social media activity, including comments you've made on specific posts or messages you've exchanged with friends.\n\nBut I can offer some suggestions to help you keep track of your recent comments and conversations:\n\n1. Check your social media platforms: Log in to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other social media accounts and review your recent activity. You can usually find this information in your profile or account settings.\n2. Use social media analytics tools: Many social media platforms provide analytics tools that can help you track your engagement, including comments and messages. For example, Facebook has Facebook Insights, and Twitter has Twitter Analytics.\n3. Set up notifications: Enable notifications for comments and messages on your social media platforms so you can stay on top of new activity.\n4. Take notes: Consider keeping a note-taking app or spreadsheet to record the comments you make and the conversations you have on social media. This can help you keep track of your activity and refer back to specific conversations.\n5. Use a social media management tool: If you're active on multiple social media platforms, consider using a social media management tool like Hootsuite, Buffer, or Sprout Social, which can help you track your comments and messages across different platforms.\n\nRegarding your specific comment on Alex's Facebook post, you can try searching for the post in your Facebook activity log or checking your Facebook Messenger conversations with Alex to find the exchange.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you keep track of your social media activity!",
