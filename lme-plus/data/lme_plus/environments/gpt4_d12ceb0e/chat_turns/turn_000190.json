Congratulations on taking the first step towards a healthier and more active lifestyle!\n\nRemember, starting small and being consistent is key. 3 times a week, 10-15 minutes per session is a great starting point, and you can always increase the frequency, duration, or intensity as you get more comfortable.\n\nFocusing on bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges is a great way to build strength and endurance, and incorporating stretching exercises will help improve your flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nScheduling your workouts for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings is a great idea, as it can help you establish a routine and make exercise a habit. Try to make it a non-negotiable part of your daily routine, just like brushing your teeth or taking a shower.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and rest when needed, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a workout or don't see immediate results. Celebrate small victories, like completing a workout or increasing your endurance, and focus on how you feel, rather than just the physical results.\n\nYou got this! You're taking control of your health and fitness, and that's something to be proud of. Keep me updated on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more tips or motivation.\n\nStay consistent, stay patient, and most importantly, stay committed to your goals. You're on your way to a healthier, happier you!",
