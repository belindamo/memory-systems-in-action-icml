  "content": "Certainly! Inside the cells of Aspen, the stored carbohydrates are broken down through a process called cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, the carbohydrates are combined with oxygen, releasing energy that can be used by the cell or the entire organism.\n\nAlternatively, if conditions are right, the stored carbohydrates can be converted into energy-rich molecules called fatty acids or stored as oils for long-term energy storage. Additionally, some carbohydrates can be converted into a structural component called cellulose which helps form the tough, fibrous cell walls in plants.\n\nIn summary, Aspen, like all plants, uses carbohydrates to store energy, which can then be used or converted into other forms depending on the needs of the organism.",
