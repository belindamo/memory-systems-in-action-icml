Using the given address blocks create three separate networks each having two subnets with equal number of addresses. Connect two nodes in each subnet and configure the arrangement so that any node is able to communicate with the remaining nodes (within the subnet as well as in other subnets). Identify and analyze the configuration requirements. Verify the communication setup and reach ability with Ping diagnostic command. Your report should include the following:\ni. Network diagram for Task 1\nii. List and explain what devices are used for the setup of the network and any other configuration required\niii. Confirm the configuration is achieved according to the plan\niv. and finally Verify that each computers can communicate with the remaining computers in the subnets of the network",
