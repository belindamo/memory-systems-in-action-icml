  "content": "Aspen primarily stores energy in the form of carbohydrates, but it can also use other molecules to some extent. For example, during periods of stress or low light, Aspen can also store additional energy in the form of lipids, which are fats or oils. \n\nFurthermore, Aspen can accumulate other compounds to help it survive environmental stresses, such as polyols or sugar alcohols, which act as osmoprotectants, helping to maintain cell integrity in response to factors like drought. Aspen can also synthesize and store phytochemicals, which are compounds that can protect the plant from factors like UV radiation or herbivory.\n\nOverall, while carbohydrates are the main energy storage molecules for Aspen, the plant can use other compounds to help it survive and adapt to changing environments.",
