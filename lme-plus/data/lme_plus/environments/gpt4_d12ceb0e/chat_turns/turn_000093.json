  "content": "Certainly! Here's a summary of the batching approach for your food delivery riders:\n\nObjective: Implement a \"live batching\" system to batch a second order with an existing order for riders who are either en route to the restaurant or already at the restaurant waiting for an order pickup.\n\nBatching Approach:\n\n1. Calculate the Time-based Frustration Index: Convert the additional distance due to the second order into time using an ETA engine. This gives a measure of the additional time required to complete the batched route compared to the non-batched route.\n2. Calculate the Additional Wait Time: Determine the additional time the rider would have to wait at the restaurant for the second order based on the remaining kitchen wait time for the first order.\n3. Combine the Time-based Frustration Index and Additional Wait Time into a single metric:\n\nBatchability Time Score = (Weight1 \\* Time-based Frustration Index) + (Weight2 \\* Additional Wait Time)\n\nWeight1 and Weight2 represent the relative importance of route efficiency and wait time, respectively.\n\n1. Set an acceptable threshold for the Batchability Time Score. If the score for a potential batch of orders is below the threshold, consider it as a suitable batch.\n\nBy using this approach, you can optimize the last-mile delivery process by batching orders based on route efficiency and wait times. Monitor the performance of your batching system and fine-tune the weights and thresholds based on your business goals and customer needs. Ensure that rider capacity and package compatibility are also considered when making batching decisions.",
