I feel like I've been commenting on a lot of posts, but I'm not sure where they all are. For example, I know I commented on my friend Alex's Facebook post about their new job promotion, saying \"So proud of you, you totally deserve it!\" and we ended up exchanging a few messages catching up about each other's lives, today.",
