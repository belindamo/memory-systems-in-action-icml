  "content": "I've dabbled in some free jazz and avant-garde music, but I'm still new to the genre. I've listened to some Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor, but I'm excited to dive deeper into Coltrane's free jazz period. I think improvisation is really interesting, and I appreciate how it allows musicians to express themselves in the moment. Can you recommend any other free jazz musicians or albums that I should check out?",
