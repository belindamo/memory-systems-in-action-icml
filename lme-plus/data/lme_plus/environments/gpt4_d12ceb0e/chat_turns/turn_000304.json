  "content": "The Battle of Coral Sea was significant in World War II because it was the first naval battle in history where the opposing fleets did not engage in direct combat. Instead, the battle was fought by aircraft, as both sides relied heavily on their aircraft carriers and planes to attack and defend. The battle was considered a strategic victory for the Allies because it prevented the Japanese from capturing Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea and threatening Australia. Additionally, the Japanese carrier fleet suffered significant losses, which forced them to change their strategy for the rest of the war. The Battle of Coral Sea also established a pattern for future naval battles, which would rely heavily on air power from carrier-based aircraft.",
