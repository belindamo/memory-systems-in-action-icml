I've been using hashtags consistently across all my social media platforms, which has helped me connect with like-minded users. Speaking of which, I've had some success with my #ThrowbackThursday post on Facebook, which got 5 comments, including 4 comments from family members and old friends. I'm thinking of doing a follow-up post to keep the momentum going. Do you have any ideas for a follow-up post?",
