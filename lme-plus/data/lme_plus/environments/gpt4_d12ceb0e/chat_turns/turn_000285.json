I think I'll try the grilled chicken breast with quinoa and veggies for lunch, and the baked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans for dinner. I'll also prep some hard-boiled eggs and Greek yogurt with berries and nuts for snacks. I'm excited to start cooking and meal prepping this week. By the way, do you have any tips on how to stay motivated and consistent with my workout routine and meal plan?",
