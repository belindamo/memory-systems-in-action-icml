  "content": "You want to find a pair of high-waisted mom jeans that's similar to your distressed denim shorts, and you're hoping to snag a deal!\n\nSince you're looking for a similar style, I'd recommend checking out Zara's \"Distressed\" or \"Ripped\" jeans section. They often have a wide range of distressed denim styles, including high-waisted mom jeans with ripped knees, frayed hems, or other trendy details.\n\nTo find a discounted pair, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to Zara's website or mobile app.\n2. Navigate to the \"Women\" or \"Denim\" section.\n3. Filter the results by selecting \"Jeans\" and then \"High-Waisted\" from the left-hand sidebar.\n4. Use the \"Distressed\" or \"Ripped\" filter to narrow down the results.\n5. Sort the results by \"Price: Low to High\" to find the most affordable options.\n6. Look for prices with a strikethrough, indicating a discounted price.\n7. Check the \"Sale\" section, which often features discounted prices on previously full-priced items.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff, Zara had some high-waisted mom jeans with distressed details on sale, including:\n\n* **High-Waisted Distressed Jeans**: A pair with ripped knees and frayed hems, originally $49.90, now $29.90.\n* **High-Waisted Ripped Jeans**: A style with ripped knees and a relaxed fit, originally $59.90, now $39.90.\n\nKeep in mind that sales and discounts can change quickly, so be sure to check the website or app regularly for the latest deals.\n\nIf you're unable to find a discounted pair online, consider visiting your local Zara store. They may have different sales or promotions in-store, and the sales associates can help you find a similar style at a discounted price.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you find the perfect pair of high-waisted mom jeans!",
