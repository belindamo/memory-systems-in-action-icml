  "content": "Lab Report: Extension of Network Created in Task 1\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn the previous task, we explored the process of creating subnets for a network and extending the network using the given blocks of IP addresses: 200.128.1.0/24, 200.128.2.0/24 and 200.128.3.0/24. In this task, we were tasked with extending the networks created in Task 1 by connecting them and configuring the arrangement so that any node belonging to any network was able to communicate with any other nodes belonging to other networks. The objective of this lab was to understand the configuration requirements and verify the communication setup and reachability using the Ping diagnostic command.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe objective of this lab was to extend the networks created in Task 1 by connecting them and configuring the arrangement so that any node belonging to any network was able to communicate with any other nodes belonging to other networks. We also aimed to identify and analyze the configuration requirements for the setup, and verify the communication setup and reachability using the Ping diagnostic command.\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. We started by connecting the three networks created in Task 1 using routers.\n2. We configured the arrangement so that any node belonging to any network was able to communicate with any other nodes belonging to other networks.\n3. We identified and analyzed the configuration requirements for the setup.\n4. Finally, we used the Ping diagnostic command to verify the communication setup and reachability.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nTo extend the networks created in Task 1, we used routers to connect the different networks. We also had to configure the IP addresses and subnet masks for the routers, as well as set up the default gateway for the nodes. This process allowed us to create a larger network that encompassed all three of the networks created in Task 1.\n\nThrough this process, we were able to confirm that the configuration was achieved according to the plan. All of the nodes were able to communicate with each other within the subnets and across the different networks. The Ping diagnostic command was used to verify the communication setup and reachability, and we were able to successfully ping all of the nodes from each other.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis lab helped us understand the process of extending the networks created in Task 1 by connecting them and configuring the arrangement so that any node belonging to any network was able to communicate with any other nodes belonging to other networks. We were able to successfully set up the extended network and verify the communication setup and reachability using the Ping diagnostic command. This lab also allowed us to gain a deeper appreciation for the configuration requirements of setting up and extending a network, as well as the importance of verifying the communication setup and reachability.",
