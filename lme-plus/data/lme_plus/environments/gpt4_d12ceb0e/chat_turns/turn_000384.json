Here's a suggestion to help you complete your caption and make it even more effective:\n\n**Caption:**\n\"THEN VS. NOW From a chubby kid to a fitness enthusiast! I'm so proud of my progress and I'm excited to share it with you all. It's not about perfection, it's about progress. What's your own #ThenVsNow story? Share it with me in the comments below and let's celebrate our transformations together! #ThrowbackThursday #ProgressOverPerfection #FitnessJourney\"\n\nHere's what I added:\n\n* A brief phrase to emphasize the progress you've made, while also acknowledging that it's not about being perfect.\n* A call-to-action to encourage your audience to share their own \"then vs. now\" stories. This will help create a sense of community and engagement.\n* A final sentence to reiterate the hashtags and create a sense of celebration around the transformations.\n\nRemember to keep your caption concise, clear, and engaging. You can adjust the wording to fit your tone and style, but this should give you a good starting point.\n\nAlso, don't forget to:\n\n* Use a bold font or a bright color to make the caption stand out.\n* Add arrows or graphics to highlight the differences between the two photos.\n* Keep the design simple and consistent to make the comparison easy to see.\n\nYou're all set! I'm excited to see your post go live and inspire your audience. Good luck!",
