  "content": "Calming herbal teas are perfect for unwinding, and chamomile or lemon balm are both excellent choices. Here are a few more options that might interest you:\n\n1. **Lavender**: Known for its calming effects, lavender tea promotes relaxation, reduces anxiety, and can even help with sleep quality.\n2. **Passionflower**: A natural sedative, passionflower tea can help with anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness, making it a great choice for a calming cup.\n3. **Tulsi** (Holy Basil): An adaptogenic herb, tulsi tea is said to reduce stress, anxiety, and fatigue, while promoting relaxation and mental clarity.\n\nAll of these options are caffeine-free, so you can enjoy them any time of day without worrying about interfering with your morning coffee routine.\n\nSpeaking of which, it's great to hear you've found a new coffee blend that's working for you! Cold brew is a fantastic way to enjoy coffee, and having it black is a great way to appreciate the nuanced flavors of the beans. Chicago is known for its vibrant coffee scene, so it's no surprise you found a great blend there.\n\nIf you're looking to experiment with herbal teas, you might consider trying a blend that combines some of the calming herbs I mentioned earlier. This can create a unique flavor profile that's both soothing and enjoyable.\n\nDo you have a preferred way of brewing your herbal teas, or would you like some recommendations on that front as well?",
