  "content": "Apologies for any confusion. You're right; it's better to find a way to get distance and time onto one plane for a more accurate and comprehensive batching decision. Let's consider converting everything to time, as it's more intuitive and directly related to customer experience.\n\nAssuming you have an ETA engine that can predict the time to travel from point A to point B, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the Time-based Frustration Index: Convert the additional distance due to the second order into time using the ETA engine. This will give you a measure of additional time required to complete the batched route compared to the non-batched route.\n2. Calculate the Additional Wait Time at the restaurant for the second order, as previously described.\n3. Combine the Time-based Frustration Index and Additional Wait Time into a single metric:\n\nBatchability Time Score = (Weight1 \\* Time-based Frustration Index) + (Weight2 \\* Additional Wait Time)\n\nWeight1 and Weight2 represent the relative importance of route efficiency and wait time, respectively.\n\n1. Set an acceptable threshold for the Batchability Time Score. If the score for a potential batch of orders is below the threshold, consider it as a suitable batch.\n\nBy converting everything to time, you create a more consistent and easily interpretable measure for batchability. As always, monitor the performance of your batching system and fine-tune the weights and thresholds based on your business goals and customer needs. Keep in mind that rider capacity and package compatibility should also be considered when making batching decisions.",
