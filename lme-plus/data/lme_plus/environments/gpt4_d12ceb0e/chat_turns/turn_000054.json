Invest in retraining programs: Governments could provide funding and resources to retrain and upskill workers whose jobs have been automated. Retraining programs could include courses, workshops, and online learning opportunities to help them transfer their skills to new industries.\n\n2. Expand social safety nets: Governments could expand and strengthen social safety programs such as unemployment benefits and health care to support those who are out of work due to automation, providing financial assistance and people with physical and mental care, respectively.\n\n3. Provide wage subsidies: Governments could provide wage subsidies to companies that continue to employ workers whose jobs have been automated. This would incentivize companies to retain workers and continue to invest in their training and development.\n\n4. Create new job opportunities: Governments can introduce policies that support the creation of new jobs, particularly in emerging or high-growth industries such as healthcare, renewable energy, or technology. Government entities could also encourage SMEs to balance automation with employment opportunities to ensure the competitive advantage of businesses without neglecting social responsibility.\n\n5. Stimulate economic growth: An effective means of overcoming structural unemployment that often results from automation, governments could stimulate economic growth and create new opportunities by targeting sectors that employ high percentages of workers who lost their jobs from automation.\n\nBy implementing these types of initiatives and supporting workers who are at risk of being displaced by automation, governments can address the social and economic challenges that accompany technological advancements. Ultimately, this could help to ensure a more just and prosperous society where people will be motivated, satisfied and ready to diversify their expertise with the changing nature of work.",
