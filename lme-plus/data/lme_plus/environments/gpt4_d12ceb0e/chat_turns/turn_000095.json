  "content": "In scenarios where multiple riders are in contention for the same order and there are idle riders available, you can modify the batching approach to rank the riders based on their Batchability Time Score and availability. This will help you determine the most suitable rider to pick up the new order, whether it's through batching or assigning it to an idle rider. Here's the updated approach:\n\n1. Calculate the Time-based Frustration Index and Additional Wait Time for each rider en route to or already at the restaurant, as described earlier.\n2. Calculate the Batchability Time Score for each rider:\n\nBatchability Time Score = (Weight1 \\* Time-based Frustration Index) + (Weight2 \\* Additional Wait Time)\n\n1. Calculate the ETA for idle riders to reach the restaurant using your ETA engine.\n2. Rank all riders (including idle riders) based on their Batchability Time Score or ETA. Lower scores or shorter ETAs indicate a more suitable match for the new order.\n3. Assign the new order to the rider with the best rank, considering the business goals and customer needs. If the chosen rider is already handling an order, create a batch; otherwise, assign the new order to the idle rider.\n\nThis approach allows you to optimize the assignment of new orders by considering multiple factors, including route efficiency, wait times, and rider availability. Keep monitoring the performance of your batching system and fine-tune the weights, thresholds, and other factors based on your business goals and customer needs. Remember that rider capacity and package compatibility should also be taken into account when making assignment decisions.",
