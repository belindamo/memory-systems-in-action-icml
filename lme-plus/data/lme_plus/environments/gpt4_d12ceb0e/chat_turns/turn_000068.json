Here are some recommendations that might scratch that Asimovian itch:\n\n**Authors similar to Isaac Asimov:**\n\n1. **Arthur C. Clarke**: Like Asimov, Clarke is a pioneer of science fiction. Try his novels like \"Childhood's End,\" \"Rendezvous with Rama,\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"\n2. **Ray Bradbury**: While not strictly a hard sci-fi author, Bradbury's poetic and philosophical style might appeal to Asimov fans. Check out \"Fahrenheit 451,\" \"Dandelion Wine,\" or \"The Martian Chronicles.\"\n3. **Greg Egan**: Egan's novels often explore complex scientific concepts, much like Asimov's works. Try \"Diaspora,\" \"Permutation City,\" or \"Incandescence.\"\n4. **Kim Stanley Robinson**: Robinson's novels often combine science fiction with social commentary, similar to Asimov's exploration of humanity's future. Check out \"Mars,\" \"2312,\" or \"Aurora.\"\n5. **Alastair Reynolds**: Reynolds' Revelation Space series shares some of the epic scope and complex world-building found in the Foundation series. Start with \"Revelation Space\" or \"Chasm City.\"\n\n**Books similar to the Foundation series:**\n\n1. **Dune** by Frank Herbert: This classic novel explores the intersection of politics, ecology, and human evolution in a sprawling, complex universe.\n2. **The Three-Body Problem** by Liu Cixin: This award-winning novel explores the first contact between humans and an alien civilization, with a scope and complexity reminiscent of Foundation.\n3. **The Expanse** series by James S. A. Corey: This series of novels (and TV show) explores a future where humanity has colonized the solar system, with a focus on politics, war, and humanity's destiny.\n4. **The Culture** series by Iain M. Banks: While more focused on character-driven stories, Banks' series explores a sprawling, utopian interstellar society with a similar sense of scope and complexity.\n5. **The Long Earth** series by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter: This series explores the possibilities of parallel universes and the implications of humanity's expansion into the multiverse.\n\n**Other recommendations:**\n\n1. **Ancillary Justice** by Ann Leckie: A thought-provoking novel that explores AI, identity, and power in a sprawling interstellar empire.\n2. **Old Man's War** by John Scalzi: A fun, fast-paced novel that explores the implications of interstellar travel and humanity's place in the universe.\n3. **The Collapsing Empire** by John Scalzi: A more recent novel that explores the consequences of a flow of information and resources in a distant future.\n\nThese recommendations should give you a good starting point for your next great sci-fi adventure!",
