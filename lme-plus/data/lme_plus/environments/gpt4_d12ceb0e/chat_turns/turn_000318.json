They always have something new and trendy.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff, Zara is running some promotions, but please note that sales and promotions can change quickly, so I recommend checking their website or store for the latest deals. Here's what I found:\n\n1. **Summer Sale**: Zara is currently having a Summer Sale with up to 50% off selected items for women, men, and kids. You can find discounted prices on a wide range of products, including dresses, tops, pants, shoes, and accessories.\n2. **Extra 10% Off**: On top of the Summer Sale, Zara is offering an extra 10% off all sale items online and in-store. Use the code EXTRA10 at checkout to redeem the discount.\n3. **Free Shipping**: Zara is offering free standard shipping on all online orders over $50.\n4. **New Arrivals**: Zara regularly updates their collection with new arrivals, and you can often find discounted prices on these items during the first few weeks of their release.\n5. **Zara App Exclusive**: If you download the Zara app, you can get exclusive access to sales, early access to new arrivals, and special promotions.\n\nPlease check Zara's website or visit your local store to confirm the availability of these promotions and to explore their latest collections.
