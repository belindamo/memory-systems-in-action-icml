I think my criteria would be a market that is -\n\n\\* quickly accessible so we can learn and earn more quickly\n\\* is viable to work with as a new / small company (possibly just myself)\n\\* can easily & affordably access\n\\* is as profitable as possible (have high-value needs that are well suited to potential AI/ML tooling)\n\\* is low-risk (e.g. non-regulated, non-critical operations) such that we can learn into our work and reduce risk / effort for likely solutions we offer\n\nFirst question for this - are there any other criteria I should consider for selecting a target market",
