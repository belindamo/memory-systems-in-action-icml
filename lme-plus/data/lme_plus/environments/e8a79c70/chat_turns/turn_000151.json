  "content": "Sure, here's a recipe for an outstanding spaghetti bolognese:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb ground beef\n* 1 onion, finely chopped\n* 2 garlic cloves, minced\n* 2 carrots, finely chopped\n* 2 celery stalks, finely chopped\n* 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes\n* 1/2 cup red wine (optional)\n* 1/2 cup beef or chicken broth\n* 1 tsp dried oregano\n* 1 tsp dried basil\n* 1/2 tsp dried thyme\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* 1 lb spaghetti\n* Grated Parmesan cheese for serving\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Transfer the beef to a plate and set aside.\n2. In the same pot, add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.\n3. Add the beef back to the pot and stir to combine with the vegetables.\n4. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, red wine (if using), and beef or chicken broth. Stir in the oregano, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper.\n5. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and let it cook, partially covered, for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the sauce is too thick, add more broth or water as needed.\n6. While the sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain the spaghetti and reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water.\n7. Add the cooked spaghetti to the pot with the sauce and toss to combine, adding reserved pasta water as needed to thin out the sauce.\n8. Serve hot with grated Parmesan cheese on top.\n\nTips:\n\n* If you want a thicker sauce, you can add a tablespoon of tomato paste or let the sauce simmer for longer.\n* You can also add other vegetables, such as mushrooms or bell peppers, to the sauce if desired.\n* For a vegetarian version, you can substitute the ground beef with chopped mushrooms or cooked lentils.",
