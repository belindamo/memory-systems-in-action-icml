Can you suggest some topics for those sessions and help me fit them into the calendar? By the way, I've been doing live streams on YouTube consistently three times a week, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, at 8 pm EST, so I want to make sure the Instagram Live sessions don't conflict with those times.",
