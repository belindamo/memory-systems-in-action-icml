While community engagement and social responsibility should certainly be embraced and promoted by educational institutions, mandating it as a requirement may not be feasible or practical. Every institution operates under unique circumstances, with varying resources, priorities, and constraints. Therefore, determining how best to engage with the local community and contribute to regional development should be an individual institutional decision that promotes and aligns with their respective missions and values. However, policies, programs, and incentives can be developed to encourage greater community engagement by institutions. This can include recognition and funding opportunities for community engagement initiatives, incentivizing faculty and student involvement in the community, and developing partnerships with local businesses and organizations. Ultimately, the decision to prioritize community engagement should come from a deep-seated understanding of the importance of social responsibility and the benefits it can bring to an educational institution, its students, and its surrounding community.",
