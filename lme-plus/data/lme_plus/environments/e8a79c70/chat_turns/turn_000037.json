  "content": "There are few foods that are naturally high in vitamin D. Some of the few food sources that have high vitamin D content are mainly fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel. Small amounts of vitamin D can also be found in beef liver, egg yolks, cheese, and mushrooms. Dairy products like milk and yogurt are often fortified with vitamin D, as are some types of orange juice, cereals and plant-based milk alternatives. However, the best source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure as our bodies can naturally produce vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight.",
