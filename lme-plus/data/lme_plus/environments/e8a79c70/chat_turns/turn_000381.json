Make sure you have a clear understanding of your goals, know your bottom line, and have a plan for various scenarios. 2. Practice active listening: Active listening means paying attention to the other party and showing them that you're engaged in the conversation. This not only helps you build rapport but also keeps you focused on the discussion, rather than allowing yourself to get lost in your own thoughts. 3. Take deep breaths: If you're starting to feel nervous or overwhelmed, taking a few deep breaths can help you regain your focus and calm your nerves. 4. Remind yourself of your strengths: Before going into the negotiation, take a moment to remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments. This can help boost your confidence and prevent you from feeling intimidated. 5. Use positive affirmations: Use positive affirmations to keep yourself focused, confident, and calm. Repeating phrases like \"I am confident and prepared\" or \"I can handle anything that comes my way\" can help you stay in a positive mindset. 6. Take breaks if needed: If you start feeling too overwhelmed or anxious, don't be afraid to ask for a break. Taking a few moments to step away from the negotiation can help you clear your mind and regain your composure. In summary, practicing active listening, deep breathing, and using positive affirmations are effective ways to stay calm and confident during negotiations. Also, don\u2019t forget to take breaks if needed. By preparing beforehand, keeping your strengths in focus, and staying composed, you can likely attain a successful outcome to your negotiation.",
