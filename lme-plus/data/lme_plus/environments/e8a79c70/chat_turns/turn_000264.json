I'll make sure to consider them when creating my blog post and Instagram Live sessions.\n\nIt's great to have a neutral perspective and get feedback from someone who's not personally invested in the topic. Your suggestions will help me create content that's more informative, engaging, and relevant to my audience's interests and concerns.\n\nI'll definitely consider covering topics like:\n\n* Favorite products for specific skin types (oily skin, dry skin, combination skin)\n* How to deal with common skin issues like acne, blackheads, or hyperpigmentation\n* Creating a natural everyday look with makeup\n* Achieving a specific makeup style or trend (e.g. natural no-makeup makeup, glam evening look)\n* Tips on choosing the right shades of foundation or concealer\n* How to make the most of makeup products by using them in different ways\n\nThank you again for your help and feedback! I'll make sure to keep these topics in mind when creating my content.",
