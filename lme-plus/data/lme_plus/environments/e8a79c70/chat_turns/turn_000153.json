  "content": "Sure, here's how to make spaghetti bolognese using an Instant Pot:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb ground beef\n* 1 onion, finely chopped\n* 2 garlic cloves, minced\n* 2 carrots, finely chopped\n* 2 celery stalks, finely chopped\n* 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes\n* 1/2 cup red wine (optional)\n* 1/2 cup beef or chicken broth\n* 1 tsp dried oregano\n* 1 tsp dried basil\n* 1/2 tsp dried thyme\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* 1 lb spaghetti\n* Grated Parmesan cheese for serving\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Set the Instant Pot to \"Saut\u00e9\" mode and add a tablespoon of oil. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Transfer the beef to a plate and set aside.\n2. In the same pot, add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.\n3. Add the beef back to the pot and stir to combine with the vegetables.\n4. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, red wine (if using), and beef or chicken broth. Stir in the oregano, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper.\n5. Close the Instant Pot lid and set it to \"Manual\" mode for 10 minutes at high pressure.\n6. Once the cooking time is complete, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then use the quick release method to release any remaining pressure.\n7. While the sauce is cooking, cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain the spaghetti and reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water.\n8. Once the pressure has released, open the Instant Pot lid and stir the sauce. If the sauce is too thin, you can set the Instant Pot to \"Saut\u00e9\" mode and let it simmer for a few minutes to thicken.\n9. Add the cooked spaghetti to the pot with the sauce and toss to combine, adding reserved pasta water as needed to thin out the sauce.\n10. Serve hot with grated Parmesan cheese on top.\n\nTips:\n\n* If you want a thicker sauce, you can add a tablespoon of tomato paste or let the sauce simmer for longer in step 8.\n* You can also add other vegetables, such as mushrooms or bell peppers, to the sauce if desired.\n* For a vegetarian version, you can substitute the ground beef with chopped mushrooms or cooked lentils.",
