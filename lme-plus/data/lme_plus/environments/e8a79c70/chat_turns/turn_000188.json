San Francisco's Fairmont is an iconic hotel, and you're in a great location for exploring the city.\n\nFor a good coffee shop near the Fairmont in San Francisco, I highly recommend:\n\n1. Blue Bottle Coffee: A popular, locally-based coffee chain with a location just a block away from the Fairmont. They source high-quality beans and offer a variety of pour-overs, espresso drinks, and more.\n2. Cafe de la Presse: A charming, French-inspired cafe about a 5-minute walk from the Fairmont. They serve excellent coffee, pastries, and light bites in a cozy atmosphere.\n3. Sightglass Coffee: Another well-known coffee roaster with a location near the Fairmont. They offer a variety of specialty drinks and a bustling atmosphere perfect for a morning pick-me-up.\n\nAll of these options are within a 10-minute walk from the Fairmont, so you can't go wrong with any of them!\n\nIf you need more recommendations or have other preferences (e.g., breakfast spots, lunch options, or after-work bars), feel free to ask. Enjoy your project and your time in San Francisco!",
