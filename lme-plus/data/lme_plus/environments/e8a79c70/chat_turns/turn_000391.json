  "content": "You're welcome! My final words of advice would be to remember that negotiation is a process that requires preparation, active listening, clear communication, and the ability to adapt. Avoid letting emotions get in the way and stay calm, patient, and confident throughout the negotiation. Remember that every negotiation is an opportunity to learn and grow, whether you achieve your desired outcome or not. And don't forget to follow up after the negotiation, regardless of the outcome. Thank them for their time and reiterate what you both have mutually agreed upon or accepted.",
