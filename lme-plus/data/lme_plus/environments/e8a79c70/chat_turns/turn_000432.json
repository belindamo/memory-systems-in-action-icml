Since your boots are black, you have a versatile canvas to work with. Here are some handbag recommendations that would complement your boots nicely:\n\n1. **Neutral tones:** A neutral-colored handbag in beige, gray, or taupe will create a chic and timeless look with your black boots. Consider a soft, supple leather or suede bag with a classic design.\n2. **Rich jewel tones:** If you want to add some contrast to your outfit, look for a handbag in a rich jewel tone like emerald green, sapphire blue, or burgundy. These colors will create a striking combination with your black boots.\n3. **Metallic accents:** A handbag with metallic accents like gold, silver, or rose gold can add a touch of sophistication to your outfit. You can opt for a bag with metallic hardware, straps, or even a metallic-finish fabric.\n4. **Textured bags:** A textured handbag with a interesting pattern or weave can add depth to your outfit. Consider a bag with a herringbone, houndstooth, or boucl\u00e9 pattern.\n\nSome popular handbag brands that might fit your style include:\n\n* Coach\n* Kate Spade\n* Michael Kors\n* Tory Burch\n* Madewell\n\nAs for your discount, that's a great score! To calculate the discount, you can use the following formula:\n\nOriginal price - (Original price x Discount percentage) = Discounted price\n\nIn your case, if you got a 20% discount, that means you paid 80% of the original price. For example, if the original price was $100, you would have paid:\n\n$100 - ($100 x 0.20) = $100 - $20 = $80\n\nSo, you saved $20 and paid $80 for your boots!\n\nI hope these recommendations and math explanations help you find the perfect handbag to match your new boots!",
