In a small mixing bowl, whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt until the mixture is well combined and the egg whites and yolks are fully incorporated.\n2. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it is hot enough to melt the butter without it sizzling or browning.\n3. Add one tablespoon of unsalted butter to the skillet, and swirl it around until it covers the entire surface of the skillet.\n4. When the butter has melted and is evenly distributed across the surface of the skillet, pour the egg mixture into the skillet, and use a fork or spatula to spread it evenly across the surface of the skillet.\n5. Let the mixture cook for about 30 seconds, or until the eggs begin to set.\n6. Gently lift one edge of the omelette with a spatula and fold it over the center of the omelette.\n7.
