I've heard great things about their in-depth analysis, but I already have a bunch of other subscriptions I need to keep up with, including Bloomberg Businessweek - which, to be honest, I've been meaning to cancel because I don't read it as much as I used to. Do you think it's worth considering a digital subscription to The Economist if I'm already struggling to keep up with my current subscriptions?",
