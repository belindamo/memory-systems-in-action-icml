Can you help me come up with some ideas for Instagram and TikTok posts that would get my audience excited about it? By the way, I've been doing live streams on YouTube consistently three times a week, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, at 8 pm EST, so I want to make sure the promotional posts align with those times.",
