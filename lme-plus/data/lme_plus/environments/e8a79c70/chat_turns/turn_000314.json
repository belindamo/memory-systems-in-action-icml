This is because lenders view your payment history as a positive indicator of your creditworthiness.\n\n**Personal loan options:**\n\nYou have several options to consider:\n\n1. **Unsecured personal loan:** This type of loan is not backed by collateral, and the lender relies on your creditworthiness to approve the loan. Interest rates vary widely, but you may qualify for a lower rate with a good credit history.\n2. **Debt consolidation loan:** This type of loan is specifically designed to combine multiple debts into one loan with a single interest rate and monthly payment. Debt consolidation loans can be unsecured or secured (backed by collateral).\n3. **Peer-to-peer lending:** Platforms like LendingClub and Prosper offer peer-to-peer lending, which connects borrowers with investors. This option may offer more competitive interest rates than traditional banks.\n\n**Interest rates:**\n\nInterest rates on personal loans vary depending on your credit score, loan amount, loan term, and lender. Here are some general rate ranges to expect:\n\n* Excellent credit (720+): 5.99% - 12.99%\n* Good credit (660-719): 6.99% - 15.99%\n* Fair credit (620-659): 10.99% - 18.99%\n* Poor credit (below 620): 15.99% - 30.99%\n\n**Factors that affect interest rates:**\n\n1. **Credit score:** A higher credit score typically leads to a lower interest rate.\n2. **Loan term:** Longer loan terms often come with higher interest rates.\n3. **Loan amount:** Larger loan amounts may have higher interest rates.\n4. **Lender:** Different lenders offer varying interest rates, so it's essential to shop around.\n5. **Collateral:** Secured loans (e.g., with a home or vehicle as collateral) may offer lower interest rates than unsecured loans.\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1. **Check your credit score:** Knowing your credit score will give you a better idea of the interest rate you might qualify for. You can check your credit score for free on websites like Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, or through your credit card provider.\n2. **Research lenders:** Look into banks, online lenders, and peer-to-peer platforms to compare rates and terms.\n3. **Pre-qualify:** Many lenders offer pre-qualification, which gives you an estimate of the interest rate and loan terms without affecting your credit score.\n4. **Compare offers:** Once you've pre-qualified with multiple lenders, compare the offers to find the best deal for your situation.\n5. **Read reviews and terms:** Carefully review the loan terms, fees, and conditions before signing any agreement.\n\nBy leveraging your good credit behavior and shopping around, you may be able to secure a competitive interest rate on a personal loan to help you consolidate debt and fund your wedding expenses.",
