The FICO score is calculated based on information in your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Here's a breakdown of the five components that make up your FICO credit score and their corresponding weightages:\n\n1. **Payment History (35%):**\n\t* Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score. This component includes:\n\t\t+ On-time payments (positive impact)\n\t\t+ Late or missed payments (negative impact)\n\t\t+ Accounts sent to collections (negative impact)\n\t\t+ Bankruptcies, foreclosures, or tax liens (severe negative impact)\n2. **Credit Utilization (30%):**\n\t* Credit utilization accounts for 30% of your FICO score. This component includes:\n\t\t+ Credit card balances (higher balances negatively impact your score)\n\t\t+ Credit limits (higher limits with lower balances positively impact your score)\n\t\t+ Credit utilization ratio (ideally below 30% for each card and overall)\n3. **Length of Credit History (15%):**\n\t* Length of credit history accounts for 15% of your FICO score. This component includes:\n\t\t+ Age of oldest account (older accounts positively impact your score)\n\t\t+ Average age of all accounts (older accounts positively impact your score)\n\t\t+ Credit account diversity (having multiple types of credit, such as credit cards, loans, and a mortgage, positively impacts your score)\n4. **Credit Mix (10%):**\n\t* Credit mix accounts for 10% of your FICO score. This component includes:\n\t\t+ Types of credit used (diversity of credit types, such as credit cards, loans, and a mortgage, positively impacts your score)\n\t\t+ New credit accounts (opening too many new accounts in a short period can negatively impact your score)\n5. **New Credit (10%):**\n\t* New credit accounts for 10% of your FICO score. This component includes:\n\t\t+ New account inquiries (multiple inquiries in a short period can negatively impact your score)\n\t\t+ New account openings (opening too many new accounts in a short period can negatively impact your score)\n\n**Other Credit Score Models:**\n\nWhile FICO is the most widely used credit score model, there are other models, such as VantageScore, which may have slightly different weightages and components. However, the general principles of the FICO score model provide a solid foundation for understanding how credit scores are calculated.\n\n**Tips to Improve Your Credit Score:**\n\nNow that you know the components of your credit score, here are some tips to improve your score:\n\n* Make on-time payments to maintain a good payment history.\n* Keep credit utilization ratios low (below 30%).\n* Monitor and correct errors on your credit reports.\n* Avoid applying for too many new credit accounts in a short period.\n* Build a diverse credit mix, including credit cards, loans, and a mortgage (if applicable).\n* Avoid negative marks, such as collections, bankruptcies, and foreclosures.\n\nBy understanding the components of your credit score and following these tips, you can improve your credit health and potentially qualify for better loan terms and interest rates.",
