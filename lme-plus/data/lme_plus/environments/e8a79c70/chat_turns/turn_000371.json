Here are some tips to help you keep your strawberries fresh for a longer period:\n\n1. **Store in a cool, dry place:** Strawberries are sensitive to heat, so it's essential to store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing them near direct sunlight, ovens, or heating vents.\n2. **Keep them dry:** Excess moisture can cause strawberries to spoil quickly. Pat them dry with a clean towel or paper towels to remove any excess moisture before storing.\n3. **Use a breathable container:** Store strawberries in a container that allows for airflow, such as a paper bag, mesh bag, or a container with holes. This will help to prevent moisture buildup.\n4. **Keep them away from strong-smelling foods:** Strawberries can absorb odors easily, so store them away from strong-smelling foods like onions, garlic, and fish.\n5. **Don't wash before storing:** Washing strawberries before storing them can lead to mold and spoilage. Instead, gently rinse them just before using.\n6. **Store in the refrigerator:** Refrigerate strawberries as soon as possible to keep them fresh. They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5-7 days.\n7. **Freeze them:** If you won't be using your strawberries within a few days, consider freezing them. Rinse, dry, and chop the strawberries, then spread them out on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer. Once frozen, transfer them to an airtight container or freezer bag for long-term storage.\n8. **Use the \"first in, first out\" rule:** Make sure to use the oldest strawberries first to ensure you're consuming the freshest ones.\n9. **Monitor for spoilage:** Regularly check your stored strawberries for signs of spoilage, such as mold, sliminess, or a sour smell. Remove any spoiled berries to prevent them from affecting the rest.\n10. **Buy strawberries at the right time:** Try to buy strawberries when they're in season (usually from March to July) for the best flavor and texture.\n\nBy following these tips, you can enjoy your strawberries for a longer period and keep them fresh for your next Strawberry Shortcake craving!\n\nNow, go enjoy your freshly baked sweet biscuits and strawberries!",
