      "content": "Hitch-mounted racks are a great option for sedans, and both Thule and Saris are well-known brands in the bike rack industry. Here's a breakdown of the Thule Hitch Rack and Saris Bones Hitch Rack:\n\n**Thule Hitch Rack:**\n\n* Thule is a Swedish company that's been in the bike rack business for over 70 years.\n* Their hitch-mounted racks are known for their durability, ease of use, and sleek design.\n* The Thule Hitch Rack is a popular model that's available in various configurations, including a 2-bike version that fits 1.25\" and 2\" hitch receivers.\n* It features a sturdy, powder-coated steel construction and a tilting mast that allows you to access the trunk of your car without removing the bikes.\n* The rack has a weight capacity of 60 lbs per bike, making it suitable for most road and mountain bikes.\n* Thule's Hitch Rack is easy to install and comes with a built-in cable lock and strap system to secure the bikes.\n* Price: Around $300-$400, depending on the configuration and features.\n\n**Saris Bones Hitch Rack:**\n\n* Saris is a US-based company that's been in the bike rack business for over 30 years.\n* Their Bones Hitch Rack is a highly rated model that's known for its durability, ease of use, and affordability.\n* The Bones Hitch Rack is available in various configurations, including a 2-bike version that fits 1.25\" and 2\" hitch receivers.\n* It features a strong, rust-resistant steel construction and a tilting mast that allows you to access the trunk of your car without removing the bikes.\n* The rack has a weight capacity of 35 lbs per bike, making it suitable for most road bikes and smaller mountain bikes.\n* Saris' Bones Hitch Rack is easy to install and comes with a built-in strap system to secure the bikes.\n* Price: Around $200-$300, depending on the configuration and features.\n\n**Main differences:**\n\n* Weight capacity: Thule's Hitch Rack has a higher weight capacity per bike (60 lbs) compared to Saris' Bones Hitch Rack (35 lbs).\n* Construction: Thule's rack has a more premium, powder-coated steel construction, while Saris' rack has a rust-resistant steel construction.\n* Price: Saris' Bones Hitch Rack is generally more affordable than Thule's Hitch Rack.\n* Features: Thule's rack comes with a built-in cable lock, while Saris' rack does not.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBoth racks are high-quality options, but I'd recommend the Thule Hitch Rack if:\n\n* You have heavier bikes (e.g., e-bikes or downhill mountain bikes) that exceed the 35 lb weight capacity of the Saris rack.\n* You want a more premium, durable construction with a powder-coated finish.\n* You're willing to pay a bit more for a rack with a built-in cable lock and strap system.\n\nOn the other hand, I'd recommend the Saris Bones Hitch Rack if:\n\n* You're on a tighter budget and want a reliable, easy-to-use hitch-mounted rack.\n* You have smaller or lighter bikes that fit within the 35 lb weight capacity.\n* You don't mind the slightly lower weight capacity and lack of built-in cable lock.\n\nUltimately, both racks are great options, and you can't go wrong with either one. I hope this helps you make an informed decision!"

Do you think I should get a bike rack that's specifically designed for carrying bikes with non-standard saddles, or would a regular hitch-mounted rack be okay?"

      "content": "I'm glad to hear that your new saddle is making a difference in your riding comfort!\n\nRegarding your question, it's great that you're thinking about the compatibility of your bike with a hitch-mounted rack. Since you have a non-standard saddle, it's essential to consider a rack that can accommodate your bike's unique features.\n\nMost hitch-mounted racks are designed to carry bikes with standard saddles and seatposts. However, some racks are more adaptable than others, and some manufacturers offer specific models or accessories that cater to bikes with non-standard saddles.\n\nIf your saddle is significantly larger or has a unique shape that might interfere with the rack's cradles or straps, you might want to consider a rack that's specifically designed for carrying bikes with non-standard saddles. These racks often have more adjustable cradles, extra-long straps, or specialized clamps that can accommodate a wider range of saddle shapes and sizes.\n\nThat being said, if your saddle is only slightly different from a standard saddle, a regular hitch-mounted rack might still work for you. You can try the following:\n\n1. Check the rack's specifications: Look for racks with adjustable cradles, extra-long straps, or clamps that can accommodate a range of saddle sizes.\n2. Measure your saddle: Take precise measurements of your saddle's width, height, and shape to ensure it will fit within the rack's cradles.\n3. Contact the manufacturer: Reach out to the rack manufacturer's customer support and provide them with your saddle's measurements. They can advise on the best rack model or accessories for your specific bike.\n4. Read reviews and forums: Research online reviews, forums, and cycling communities to see if other riders with similar saddles have successfully used a particular rack model.\n\nSome popular hitch-mounted racks that are known for their adaptability and can accommodate non-standard saddles include:\n\n* Thule's Hitch Rack (which you're already considering)\n* Saris' Bones Hitch Rack\n* Kuat's NV 2.0 Hitch Rack\n* Yakima's FullBack Hitch Rack\n\nRemember to double-check the rack's compatibility with your bike before making a purchase. If you're still unsure, you can always consult with a local bike shop or a cycling expert for personalized advice."

I don't want to risk damaging my new saddle or the rack itself. Do you think I should also consider a bike rack with a tilting feature, so I can easily access the trunk of my car without removing the bikes?"

      "content": "That's a great decision! Playing it safe is always the best approach when it comes to protecting your bike and rack.\n\nRegarding the tilting feature, it's a fantastic option to consider, especially if you plan to use the rack frequently. A tilting feature allows you to tilt the rack down towards the ground, giving you easy access to the trunk of your car without having to remove the bikes. This can be a huge convenience, especially if you need to grab something from the trunk while you're out on a ride.\n\nHere are some benefits of a tilting bike rack:\n\n1. **Easy trunk access**: As mentioned, a tilting rack makes it easy to access the trunk of your car without removing the bikes.\n2. **Convenience**: You can quickly grab something from the trunk, such as a spare tube, tire levers, or a snack, without having to unload the bikes.\n3. **Reduced strain**: Tilting the rack reduces the strain on your back and arms when loading or unloading bikes, as you don't have to lift them as high.\n4. **Increased clearance**: A tilting rack can provide more clearance between the bikes and the car, making it easier to load and unload bikes, especially if you have a larger or heavier bike.\n\nWhen shopping for a tilting bike rack, look for the following features:\n\n1. **Smooth tilting mechanism**: A rack with a smooth, easy-to-use tilting mechanism will make it simple to access the trunk.\n2. **Secure locking system**: Ensure the rack has a secure locking system to prevent the bikes from falling off or being stolen when the rack is tilted.\n3. **Stable design**: A stable, sturdy rack design is essential to prevent the rack from wobbling or tipping over when tilted.\n4. **Adjustable tilting angles**: Some racks offer adjustable tilting angles, allowing you to customize the position of the rack to suit your needs.\n\nMany hitch-mounted racks, including those from Thule, Saris, and Kuat, offer tilting features. Be sure to check the product specifications and reviews to ensure the rack you choose meets your needs.\n\nRemember to also consider the weight capacity, bike compatibility, and other features we discussed earlier when selecting a rack."
