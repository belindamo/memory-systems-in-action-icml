      "content": "The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is a tax credit designed to encourage businesses to keep their employees on payroll during difficult economic times, including the COVID-19 pandemic. It is available to eligible employers who experienced a significant decline in gross receipts or were partially or fully suspended due to government orders related to COVID-19.\n\nThe ERC is a refundable tax credit, which means that eligible employers can receive a refund if the credit exceeds their tax liability. The credit is equal to 70% of qualified wages paid to each eligible employee, up to a maximum of $10,000 per employee per quarter. This means that the maximum credit per employee is $28,000 for 2021.\n\nTo be eligible for the ERC, an employer must have experienced a significant decline in gross receipts or been partially or fully suspended due to government orders related to COVID-19. The decline in gross receipts must be at least 20% in 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2019, or the employer must have been fully or partially suspended due to government orders related to COVID-19.\n\nSmall or medium privately owned businesses can benefit greatly from the ERC. The credit can help offset the cost of keeping employees on payroll during difficult economic times, which can be especially helpful for businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. To claim the ERC, eligible employers must file Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, with the IRS. It is recommended that business owners consult with a tax professional to determine their eligibility and the amount of credit they may be eligible to receive."
