A study showed that the CSI is a relatively tight function of the ratio of impact factors of journals being compared and grows slowly as a function of the impact factor ratio [[3], 2017, T.

Another study found that the lognormal distribution of citation counts is the reason for the relation between impact factors and the CSI [[1], 2018, Zhesi Shen and Jinshan Wu]. The CSI provides an intuitive pair-wise comparison metric for evaluating journals, which can be useful in"

It measures the probability that a random paper in one journal has more citations than a random paper in another journal, with 50% indicating that the two journals perform equally well. Unlike the journal impact factor (IF), which is based on the number of citations received by a journal's articles in a given year divided by the total number of articles published in the two preceding years, the citation success index depends on the broadness and the shape of citation distributions. It is a relatively tight function of the ratio of IFs of journals being compared, with the citation success index growing slowly as a function of IF ratio. The lognormal distribution of citation counts is the reason for the relation between Impact Factors and Citation Success Index [[1, 2018, Shen and Wu](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e3cb33e592162e469fd902b47e5ad0c1572080c)].
