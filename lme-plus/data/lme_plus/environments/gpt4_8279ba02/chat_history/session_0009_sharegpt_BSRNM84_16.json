US inflation may have hit a 31-year high in October. But consumers are still eager to spend.\nThis should be good news for Walmart. The world\u2019s biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer reported strong third-quarter sales and raised its full-year outlook. Supply-chain disruptions and fears of empty shelves are prompting many Americans to get a head start on their holiday shopping.\nDo not be fooled by the topline growth. There are reasons that shares in Walmart have gone nowhere this year. The stock is down 3 per cent, compared with the 48 per cent gains at rivals Target and Home Depot.\nTo ensure that its shelves are stocked for the holidays, Walmart has taken drastic measures, including using air freight and chartering its own cargo ships. This has helped it to increase US inventory 11.5 per cent in the quarter.\nThat has come at a cost. Gross quarterly margins fell 42 basis points to 24.6 per cent. This compares with 34.1 per cent at Home Depot and the 30 per cent posted by Target.\nPressure will persist. Labour shortages mean low-wage Walmart will need to pay up for workers. Home Depot sells bulky items that cannot be readily ordered from Amazon. Target has strong in-house brands that help protect margins. But Walmart is more exposed to the inflationary squeeze.\nMany of the products it carries can readily be bought elsewhere.\nWalmart still trades at a premium to Target, which is on 21 times forward earnings. But the\nvaluation has fallen from 27 to 23 times over the past year.\nTo break out of rangebound trading, Walmart will have to find new sources of growth. Potential\ncatalysts include Walmart\u2019s ad unit and its marketplace business where third-party vendors sell their wares. Walmart, once written off as a doomed physical retailer, has staged a remarkable recovery. The era of rising inflation means another reinvention is required.\n\u8bf7\u7528\u5230\u4e0a\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u7248\u5b8c\u6210\u8fd9\u9053\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u7528\u82f1\u65872 / 2"

The retailer reported strong third-quarter sales and raised its full-year outlook, but its stock has not performed as well as its rivals. Walmart has taken drastic measures to ensure its shelves are stocked for the holidays, but this has come at a cost. Gross quarterly margins fell 42 basis points to 24.6%, compared to Home Depot's 34.1% and Target's 30%. Labor shortages and the inflationary squeeze will continue to pressure Walmart, which is more exposed than its competitors. To find new sources of growth, Walmart could leverage its ad unit and marketplace business with third-party vendors.\n\nTemplate:\nTitle: [Article Title]\n\nSummary:\n\n1.

      "content": "One question that I am concerned about in financial economics is the potential impact of climate change on financial markets and the global economy. As the world experiences more frequent and severe climate-related events, such as floods, wildfires, and hurricanes, these events could cause significant financial losses for individuals, businesses, and governments, which could in turn affect financial markets and the broader economy.\n\nAnother related question is how financial institutions can effectively manage and mitigate climate-related risks in their investment portfolios and lending practices. For example, how can banks and asset managers incorporate climate risk assessments into their investment decision-making processes, and what measures can they take to reduce exposure to climate-related risks?\n\nOverall, I believe that addressing these questions is important for ensuring the stability and sustainability of the global financial system in the face of ongoing climate change."
