He replied to the email and said-\n\nLooking over the terms, salary, benefits, and speaking with my wife, this offer would be a step back for me from my current employment. Would UNG be able to increase the salary?\n\nCompose a reply to him and explain that UNG feels that the offer that was sent to him is on par for his experience and knowledge and that we are not able to increase the salary. He currently works for the state at a school district and he receives more PTO and better insurance benefits since he works for the state. Explain to him that unfortunately we are not able to compete with the state in regards to the PTO and insurance benefits."
