  "content": "That's a lot of great ideas! For the photo booth, I think I'll go with a basketball court backdrop and provide some funny props like basketball-themed accessories and inflatable basketballs. I'll also set up a \"coach's corner\" with a clipboard and have the team take turns giving each other advice or drawing up plays. Can you suggest some ideas for a customized banner to hang in the background? Something that will make the photos even more special and memorable.",
