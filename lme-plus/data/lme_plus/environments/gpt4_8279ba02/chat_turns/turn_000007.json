However, the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) may have publicly available data on this topic.\n\nYou can access the CSDE's Data and Reporting webpage to find statistics on student outcomes in Bridgeport, including achievement gaps across demographic groups. Additionally, the CSDE\u2019s School Performance Explorer allows you to compare student achievement data from district to district and school to school.\n\nYou may also want to reach out to Bridgeport Public Schools administration or local organizations directly associated with education to see if they have any data or statistics on the effectiveness of specific initiatives or strategies to close the achievement gap. By examining multiple sources of data and information, you can gain a better understanding of the progress being made in minimizing the achievement gap in Bridgeport's public schools.",
