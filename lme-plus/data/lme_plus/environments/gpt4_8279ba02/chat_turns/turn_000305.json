It's wonderful that you're thinking of ways to make him feel more comfortable and secure while you're away.\n\nA bed with a hood or canopy can be a great option for Max, especially since he seems to miss you when you're away. The enclosed space can provide a sense of security and comfort, which might help him feel more relaxed and calm when you're not there.\n\nIt's completely normal for dogs to miss their owners, and it's great that you're acknowledging Max's feelings. By providing him with a cozy and comfortable space, you can help him feel more at ease when you're away.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when choosing a bed with a hood or canopy:\n\n1. **Size**: Make sure the bed is large enough for Max to comfortably fit in, with enough room to turn around and stretch out.\n2. **Material**: Choose a bed with a soft, plush material that will provide comfort and support for Max's joints.\n3. **Breathability**: Look for a bed with good airflow to prevent overheating and keep Max cool.\n4. **Easy cleaning**: Consider a bed with a removable cover that's easy to wash and dry.\n\nIn addition to the bed, you might also want to consider leaving a familiar object with your scent, such as a blanket or toy, to provide Max with a sense of comfort and reassurance when you're away.\n\nIt's also great that you've been working on leaving Max alone for short periods. Gradually increasing the time you're away will help him get used to being alone, and eventually, he'll learn to relax and enjoy his alone time.\n\nRemember to reward Max with treats and praise when you return, and try to make your departures and arrivals low-key to minimize anxiety. With patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement, Max will learn to feel more comfortable when you're away.\n\nHow do you think Max will like the new bed, and do you have any other questions about helping him adjust to being alone?",
