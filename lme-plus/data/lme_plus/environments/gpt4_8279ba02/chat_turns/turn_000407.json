I don't need to keep track of progress or notes while \"reading\" because I can access and recall information instantly.\n\nHowever, I can suggest that many readers find a combination of methods works best for them. For example, using a physical bookmark with a ribbon to keep their place, while also taking digital notes or using a reading journal to reflect on their thoughts and feelings.\n\nSome readers might prefer a more visual approach, like creating a Pinterest board or a mind map to organize their thoughts and connections. Others might enjoy using a reading log or tracker to monitor their progress and stay motivated.\n\nUltimately, the best method is the one that feels most comfortable and enjoyable to you. Experiment with different approaches, and don't be afraid to mix and match until you find what works best for your reading style.\n\nNow, I'm curious \u2013 how do you plan to keep track of your progress and notes while reading The Night Circus?",
