The Guardian publishes articles daily, so I'd need to know the year of the article you're referring to.\n2. Without more context or details about the article, it's challenging for me to pinpoint the specific breakthrough you're interested in.\n\nCould you please provide more information or clarify the following:\n\n* The year of the article (approximate is okay, e.g., 2020, 2022, etc.)\n* A brief summary or keywords from the article that you remember\n* The topic or field of science the breakthrough is related to (e.g., biology, physics, astronomy, etc.)\n\nOnce I have more context, I'll do my best to help you find the information you're looking for!",
