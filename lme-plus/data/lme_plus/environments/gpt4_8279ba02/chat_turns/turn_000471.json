  "content": "I've been noticing that I tend to splurge on luxury items, especially when it comes to clothing and accessories, but I'm trying to cut back on unnecessary expenses. For my birthday last month, I treated myself to a designer watch for $800, which is a special occasion. I know it's a lot, but it's something I've always wanted, and I figured it was a good excuse to indulge. Can you suggest some affordable alternatives to luxury brands for clothing and accessories, so I can still look stylish without breaking the bank?",
