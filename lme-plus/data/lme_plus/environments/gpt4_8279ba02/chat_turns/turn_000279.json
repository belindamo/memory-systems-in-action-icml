  "content": "I'm glad you enjoyed the workshop at Dance Fusion! Since you're looking for traditional bachata classes, I'll assume you're looking for more authentic, Dominican-style bachata instruction.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to specific studios or instructors in your area. However, I can suggest a few ways to find traditional bachata classes or instructors:\n\n1. **Ask the instructor from Dance Fusion**: Since you enjoyed the workshop, ask the instructor if they offer regular traditional bachata classes or know of other instructors who do. They might be able to recommend someone or provide guidance.\n2. **Check with local Latin dance studios**: Reach out to other Latin dance studios in your area that offer salsa, cha cha, or other styles. They might have instructors who teach traditional bachata or know someone who does.\n3. **Search online**: Look for studios or instructors in your area who specialize in traditional bachata. You can use online directories like Google Maps or reviews websites like Yelp to find studios or instructors with good reputations.\n4. **Facebook groups or online forums**: Join local dance groups or forums on Facebook or other platforms and ask about traditional bachata classes or instructors in your area.\n\nSome questions to ask when searching for a traditional bachata instructor or studio:\n\n* What style of bachata do they teach (traditional, urban, fusion)?\n* What's their experience with traditional bachata?\n* Do they have a focus on technique, footwork, and musicality?\n* What's the class structure and format like (group, private, workshop-style)?\n* Do they have any experience teaching beginners or intermediate dancers?\n\nBy asking these questions, you can find an instructor or studio that fits your needs and helps you improve your traditional bachata skills.",
