Here are some tips to consider:\n\n* **Treats:** Use high-value treats that are small enough to fit inside the puzzle toy. You can use pieces of cooked chicken, cheese, or even canned dog food. Treats can be more motivating for Max, but be sure to choose low-calorie options to avoid overfeeding.\n* **Kibble:** Use Max's regular kibble to fill the puzzle toy. This can be a great way to make mealtime more engaging and fun. You can also mix in some treats with the kibble for added motivation.\n\n**How often to give the puzzle toy:**\nIt's essential to introduce the puzzle toy gradually to prevent overwhelming Max. Here's a suggested schedule:\n\n* **Initial introduction:** Start by giving Max the puzzle toy 1-2 times a week, with short sessions (5-10 minutes) to help him get used to the toy and learn how to use it.\n* **Gradually increase frequency:** As Max becomes more comfortable with the puzzle toy, you can increase the frequency to 3-4 times a week, with longer sessions (15-30 minutes).\n* **Rotate puzzle toys:** To keep things interesting, rotate the puzzle toys every few days or weeks. This will prevent Max from getting bored with the same toy and challenge him to learn new problem-solving skills.\n\n**Tips for using puzzle toys:**\n\n* **Supervise:** Always supervise Max when introducing a new puzzle toy to ensure he's using it correctly and not getting frustrated.\n* **Start easy:** Begin with simpler puzzle toys and gradually move to more challenging ones as Max becomes more confident.\n* **Encourage problem-solving:** Let Max figure out how to get the treats or kibble out of the puzzle toy. Avoid helping him too much, as this can reduce the challenge and fun.\n* **Clean the toy:** Regularly clean the puzzle toy to prevent bacterial growth and keep Max healthy.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can help Max enjoy the puzzle toy and provide him with a fun and engaging way to stay mentally stimulated.",
