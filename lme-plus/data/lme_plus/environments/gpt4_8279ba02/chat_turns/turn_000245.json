Here is a new comic strip for Calvin and Hobbes:\n\nCalvin and Hobbes are sitting on the couch, looking bored.\n\nCalvin: \"There's nothing to do.\"\n\nHobbes: \"Why don't we invent something?\"\n\nCalvin: \"Like what?\"\n\nHobbes: \"I don't know. How about a machine that turns thoughts into reality?\"\n\nCalvin's eyes light up.\n\nCalvin: \"That would be amazing! We could wish for anything we want and it would just appear!\"\n\nHobbes: \"Well, we'd have to be careful what we wish for. We don't want to turn the world into chaos.\"\n\nCalvin: \"Right. We could use it for good. We could wish for world peace, or an end to hunger and poverty.\"\n\nHobbes: \"That sounds like a great idea. Let's get to work on building the thought machine!\"\n\nCalvin and Hobbes jump up from the couch and run to the garage to start building.\n\nCalvin: \"This is going to be the best invention ever!\"\n\nHobbes: \"I can't wait to see what we come up with!\"",
