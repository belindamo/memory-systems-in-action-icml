With that information, I can try to help you narrow down the search.\n\nSince the author is a famous woman who has written several bestselling novels, it's possible that the review mentioned her previous works or her reputation in the literary world.\n\nHere's an updated approach to find the book review:\n\n1. **Search for prominent female authors**: Think about popular female authors who have written bestselling novels in the past. Some examples might include:\n\t* Celeste Ng\n\t* Emily Giffin\n\t* Jennifer Weiner\n\t* Jodi Picoult\n\t* Liane Moriarty\n\t* Paula Hawkins\n\t* Taylor Jenkins Reid\n2. **Check their recent releases**: Look up the recent releases from these authors (or any others you think might match) and see if any of them have written a novel that fits the description you mentioned (family drama, great characters, etc.).\n3. **Search online reviews**: Use search engines or book review websites to look for reviews of these authors' recent releases. You can filter the results by date to focus on reviews published around March 26th, 2023.\n4. **Check The Washington Post's book reviews**: Visit The Washington Post's website and search for book reviews published in the Sunday edition around March 26th, 2023. Look for reviews of novels by female authors that match the description you mentioned.\n\nIf you're still having trouble finding the review, I can try to help you brainstorm more search terms or strategies.\n\nDo you have any favorite authors or genres that might help us narrow down the search?",
