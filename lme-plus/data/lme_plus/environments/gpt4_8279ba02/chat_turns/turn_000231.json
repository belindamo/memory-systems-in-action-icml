Here's a format you can follow:\n\n**Trip #1**\n\n* Destination(s):\n* Dates of travel (start and end dates):\n* Any notable events or activities during the trip:\n\n**Trip #2**\n\n* Destination(s):\n* Dates of travel (start and end dates):\n* Any notable events or activities during the trip:\n\n...and so on for each trip you'd like to add to the timeline.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a calendar event for each trip. Would you like the events to be in a specific format (e.g. Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, or just a plain text list)?",
