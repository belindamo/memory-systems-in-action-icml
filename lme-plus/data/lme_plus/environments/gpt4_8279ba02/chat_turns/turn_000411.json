Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Check your Expedia account**: Log in to your Expedia account to review your booking details and outstanding balance.\n2. **Payment options**: Expedia typically accepts various payment methods, including credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.), PayPal, and sometimes even bank transfers or online banking.\n3. **Credit card vs. PayPal**: Both credit cards and PayPal are secure payment options. If you have a rewards credit card, using it might be a good idea to earn points or miles. PayPal, on the other hand, offers an additional layer of protection and buyer protection.\n4. **Follow Expedia's instructions**: Expedia will provide specific payment instructions, including any deadlines or requirements for settling the outstanding balance.\n\n**Power sockets in Japan:**\n\nJapan uses different power sockets and voltage requirements than many countries, so it's essential to be prepared:\n\n1. **Type A power sockets**: Japan uses Type A power sockets, which are identical to those found in the United States. They have two parallel flat prongs.\n2. **Voltage and frequency**: Japan's electrical grid operates at 100V, 50Hz (in eastern Japan) and 60Hz (in western Japan). This is different from many countries, including the US, which uses 120V, 60Hz.\n3. **Adapters and converters**: If your devices aren't compatible with 100V, you'll need a voltage converter. If your device has a different plug type, you'll need a physical adapter. You can buy these at electronics stores or online.\n4. **Dual-voltage devices**: Many modern devices, such as laptops and phone chargers, are designed for dual-voltage use (100-240V). Check your device's documentation to see if it's compatible with Japan's voltage.\n\nRemember to pack the necessary adapters and converters to keep your devices charged and functional during your trip to Japan!",
