  "content": "Hitch-mounted racks are a great option for sedans, and both Thule and Saris are well-known brands in the bike rack industry. Here's a breakdown of the Thule Hitch Rack and Saris Bones Hitch Rack:\n\n**Thule Hitch Rack:**\n\n* Thule is a Swedish company that's been in the bike rack business for over 70 years.\n* Their hitch-mounted racks are known for their durability, ease of use, and sleek design.\n* The Thule Hitch Rack is a popular model that's available in various configurations, including a 2-bike version that fits 1.25\" and 2\" hitch receivers.\n* It features a sturdy, powder-coated steel construction and a tilting mast that allows you to access the trunk of your car without removing the bikes.\n* The rack has a weight capacity of 60 lbs per bike, making it suitable for most road and mountain bikes.\n* Thule's Hitch Rack is easy to install and comes with a built-in cable lock and strap system to secure the bikes.\n* Price: Around $300-$400, depending on the configuration and features.\n\n**Saris Bones Hitch Rack:**\n\n* Saris is a US-based company that's been in the bike rack business for over 30 years.\n* Their Bones Hitch Rack is a highly rated model that's known for its durability, ease of use, and affordability.\n* The Bones Hitch Rack is available in various configurations, including a 2-bike version that fits 1.25\" and 2\" hitch receivers.\n* It features a strong, rust-resistant steel construction and a tilting mast that allows you to access the trunk of your car without removing the bikes.\n* The rack has a weight capacity of 35 lbs per bike, making it suitable for most road bikes and smaller mountain bikes.\n* Saris' Bones Hitch Rack is easy to install and comes with a built-in strap system to secure the bikes.\n* Price: Around $200-$300, depending on the configuration and features.\n\n**Main differences:**\n\n* Weight capacity: Thule's Hitch Rack has a higher weight capacity per bike (60 lbs) compared to Saris' Bones Hitch Rack (35 lbs).\n* Construction: Thule's rack has a more premium, powder-coated steel construction, while Saris' rack has a rust-resistant steel construction.\n* Price: Saris' Bones Hitch Rack is generally more affordable than Thule's Hitch Rack.\n* Features: Thule's rack comes with a built-in cable lock, while Saris' rack does not.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBoth racks are high-quality options, but I'd recommend the Thule Hitch Rack if:\n\n* You have heavier bikes (e.g., e-bikes or downhill mountain bikes) that exceed the 35 lb weight capacity of the Saris rack.\n* You want a more premium, durable construction with a powder-coated finish.\n* You're willing to pay a bit more for a rack with a built-in cable lock and strap system.\n\nOn the other hand, I'd recommend the Saris Bones Hitch Rack if:\n\n* You're on a tighter budget and want a reliable, easy-to-use hitch-mounted rack.\n* You have smaller or lighter bikes that fit within the 35 lb weight capacity.\n* You don't mind the slightly lower weight capacity and lack of built-in cable lock.\n\nUltimately, both racks are great options, and you can't go wrong with either one. I hope this helps you make an informed decision!",
