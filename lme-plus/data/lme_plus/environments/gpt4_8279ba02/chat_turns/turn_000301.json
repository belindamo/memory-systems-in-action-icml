  "content": "That's great to hear that you're working on helping Max get used to being alone! Mental stimulation is essential for dogs, and it's fantastic that you're looking to mix things up beyond hiding treats. Here are some new activities you can try to keep Max engaged and challenged:\n\n1. **Interactive Toy Stuffing**: Fill puzzle toys like Kongs, Tricky Treat Ball, or Nina Ottosson Dog Brick with treats, peanut butter, or canned dog food. This will challenge Max to figure out how to get the treats out.\n2. **Scent Work**: Teach Max to follow specific scents, such as essential oils or treats, around the house. You can hide the scent in various locations, encouraging Max to use his nose to find it.\n3. **Obstacle Courses**: Set up a mini obstacle course using tunnels, cones, or jumps. Guide Max through it initially, then gradually increase the difficulty level as he becomes more confident.\n4. **Problem-Solving Games**: Try \"Find the Treat Under the Cup\" or \"Which Hand Holds the Treat?\" games. These activities challenge Max's problem-solving skills and provide mental stimulation.\n5. **Snuffle Mats or Boxes**: Create or purchase snuffle mats or boxes with hidden treats or scents. These encourage Max to use his sense of smell and problem-solving skills to find the rewards.\n6. **Window Watching**: Place a bird feeder or other wildlife-watching spot near a window. Max can observe and engage with the outdoor activities while staying calm indoors.\n7. **Calming Activities**: Teach Max calming exercises like \"Sit,\" \"Stay,\" \"Down,\" and \"Shake.\" These can help him relax and focus his attention.\n8. **Food Dispensing Toys**: Use toys that dispense food as the dog plays with them, such as Buster Cubes or Outward Hound Brick Puzzle.\n9. **Create a Digging Pit**: If Max enjoys digging, create a designated digging area with toys or treats buried beneath the surface.\n10. **Rotate Toys**: Rotate Max's toys regularly to prevent boredom and keep him interested in new objects.\n\nRemember to always supervise Max during these activities, especially when introducing new toys or games. Start with short sessions and gradually increase the duration as he becomes more engaged.\n\nIt's great that you've been working on leaving Max alone for short periods. Be sure to:\n\n* Gradually increase the duration of your absences\n* Leave a familiar object with your scent, like a blanket or toy\n* Provide a treat-filled toy or a calming activity before leaving\n* Return home calmly and avoid making a big fuss over Max when you return\n\nBy incorporating these activities and continuing to work on separation training, you'll help keep Max mentally stimulated and reduce the likelihood of separation anxiety.",
