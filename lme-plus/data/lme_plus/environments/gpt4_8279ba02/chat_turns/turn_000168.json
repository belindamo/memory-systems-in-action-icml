Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n**Enhancing Colors:**\n\n1. **White Balance**: Adjust the White Balance to match the dominant light source in your scene. For a cityscape at night, you might want to try \"Tungsten\" or \"Fluorescent\" to capture the warm glow of streetlights.\n2. **Vibrance and Saturation**: Increase the Vibrance and Saturation sliders to add more color depth and richness to your image. Be cautious not to overdo it, as this can lead to unnatural-looking colors.\n3. **Color Grading**: Use the Color Grading panel to adjust the color tone and atmosphere of your image. You can create a warm, cool, or neutral look depending on your preference.\n4. **Split Toning**: Apply a subtle Split Tone effect to add depth and interest to your image. This can help separate the colors in your scene and create a more dynamic look.\n\n**Enhancing Contrast:**\n\n1. **Exposure and Contrast**: Adjust the Exposure and Contrast sliders to balance the brightness and darkness in your image. This will help make the lights and shadows more defined.\n2. **Highlights and Shadows**: Use the Highlights and Shadows sliders to recover detail in the brightest and darkest areas of your image. This can help add depth and dimensionality to your cityscape.\n3. **Tone Curve**: Use the Tone Curve to fine-tune the contrast and tone of your image. You can create an \"S-curve\" to add more contrast and punch to your image.\n4. **Gradient Filter**: Apply a Gradient Filter to darken the sky or add contrast to the buildings. This can help create a more dramatic and dynamic look.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Local Adjustments**: Use the Adjustment Brush or Spot Removal tool to make targeted adjustments to specific areas of the image. This can help enhance the colors and contrast in specific parts of the scene.\n2. **Noise Reduction**: If you're shooting in low light, you may need to reduce noise in your image. Use the Noise Reduction sliders to minimize grain and digital artifacts.\n3. **Lens Corrections**: Make sure to enable Lens Corrections to correct for any optical distortions or vignettes in your image.\n\n**Before and After:**\n\nRemember to regularly toggle between the \"Before\" and \"After\" views to see the impact of your edits. This will help you refine your adjustments and ensure you're not over-editing your image.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to enhance the colors and contrast in your cityscape photo and create a more engaging and dynamic image. Happy editing!",
