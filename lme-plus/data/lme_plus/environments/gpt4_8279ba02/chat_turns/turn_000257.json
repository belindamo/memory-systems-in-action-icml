  "content": "With those details, I can try to help you narrow down the possibilities.\n\nSince the author was a woman, and her latest novel had historical elements set in the 19th or early 20th century, I'll take a few educated guesses.\n\n**Possible Authors:**\n\n1. **Tracy Chevalier**: Known for her historical fiction novels, Chevalier often draws inspiration from her own family history and research. Her novels, such as \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" and \"The Lady and the Unicorn\", are set in the 17th to 19th centuries.\n2. **Sarah Waters**: While Waters' novels often have a stronger focus on LGBTQ+ themes, her historical fiction books, like \"The Night Watch\" and \"The Paying Guests\", are set in the early 20th century and explore the lives of women during that time period.\n3. **Hazel Gaynor**: Gaynor's novels, such as \"The Girl Who Came Home\" and \"The Cottingley Secret\", often blend historical fact and fiction, drawing inspiration from real-life events and her own family history. Her stories are set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n4. **Kate Morton**: Morton's novels, like \"The Forgotten Garden\" and \"The Secret Keeper\", often feature historical elements and are set in the 19th and early 20th centuries. She's known for her engaging storytelling style and atmospheric settings.\n\nThese are just a few possibilities, but there are many other authors who might fit the description. If none of these resonate with you, please let me know, and I can try to suggest more authors or ask additional questions to help narrow down the search.\n\nDo any of these authors sound familiar, or would you like me to continue the search?",
