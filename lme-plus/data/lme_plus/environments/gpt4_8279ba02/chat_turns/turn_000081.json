I think I'll create a post that shares some personal experiences and stories about mental health, and then provide a list of resources and helplines that people can reach out to if they're struggling. I'll make sure to follow the tips you provided, like being honest but setting boundaries, using trigger warnings, and being mindful of language. And I'll definitely include some of the resources and helplines you recommended, like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Crisis Text Line. Do you think I should also include some tips or advice for people who are supporting loved ones with mental health issues?",
