  "content": "I understand your concern, but I have to reiterate that Sakura Travel Agency doesn't seem to be a real travel agency. It's possible that it's a scam, and you may have fallen victim to a fraudulent scheme.\n\nGiven that you've already paid a deposit, it's essential to take immediate action to protect yourself:\n\n1. **Stop waiting**: Don't wait any longer to hear back from Sakura Travel Agency. It's likely that they won't respond or provide your flight tickets.\n2. **Contact your bank or credit card company**: Reach out to your bank or credit card company's fraud department to report the issue. They may be able to help you recover your deposit or prevent further unauthorized transactions.\n3. **File a dispute**: If you paid by credit card, you can file a dispute with your credit card company to try to reverse the charges.\n4. **Report the incident**: You can also report the incident to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your local authorities to help prevent others from falling victim to the same scam.\n5. **Book with a reputable agency**: Look for a well-established and reputable travel agency to book your flights to Japan. Make sure to research the agency thoroughly and read reviews from other customers before making a payment.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with unknown or suspicious entities. Don't hesitate to take action to protect yourself and your financial information.",
