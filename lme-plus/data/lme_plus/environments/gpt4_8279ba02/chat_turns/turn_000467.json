Speaking of which, I treated myself to a designer watch for $800 on my birthday last month, which is a special occasion. I know it's a lot, but it's something I've always wanted, and I figured it was a good excuse to indulge. Do you have any tips on how to take care of luxury watches to make them last longer?",
