However, I need a bit more information to narrow down the search.\n\nSince you mentioned The Washington Post, I'll assume you're referring to the US-based newspaper. Here are a few questions to help me get started:\n\n1. **Date of the review**: You mentioned \"last Sunday\", but I need a specific date or a range of dates (e.g., March 12-18) to search for the review.\n2. **Section or category**: Was the book review in a specific section of The Washington Post, such as the Book World, Style, or Outlook section?\n3. **Genre or topic**: Do you remember the genre of the book (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, biography, self-help) or the topic it covered (e.g., politics, science, history)?\n4. **Any memorable details**: Do you recall any distinctive details from the review, such as the book's title, author, or a notable quote?\n\nOnce I have more information, I can try to help you find the book review and identify the title and author.\n\nIn the meantime, you can also try searching The Washington Post's website using their search function, filtering by date, section, and keywords. You can also try searching online archives or book review aggregators like Bookmarks or Kirkus Reviews.\n\nLet me know if you have any additional details or clarification on the book review, and I'll do my best to assist you!",
