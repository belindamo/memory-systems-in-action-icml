I think I might have a breakthrough!\n\nSince you mentioned the author was a woman, and the book reading event was on February 10th at your local library, I'm going to take a wild guess: could the author be Emma Thompson, and the book be \"The Lost City\"? I know I previously mentioned that Emma Thompson is an actress and screenwriter, not a novelist, but I'm wondering if maybe, just maybe, there's another Emma Thompson who's a novelist, and you attended her book reading event?\n\nAm I correct, or am I completely off the mark?",
