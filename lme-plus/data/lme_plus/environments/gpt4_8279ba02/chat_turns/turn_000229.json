  "content": "Dear Tommy,\n\nThank you for your email regarding the offer letter for the position we discussed. We understand that the salary offered may be a step back from your current employment, however, we feel that the offer is on par for your experience and knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, UNG is not able to increase the salary at this time. We understand that as a state employee, you may receive more PTO and better insurance benefits. However, we are not able to compete with the state in regards to these benefits.\n\nWe hope that you will still consider this opportunity as we believe that you would be a valuable asset to our team. Please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
