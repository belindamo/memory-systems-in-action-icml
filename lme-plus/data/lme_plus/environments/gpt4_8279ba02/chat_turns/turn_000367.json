  "content": "In Starcraft II, Terran players typically open their builds differently in each matchup. Here are some examples:\n\nTvZ (Terran vs Zerg)\n\n- Most Terran players start with a fast expand build, which involves building a Command Center as their first building after their Supply Depot, followed by barracks and gas. They may also build a wall with supply depots and/or barracks to block off the entrance to their main base to fend off early aggression.\n\n- Some Terran players may opt for a 1-1-1 (one barracks, one factory, one starport) build, which involves building a barracks, followed by a factory and a starport. This allows for early aggression with Hellions, Banshees or a Raven.\n\nTvP (Terran vs Protoss)\n\n- In this matchup, Terran players usually start with a fast expand build, similar to TvZ.\n\n- Some players may also opt for a proxy Reaper or proxy Widow Mine build, which involves building a Barracks or Factory close to the enemy base to produce early-game units that can deal significant damage if not countered quickly.\n\nTvt (Terran vs Terran)\n\n- In TvT, players typically start with a defensive build, building up their base with Marines and Siege Tanks before expanding.\n\n- Some players may opt for a Reaper or Proxy Factory build to gain an early-game advantage.\n\nOverall, Terran players have many different build options depending on the matchup and their personal playstyle. It's important for the Terran player to scout their opponent's build to properly counter and adjust their strategy accordingly.",
