  "content": "I remember that the author was a woman, and she read from her latest novel. The book had a lot of historical elements, and I think it was set in the past, maybe in the 19th or early 20th century. I don't remember the plot or characters too well, but I do recall that the author's storytelling style was engaging and immersive. During the Q&A, she mentioned that she was inspired by her own family history and research into the time period.",
