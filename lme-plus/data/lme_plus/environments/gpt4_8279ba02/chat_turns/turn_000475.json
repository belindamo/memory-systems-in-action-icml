Since you mentioned you treated yourself to a designer watch for $800 on your birthday, I'm guessing you're open to spending a bit more for a high-quality handbag. Considering your budget, I'd recommend checking out brands like Kate Spade New York, Longchamp, or Tory Burch Robinson. They offer stylish and durable handbags with a price tag around $200-$500. If you're looking for something more affordable, brands like Zara, Vera Bradley, or C\u00f4te&Ciel might be a great option, with prices ranging from $20-$300. What's your personal style like? Do you prefer classic and elegant or trendy and bold handbags?",
