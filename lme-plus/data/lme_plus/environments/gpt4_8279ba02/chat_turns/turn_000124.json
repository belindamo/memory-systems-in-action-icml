  "content": "Title: Walmart's Response to Inflation\n\nSummary:\nUS inflation has hit a 31-year high, but Americans are still eager to spend, which is good news for Walmart. The retailer reported strong third-quarter sales and raised its full-year outlook, but its stock has not performed as well as its rivals. Walmart has taken drastic measures to ensure its shelves are stocked for the holidays, but this has come at a cost. Gross quarterly margins fell 42 basis points to 24.6%, compared to Home Depot's 34.1% and Target's 30%. Labor shortages and the inflationary squeeze will continue to pressure Walmart, which is more exposed than its competitors. To find new sources of growth, Walmart could leverage its ad unit and marketplace business with third-party vendors.\n\nTemplate:\nTitle: [Article Title]\n\nSummary:\n\n1.
