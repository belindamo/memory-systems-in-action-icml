Since you have a non-standard saddle, it's essential to consider a rack that can accommodate your bike's unique features.\n\nMost hitch-mounted racks are designed to carry bikes with standard saddles and seatposts. However, some racks are more adaptable than others, and some manufacturers offer specific models or accessories that cater to bikes with non-standard saddles.\n\nIf your saddle is significantly larger or has a unique shape that might interfere with the rack's cradles or straps, you might want to consider a rack that's specifically designed for carrying bikes with non-standard saddles. These racks often have more adjustable cradles, extra-long straps, or specialized clamps that can accommodate a wider range of saddle shapes and sizes.\n\nThat being said, if your saddle is only slightly different from a standard saddle, a regular hitch-mounted rack might still work for you. You can try the following:\n\n1. Check the rack's specifications: Look for racks with adjustable cradles, extra-long straps, or clamps that can accommodate a range of saddle sizes.\n2. Measure your saddle: Take precise measurements of your saddle's width, height, and shape to ensure it will fit within the rack's cradles.\n3. Contact the manufacturer: Reach out to the rack manufacturer's customer support and provide them with your saddle's measurements. They can advise on the best rack model or accessories for your specific bike.\n4. Read reviews and forums: Research online reviews, forums, and cycling communities to see if other riders with similar saddles have successfully used a particular rack model.\n\nSome popular hitch-mounted racks that are known for their adaptability and can accommodate non-standard saddles include:\n\n* Thule's Hitch Rack (which you're already considering)\n* Saris' Bones Hitch Rack\n* Kuat's NV 2.0 Hitch Rack\n* Yakima's FullBack Hitch Rack\n\nRemember to double-check the rack's compatibility with your bike before making a purchase. If you're still unsure, you can always consult with a local bike shop or a cycling expert for personalized advice.",
