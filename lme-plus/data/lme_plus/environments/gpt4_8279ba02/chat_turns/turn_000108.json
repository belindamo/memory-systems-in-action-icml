Here are some tips to entice these tiny, iridescent birds to visit and stay awhile:\n\n**Food:**\n\n1. **Nectar-rich flowers**: Plant a variety of flowers that are rich in nectar, such as trumpet-shaped flowers like honeysuckle, fuchsia, and lantana. Tubular flowers like salvias, coral bells, and bee balm are also great options.\n2. **Sugary water feeders**: Use sugar-water feeders with a ratio of 4 parts water to 1 part sugar. Avoid using artificial sweeteners or honey, as they can be harmful to hummingbirds.\n3. **Fresh fruit**: Offer fresh fruit like oranges, grapefruits, or bananas. Hummingbirds love the sugar-rich juice and pulp.\n\n**Water:**\n\n1. **Shallow water sources**: Provide shallow water sources, like birdbaths or shallow dishes, with fresh water for hummingbirds to drink and bathe in.\n2. **Misting**: Create a misting system or use a spray bottle to create a fine mist, which hummingbirds love to fly through and drink from.\n\n**Shelter and Habitat:**\n\n1. **Native plants**: Incorporate native plants, shrubs, and trees that provide shelter, nesting sites, and perches for hummingbirds.\n2. **Dense shrubs**: Plant dense shrubs like azalea, rhododendron, or pyracantha to provide shelter from predators and harsh weather.\n3. **Trees with flowers**: Incorporate trees with flowers, like cherry or apple trees, which provide nectar and shelter.\n\n**Other Tips:**\n\n1. **Avoid using pesticides**: Pesticides can harm hummingbirds and other beneficial insects. Instead, use natural methods to control pests.\n2. **Maintain a clean habitat**: Keep your yard clean, and avoid littering, which can attract predators and harm hummingbirds.\n3. **Be patient**: Hummingbirds can be territorial, so it may take some time for them to discover and frequent your yard.\n\n**Migration Seasons:**\n\n1. **Spring migration** (February to May): During this period, hummingbirds are more likely to visit feeders and flowers as they migrate north.\n2. **Fall migration** (July to October): As hummingbirds migrate south, they may stop at feeders and flowers to refuel for their journey.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to attracting hummingbirds to your backyard and creating a welcoming habitat for these magnificent creatures during their migration seasons.",
