  "content": "That's a wonderful idea! A personalized banner with \"Michael's Squad\" or \"Brother's Team\" will definitely make the photos more special and meaningful to your brother and his teammates. It's a thoughtful touch that shows you care about their experience and want to celebrate their team spirit.\n\nI'm glad I could help with the suggestion. Remember to have fun with the photo booth and encourage everyone to be silly and creative with the props and poses. The more relaxed and playful they are, the more natural and enjoyable the photos will be.\n\nIf you need any more help or have any other questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope the party goes smoothly, and you and your brother have an amazing time celebrating his basketball season!",
