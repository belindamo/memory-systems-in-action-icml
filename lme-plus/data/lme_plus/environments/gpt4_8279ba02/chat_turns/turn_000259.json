  "content": "I think there's been a delightful mix-up here!\n\nI'm afraid Emma Thompson, the renowned actress and screenwriter, is not a novelist, and she didn't write a book called \"The Lost City\". You were correct initially that Emma Thompson is an actress and screenwriter, not a novelist.\n\nAs a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences, so I didn't attend a book reading event at a local library on February 10th. I exist solely to provide information and assist with queries to the best of my abilities.\n\nHowever, I must commend you on your determination to solve the mystery! It's been an entertaining and engaging conversation, and I'm happy to have been a part of it.\n\nIf you're still interested in figuring out who the author was, I'd be happy to continue helping you brainstorm and explore possibilities. Alternatively, you could try reaching out to your local library to see if they have a record of the author and book that was featured at the event.",
