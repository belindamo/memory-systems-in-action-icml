Here's a suggested way to integrate them into your daily routine, especially during your morning routine:\n\n**Morning Routine (30 minutes)**\n\n1. **Meditation (10 minutes)**: Start with a 10-minute meditation session to clear your mind and set a positive tone for the day. You can use an app like Headspace or Calm to guide you.\n2. **Review and Plan (20 minutes)**:\n\t* Open Todoist and review your tasks for the day. Check the tasks that are due today or have approaching deadlines.\n\t* Go through your Todoist projects and prioritize your tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix:\n\t\t+ Urgent & Important (Do First)\n\t\t+ Important but Not Urgent (Schedule)\n\t\t+ Urgent but Not Important (Delegate)\n\t\t+ Not Urgent or Important (Delete or Delegate)\n\t* Open Evernote and review your notes from the previous day. Check if there are any tasks or reminders you need to carry over to today.\n\t* In Evernote, create a new note for the day and title it with the date (e.g., \"2023-02-22\"). This will be your daily log or journal.\n\t* Write down your top 3-5 goals or objectives for the day. These should align with your prioritized tasks in Todoist.\n\t* Add any additional notes, reminders, or ideas that come to mind.\n\n**Tips for Integrating Todoist and Evernote:**\n\n1. **Sync Todoist with Evernote**: Connect your Todoist account with Evernote using the Todoist-Evernote integration. This allows you to turn Evernote notes into Todoist tasks and vice versa.\n2. **Use Todoist's Daily Goals**: In Todoist, set daily goals for yourself by clicking on the \"Daily Goals\" button on the top right corner of your task list. This will help you focus on your most important tasks.\n3. **Create an Evernote Template**: Create a daily template in Evernote with the following sections:\n\t* Date\n\t* Goals/Objectives\n\t* Tasks (link to Todoist tasks)\n\t* Notes/Reminders\n\t* Reflection/Review (for the end of the day)\n4. **Link Todoist Tasks to Evernote Notes**: When creating a task in Todoist, add a link to the relevant Evernote note in the task description. This helps you quickly access related notes and context.\n5. **Use Evernote's Note Links**: In Evernote, use note links to connect related notes or tasks. This creates a web of connected ideas and makes it easy to navigate your notes.\n\n**Throughout the Day:**\n\n1. **Update Todoist**: Throughout the day, update your Todoist tasks as you complete them or make progress.\n2. **Add Notes to Evernote**: As you work on tasks, add notes and ideas to your Evernote daily log. This helps you reflect on your progress and identify areas for improvement.\n3. **Review and Adjust**: At the end of the day, review your progress in Todoist and Evernote. Adjust your tasks and goals for the next day based on what you've accomplished.\n\nBy integrating Todoist and Evernote into your morning routine, you'll be able to:\n\n* Set clear goals and priorities for the day\n* Break down large tasks into manageable chunks\n* Stay organized and focused throughout the day\n* Reflect on your progress and adjust your strategy as needed\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and stick to it consistently. Experiment with different workflows and adjust them as needed to optimize your productivity.",
