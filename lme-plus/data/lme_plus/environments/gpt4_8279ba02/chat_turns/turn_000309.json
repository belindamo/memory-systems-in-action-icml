Puzzle toys can be especially beneficial for dogs like Max who miss their owners when they're away, as they provide a fun and rewarding way to occupy his time.\n\nPuzzle toys come in various shapes, sizes, and difficulty levels, so you can choose one that's suitable for Max's age, breed, and cognitive abilities. Here are some benefits of puzzle toys:\n\n1. **Mental stimulation**: Puzzle toys challenge Max's problem-solving skills, keeping his mind active and engaged.\n2. **Reduces boredom**: Puzzle toys provide a fun and rewarding way to occupy Max's time, reducing boredom and destructive behavior.\n3. **Improves problem-solving skills**: Puzzle toys help Max develop his critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which can translate to other areas of his life.\n4. **Slows down eating**: If you fill the puzzle toy with treats, it can help slow down Max's eating, reducing gobbling and promoting a healthier eating pace.\n\nSome popular puzzle toys for dogs include:\n\n1. **Kongs**: Stuffable rubber toys that can be filled with treats, peanut butter, or canned dog food.\n2. **Tricky Treat Ball**: A treat-dispensing ball that challenges Max to figure out how to get the treats out.\n3. **Nina Ottosson Dog Brick**: A puzzle toy with hidden treat compartments that require Max to use his problem-solving skills to access the treats.\n4. **Outward Hound Brick Puzzle**: A puzzle toy with hidden treat compartments and adjustable difficulty levels.\n\nWhen introducing a new puzzle toy to Max, start with short sessions and gradually increase the duration as he becomes more comfortable and confident. You can also fill the toy with treats or kibble to make it more engaging and rewarding.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been working on leaving Max alone for short periods. Gradually increasing the time you're away will help him get used to being alone, and puzzle toys can be a great way to keep him occupied and engaged during that time.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about puzzle toys or introducing them to Max?",
