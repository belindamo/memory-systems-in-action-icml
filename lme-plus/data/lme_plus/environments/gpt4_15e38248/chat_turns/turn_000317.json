You can definitely replace it with a quiet time activity that helps you relax and prepare for the day.\n\n**Replacing Morning Exercise with Quiet Time**\n\n7:00 am - Wake up, stretch, and hydrate\n7:10 am - Quiet time (20-30 minutes): Meditate, read the news, journal, or simply enjoy a cup of tea/coffee in peace\n7:40 am - Get ready to head out the door (grab your bag, keys, etc.)\n7:45 am - Plan your day (10-15 minutes)\n8:00 am - Head out the door and commute to the office\n8:20 am - Arrive at the office with time to spare before the meeting\n8:30 am - Attend morning meeting\n\n**Tips for Quiet Time**\n\n1. **Keep it calm and relaxing**: Choose an activity that helps you unwind and sets a positive tone for the day.\n2. **Be gentle with yourself**: If you're not a morning person, don't feel obligated to meditate for 30 minutes. Start with 10-15 minutes and gradually increase as you become more comfortable with the practice.\n3. **Use this time to reflect**: Take a few minutes to reflect on your goals, priorities, and what you're grateful for. This can help you stay focused and motivated throughout the day.\n\nBy replacing morning exercise with quiet time, you can still enjoy a relaxing and productive morning routine that sets you up for success. Remember to be flexible and adjust this routine as needed to fit your individual needs and preferences.",
