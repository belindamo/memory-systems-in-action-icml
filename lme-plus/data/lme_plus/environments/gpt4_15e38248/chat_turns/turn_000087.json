As I mentioned earlier, it's unlikely you'll be able to bring your guitar to a music festival, and it seems like you're still excited about playing your guitar every day.\n\nHowever, I'd be happy to help you with resources for learning violin! Here are some popular books and online resources for beginners:\n\nBooks:\n\n1. \"The Violin Handbook\" by Carl Flesch - A comprehensive guide covering technique, music theory, and history.\n2. \"The Suzuki Violin Method\" by Shinichi Suzuki - A well-known method for beginners, focusing on ear training and technique.\n3. \"Violin for Dummies\" by Katharine Rapoport - A friendly, accessible guide for complete beginners.\n\nOnline Resources:\n\n1. YouTube Channels:\n\t* Violin Lessons 365: Offers a variety of lessons and tutorials for beginners.\n\t* Fiddlerman: Provides lessons, tutorials, and sheet music for violin and fiddle.\n2. Websites:\n\t* ViolinOnline.com: Offers lessons, tutorials, and resources for beginners, including a beginner's course.\n\t* TakeLessons: Provides online violin lessons with experienced teachers.\n3. Apps:\n\t* Fender Play: A beginner-friendly app that teaches violin and other instruments through video lessons and interactive exercises.\n\t* Yousician: A popular app that uses games and exercises to teach violin and other instruments.\n\nRemember, it's essential to find a good teacher or mentor to guide you in person, especially when it comes to holding the violin and bow correctly. Online resources can be a great supplement to your learning, but they shouldn't replace in-person instruction.\n\nGood luck on your violin journey, and I hope you find these resources helpful!",
