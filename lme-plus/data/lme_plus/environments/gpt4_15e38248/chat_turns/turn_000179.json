As a friendly AI, I'd be happy to help you with your query, but I have to point out that Hammy is a pig, and you mentioned you're looking for layer feed, which is typically for chickens. Pigs and chickens have different dietary needs, and layer feed isn't suitable for pigs.\n\nIf you're looking for organic layer feed for your chickens, I can certainly help you with that! There are many online retailers that offer organic layer feed at competitive prices. Some popular options include:\n\n1. Amazon - They offer a wide selection of organic layer feed from various brands, often with free shipping and competitive pricing.\n2. Chewy.com - Chewy is an online pet supply retailer that carries a range of organic layer feed options, with fast shipping and competitive pricing.\n3. Tractor Supply Co. - Tractor Supply Co. is a popular retailer for farm and animal supplies, including organic layer feed.\n4. Local feed stores or co-ops - Consider checking with local feed stores or co-ops in your area for organic layer feed options.

However, I would recommend consulting with a veterinarian to determine the underlying cause of the itching and get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Anti-itch sprays may not be the most effective solution, and a vet can provide guidance on the best course of action to help Hammy feel more comfortable.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
