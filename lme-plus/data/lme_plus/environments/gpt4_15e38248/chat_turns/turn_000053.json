It's great that you're excited about upgrading your home and prioritizing a good night's sleep.\n\nNow, let's talk about throw pillows! They can totally refresh the look and feel of your living room. Here are some tips and recommendations to consider:\n\n1. **Choose a style that complements your coffee table**: Since you've got a new coffee table, think about the style and material it's made of. If it's modern and sleek, you might want pillows with clean lines, geometric patterns, and bold colors. If it's more rustic or traditional, you might opt for pillows with softer, more natural fabrics and classic patterns.\n2. **Consider the color scheme**: Think about the dominant colors in your living room and choose pillows that complement or contrast with them. You can also use throw pillows to add a pop of color and create a focal point.\n3. **Think about texture**: Mixing different textures, like velvet, linen, or cable knit, can add depth and visual interest to your couch.\n4. **Size matters**: Choose pillows that are proportional to your couch and the space. Larger pillows can make a statement, while smaller ones can add a subtle touch.\n5. **Fill material**: Decide whether you prefer down-filled pillows for a soft, plush feel or synthetic fills for a more durable, easy-to-clean option.\n\nSome popular throw pillow styles and brands to consider:\n\n* **Modern and bold**: West Elm, CB2, or IKEA for affordable, trendy options\n* **Rustic and cozy**: Pottery Barn, Crate & Barrel, or Magnolia Home for a more traditional, homespun feel\n* **Luxurious and soft**: Faux fur or velvet pillows from brands like Anthropologie or Jonathan Adler\n* **Patterned and playful**: Society6 or Etsy for unique, handmade options with fun designs\n\nRemember, throw pillows are an easy way to update your space without breaking the bank. You can always experiment with different styles and swap them out seasonally to keep your living room looking fresh and exciting.\n\nEnjoy your new mattress and sweet dreams!",
