  "content": "Yes, you can substitute beef short ribs with chicken or pork for the Galbi marinade. You can use the same marinade ingredients for chicken or pork, but make sure to adjust the marination time accordingly. For chicken or pork, you can marinate for at least 1-2 hours, but it's better to marinate them for longer if possible, up to 24 hours for pork.\n\nThe taste won't be exactly the same as using beef short ribs, but it will still be delicious. The marinade's sweetness and umami flavor will complement well with the chicken or pork's natural flavor, and you'll still achieve the signature flavors of Korean BBQ. So don't be afraid to experiment and have fun with the type of meat you choose to grill!",
