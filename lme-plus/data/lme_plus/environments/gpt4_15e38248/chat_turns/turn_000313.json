Set a timer to ensure you don't spend too much time on planning.\n2. **Keep it simple**: Focus on the most critical tasks and priorities for the day. You can use a simple framework like the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into urgent vs. important, and focus on the most critical ones first.\n3. **Use a quick planning technique**: Try techniques like:\n\t* The \"Top 3\": Identify the three most important tasks you need to accomplish that day.\n\t* The \"MIT\" (Most Important Task): Identify the single most critical task that will have the greatest impact.\n\t* The \"Brain Dump\": Write down all the tasks, ideas, and reminders that come to mind, and then prioritize them quickly.\n4. **Prepare your planning materials**: Have your planning tools and materials ready the night before or at the same time every morning. This could be a planner, a note-taking app, or a task management tool.\n5. **Make it a habit**: Consistency is key. Try to plan your day at the same time every morning, so it becomes a habitual part of your routine.\n\nBy following these tips, you can efficiently plan your day, prioritize your tasks, and still have time to grab a cup of coffee before your meeting.\n\nHere's an updated example of your morning routine:\n\n7:00 am - Wake up, stretch, and hydrate\n7:15 am - Morning exercise (20 minutes)\n7:35 am - Shower and get dressed\n7:45 am - Plan your day (10-15 minutes)\n7:55 am - Grab a cup of coffee and head to your meeting\n8:30 am - Attend morning meeting\n\nRemember, the goal is to find a balance that works for you. Experiment with different planning techniques and time allocations until you find a rhythm that sets you up for success.",
