I'm happy to help with toy recommendations for her!\n\nGoats are notorious for their curiosity and playful nature, so it's essential to choose toys that are durable, safe, and stimulating. Here are some ideas for toys that might withstand Luna's playful antics:\n\n1. **Tough Rubber Toys**: Look for rubber toys specifically designed for goats or horses, such as rubber balls, cones, or tires. These are often made with heavy-duty rubber that can withstand biting and chewing.\n2. **Hard Plastic Toys**: Durable plastic toys like buckets, tubs, or containers with holes drilled in them can provide entertainment for Luna. You can fill them with treats or hay to make them more appealing.\n3. **Nylon or Canvas Toys**: Nylon or canvas toys, such as tug toys or stuffed animals, can be a great option. Look for ones with no small parts or loose threads that can be ingested.\n4. **Cardboard Boxes**: Goats love to play with and destroy cardboard boxes! You can cut holes in them to make them more interesting or add treats inside to encourage problem-solving.\n5. **Puzzle Feeders**: Puzzle feeders are an excellent way to challenge Luna's problem-solving skills and keep her occupied. You can fill them with treats or hay, and they come in various difficulty levels.\n6. **Climbing Structures**: Goats are natural climbers, so consider investing in a sturdy climbing structure or a wooden or plastic ladder. This will provide exercise and entertainment for Luna.\n7. **Sensory Toys**: Goats have a strong sense of smell and enjoy exploring different textures. Consider toys with different textures, smells, or tastes, such as a scratching post with rope or a treat-filled mat with different materials.\n\nRemember to always supervise Luna when introducing new toys, and ensure they're safe and free from any potential hazards. Rotate toys regularly to keep her engaged and prevent boredom.\n\nPlease keep in mind that goats can be prone to ingesting small objects, so it's essential to choose toys that are safe and won't pose a choking hazard.\n\nI hope these suggestions help, and Luna enjoys her new toys!",
