Kimchi: Spicy, sour, and salty, kimchi is a classic Korean side dish made of fermented vegetables. It's the perfect palate cleanser between bites of meat.\n\n2. Pickled Vegetables: Korean cuisine makes extensive use of pickled vegetables which make for great side dishes. Vegetables like cucumber, radish, and carrots can be easily pickled overnight with vinegar, salt, and sugar.\n\n3. Japchae: Japchae is a stir-fried noodle dish made with sweet potato noodles, vegetables, and meat (usually beef or pork). It's a great way to incorporate more vegetables and carbs into your meal.\n\n4. Korean Steamed Egg: Korean steamed egg is a simple custard-like dish made by whisking eggs, water, and a few seasonings together and steaming the mixture until set. It's a light and savory side dish that pairs well with the strong flavors of Korean BBQ.\n\n5. Sauteed vegetables: Saut\u00e9ed spinach, bean sprouts, mushrooms, and other Korean vegetables served with just a sprinkle of salt, sugar, and soy sauce make for a great side dish to complement the meaty and rich flavors of Korean BBQ. \n\n6. Korean Pancakes: Pajeon made with scallions, seafood, and other ingredients is a great choice for a satisfying and flavorful Korean appetizer to share.",
