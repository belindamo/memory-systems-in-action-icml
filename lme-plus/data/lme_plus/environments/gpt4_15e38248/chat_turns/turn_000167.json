It's great that you're thinking ahead and taking measures to protect your furniture and belongings from your mischievous kitten, Luna.\n\nThe scratch guards from IKEA are an excellent start! Here are some additional tips to help you cat-proof your home:\n\n1. **Secure loose items**: Kitten's love to bat around and pounce on small objects, so make sure to secure any loose items that could be knocked over or swallowed, such as vases, decorative objects, and small appliances.\n2. **Protect electrical cords**: Cats are notorious for chewing on cords, which can be dangerous. Use cord protectors or cord organizers to keep them out of reach. You can also tape cords to the wall or baseboards to prevent Luna from accessing them.\n3. **Block access to hazardous areas**: Keep certain areas, like the kitchen counter, sink, or toilet, off-limits to Luna by installing baby gates or barriers. This will prevent her from getting into trouble or accessing hazardous materials.\n4. **Use cat-deterrent materials**: Place double-sided tape or aluminum foil on surfaces you don't want Luna to scratch or jump on. Cats don't like the feel of these textures under their paws, so it can help deter them from certain areas.\n5. **Provide alternative scratching surfaces**: In addition to the scratch guards, offer Luna other scratching options, like a cat tower or scratching post, to redirect her scratching behavior away from your furniture.\n6. **Keep toxic substances out of reach**: Make sure to store cleaning supplies, medications, and other toxic substances in a secure, inaccessible location to prevent Luna from ingesting them.\n7. **Secure curtains and blinds**: Tie up curtains and blinds to prevent Luna from climbing or getting tangled in them.\n8. **Cat-proof your trash cans**: Use trash cans with secure lids or store them in a cabinet to prevent Luna from rummaging through the trash.\n9. **Supervise**: Always supervise Luna when introducing her to new areas or objects to ensure she's not getting into trouble.\n10. **Be patient and consistent**: Cat-proofing is an ongoing process, and it may take time for Luna to adjust to the new boundaries. Be patient and consistent in your efforts to cat-proof your home.\n\nRemember, every cat is different, so it's essential to observe Luna's behavior and adjust your cat-proofing strategies accordingly. With time and patience, you can create a safe and enjoyable environment for both you and your kitten.\n\nHow's Luna enjoying her new exploration area?",
