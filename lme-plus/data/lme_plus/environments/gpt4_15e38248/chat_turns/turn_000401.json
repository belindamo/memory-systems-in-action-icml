As they attempt to defend the choke, you can use the leverage to sweep them and take the top position.\n\t+ Scissors sweep: This sweep involves trapping one of your opponent's legs with your legs, and then using your other leg to push their other leg away and take the top position.\n\t+ Hip bump sweep: This sweep involves bumping your hips to create space and leverage, and then using your legs to push your opponent off balance and take the top position.\n* From half guard:\n\t+ Kimura sweep: This sweep involves trapping one of your opponent's arms with your legs, and then using your other leg to push their other leg away and take the top position. As you establish the top position, you can use your trapped arm to apply the kimura submission.\n\t+ Hook sweep: This sweep involves using your trapped leg to hook your opponent's leg, and then using your hips and arms to take the top position.\n\t+ Elevator sweep: This sweep involves using your legs to elevate your opponent off balance, and then using your hips and arms to take the top position.\n\nRemember to always warm up before training, and to train with a partner if possible. It's also important to listen to your body and take regular breaks to avoid injury. Most importantly, have fun and enjoy the journey of learning BJJ!",
