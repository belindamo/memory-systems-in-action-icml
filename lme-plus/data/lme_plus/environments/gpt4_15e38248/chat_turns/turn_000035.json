With the stops I mentioned, I estimate the drive would take around 20-24 hours of driving time, spread over 4-5 days.\n\nHere's a rough breakdown of the driving time between each stop:\n\n* Day 1: Virginia to Hershey, PA (approx. 3.5 hours)\n* Day 2: Hershey, PA to Amish Country, OH (approx. 4 hours)\n* Day 3: Amish Country, OH to Cleveland, OH (approx. 2 hours)\n* Day 4: Cleveland, OH to Indiana Dunes National Park, IN (approx. 5.5 hours)\n* Day 5: Indiana Dunes National Park, IN to Michigan City, IN (approx. 1 hour) and then to St. Joseph, MI (approx. 2.5 hours)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates and don't include time for meal breaks, sightseeing, and potential traffic delays. You should also factor in time for rest and relaxation, especially with kids on board.\n\nTo make the drive more manageable, consider the following tips:\n\n* Drive for 4-6 hours a day, with regular breaks for meals, snacks, and stretching.\n* Take turns driving, if possible, to share the responsibility and reduce fatigue.\n* Plan for some flexibility in your itinerary, in case you need to adjust due to weather, traffic, or unexpected delays.\n* Pack entertainment, snacks, and games for the kids to enjoy during the drive.\n\nRemember to check the road conditions, weather forecasts, and attraction schedules before you leave, and adjust your plan accordingly.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you have an amazing time on your road trip!",
