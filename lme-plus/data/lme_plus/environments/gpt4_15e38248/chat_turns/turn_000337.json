Based on your description, here are some suggestions that might add a pop of color and complement the modern feel:\n\n1. **Bold Geometric Patterns**: A geometric patterned pillow in a bold, contrasting color like navy blue, emerald green, or yellow can add a modern touch and create a stunning visual contrast with your neutral-toned furniture.\n2. **Velvet Pillows in Rich Hues**: Velvet pillows in rich, jewel-toned colors like burgundy, mustard, or teal can add depth and sophistication to your modern space. The soft, plush texture of velvet will also provide a nice contrast to the sleek, modern lines of your coffee table.\n3. **Abstract Art-Inspired Designs**: A pillow with an abstract art-inspired design in a bold, bright color can add a touch of modernity and whimsy to your space. Look for designs that feature geometric shapes, splashes of color, or expressive brushstrokes.\n4. **Metallic Accents**: Since your coffee table has metal legs, you might consider incorporating metallic accents into your throw pillows. A pillow with metallic thread, sequins, or even a metallic-coated fabric can add a touch of glamour and modernity to your space.\n\nSome specific pillow designs that might fit the bill include:\n\n* A navy blue and white geometric patterned pillow from West Elm\n* A velvet pillow in a rich, burgundy color from CB2\n* A abstract art-inspired pillow with bold, colorful brushstrokes from Society6\n* A metallic-coated pillow with a geometric pattern from AllModern\n\nWhen choosing the perfect pillow, remember to consider the size, shape, and fill material (e.g., down, polyester, or foam) to ensure it provides the right level of comfort and support for your seating arrangement.\n\nWhat do you think of these suggestions?
