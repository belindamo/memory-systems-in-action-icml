  "content": "Adding a small note or message to the necklace is a wonderful idea! It makes the gift even more personal and special. \"RHCP @ Hollywood Bowl 9/25\" is a great idea, as it specifically commemorates the concert you attended together. This way, whenever Alex wears the necklace, he'll be reminded of the amazing experience you shared.\n\nHere are a few more ideas for the message:\n\n* \"Ride the Waves\" (a nod to the RHCP song)\n* \"Hollywood Bowl 9/25/22\" (with the year, if you want to include it)\n* \"Alex & [Your Name] @ RHCP\" (a sweet, personalized touch)\n* \"Concert Magic 9/25\" (capturing the essence of the night)\n* \"Rock On!\" (a fun, playful message)\n\nKeep in mind that the character limit might vary depending on the seller or website you choose. Be sure to check the product description or contact the seller to confirm the maximum number of characters they can engrave.\n\nWhen deciding on the message, consider Alex's personality and your relationship. You could also include a inside joke or a phrase that's special to your relationship. The more personalized it is, the more meaningful it will be to him.\n\nRemember, the necklace is a symbol of your shared experience, and the message will make it even more unique and memorable. I'm sure Alex will love it!",
