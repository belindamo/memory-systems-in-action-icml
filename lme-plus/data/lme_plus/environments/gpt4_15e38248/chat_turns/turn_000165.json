Getting a few vinyl records and a vinyl cleaning kit will really make the gift special and show that you've put thought into it.\n\nAs for the vinyl records, I think it would be great to get Alex a mix of his favorite artists and some classic albums that he might appreciate. Since you mentioned he's into rock music, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication**: This is one of their most popular albums, and it would be a great addition to his collection.\n2. **Foo Fighters - The Colour and the Shape**: Another great rock album that's a classic in its own right.\n3. **Led Zeppelin - IV**: A must-have for any rock fan, this album is a staple of the genre.\n4. **The Black Keys - Brothers**: A more modern rock album that's got a great bluesy vibe.\n5. **Nirvana - Nevermind**: A classic grunge album that's still widely popular today.\n\nAs for the vinyl cleaning kit, you can't go wrong with a basic kit that includes a record cleaning solution, a microfiber cloth, and a soft-bristled brush. This will give Alex everything he needs to keep his records clean and in good condition.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to show Alex that you care about his interests and hobbies, and that you're willing to put in the effort to get him a gift that's thoughtful and meaningful. I'm sure he'll appreciate the extra effort you're putting into this gift!",
