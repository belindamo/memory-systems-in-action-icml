  "content": "The feminist movement impacted gender roles in the 20th century by challenging traditional gender norms and promoting gender equality. It led to significant changes in the roles and expectations of women in society, including greater opportunities for education and employment, the ability to own property, and the right to vote. \n\nThe feminist movement also challenged gender stereotypes and encouraged men to rethink traditional notions of masculinity. It was instrumental in raising awareness of issues such as sexual harassment, reproductive rights, and domestic violence. \n\nOverall, the feminist movement destabilized gender roles and opened up new possibilities for individuals of all genders to live their lives in non-traditional ways.",
