I'm a new conversation each time you interact with me, and I don't retain any information from previous conversations.\n\nIf you're trying to remember what you did with the report, you might want to try checking your notes, calendar, or email to see if you have any records of the meeting or the report. You could also try asking a colleague or someone who was present at the meeting if they remember the topic of the report.",
