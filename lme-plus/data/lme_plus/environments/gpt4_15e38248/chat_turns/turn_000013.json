  "content": "Title: A Systematic Review of Biochemical Sensors for Monitoring Biomarkers in Closed-loop Neuromodulation Systems.\n\nResearch Question: What are the recent advances in the development of biochemical sensors for monitoring biomarkers in closed-loop neuromodulation systems, and how do they impact the clinical applications of neuromodulation?\n\nObjective: The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in biochemical sensors for monitoring biomarkers in closed-loop neuromodulation systems. The review will explore the current state of the art in the development of biochemical sensors, and the potential clinical applications of closed-loop neuromodulation systems.\n\nMethodology: The review will follow a systematic approach, including a comprehensive literature search of relevant databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria will be based on the publication year (2018 to present) and the relevance to the topic. The selected articles will be screened, and data will be extracted, including the type of sensor, biomarker monitored, and clinical application. The data will be analyzed using a qualitative synthesis approach, and the findings will be presented in a narrative format.\n\nSignificance: This systematic review will provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in biochemical sensors for monitoring biomarkers in closed-loop neuromodulation systems. The review will be of significant importance to researchers, clinicians, and medical device manufacturers who are interested in the development of closed-loop neuromodulation systems. The findings of this review may contribute to the development of novel clinical applications of closed-loop neuromodulation systems, which may improve patient outcomes and quality of life.",
