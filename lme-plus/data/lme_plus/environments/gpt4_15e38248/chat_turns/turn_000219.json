  "content": "I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but i can say that increased representation in historical records such as the dictionary of canadian biography can have a positive impact on encouraging diverse voices to speak up and share their stories. when individuals from historically underrepresented or marginalized groups see more diverse representation in historical records, they may feel more empowered and included to share their own experiences and stories. this can ultimately lead to a greater understanding and appreciation of diverse perspectives, as well as a more comprehensive and accurate representation of canadian history.",
