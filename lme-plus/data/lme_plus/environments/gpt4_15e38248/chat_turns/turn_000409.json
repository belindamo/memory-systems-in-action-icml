Add the onion, bell pepper, carrot, peas, corn, chickpeas, garlic, tomato paste, paprika, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.\n\nStir in the cooked rice, vegetable broth, parsley, dill, mint, cilantro, basil, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.\n\nTo assemble the sarma, lay a grape leaf on a flat surface, with the stem end facing you. Place a tablespoon of the rice mixture in the center of the leaf. Fold the stem end over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll up the leaf to form a neat package. Repeat with the remaining grape leaves and filling.\n\nArrange the sarma in a single layer in a large saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover the sarma and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the grape leaves are tender and the filling is heated through.\n\nServe the sarma hot with a dollop of yogurt on top. Enjoy!",
