I've been tracking my collection's growth and expenses in a spreadsheet, and I'm curious to know how my average cost per camera compares to the market prices you mentioned. According to my spreadsheet, I've spent around $2,300 on 12 cameras in the past six months, which works out to around $192 per camera. Do you think that's a good deal, considering the models I've been able to find?",
