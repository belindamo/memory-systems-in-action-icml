Channeling her energy into positive outlets is a great way to keep her engaged, stimulated, and happy.\n\n**Tips for keeping Luna active and engaged:**\n\n1. **Rotate toys regularly**: Switch out toys every few days to keep things fresh and exciting for Luna. This can help prevent boredom and stimulate her natural hunting instincts.\n2. **Encourage vertical space**: As you've noticed, Luna loves to climb. Consider adding more vertical elements, such as cat shelves or catwalks, to provide her with more space to explore and climb.\n3. **Sensory stimulation**: Cats have a strong sense of smell and enjoy exploring different textures, sounds, and sensations. Consider adding toys with different textures, such as furry mice or crinkly tunnels, to keep her engaged.\n4. **Interactive play**: Engage in interactive play with Luna, such as chasing her around with a laser pointer or playing hide-and-seek. This can help burn off energy and create a strong bond between you two.\n5. **Food puzzle toys**: Consider using food puzzle toys to challenge Luna's problem-solving skills and provide mental stimulation. These toys can help slow down eating and reduce boredom.\n6. **Create a \"kitten agility course\"**: Set up a series of tunnels, cones, or small obstacles for Luna to navigate. This can provide a fun and challenging way for her to exercise and play.\n7. **Supervised outdoor time**: If possible, consider providing supervised outdoor time for Luna, such as in a secure, enclosed area or on a harness and leash. This can help her experience new sights, smells, and sensations.\n\n**Tips for managing mischief:**\n\n1. **Redirect unwanted behavior**: When you catch Luna engaging in unwanted behavior, such as scratching furniture, redirect her attention to an acceptable alternative, like a scratching post.\n2. **Provide plenty of exercise**: Make sure Luna is getting enough physical and mental stimulation throughout the day. A tired kitten is a happy kitten!\n3. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries and rules for Luna's behavior, and consistently enforce them.\n4. **Distract and reward**: When Luna starts to get into mischief, try distracting her with a toy or treat, and reward her for calm behavior.\n\nRemember, every kitten is different, so it's essential to observe Luna's preferences and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\nHow do you think Luna would react to a food puzzle toy? Would she enjoy problem-solving and figuring out how to get the treats out?",
