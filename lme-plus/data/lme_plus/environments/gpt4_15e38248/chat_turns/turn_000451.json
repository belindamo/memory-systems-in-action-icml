  "content": "The Seafood Peddler is a great choice for a fresh and simple seafood fix.\n\nSorry to hear that you had a terrible experience at the La Quinta Inn near LAX. A dirty room and no Wi-Fi can definitely make for a frustrating stay. It's especially disappointing when you're already exhausted from traveling.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, did you report the issues to the hotel staff or management? Sometimes, they may not be aware of the problems and can offer a solution or compensation.\n\nFor future reference, you might want to check out some alternative hotels near LAX that have better reviews. Some popular options include the Hyatt Regency LAX, the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel, or the Westin Los Angeles Airport Hotel.\n\nBut I'm glad you're taking a break from hotels and airports for now, and I hope you enjoy your meal at The Seafood Peddler!",
