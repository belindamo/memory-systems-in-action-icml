I'm thinking of planning my day around 7:45 am, but I need to make sure I have enough time to get to the office before the meeting. My work starts at 8:30 am, and I have a morning meeting that I need to attend. Can you suggest how I can adjust my morning routine to ensure I arrive at the office with time to spare?",
