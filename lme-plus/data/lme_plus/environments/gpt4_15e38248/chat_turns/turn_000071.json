  "content": "Stoicism is distinguished from other schools of ancient Greek thought by its emphasis on self-control, self-reliance, and detachment from external circumstances. Stoics believe that one can achieve inner peace and happiness by accepting what is beyond one's control and focusing on what is within one's control, such as one's thoughts, actions, and values. Unlike other schools such as Epicureanism, which emphasize the pursuit of pleasure as the key to happiness, Stoicism rejects pleasure as a goal in and of itself and instead emphasizes the pursuit of virtue and living according to reason. Additionally, Stoics believed in living in accordance with nature and the universal laws of the cosmos, rather than being driven by personal desires and passions.",
