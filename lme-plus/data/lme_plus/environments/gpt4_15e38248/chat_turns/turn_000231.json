  "content": "Obsidian is a popular note-taking and knowledge management app that can be used for a wide range of purposes, including tracking sales deals cadence. Here's a possible workflow for using Obsidian to plan and track your software sales deals cadence:\n\n1. Create a new note in Obsidian for each potential software sales deal you're working on. Give each note a descriptive title, such as the name of the company or the product you're selling.\n2. Within each note, use Obsidian's built-in text editor to write down all relevant information about the deal, such as the name of the contact person, their contact information, the product or service they're interested in, their budget, and any other relevant details.\n3. Tag each note with relevant tags, such as \"sales\", \"prospects\", or \"deals\", to make it easier to find and organize your notes.\n4. Create a new note or use an existing one to plan and track your deals cadence. Use headings or bullet points to create a clear outline of your plan, including the following:\n* A list of your prospects and their current status (e.g. contacted, interested, in negotiation, closed-won, closed-lost)\n* A timeline of your cadence, including the steps you'll take to move each prospect through the pipeline (e.g. send an introductory email, schedule a demo, send a proposal, follow up, close the deal)\n* A list of next steps for each prospect, with specific dates and action items\n5. Use Obsidian's backlinks and graph view features to visualize and navigate your notes and plan. You can easily create links between related notes and use the graph view to see the connections between them.\n6. Use Obsidian's search and filter features to quickly find the notes and information you need. You can search for specific tags, keywords, or phrases, or use the filter feature to narrow down your results based on specific criteria.\n\nBy using Obsidian to plan and track your software sales deals cadence, you can keep all relevant information and notes in one place and easily track your progress and next steps.",
