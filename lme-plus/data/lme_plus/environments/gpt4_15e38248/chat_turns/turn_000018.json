The capability to selectively and precisely\nmodulate and detect neural activities with high spatiotemporal\nresolutions represents a powerful tool for neuroscience research and clinical therapeutics. The development of advanced\nmaterials, devices, algorithms and system, as well as the ultilization of electrical, optical, thermal, magnetic, acoutis and\nchemical signals, are rapidly progressed to realize advanced\nbrain-machine interfaces. This special issue calls for Reviews, Perspectives, and Research Articles that focus on the recent developments of\nadvanced technologies for interrogating and detecting neural\nactivities. We are particularly interested in, but by no means\nlimitied to, welcoming submission that addresses the following\ntopics: \n\n1. Novel materials, devices, and circuit systems for brain-ma-\n chine interface;\n2. Electrical, optical, thermal, magnetic, acoustic and chemical\n modalities to modulate and detect neural activities\n3. Encoding and decoding algoithms for brain-machine inter-\n face\n4. Novel approaches for neurological disease diagnostics and\n therapeutics \"\n\nBrain Strom for me a topic relate to close loop, Biochemical Sensors, and, neuromodulation Systems1 / 1",
