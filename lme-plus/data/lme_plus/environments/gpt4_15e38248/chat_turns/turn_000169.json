Rotating Luna's cat tree can help keep her engaged and stimulated, as well as prevent boredom and scratching of unwanted surfaces.\n\n**How often to rotate the cat tree:**\n\nAim to rotate the cat tree every 3-5 days, depending on Luna's interest and activity level. You can observe her behavior and adjust the frequency based on her response. If you notice she's getting bored or losing interest, it might be time to switch it up.\n\n**Tips for placing the cat tree:**\n\n1. **Window views**: Place the cat tree near a window to provide Luna with a bird's-eye view of the outdoors. This can be a great source of entertainment and stimulation.\n2. **High traffic areas**: Position the cat tree in a high-traffic area, like a living room or family room, where Luna can observe and interact with family members.\n3. **Cozy corners**: Place the cat tree in a quiet, cozy corner where Luna can retreat and feel safe. This can be especially appealing for introverted or anxious cats.\n4. **Near scratching posts**: Consider placing the cat tree near a scratching post or pad to create a \"cat agility\" zone, encouraging Luna to scratch, climb, and play.\n5. **Avoid busy zones**: Avoid placing the cat tree in areas with high foot traffic, like entryways or hallways, where it might get knocked over or become a tripping hazard.\n6. **Change the angle**: Don't be afraid to experiment with different angles and orientations for the cat tree. Sometimes, a simple rotation or tilt can make the same old spot feel fresh and exciting again.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Make sure the cat tree is stable and secure to prevent it from tipping over.\n* Consider adding new toys, scratching pads, or treats to the cat tree to keep Luna engaged and interested.\n* If you have multiple cats, consider providing multiple cat trees or rotating them between rooms to reduce competition and resource guarding.\n\nBy rotating the cat tree and providing a variety of stimulation, you'll keep Luna engaged, active, and happy. Remember to observe her behavior and adjust your strategy as needed to ensure she's getting the most out of her cat tree experience!\n\nHow's Luna's personality? Is she more of a playful, adventurous kitten or a laid-back, relaxed kitty?",
