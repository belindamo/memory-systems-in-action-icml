  "content": "Jin Sook and Do Won Chang are a Korean-American couple who founded Forever 21, a fast-fashion retailer, in 1984. The couple immigrated to the United States in 1981 with the dream of starting their own business, despite facing many obstacles, including a lack of English language skills and limited financial resources.\n\nForever 21 began as a small clothing store called Fashion 21 in Los Angeles, California. The store offered trendy, affordable clothing for young women and quickly gained popularity, allowing the Changs to expand their business and open additional locations. In 1995, the company was renamed Forever 21, and it continued to grow rapidly, eventually expanding to over 600 stores in more than 50 countries.\n\nThe success of Forever 21 was largely due to the Changs' ability to identify and capitalize on emerging fashion trends quickly. They also placed a strong emphasis on providing customers with a wide selection of affordable clothing options, including clothes for men and children.\n\nIn 2019, Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy and underwent a significant restructuring. Despite this setback, the company continues to operate and is now focusing on online sales and smaller, more curated retail locations.",
