I've been trying to get the paint job right, but none of the shades of gray I've tried seem to match the reference images I found online. I recently picked up some new airbrush and paint supplies from the local hobby store on February 17th, so I'm hoping those will help. Do you have any tips for getting an accurate paint job on a model like this?",
