  "content": "I think that's a brilliant idea! Starting with a smaller navy accent, like a navy throw blanket, is a great way to test the color in the space without making a big investment. It's a low-commitment way to introduce the navy color and see how it interacts with the other design elements in the room.\n\nA throw blanket is also a great way to add a pop of color and texture to the space, and it's easy to switch out if you decide you don't like the look. Plus, it's a versatile piece that can be used in different ways, such as:\n\n* Draping it over the back of the sofa or armchair\n* Using it as a throw blanket to keep cozy on chilly evenings\n* Folding it and placing it on a chair or ottoman as a decorative accent\n\nBy starting with a smaller navy accent, you'll be able to get a sense of how the color works in the space and make adjustments from there. If you find that you love the navy, you can always add more accents or even consider a navy rug later on.\n\nRemember, decorating is all about experimentation and iteration. It's okay to start small and build up to bigger changes. And who knows, you might find that the navy throw blanket is the perfect addition to your living room, and you won't need to add any more navy accents!\n\nI think you're making a great decision, and I'm excited to hear how it turns out!",
