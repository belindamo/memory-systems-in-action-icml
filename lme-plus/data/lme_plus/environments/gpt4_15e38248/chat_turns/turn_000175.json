Luna sounds like the perfect candidate for a treat-dispensing toy that requires her to use her problem-solving skills and physical energy. The rolling motion will provide her with a fun and engaging way to get the treats out, and the challenge will keep her mentally stimulated.\n\n**Tips for introducing the treat-dispensing toy:**\n\n1. **Start with a few treats**: Begin by placing a few treats inside the toy to make it easy for Luna to get them out. This will help her understand the concept and build her confidence.\n2. **Show her how it's done**: Demonstrate how to roll the toy around to get the treats out. You can do this by gently rolling the toy around on the floor or tapping it with your hand to encourage Luna to follow your example.\n3. **Encourage her to experiment**: Let Luna figure out how to get the treats out on her own. Encourage her to experiment with different rolling motions, pawing, and batting the toy around.\n4. **Gradually increase the difficulty**: As Luna becomes more comfortable with the toy, you can gradually increase the difficulty by adding more treats or making the holes smaller.\n5. **Supervise and praise**: Supervise Luna when she's playing with the toy and praise her when she successfully gets a treat out. This will help build her confidence and reinforce positive behavior.\n\nRemember to rotate the toy regularly to keep Luna engaged and prevent boredom. You can also try hiding the toy around the house to encourage her to search and problem-solve to find it.\n\nI'm excited to hear how Luna reacts to the treat-dispensing toy! Please let me know if you have any further questions or need more advice.\n\nWhat do you think Luna's favorite way to play with the toy will be? Will she use her paws, nose, or mouth to get the treats out?",
