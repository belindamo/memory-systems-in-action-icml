  "content": "That's a great approach! Starting with one pillow and testing it out in your space is a low-commitment way to introduce a new color and texture. And ordering swatches or samples is a fantastic way to get a better feel for the fabric and color before making a final decision.\n\nRemember to place the swatches or samples in different spots around your living room, such as on the sofa, armchair, or coffee table, to see how the color and texture interact with the surrounding decor. This will give you a better sense of how the pillow will look in different lighting conditions and from different angles.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to experiment and move the swatches or samples around to see how they look with different combinations of furniture and decor. This is a great opportunity to have fun and get creative with your design process!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy the process of finding the perfect pillow for your living room!",
