      "content": "Norwegian Air's financial struggles have been making headlines lately, and it's natural to have concerns about booking with them. While I can't predict the future, I can provide some context and insights to help you make an informed decision.\n\n**Norwegian Air's financial situation:**\n\nNorwegian Air has been facing financial challenges due to increased competition, rising fuel costs, and significant investments in their long-haul operations. In recent months, they've been working to reduce costs, optimize their route network, and secure additional funding. While they've made progress, their financial situation remains uncertain.\n\n**Is it safe to book with Norwegian Air?**\n\nFrom a safety perspective, Norwegian Air is still a safe airline to fly with. They have a good safety record, and their aircraft are well-maintained. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regularly monitor and audit Norwegian Air's safety standards.\n\n**Risks associated with booking with Norwegian Air:**\n\nWhile safety is not a concern, there are other risks to consider:\n\n1. **Flight cancellations or schedule changes:** If Norwegian Air's financial situation worsens, they might need to reduce their capacity, leading to flight cancellations or schedule changes. This could impact your travel plans, and you might not receive adequate notice or compensation.\n2. **Bankruptcy risk:** In the worst-case scenario, Norwegian Air could file for bankruptcy, which would likely result in the cancellation of all flights. If you've booked a ticket, you might not receive a refund or compensation.\n3. **Limited customer service:** If Norwegian Air experiences financial difficulties, their customer service might be impacted, leading to longer response times or limited support in case of issues.\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n\nIf you're concerned about Norwegian Air's financial situation, you might want to consider other airlines that offer similar routes and prices. Some alternatives to Norwegian Air for flights from New York to Frankfurt include:\n\n1. **Lufthansa:** As a major European carrier, Lufthansa is a more stable option with a strong financial foundation.\n2. **TAP Air Portugal:** TAP Air Portugal is another European airline that operates flights from New York to Frankfurt with a layover in Lisbon.\n3. **Swiss International Air Lines:** Swiss is a high-quality airline with a strong reputation and a more stable financial situation.\n\n**Tips for booking with Norwegian Air:**\n\nIf you still want to book with Norwegian Air, consider the following:\n\n1. **Pay with a credit card:** If you pay with a credit card, you might be able to dispute the charge or receive a refund if Norwegian Air cancels your flight or files for bankruptcy.\n2. **Book a flexible ticket:** Opt for a flexible ticket that allows you to change or cancel your booking if needed.\n3. **Monitor their financial situation:** Keep an eye on Norwegian Air's financial news and updates to stay informed about their situation.\n\nUltimately, the decision to book with Norwegian Air depends on your personal risk tolerance and travel priorities. If you're willing to take on some risk in exchange for a cheaper fare, Norwegian Air might still be a good option. However, if you prioritize stability and reliability, you might want to consider alternative airlines."
