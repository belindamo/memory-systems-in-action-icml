CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL\n\u2022 Reasons for and objectives of the proposal\nRaw materials are found at the beginning of all industrial value chains. The focus of this Regulation is on non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials that are important for the EU economy, the supplies of which are subject to a high level of supply risk. These critical raw materials (CRMs) are often indispensable inputs for a wide set of strategic sectors including renewable energy, the digital industry, the space and defence sectors and the health sector. At the same time, extraction and processing of CRMs can have negative environmental impacts, depending on the methods and processes used, as well as social impacts.\nThe EU relies almost exclusively on imports for many critical raw materials. Suppliers of those imports are often highly concentrated in a small number of third countries, both at the extraction and processing stage. For example, the EU sources 97% of its magnesium in China. Heavy rare earth elements, used in permanent magnets, are exclusively refined in China. 63% of the world's cobalt, used in batteries, is extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, while 60% is refined in China. This concentration exposes the EU to significant supply risks. There are precedents of countries leveraging their strong position as suppliers of CRMs against buyer countries, for instance through export restrictions.\nWith the global shift towards renewable energy and the digitalisation of our economies and societies, demand for some of these critical raw materials is forecasted to rapidly increase in the coming decades. Global demand for the lithium used to manufacture batteries for mobility and energy storage is expected to increase of up to 89-fold by 2050. EU demand for the rare earth elements from which the permanent magnets used in wind turbines or electric vehicles are manufactured is expected to increase six to seven-fold by 2050. EU demand for gallium, used to manufacture semi-conductors, is expected to grow 17-fold by 2050. Substituting materials and increasing material efficiency and circularity can mitigate the projected rise in demand to a certain extent, but these steps are not expected to reverse the trend. Presently, current and planned capacities risk not meeting more than 50 % of the projected demand for cobalt and future demand increase for rare earths is expected to outpace growth in capacities1. Against this background, many countries have adopted policies to actively secure their supply of critical raw materials, increasing resource competition.\nDisruption in the supply of essential goods during the COVID-19 crisis and the energy crisis sparked by Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine have highlighted the EU\u2019s structural supply dependencies and their potentially damaging effects in times of crisis. The central importance of critical raw materials for the green and digital transitions, and for defence and space applications, means that a disruption in their supply would have significant adverse effects for industry in the EU. This would jeopardise the functioning of the single market and damage the EU\u2019s competitiveness, while putting at stake jobs and job creation and affecting working conditions and wages. In addition, without a secure supply of critical raw materials, the Union will not be able to meet its objective for a green and digital future.\nThe 2008 raw materials initiative and the 2020 action plan on critical raw materials both provided a framework for initiatives to assess assessing the criticality of different raw materials, the international diversification, research and innovation and the development of CRMs production capacity in the EU. The measures put in place are helping to ensure a more secure supply. For instance, Strategic Partnerships concluded with third countries, as provided in the action plan, are helping to diversify sources of raw materials supply by further integrating the EU\u2019s raw materials value chains with those of resource-rich third countries.\nHowever, non-regulatory actions have not been enough to ensure the EU\u2019s access to a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials. At present, there is no regulatory framework aimed at structurally reducing supply risks across the range of critical raw materials. First, in the absence of a common framework to ensure that economic operators are resilient and prepared for problems that arise, industry remains overexposed to the risk of supply disruptions. Second, the EU's potential to increase its extraction, processing or recycling capacities remains underexploited. Across Member States, knowledge of mineral deposits often dates back to a time when critical raw materials were not the sought-after resources that they are today. Sometimes difficult access to funding, lengthy and complex permitting procedures and the lack of public acceptance as well as potential environmental concerns are major impediments to the development of critical raw materials projects. Third, legislation on waste management does not create enough incentives to improve the circularity of critical raw materials (\u2018their circularity\u2019) or for the development of a market in secondary raw materials. Lastly, there are not enough incentives to report on and limit the negative environmental impacts of CRMs that are placed on the EU market.\nAgainst this background, the present proposal has the following objectives:\n\u2013 to strengthen the different stages of the European critical raw materials value chain;\n\u2013 to diversify the EU's imports of critical raw materials to reduce strategic dependencies;\n\u2013 to improve the EU capacity to monitor and mitigate current and future risks of disruptions to the supply of critical raw materials;\n\u2013 to ensure the free movement of critical raw materials on the single market while ensuring a high level of environmental protection, by improving their circularity and sustainability.\n\u2022 Consistency with existing policy provisions in this area\nThis proposal is consistent with the European Green Deal strategy and the European Climate Law. This proposal is intended to help equip the EU with the capacities that will be needed to meet its targets for producing renewable energy, for developing strategic manufacturing technologies such as semiconductors and to reach our climate neutrality objectives.\nThis proposal responds to the 2022 Versailles Declaration adopted by the European Council, which underlined the strategic importance of critical raw materials in guaranteeing the EU\u2019s open strategic autonomy and European sovereignty. It is also consistent with the November 2021 resolution of the European Parliament on an EU strategy on CRMs and with the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe. Finally, this Regulation delivers on the commitment to reduce the EU\u2019s dependency on critical raw materials made by President von der Leyen in her 2022 State of the Union speech. This would be achieved by diversifying and securing a sustainable domestic supply of critical raw materials by identifying Strategic Projects across the supply chain and by building up strategic reserves. Ahead of the announcement of a Critical Raw Materials Act, the REPowerEU Communication and the Joint Communication on Defence Investment Gaps Analysis and Way Forward had announced a legislative proposal on CRMs in May 2022.\nWhereas this proposal focuses on building the EU\u2019s capacity to supply CRMs, the Communication accompanying this proposal explains the underlying strategy to secure the supply of critical raw materials sector, which includes non-regulatory measures to diversify external supplies from outside of the EU and to boost research and innovation and skills. The Regulation is accompanied by the results of the Commission\u2019s criticality assessment, the corresponding papers fiches on the critical and strategic raw materials (see detailed explanation on p.15 for more details) targeted by this proposal, ands by the latest foresight study. The proposal is presented jointly with the Net Zero Industry Act which, as announced in the Communication on A Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age, will underpin the industrial manufacturing of key technologies in the EU.\nThis proposal is consistent with the Commission\u2019s Communication updating the 2020 EU Industrial Strategy in May 2021, which identifies areas of strategic dependencies that could lead to vulnerabilities. The two subsequent in-depth reviews provided further analysis on the origins of strategic dependencies and first addressed CRMs overall (among other issues), then rare earth elements and magnesium.\nAlthough there has been no regulatory framework before this Regulation that aimed to secure the supply of CRMs, this proposal is consistent with the previous European CRM strategies. First, this Regulation builds on the criticality assessment, updated every 3 years since the 2008 initiative, which has provided information on CRMs and the EU\u2019s dependencies on them. Second, it complements and strengthens the initiatives which followed the 2020 action plan. It also provides a framework to support projects along the critical raw materials value chain, building on the work of the European Raw Materials Alliance. The proposal also builds on the EU principles for sustainable raw materials which aim to align Member States\u2019 understanding of sustainable extraction and processing.\nIn addition, in line with the 2021 action plan on synergies between civil, defence and space industries, the Commission is setting up an observatory of critical technologies. The observatory will identify, monitor and assess critical technologies for the civilian, defence and space sectors, their potential applications and related value and supply chains, including strategic dependencies and vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, the Commission has carried out a Foresight study which assesses the European Union\u2019s future needs for critical raw materials and the potential supply chain bottlenecks in key strategic technologies and sectors. The report forecasts an unprecedented increase in demand for the key materials necessary to a successful twin transition and to the EU\u2019s defence and aerospace agendas.\nThis proposal is consistent with other legislation on CRMs. For instance, it is consistent with the Conflict Minerals Regulation2, which requires importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG) to set up and implement due diligence policies addressing human rights impacts linked to armed conflicts and labour rights along their value chain."
