      "content": "A gramby roll is a technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) that involves using a rolling motion to escape from the bottom side control position. The gramby roll is named after Marcelo Garcia, who is a Brazilian BJJ practitioner and instructor known for his effective use of the technique.\n\nTo execute the gramby roll, you start by lying on your back with your opponent in the side control position on top of you. Then, you use your hips and legs to create space and leverage, and roll your body over onto your side. As you roll, you can use your arms to control your opponent's head and posture, and to prevent them from following you and re-establishing the side control position.\n\nThe gramby roll is an effective technique for escaping from the bottom side control position and taking the top position. It requires good coordination, control, and timing, and can be challenging to execute against a resisting opponent. However, with practice, you can develop the skills and confidence needed to successfully execute the gramby roll in BJJ."
