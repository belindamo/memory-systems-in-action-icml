      "content": "Obsidian is a popular note-taking and knowledge management app that can be used for a wide range of purposes, including tracking sales deals cadence. Here's a possible workflow for using Obsidian to plan and track your software sales deals cadence:\n\n1. Create a new note in Obsidian for each potential software sales deal you're working on. Give each note a descriptive title, such as the name of the company or the product you're selling.\n2. Within each note, use Obsidian's built-in text editor to write down all relevant information about the deal, such as the name of the contact person, their contact information, the product or service they're interested in, their budget, and any other relevant details.\n3. Tag each note with relevant tags, such as \"sales\", \"prospects\", or \"deals\", to make it easier to find and organize your notes.\n4. Create a new note or use an existing one to plan and track your deals cadence. Use headings or bullet points to create a clear outline of your plan, including the following:\n* A list of your prospects and their current status (e.g. contacted, interested, in negotiation, closed-won, closed-lost)\n* A timeline of your cadence, including the steps you'll take to move each prospect through the pipeline (e.g. send an introductory email, schedule a demo, send a proposal, follow up, close the deal)\n* A list of next steps for each prospect, with specific dates and action items\n5. Use Obsidian's backlinks and graph view features to visualize and navigate your notes and plan. You can easily create links between related notes and use the graph view to see the connections between them.\n6. Use Obsidian's search and filter features to quickly find the notes and information you need. You can search for specific tags, keywords, or phrases, or use the filter feature to narrow down your results based on specific criteria.\n\nBy using Obsidian to plan and track your software sales deals cadence, you can keep all relevant information and notes in one place and easily track your progress and next steps."

      "content": "MEDDPICC is a widely used framework in sales for qualifying and managing deals. It stands for Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Paper process, Identify pain, Champion, and Competition. Here's how you can relate your software sales cadence to the MEDDPICC framework:\n\nMetrics: Define the key metrics that are important for your software sales process, such as revenue, customer acquisition cost, and sales cycle length. Track these metrics for each deal in your pipeline to understand the health of your sales process and identify areas for improvement.\n\nEconomic buyer: Identify the economic buyer for each deal - the person or group with the power to approve the purchase decision and allocate budget. Build relationships with these economic buyers and understand their needs and priorities.\n\nDecision criteria: Understand the decision criteria for each deal - the specific factors that will drive the buyer's decision. Make sure your product or service meets these criteria and emphasize them in your sales pitch.\n\nDecision process: Understand the decision process for each deal - the steps the buyer will take to evaluate and make a decision. Use this knowledge to tailor your sales approach and guide the buyer through the process.\n\nPaper process: Understand the paper process for each deal - the legal and contractual steps required to finalize the sale. Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the legal requirements and work with your legal team to streamline the process.\n\nIdentify pain: Identify the pain points or challenges that your product or service can help the buyer solve. Use this information to position your product or service as a solution to the buyer's problems.\n\nChampion: Identify a champion within the buyer's organization who will advocate for your product or service and help drive the purchase decision. Build a strong relationship with this champion and provide them with the support they need to be successful.\n\nCompetition: Understand the competitive landscape for each deal and position your product or service effectively against your competitors. Anticipate objections and be prepared to address them in your sales pitch.\n\nBy using the MEDDPICC framework to qualify and manage your deals, you can ensure that you have a thorough understanding of each deal and are well-positioned to close them successfully. This can be integrated with your software sales cadence by aligning the MEDDPICC factors with the stages of your sales process, and ensuring that you're addressing each factor at the appropriate time in the process."

      "content": "Calculating the adjusted deal values based on the probability % linked to sales stages is a common practice in sales forecasting. Here's a step-by-step process for calculating adjusted deal values:\n\n1. Define the sales stages in your sales process. For example, you might have the following stages: Prospecting, Qualification, Needs Analysis, Proposal, Negotiation, and Closed Won.\n2. Assign a probability percentage to each sales stage. This percentage represents the likelihood that the deal will close successfully at that stage. For example, you might assign the following probabilities: Prospecting - 10%, Qualification - 20%, Needs Analysis - 30%, Proposal - 50%, Negotiation - 70%, Closed Won - 100%.\n3. Assign a dollar value to each deal. This is the total value of the deal if it closes successfully.\n4. Multiply the dollar value of the deal by the probability percentage for each sales stage to calculate the adjusted deal value. For example, if the total value of the deal is $10,000 and it's in the Proposal stage with a probability of 50%, the adjusted deal value would be $5,000 (i.e. $10,000 x 50%).\n5. Sum the adjusted deal values for all deals in each sales stage to calculate the total adjusted value for that stage. For example, if you have five deals in the Proposal stage with adjusted deal values of $5,000, $4,000, $6,000, $2,000, and $8,000, the total adjusted value for the Proposal stage would be $25,000.\n6. Repeat this process for each sales stage to calculate the total adjusted value for all deals in your pipeline.\n\nBy calculating the adjusted deal values based on the probability % linked to sales stages, you can get a more accurate picture of the potential revenue that your sales pipeline represents. This can help you make more informed decisions about resource allocation, forecasting, and other aspects of your sales strategy."

      "content": "The MEDDPICC framework is a sales methodology that helps sales teams evaluate their prospects and navigate the sales process. The correct order for completing the MEDDPICC elements is:\n\n1. Metrics: Metrics refer to the specific quantitative measures that are relevant to the prospect's business and goals. These metrics could include revenue growth, customer acquisition cost, or any other key performance indicators (KPIs) that are relevant to the prospect. Metrics should be identified early in the sales process, as they will inform the rest of the MEDDPICC elements.\n2. Economic Buyer: The Economic Buyer is the person within the prospect's organization who has the authority and budget to make purchasing decisions. This person may not always be the final decision maker, but they have the ability to influence the decision-making process. Identifying the Economic Buyer early in the sales process is critical to success.\n3. Decision Criteria: Decision criteria are the specific factors that the prospect will use to evaluate your product or service, and compare it against alternatives. This could include price, quality, features, functionality, ease of use, or any other relevant factors. Identifying the decision criteria will help you tailor your sales pitch and make a compelling case for your product or service.\n4. Decision Process: The Decision Process refers to the steps and stakeholders involved in the prospect's decision-making process. Understanding the decision process can help you identify potential roadblocks and make sure that all stakeholders are engaged in the process.\n5. Paper Process: The Paper Process is the formal process that the prospect follows to evaluate and purchase products or services. This could include legal requirements, procurement policies, or other administrative processes. Understanding the Paper Process is critical to closing the deal, as it can impact the timing and terms of the sale.\n6. Identify Pain: Identifying the prospect's Pain Points is the process of understanding the specific problems or challenges that the prospect is trying to solve with your product or service. This could include operational inefficiencies, revenue shortfalls, or any other challenges. Identifying Pain Points is critical to making a compelling case for your product or service and positioning it as a solution to the prospect's needs.\n7. Champion: The Champion is the person within the prospect's organization who is an advocate for your product or service and is actively working to move the sale forward. The Champion may not always be the Economic Buyer, but they can be a key influencer in the decision-making process. Identifying a Champion and building a relationship with them is critical to success.\n\nBy following this order and addressing each of the MEDDPICC elements, you can create a comprehensive and effective sales strategy that is tailored to the specific needs and goals of your prospects."
