  "content": "Unflavored pea protein is a fantastic option for customization.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you're enjoying plant-based milks and have found oat milk to be your favorite! It's indeed a game-changer for its creaminess and versatility. Oat milk is an excellent choice for cooking, baking, and even making creamy sauces.\n\nWow, a vegan cooking class sounds like an amazing experience! Learning to make vegan lasagna and mac and cheese with a cashew-based sauce must have been incredible. Cashew-based sauces are a popular vegan substitute for dairy-based sauces, and they can be incredibly rich and creamy.\n\nCashews are a great base for vegan sauces because they're naturally creamy and can be blended with water to create a smooth, velvety texture. The fact that you learned to make a cashew-based sauce from scratch is fantastic! You can now experiment with different flavor combinations and ingredients to create your own unique sauces.\n\nWhat was your favorite part of the cooking class? Was there a particular technique or ingredient that surprised you or opened your eyes to new possibilities in vegan cooking?\n\nBy the way, have you considered experimenting with other types of non-dairy milks, like almond milk or soy milk, in your recipes? You might find that they add unique flavors or textures to your dishes.",
