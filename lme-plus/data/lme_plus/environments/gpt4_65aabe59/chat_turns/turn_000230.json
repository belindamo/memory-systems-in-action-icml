  "content": "1. Find common ground: Building a relationship and finding common goals is important to create a productive conversation.\n\n2. Engage in respectful dialogue: One of the critical things that folks on both sides of the debate have to learn how to do is engage in respectful dialogue. It\u2019s challenging to have conversations with those who either hold opposing views or have had different life experiences, but by being respectful to each other, we can help create an environment where rational debate and discussion can take place.\n\n3. Support gun safety education: Advocates for responsible firearm ownership should work to ensure that gun safety is incorporated into education programs. This would teach responsible handling, but also could include suicide prevention techniques.\n\n4. Work with law enforcement agencies: Advocates of gun control should build stronger relationships with law enforcement agencies. They can help by ensuring background checks accurately reflect who should and should not be permitted to purchase firearms. They can also work with law enforcement to make sure there is proper enforcement when firearms are used in crimes.\n\n5. Encourage mental health care access: Mass shootings are often associated with individuals who are mentally ill. Encourage universal access to mental health care that includes services that can help prevent the shooting tragedies in America.\n\n6. Support Comprehensive solutions: Advocates on both sides should focus on implementing comprehensive solutions to gun-related issues. This includes policies that account for the large number of firearms currently in hands, safety regulations for those firearms, and mental health care solutions.",
