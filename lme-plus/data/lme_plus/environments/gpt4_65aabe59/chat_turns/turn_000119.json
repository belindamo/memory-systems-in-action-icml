Since the gaming convention was last month, it's unlikely that you'll be able to try out a keyboard with Romer-G switches at the same event. The convention is probably over, and the vendors and exhibitors have likely packed up and gone home.\n\nHowever, you have a few other options to try out Romer-G switches:\n\n1. **Visit a local electronics store:** Look for a local electronics store or a gaming peripherals retailer in your area that carries Razer products. They might have a Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2 or other Razer keyboards with Romer-G switches on display for you to try out.\n2. **Online retailers:** Some online retailers like Amazon, Newegg, or Best Buy might have demo units or showrooms where you can try out keyboards before buying. You can check their websites or visit their physical stores to see if they have Razer keyboards available for demo.\n3. **Razer's website or store:** If you have a Razer store or a Razer-authorized retailer in your area, you can visit their website or store to try out their keyboards. They might have demo units available for you to try before buying.\n4. **Ask a friend or online community:** You can also ask friends or online communities (e.g., Reddit's r/MechanicalKeyboards or r/GamingKeyboards) if anyone has a Razer keyboard with Romer-G switches that you can try out.\n\nRemember to take your time, try out the keyboard, and get a feel for the Romer-G switches before making a purchase.",
