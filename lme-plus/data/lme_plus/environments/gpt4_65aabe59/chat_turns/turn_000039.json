Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Use relevant and popular hashtags**: You're already on the right track with using hashtags like #breakfastlover and #SundayFunday. Research and experiment with different hashtags to find the ones that resonate with your audience. You can use tools like Hashtagify or RiteTag to find popular hashtags in your niche.\n2. **Post high-quality content**: Share high-quality, visually appealing photos or videos that make people want to engage with your content. Consider investing in a good camera or editing software to enhance your visuals.\n3. **Ask questions or ask for opinions**: Encourage engagement by asking questions or asking for opinions in your captions. For example, \"What's your favorite breakfast dish?\" or \"Have you tried this recipe before?\"\n4. **Use Instagram Stories and IGTV**: Instagram Stories and IGTV can help increase engagement by providing a behind-the-scenes look at your content creation process, sneak peeks, or exclusive deals. You can also use the \"poll\" feature to ask questions and encourage engagement.\n5. **Post consistently**: Maintaining a consistent posting schedule helps to keep your audience engaged and interested in your content. Aim to post at least 3-5 times a week, but make sure you don't sacrifice quality for quantity.\n6. **Engage with your audience**: Respond to comments and messages promptly to build a relationship with your audience. Like and comment on other users' posts, especially in your niche, to start conversations and build a community.\n7. **Run a contest or giveaway**: Hosting a contest or giveaway can increase engagement and attract new followers. For example, you could ask followers to share a post, tag a friend, or submit a photo using a specific hashtag.\n8. **Time your posts strategically**: Post when your audience is most active, which is usually during peak hours (e.g., lunch breaks, evening commutes). Use Instagram Insights to determine when your followers are most engaged.\n9. **Be authentic and unique**: Share your personal story, showcase your personality, and highlight what sets you apart from others in your niche. Authenticity and uniqueness can help attract and retain followers.\n10. **Monitor and adjust**: Keep an eye on your analytics to see what's working and what's not. Adjust your strategy based on your results, and don't be afraid to try new things.\n\nRemember, increasing engagement takes time and effort. Focus on providing value to your audience, and with consistency and creativity, you'll see your engagement rates rise over time.\n\nWhat do you think?
