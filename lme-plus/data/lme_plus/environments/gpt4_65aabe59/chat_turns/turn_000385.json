Sorry to hear it's been freezing on you randomly - that can be frustrating.\n\nBefore we dive into specs and budget, can you tell me a bit more about your current computer and how you use it? For example:\n\n1. What's your current CPU (processor), RAM, and storage (hard drive or solid state drive) configuration?\n2. What operating system are you running (Windows, macOS, Linux)?\n3. What kind of tasks do you primarily use your computer for (gaming, video editing, web browsing, office work, etc.)?\n4. Are there any specific features you're looking for in a new computer (e.g., USB-C ports, Wi-Fi 6, high-resolution display)?\n\nThis information will help me provide more tailored recommendations.\n\nAs for your smart thermostat, that's great to hear it's been helping with your energy bills! Have you noticed any significant savings or changes in your energy consumption since setting it up?\n\nLet's get started on upgrading your desktop computer, and I'll do my best to guide you through the process!",
