  "content": "It's great that you're exfoliating regularly, but I would recommend reassessing your exfoliation frequency based on your skin type and the new moisturizer you choose.\n\nAs a general rule, combination skin can be more prone to irritation, so it's essential to find a balance between exfoliating enough to control acne and hyperpigmentation, while not over-exfoliating and causing dryness or sensitivity.\n\nChemical exfoliants, like alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), can be more gentle than physical exfoliants (like scrubs or brushes), but they can still be potent. Exfoliating every other day might be too frequent, especially if you're using a strong product or have sensitive skin.\n\nHere are some tips to consider:\n\n1. **Start with a lower frequency**: Consider reducing your exfoliation frequency to 1-2 times a week, depending on your skin's sensitivity and how it responds to the new moisturizer. This will give your skin time to adjust and minimize the risk of irritation.\n2. **Monitor your skin**: Pay attention to how your skin reacts to the new moisturizer and exfoliant. If you notice any signs of irritation, dryness, or sensitivity, it may be a sign that you need to adjust your exfoliation frequency.\n3. **Adjust based on the moisturizer**: If you choose a moisturizer that's more emollient or rich, you may need to exfoliate less frequently to avoid stripping your skin of its natural oils. On the other hand, if you choose a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer, you may be able to exfoliate more frequently.\n4. **Patch test**: Always patch test any new exfoliant or product on a small area of your skin before using it on your face to ensure you don't have any adverse reactions.\n\nRemember, it's essential to find a balance that works for your skin. If you're unsure, consider consulting with your aesthetician again for personalized guidance.",
