However, it is worth noting that the new trains recently added to the line do not currently have charging ports for electronic devices. That said, it's always possible that this could change in the future if Transport for London (TfL) decides to add such a feature to improve the passenger experience. It's also worth noting that many stations along the Northern Line offer charging points for electronic devices where you can plug in your phone or other device while waiting for a train.",
