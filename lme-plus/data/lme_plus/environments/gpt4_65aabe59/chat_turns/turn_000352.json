  "content": "Yes, it is. Science Fiction has always offered an outlet for people to explore their anxieties and fears, and to imagine a world with different possibilities. It can be a powerful tool for individuals to confront and understand their anxieties, and to work towards resolving them. By placing these anxieties in a fictional context, science fiction allows people to experience a distance from their fears while still engaging with them, which can be therapeutic. So, it's not surprising that Science Fiction has continued to play an essential role in times of social and political upheaval.",
