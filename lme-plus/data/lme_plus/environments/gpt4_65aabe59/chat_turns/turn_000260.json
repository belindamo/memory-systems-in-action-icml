Let go and live free!\"\n3. \"When we forgive, we're not changing the past, but we're changing the present and the future. Choose to let go and move forward!\"\n4. \"Unforgiveness is like a stormy weather - it clouds our judgment and weighs us down. Let's choose to forgive and bring sunshine back into our lives!\"\n5. \"Forgiveness is a choice, not a feeling. Choose to release the burden and walk in peace!\"\n\n**Quote Ideas:**\n\n1. \"Forgiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it.\" - Mark Twain\n2. \"The weak can never forgive.
