  "content": "As far as I know, the Northern Line's recent train upgrades do not include any special features for entertainment, such as personal screens or Wi-Fi connectivity. However, passengers are generally able to connect to free Wi-Fi at many stations along the Northern Line, and TfL has announced plans to roll out Wi-Fi connectivity on board its trains starting in 2020. So while the current Northern Line trains may not have these amenities, it's possible that future upgrades or installations may include features like Wi-Fi to improve the passenger experience.",
