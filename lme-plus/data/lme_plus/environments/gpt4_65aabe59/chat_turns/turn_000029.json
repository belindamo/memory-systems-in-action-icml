  "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that. However, as a digital AI assistant, I don't have direct access to real-time sales data or promotions for specific stores. But I can suggest a few ways for you to find out about sales and promotions on Pepsi products at ShopRite:\n\n1. **ShopRite Website**: You can visit ShopRite's official website ([www.shoprite.com](http://www.shoprite.com)) and check their weekly ads or sales circulars section. They usually post their weekly sales and promotions online.\n2. **ShopRite Mobile App**: If you have the ShopRite mobile app, you can check the \"Sales\" or \"Deals\" section to see if they have any promotions on Pepsi products.\n3. **Fetch Rewards App**: As you mentioned, you're already using Fetch Rewards. You can check the app to see if they have any current offers or promotions on Pepsi products.\n4. **Visit ShopRite's Social Media**: Sometimes, ShopRite posts about their sales and promotions on their social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.\n5. **Call Your Local ShopRite**: If you have a specific ShopRite store in mind, you can call them directly and ask about their current sales and promotions on Pepsi products.\n\nRemember to always check the expiration dates and any limitations on the sales or promotions before you head out to shop.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
