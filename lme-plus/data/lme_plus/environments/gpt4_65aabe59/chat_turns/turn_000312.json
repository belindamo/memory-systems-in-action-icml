In 2014, Transport for London (TfL) began upgrading the Northern Line rolling stock, replacing the existing fleet of 47-year-old trains with new, more modern models. The new trains have several upgrades, including air conditioning, wider doors, walk-through carriages, and improved accessibility for passengers with disabilities. Additionally, the new trains have a higher capacity, as they are longer than the previous ones, and are expected to carry up to 25% more passengers.",
