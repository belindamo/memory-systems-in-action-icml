However, a few of the most popular gaming forums are Reddit's r/gaming, GameFAQs, NeoGAF, and Gamespot. Each of these forums has a large user base and a vast range of topics covering various gaming consoles and titles. In terms of engagement, it depends on the forum's moderators, quality of content, and user interactions that influence the community's engagement level. Therefore, it is difficult to compare and determine which forum has the most active and engaged community.",
