  "content": "Great choice on the pea protein! \n\nUnflavored vs. flavored pea protein ultimately depends on your personal preference and how you plan to use the protein powder. Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Unflavored:**\n\n1. **Neutral taste**: Unflavored pea protein is a great option if you want to add it to your oatmeal, smoothies, or recipes without affecting the flavor.\n2. ** Versatility**: You can add your own flavorings or sweeteners to create a customized taste.\n3. **Less added ingredients**: Unflavored powders often have fewer ingredients, which can be beneficial for those with sensitivities or preferences.\n\n**Flavored:**\n\n1. **Convenience**: Flavored pea protein powders can be a convenient option if you want a quick and easy smoothie or post-workout drink.\n2. **Taste variety**: Flavored powders come in a range of options, such as chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry, which can be a nice change of pace.\n3. **Masking bitterness**: Some people find that flavored powders can help mask any bitterness or earthy taste associated with pea protein.\n\nIf you're new to pea protein, you might consider starting with an unflavored option to get accustomed to the taste and texture. You can always add your own flavorings or sweeteners to create a taste you enjoy.\n\nHowever, if you prefer a convenient and hassle-free option, a flavored pea protein powder might be the way to go. Many brands offer natural flavorings and sweeteners, so be sure to check the ingredient list.\n\nSince you enjoy oat milk and have a sweet tooth (banana and peanut butter oatmeal, yum!), you might prefer a flavored pea protein powder with a subtle sweetness. Some brands offer natural flavorings like stevia or monk fruit, which can add a touch of sweetness without adding refined sugars.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what works best for your taste preferences and dietary needs. You could also consider purchasing a small sample or trial size to test the flavor and texture before committing to a larger quantity.",
