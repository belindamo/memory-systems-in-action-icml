  "content": "That's a good lead! Getting a new router can sometimes introduce new issues. Let's explore that further.\n\nSince you've already tried restarting the router, here are some additional steps to help troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. **Router configuration**: Check the router's settings to ensure that Wi-Fi is enabled and broadcasting its SSID (network name). Also, verify that the Wi-Fi password is correct and matches the one on your devices.\n2. **Channel overlap**: With a new router, it's possible that the channel it's using is causing interference. Try changing the Wi-Fi channel on your router to one that's less crowded. You can use tools like Wi-Fi Analyzer (for Android or iOS) to scan for nearby networks and find a less congested channel.\n3. **Router's 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz settings**: If your router is dual-band, make sure that both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks are enabled and broadcasting separate SSIDs. Some devices might be set to connect to a specific frequency band, so try switching between the two to see if it makes a difference.\n4. **Device-specific settings**: On your laptop, try forgetting the Wi-Fi network and then reconnecting to it. Also, ensure that your laptop's Wi-Fi adapter is set to connect to the correct frequency band (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz).\n5. **Smart TV settings**: Check your smart TV's Wi-Fi settings to ensure it's set to connect to the correct network and frequency band. You might need to reset the TV's network settings or update its firmware.\n6. **Physical obstructions**: Physical barriers like walls, furniture, or other devices can impact Wi-Fi signal strength. Try moving your router to a more central location or elevating it to improve the signal.\n7. **Firmware updates**: Check with your ISP or the router manufacturer to see if there are any firmware updates available for your new router. Updating the firmware might resolve any connectivity issues.\n8. **ISP-specific issues**: Reach out to your ISP's technical support to see if there are any known issues on their end that might be affecting your connection. They may be able to send a technician to check the connection or provide additional assistance.\n\nTo help you better, can you please provide more information about your new router, such as:\n\n* The router model and manufacturer\n* The type of internet connection you have (e.g., cable, fiber, DSL)\n* The Wi-Fi frequency bands supported by your router (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or both)\n\nLet's work together to resolve this issue!",
