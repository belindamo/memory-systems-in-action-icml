  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or the ability to engage in value judgments, but I can provide information from a neutral standpoint.\n\nLe Corbusier's architectural philosophy emphasized functionality and efficiency, but he did not disregard aesthetics entirely. In his view, beauty came from the harmony of functionality, materials, and form. He believed that a building's design should be based on its purpose, and its form should express its function. So, while he prioritized function, he believed that a building's aesthetic qualities would naturally emerge from its functional design. Additionally, Le Corbusier was interested in creating a new aesthetic grounded in the principles of modernity and technology. While some may argue that his buildings lack traditional beauty, others appreciate their unique style and character. Ultimately, whether a building is considered beautiful or not is subjective and dependent on an individual's personal aesthetic preferences.",
