  "content": "Le Corbusier's five points of architecture are still relevant today and have greatly influenced contemporary design. Here are some examples of how Le Corbusier's principles have been used in contemporary designs:\n\n1. Pilotis - The use of pilotis is still widely used in contemporary designs, particularly in areas prone to flooding or with difficult terrain. For example, the Vidyalankar Institute of Technology in Mumbai, India, features a building partially elevated on pilotis, allowing for water to flow underneath in the event of floods.\n\n2. Free-plan - The free-plan principle espoused by Le Corbusier has been used in contemporary designs to create more flexible and adaptable interior spaces. The Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, features an open-office plan that allows for flexible workspaces and easier collaboration.\n\n3. Free-fa\u00e7ade - The free-fa\u00e7ade principle has been used to create more expressive and unique building facades. For example, the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, features undulating curves on its exterior facade that create a sense of movement and flow.\n\n4. Ribbon Windows - Ribbon windows are still commonly used in contemporary designs to provide ample natural light and ventilation. The Edificio Kavanagh in Buenos Aires, Argentina, features long, horizontal windows that wrap around the entire building, providing stunning views of the city.\n\n5. Roof Garden - The roof garden principle has been used in contemporary designs to provide additional functional spaces that can be used for a variety of purposes. The Bosco Verticale in Milan, Italy, features two residential towers with over 900 trees planted on their balconies and terraces, creating a unique and eco-friendly urban oasis.\n\nOverall, Le Corbusier's five points of architecture are still relevant today and have greatly influenced contemporary design. They continue to inspire architects to create functional, sustainable, and beautiful buildings that meet the needs of a modern world.",
