However, if you are interested in beginner-friendly camping trips with rock climbing as an activity, it would be best to do some research online or speak with a local outdoor recreation organization. They may be able to recommend campsites or parks that offer beginner-friendly rock climbing experiences, as well as provide guidance for those just starting out. Additionally, it's important to remember to always prioritize safety and have a skilled guide or instructor with you when attempting any activity that you are new to.",
