You meant to say you redeemed 500 points from ShopRite's Price Plus program, right?\n\nBut I'm glad you're excited about redeeming your points for a discount! It's always great to earn rewards and save money on your grocery shopping. Just remember to check the ShopRite website and mobile app to learn more about their Price Plus program and how to earn and redeem points.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
