In fact, Italy is known for its great linguistic diversity, with over 30 regional dialects recognized by the Italian Constitution. Each of these dialects has its own distinct phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, and many have been used in literature, poetry, and other forms of cultural expression for centuries. Some examples of other significant Italian dialects include Neapolitan, Sicilian, Venetian, and Tuscan.
