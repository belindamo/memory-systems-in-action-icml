You actually shopped at ShopRite, and that's where you can earn points with their Price Plus program.\n\nBut don't worry, it's an easy mistake! And congratulations on earning 740 points already! With ShopRite's Price Plus program, you can continue to earn points and redeem them for discounts and rewards. Just make sure to sign up for the program and start tracking your points through their website or mobile app.\n\nRemember, you can also use Fetch Rewards to earn points on your Pepsi purchases, and combine those points with your ShopRite Price Plus points to maximize your savings. Happy shopping!",
