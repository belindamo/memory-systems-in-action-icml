  "content": "A 24-inch screen is a great size for a desktop computer, providing a comfortable viewing experience without taking up too much space.\n\nNot needing a DVD/CD drive is a common trend these days, especially with the rise of digital content and streaming services. You can always use an external drive if you need to access physical media in the future.\n\nComfortable keyboard and mouse are essential for productivity and overall user experience. You can always upgrade or replace them later if you find that the bundled ones aren't to your liking.\n\nBased on your preferences, here are some pre-built desktop computer options from Dell and HP that might interest you:\n\n**Dell Inspiron 24 3000 Series AIO**:\n\n* 24-inch Full HD display\n* 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor\n* 16 GB DDR4 RAM\n* 512 GB SSD\n* Integrated Intel UHD Graphics\n* Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)\n* USB-A ports, USB-C with USB 3.2 Gen 2, and HDMI\n* Price: Around $900\n\n**HP Pavilion 24-inch All-in-One Desktop**:\n\n* 24-inch Full HD display\n* 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor\n* 16 GB DDR4 RAM\n* 1 TB SSD\n* Integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics\n* Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)\n* USB-A ports, USB-C with USB 3.2 Gen 2, and HDMI\n* Price: Around $1,000\n\nBoth of these options should provide a smooth experience for your web browsing, office work, and light video editing needs. The all-in-one design means the computer is built into the monitor, which can save space and reduce clutter.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I'd like to ask:\n\n1. Are you willing to consider a slightly larger or smaller screen size if it means getting a better deal or more features?\n2. Would you like to explore other brands, such as Lenovo or Acer, for comparison?\n3. Are there any specific warranty or support options you're looking for in a desktop computer?\n\nLet me know your thoughts, and I'll help you make an informed decision!",
