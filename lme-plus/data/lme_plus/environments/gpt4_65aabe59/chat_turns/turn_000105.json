  "content": "Lexical semantics is a subfield of linguistics that deals with the study of word meaning, and how words are used to communicate meaning. It is concerned with the meaning of words, as well as their relationships with other words and with the world around us.\n\nLexical semantics explores the different types of meaning that words can have, such as their literal or figurative meaning, connotations, associations, and how they are used in context. It also examines the relationships between words, including synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, hypernymy, and collocation.\n\nOverall, lexical semantics aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of how words work in language, and how they contribute to meaning in communication.",
