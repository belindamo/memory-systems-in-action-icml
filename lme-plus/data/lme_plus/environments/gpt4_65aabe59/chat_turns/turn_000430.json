Since you mentioned The Great, I have to say I loved its second season, which I binge-watched from December 18th to 22nd, 2021. The costumes and production design were amazing, and it reminded me of the grandness of live theater, which I've been enjoying a lot lately. Do you have any recommendations for live theater productions or musicals that I might enjoy?",
