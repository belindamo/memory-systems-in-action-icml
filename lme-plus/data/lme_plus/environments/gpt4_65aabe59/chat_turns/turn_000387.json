  "content": "With 5 years of use, it's no surprise your computer might be showing its age.\n\nDon't worry about not knowing the exact specs; we can work with that. Based on your usage, I'll provide some general guidelines for a new computer that should meet your needs.\n\nFor web browsing, office work, and light video editing, you'll want a computer that can handle multitasking and has some decent processing power. Here are some specs to consider:\n\n1. **CPU (Processor):** A mid-range to high-end processor from the latest generations (10th or 11th gen) from Intel Core i5 or i7 series or AMD Ryzen 5 or 7 series would be a good starting point.\n2. **RAM:** 16 GB of DDR4 RAM should be sufficient, but 32 GB or more would be ideal for smoother performance, especially if you plan to do more video editing.\n3. **Storage:** A 512 GB or 1 TB Solid-State Drive (SSD) would be a great upgrade from traditional hard drives. SSDs provide faster loading times, faster file access, and improved overall performance.\n4. **Graphics:** Integrated graphics (Intel Iris or UHD) would be sufficient for your usage, but if you want to do more video editing or gaming, a dedicated graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce or AMD Radeon) might be a good investment.\n5. **Operating System:** You can stick with Windows, but if you're open to exploring, Linux is a great option too.\n\nAs for features, you might want to consider:\n\n1. **USB ports:** Ensure the new computer has a good number of USB-A ports (at least 4-6) and possibly some USB-C ports with USB 3.2 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt 3 support.\n2. **Display:** If you're planning to use an external monitor, look for a computer with an HDMI port or DisplayPort.\n3. **Wi-Fi:** Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is the latest standard, providing faster and more reliable connectivity.\n4. **Power efficiency:** If you're concerned about energy consumption, look for computers with energy-efficient components and a power supply with a high efficiency rating (e.g., 80 PLUS Bronze or higher).\n\nBudget-wise, you can expect to spend around $800-$1,500 for a well-rounded desktop computer that meets your needs. However, prices can vary depending on the brand, model, and specific features.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I'd like to ask a few more questions:\n\n1. Are you open to building your own computer or would you prefer a pre-built one?\n2. Do you have a preferred brand or form factor (e.g., tower, all-in-one, mini PC) in mind?\n3. Are there any specific software or applications you use for video editing that might require additional resources?\n\nLet me know your thoughts, and I'll provide more tailored guidance!",
