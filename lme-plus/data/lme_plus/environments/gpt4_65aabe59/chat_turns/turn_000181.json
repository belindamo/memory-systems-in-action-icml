Having a knowledgeable instructor can make all the difference in learning new cooking techniques and gaining confidence in the kitchen.\n\nI'm glad to hear that making the cashew-based sauce was a surprise win for you! It's often the case that vegan cooking can be simpler and more accessible than people think. The cashew-based sauce is a great example of how a few simple ingredients can come together to create something rich and creamy.\n\nCashews are a great ingredient to work with because they're so versatile. They can be used to make everything from creamy sauces to cheesy vegan cheeses. And the best part is that they're relatively inexpensive and easy to find in most grocery stores.\n\nNow that you've learned how to make a cashew-based sauce, I'm sure you'll be experimenting with it in all sorts of dishes. Have you thought about trying it in other recipes, like vegan mac and cheese or creamy soups?\n\nAnd what about the vegan lasagna you made in the class? How did it turn out, and was it a hit with your taste buds?\n\nBy the way, are there any other vegan cooking classes or workshops you're interested in taking in the future? There are often so many great opportunities to learn new skills and connect with like-minded people in the vegan community.",
