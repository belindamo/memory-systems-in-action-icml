  "content": "Le Corbusier's \"five points of architecture\" is a set of principles that he developed in 1926 as a guiding philosophy for his architectural designs. The five points are:\n\n1. Pilotis - This refers to the use of thin, reinforced concrete columns or stilts to elevate the building above the ground. This allows for more open space underneath the building and enables a more functional use of space in the building itself.\n\n2. Free-plan - Le Corbusier believed that walls should be used for separation of spaces rather than for support, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in the use of the interior space.\n\n3. Free-fa\u00e7ade - The fa\u00e7ade, or the exterior of the building, should not be constrained by load-bearing walls and should be free to be designed as a separate element, allowing for more creativity and expression in design.\n\n4. Ribbon windows - Continuous horizontal windows that run across the fa\u00e7ade of the building, providing ample natural light and ventilation.\n\n5. Roof garden - The roof of the building should be used as an additional functional space, such as a garden or recreation area, and not just as a protective covering.\n\nThese five points influenced Le Corbusier's work in a significant way. He utilized these principles in many of his most famous designs, including the Villa Savoye in Poissy, France, and the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation in Marseille, France. The five points were key to his vision of functional, modern architecture that maximized the use of space and light. They also represented a break from traditional architecture and were seen as revolutionary at the time they were introduced.",
