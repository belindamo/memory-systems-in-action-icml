Giving the gift in person will allow you to show your support and care in a more personal way, and seeing her reaction will be a great way to connect with her.\n\nA heartfelt note or card is a perfect way to express your thoughts and feelings. It's a tangible way to show your support and let her know that you're thinking of her during this difficult time. You could write something like:\n\n\"Dear [Colleague's Name], I wanted to give you this gift to let you know that I'm thinking of you and here for you during this tough time. I hope this cozy throw blanket brings you some comfort and warmth. You're not alone, and I'm here to support you in any way I can. If you need to talk or just need someone to listen, I'm here for you.\"\n\nRemember to be sincere and genuine in your message. Your colleague will appreciate the thought and effort you put into the gift and the note.\n\nIt's also a great way to start a conversation and show your support in person. You could say something like, \"Hey, I wanted to give you this gift to let you know I'm thinking of you. I hope it brings you some comfort during this tough time. How are you doing? Is there anything I can do to support you?\"\n\nBy giving the gift in person and including a heartfelt note, you're showing your colleague that you care about her well-being and are there to support her. That can make a big difference in her day and in your working relationship.",
