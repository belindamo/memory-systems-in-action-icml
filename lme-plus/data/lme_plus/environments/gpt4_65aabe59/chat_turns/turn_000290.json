Voting is a fundamental right in a democratic society, and election officials must ensure that every eligible voter has fair and equal access to the ballot box. Mail-in ballots can provide a convenient and secure way for people to exercise this right, and efforts to improve the system can help make elections more accessible and efficient. By continuously working to improve the mail-in ballot system as part of a broader effort to strengthen our democratic institutions, we can help ensure that every voice is heard and every vote is counted.",
