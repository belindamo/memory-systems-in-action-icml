  "content": "There are several transport options available in the area of the Northern Line. The other underground lines that operate in the area are the Piccadilly, Victoria, Bakerloo, Jubilee, and Central lines. There is also the London Overground, which serves many areas in North and East London. Additionally, there are several bus routes that run in the area, and many of them connect with tube and rail stations to provide an integrated transport network. Some commuters also choose to cycle or walk to their destinations, particularly for shorter journeys or to avoid peak hour traffic. TfL provides a range of services to help people plan their journeys and find the best routes, including online journey planners, mobile apps, and information kiosks at many stations. Now, depending on your starting and ending points, it might be worth exploring some of these other options to see if they offer faster, more convenient, or cheaper routes than the Northern Line.",
