  "content": "Yes, the cleanliness of the Northern Line's trains has been a concern for many passengers in the past, and TfL has taken steps to address this issue as part of the recent upgrades. The new trains have been designed with features that make them easier to clean, such as easier-to-reach surfaces and fewer seams where dirt and debris can accumulate. In addition, TfL has increased its cleaning and maintenance schedules, with more frequent and intensive cleaning of the trains and stations along the line. TfL has also introduced new measures to enforce anti-littering rules, such as increased fines for littering and more visible signage reminding passengers of their responsibilities to keep the trains and stations clean. Overall, TfL is committed to improving the cleanliness and hygiene of the Northern Line, and passengers should notice an improvement in this area as a result of the recent upgrades.",
