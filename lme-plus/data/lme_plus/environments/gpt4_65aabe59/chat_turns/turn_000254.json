With 35,000 miles, you might not have enough for a round-trip economy ticket to Europe just yet, but you have a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Wait and accumulate more miles**: Keep earning miles through your credit card, flying, or other activities to reach the required amount for a round-trip ticket.\n2. **Look for off-peak or sale awards**: Some airlines offer discounted award tickets during off-peak seasons or special promotions. Keep an eye on your airline's website or sign up for their newsletter to stay informed about these deals.\n3. **Consider a one-way ticket**: You might have enough miles for a one-way ticket to Europe. This could be a good option if you're flexible with your return travel dates or plan to book a separate ticket for the return journey.\n4. **Book a shorter flight**: If you have enough miles for a shorter flight, like a domestic or intra-European route, you could use your miles for that and then book a separate ticket for the remaining leg of your journey.\n5. **Transfer miles to a partner airline**: If you have miles with an airline that has partnerships with other carriers, you might be able to transfer your miles to a partner airline that offers more favorable redemption rates or availability.\n6. **Use miles for upgrades**: If you're short on miles for a free ticket, consider using them to upgrade your seat on a paid ticket instead. This can still enhance your travel experience and provide more comfort.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some approximate mileage requirements for one-way economy tickets from New York to Europe:\n\n* Air France/KLM Flying Blue: 20,000-25,000 miles\n* Delta SkyMiles: 25,000-30,000 miles\n* American Airlines AAdvantage: 25,000-30,000 miles\n* United MileagePlus: 25,000-30,000 miles\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates, and the actual number of miles required may vary depending on the airline, route, and travel dates.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you willing to wait and accumulate more miles, or would you like to explore other options?",
