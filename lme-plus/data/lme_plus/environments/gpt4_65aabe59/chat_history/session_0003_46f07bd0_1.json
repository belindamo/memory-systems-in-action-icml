By the way, I just redeemed 500 points from the SaveRite loyalty program for a discount on my last bill, which was really helpful."

      "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I have to inform you that SaveRite is a fictional store, so it's unlikely that it has sales on Pepsi products or a loyalty program. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different store, such as ShopRite, which is a real grocery store chain.\n\nIf that's the case, I'd be happy to help you check on sales and promotions on Pepsi products at ShopRite. You can usually find this information on their website, mobile app, or by checking their weekly ads.\n\nAdditionally, Fetch Rewards is a real app that rewards users for purchasing certain products, including Pepsi. You can check the app to see if there are any current offers or promotions on Pepsi products.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!"

      "content": "I think there's a small mistake again. You didn't earn points from shopping at SaveRite, because SaveRite is not a real store.

With ShopRite's Price Plus program, you can continue to earn points and redeem them for discounts and rewards.
