It's also great that you've prioritized self-care with dedicated time for reading every evening.\n\nSince I don't know your personal preferences or other commitments, I won't suggest any changes. However, you might want to consider a few things:\n\n1. **Meal times**: You might want to block out time for dinner or other meals, especially if you have specific dietary needs or preferences.\n2. **Sleep schedule**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep each night. You might want to allocate time for winding down before bed, such as relaxation techniques or a calming activity.\n3. **Other activities**: If you have other hobbies or activities you enjoy, you might want to fit them into your schedule. For example, you could allocate time for a creative pursuit, spending time with friends or family, or learning a new skill.\n4. **Flexibility**: Remember that life can be unpredictable, and things don't always go as planned. Don't be too hard on yourself if you need to adjust your schedule occasionally. It's okay to move things around or take a rest day when needed.\n\nIf you're happy with your current schedule, that's perfectly fine! If you do want to make changes or add new activities, feel free to share your ideas, and I can help you incorporate them into your schedule."
