Here are some tips to help you incorporate walnuts into your Spelt and Walnut Bread dough:\n\n**Tips for incorporating walnuts into bread dough:**\n\n1. **Chop the walnuts coarsely:** Chop the toasted walnuts into coarse pieces, about 1/4 inch (6 mm) in size. This will help them distribute evenly throughout the dough.\n2. **Add walnuts during the mixing phase:** Add the chopped walnuts during the mixing phase, after the initial autolyse (if you're using one) and before the bulk fermentation. This allows the walnuts to distribute evenly throughout the dough.\n3. **Use a gentle mixing technique:** Mix the dough gently, using a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or by hand, to prevent crushing the walnuts. Avoid overmixing, which can cause the walnuts to break down and become unevenly distributed.\n4. **Use a preferment or soaker:** Consider using a preferment, like a biga or poolish, or a soaker, like a walnut soaker, to help the walnuts distribute evenly throughout the dough. These techniques can help the walnuts absorb the dough's moisture and become more evenly distributed.\n5. **Fold the dough gently:** During the folding process, gently fold the dough to distribute the walnuts evenly. This is especially important during the first few folds, as the dough is still quite delicate.\n6. **Use a gentle shaping technique:** When shaping the dough, use a gentle, gentle touch to avoid crushing the walnuts. You can also try shaping the dough into a round or oblong shape, which can help the walnuts distribute more evenly.\n7. **Don't over-proof the dough:** Avoid over-proofing the dough, as this can cause the walnuts to become unevenly distributed or even sink to the bottom of the loaf.\n8. **Score the bread carefully:** When scoring the bread, use a gentle, shallow cut to avoid cutting into the walnuts. This will help the bread open up nicely during baking and prevent the walnuts from becoming exposed.\n\n**Additional tips for working with spelt flour:**\n\n* Spelt flour can be more delicate than other flours, so be gentle when handling the dough to avoid developing the gluten too much.\n* Spelt flour can absorb more liquid than other flours, so keep an eye on the dough's hydration and adjust as needed.\n* Spelt breads can be more dense than other breads, so be prepared for a slightly denser crumb.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to incorporate the walnuts into your Spelt and Walnut Bread dough successfully, resulting in a beautiful, evenly distributed walnut texture throughout the loaf. Happy baking!",
