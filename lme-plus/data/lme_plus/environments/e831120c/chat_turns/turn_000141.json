Here are some tips:\n\n1. **Separate each movie with a line break**: Make sure each movie title is on a new line, so that when you paste it into the spreadsheet, each movie will go into a new row.\n2. **Use a consistent format**: Try to use a consistent format for each movie, such as \"Title (Year)\" or \"Title - Rating\". This will make it easier to paste the data into the correct columns.\n3. **Remove any unnecessary characters**: Remove any unnecessary characters, such as commas or semicolons, that might cause issues when pasting into the spreadsheet.\n\nOnce you've formatted your list, follow these steps:\n\n1. Copy the list of movies from your note-taking app.\n2. Open your spreadsheet and select the first cell in the \"Movie Title\" column.\n3. Right-click and select \"Paste\" (or use Ctrl+V or Cmd+V).\n4. The movies will be pasted into the spreadsheet, one per row.\n5. Use the spreadsheet's auto-fill feature to fill in the rest of the columns. You can do this by dragging the fill handle (the small square at the bottom right of the cell) down to fill in the rest of the column.\n\nIf you need to, you can always adjust the formatting or add additional columns later.\n\nHow's that? Are you ready to give it a try?",
