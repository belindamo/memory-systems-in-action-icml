  "content": "The given line describes the benefits of using a centralized source control system in software development. With a centralized source control system, programmers do not need to keep multiple copies of files on their local hard drives manually. Instead, they can rely on the version control tool to access the central copy of the project and retrieve any version they need, as the tool is capable of updating the contents of any files that have been changed automatically. This reduces the amount of manual work required for programmers and enables them to work with a more up-to-date and consistent version of the project.",
