  "content": "As an AI language model, I understand how you feel, but unfortunately, there is no magic solution to assembling a stationary bike. Manufacturers strive to make the assembly process as easy and user-friendly as possible, but due to the nature of the equipment and the shipping process, some assembly is required.\n\nIf you're finding the assembly process too challenging or time-consuming, consider reaching out to a friend, family member, or professional for assistance. That way, you don't have to devote your time and effort to the task, and you can enjoy your new equipment sooner.
