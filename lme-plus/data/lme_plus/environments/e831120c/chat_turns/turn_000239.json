Let's get started!\n\nTo organize your movie list, I can suggest a few options:\n\n1. **Simple List**: We can create a plain list of movie titles, with the most recent ones at the top.\n2. **Categorized List**: We can categorize your movies by genre (e.g., action, comedy, sci-fi, etc.), director, or release year.\n3. **Movie Log**: We can create a log with columns for movie title, release year, genre, rating (out of 5 stars), and a brief review or notes.\n\nWhich option sounds appealing to you?\n\nAlso, since you just finished a Star Wars marathon, let's add those movies to the list first! Here's a suggested format:\n\n**Star Wars Marathon**\n\n1. Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n2. Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n3. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n4.
