  "content": "Absolutely! Okra can be a great addition to minestrone soup, and can add a nice texture and flavor to the dish. You can add the okra along with the other vegetables in step 2 of the recipe. I would recommend using about 1 cup of sliced okra, and adding it towards the end of the cooking time so that it doesn't get too soft or slimy. Enjoy!",
