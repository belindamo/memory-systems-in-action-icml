  "content": "I think I'll start with \"The Miracle of Mindfulness\" by Thich Nhat Hanh, as I've heard great things about it. I'll also check out \"The Self-Care Revolution\" by Suzy Reading, as it seems like a practical guide to prioritizing my well-being. I'll try to read a little bit each day and reflect on what I've learned.
