  "content": "That sounds like a great spotting! Congratulations on seeing the American robins building their nest.\n\nTo help you with your question, I'd need to know your location and the current time of year. Could you please tell me what state or region you're in? Additionally, since you mentioned you went on a trip on March 12th, I assume you're looking for information on what birds you might see in the spring season.\n\nOnce I have that information, I can provide you with a list of birds you might see at the nature reserve during this time of year.",
