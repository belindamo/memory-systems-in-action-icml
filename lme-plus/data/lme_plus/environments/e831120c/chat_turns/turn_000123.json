Deep Breathing Meditation: Sit in a comfortable, quiet place and inhale slowly and deeply for a count of four, hold the breath for a count of four, and then exhale slowly for a count of four. Repeat this cycle for 5-10 minutes.\n\n2. Mindfulness Meditation: Focus on the present moment, without judgment or distraction. Pay attention to your breath, your feelings, your body, and your surroundings.\n\n3. Body Scan Meditation: Lie down and focus on one part of your body at a time, starting with your toes and moving up to your head. Notice any tension or discomfort and let it go.\n\n4. Loving-Kindness Meditation: Send love, compassion, and kindness to yourself, loved ones, and even difficult people in your life.\n\n5. Visualization Meditation: Close your eyes and visualize a peaceful place, such as a beach or a forest. Engage your senses, imagining the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings of being there.\n\nRemember to be patient and consistent with your meditation practice, and to seek professional help if your anxiety and stress levels are severe.",
