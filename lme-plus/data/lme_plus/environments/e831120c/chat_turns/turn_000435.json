The exact species you'll see will depend on the specific location, time of year, and weather conditions, but here are some possibilities:\n\n1. **Shorebirds**: You might see species like:\n\t* Sanderlings: Small, sparrow-sized birds with a distinctive running motion along the beach.\n\t* Killdeer: Medium-sized plovers with a brown back and white belly, often seen running or flying along the beach.\n\t* Willets: Medium-sized shorebirds with a grayish-brown back and white belly, known for their loud, piercing calls.\n\t* Ruddy Turnstones: Small to medium-sized birds with a distinctive orange-red back and white belly, often seen probing for food in the sand and mud.\n2. **Seabirds**: You might spot species like:\n\t* Gulls: Several species of gulls, such as Herring Gulls, Laughing Gulls, or Ring-billed Gulls, can be seen along the coast.\n\t* Terns: Species like the Common Tern, Forster's Tern, or Royal Tern might be seen flying overhead or perched on rocks or sandbars.\n\t* Skuas: These medium-sized, predatory seabirds might be seen flying overhead or hovering near the water's surface.\n\t* Ospreys: These fish-eating birds of prey can be seen diving into the water to catch fish or perched on nearby rocks or poles.\n\nTo increase your chances of spotting shorebirds and seabirds, consider the following tips:\n\n* **Timing**: Visit the coastal state park during low tide, when more of the beach and mudflats are exposed, making it easier to spot shorebirds.\n* **Habitat**: Explore different habitats like beaches, mudflats, salt marshes, and rocky shores, as different species prefer different environments.\n* **Patience**: Spend time scanning the horizon, beaches, and water's edge, as shorebirds and seabirds can be quite active and mobile.\n* **Binoculars**: Bring a good pair of binoculars to help you spot birds at a distance and get a closer look.\n* **Field guide**: Consult a field guide or app to help you identify the species you see, as shorebirds and seabirds can be challenging to distinguish.\n\nRemember to respect these amazing birds and their habitats, keeping a safe distance and not disturbing them as they go about their daily lives.\n\nDo you have a favorite shorebird or seabird species you're hoping to spot during your visit, or any questions about the ones I mentioned?",
