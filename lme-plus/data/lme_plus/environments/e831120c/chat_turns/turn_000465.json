  "content": "I'd be happy to help you create a daily schedule that incorporates your walks with Emily.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your preferences and constraints? For example:\n\n* What time do you wake up and go to bed?\n* Do you have any fixed commitments or appointments that you need to schedule around (e.g., work, classes, family time)?\n* How many hours of sleep do you aim to get each night?\n* Are there any specific times of the day when you're most productive or focused?\n* Do you have any hobbies or activities that you'd like to make time for (e.g., exercise, reading, relaxation)?\n* Are there any specific goals or tasks you'd like to prioritize during the week?\n\nWith this information, I can help you create a personalized daily schedule that fits your needs and ensures you have buffer time for your walks with Emily.",
