By the way, I've been taking more baths lately since the weather started getting colder, and I found this amazing bath bomb at Lush that makes the water turn pink and it smells amazing. I've been using it about once a week and it's become a little self-care ritual for me. Do you have any other self-care tips or recommendations?",
