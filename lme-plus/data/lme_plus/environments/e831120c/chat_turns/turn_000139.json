Here are a few methods to help you speed up the process:\n\n**Method 1: Copy and Paste from a List**\n\nIf you have a list of movies in a text file or a note-taking app, you can copy and paste them into your spreadsheet. Here's how:\n\n1. Open your list of movies in a text editor or note-taking app.\n2. Select all the movies and copy them (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C).\n3. Open your spreadsheet and select the first cell in the \"Movie Title\" column.\n4. Right-click and select \"Paste\" (or use Ctrl+V or Cmd+V).\n5. The movies will be pasted into the spreadsheet, one per row.\n\n**Method 2: Use a Formula to Auto-Fill Columns**\n\nIf you have a list of movies with some columns already populated (e.g., title, release year, rating), you can use formulas to auto-fill other columns. For example, if you have a list of movies with titles and release years, you can use a formula to auto-fill the \"Franchise/Series\" column.\n\n1. Enter the formula in the first cell of the column you want to auto-fill.\n2. Use the `IF` function to check if the title matches a specific franchise or series.\n3. If the condition is true, enter the franchise or series name.\n\nExample formula: `=IF(A2=\"The Avengers\", \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\", \"\")`\n\n**Method 3: Use Online Tools or APIs**\n\nThere are online tools and APIs that can help you quickly add movies to your spreadsheet. For example:\n\n1. IMDb's API: You can use IMDb's API to fetch movie data and import it into your spreadsheet.\n2. Movie databases: Websites like Letterboxd, IMDb, or Rotten Tomatoes allow you to export your watchlist or create a CSV file with movie data.\n3. Spreadsheet add-ons: Some spreadsheet add-ons, like AutoCrat or MovieDB, can help you import movie data from online sources.\n\n**Method 4: Break it Down into Chunks**\n\nIf you have a large number of movies to add, break it down into smaller chunks. Set a goal to add, say, 10-20 movies at a time. This will make the task less overwhelming and help you stay focused.\n\nRemember to take breaks and save your progress regularly to avoid losing any data.\n\nWhich method do you think you'll find most helpful? Or do you have any other questions about entering data quickly?",
