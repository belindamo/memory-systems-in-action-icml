  "content": "Some manufacturers may offer assembly services for a fee, or you might consider hiring a professional to assemble the bike for you. That way, you don't have to devote your time and effort to set up the bike. However, assembling the bike yourself can be a valuable learning experience, and it's also a cost-saving alternative.\n\nManufacturers aim to provide quality products at an affordable price, which is why they may not include extra assembly services in the package. In addition, hiring someone to assemble the bike for you can be expensive and will increase the overall cost of the equipment. However, if you're finding the assembly process difficult or time-consuming, it's worth weighing the costs and benefits of hiring a professional or using the manufacturer's assembly service.",
