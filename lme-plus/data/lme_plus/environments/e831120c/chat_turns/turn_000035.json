Here are some tips on how to store your sourdough starter when you're not using it and how to revive it when you want to bake again:\n\n**Storing Your Sourdough Starter:**\n\n1. **Refrigerate:** Store your sourdough starter in the refrigerator to slow down its activity. This will help reduce the frequency of feeding and maintain the starter's health.\n2. **Use a clean container:** Transfer the starter to a clean, airtight container, such as a glass or ceramic container with a tight-fitting lid.\n3. **Store in a consistent environment:** Place the container in a consistent refrigerator environment, away from direct sunlight and temperature fluctuations.\n4. **Feed before storing:** Feed your starter once before storing it in the refrigerator to ensure it's active and healthy.\n5. **Store at the right temperature:** Store the starter at a consistent refrigerator temperature between 39\u00b0F and 45\u00b0F (4\u00b0C and 7\u00b0C).\n\n**Reviving Your Sourdough Starter:**\n\n1. **Allow time to revive:** Before using your stored starter, allow it to revive at room temperature (around 75\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F or 24\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C) for 24 to 48 hours.\n2. **Feed and wait:** Feed your starter once or twice during the revival period to help it regain its activity.\n3. **Monitor and adjust:** Observe your starter's activity and adjust the feeding schedule as needed.\n4. **Use when active:** Once your starter is active, bubbly, and frothy, it's ready to use in your recipe.\n\n**Tips for Long-Term Storage:**\n\n1. **Freeze:** If you won't be using your starter for an extended period, consider freezing it. Mix the starter with equal parts of water and flour to create a thick paste, then transfer it to an airtight container or freezer bag. Store in the freezer at 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or below.\n2. **Dehydrate:** Another option is to dehydrate your starter. Mix the starter with flour to create a thick paste, then spread it onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Dehydrate at 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C) for 1-2 hours, then store the dried starter in an airtight container.\n3. **Maintain a backup:** Consider maintaining a backup starter in case your primary starter becomes contaminated or dies. This will ensure you always have a healthy starter on hand.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to store your sourdough starter safely and revive it when you're ready to bake again. Happy baking!",
