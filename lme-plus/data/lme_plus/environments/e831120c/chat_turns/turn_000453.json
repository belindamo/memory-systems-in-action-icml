  "content": "In centralized source control, there is a single copy of the project stored in a central repository, and all developers access and modify this copy. The system records changes made by each developer and allows them to see each other's changes. The workflow for adding a new feature or fixing a bug in a project involves getting the latest changes made by other developers, making changes, and checking in changes to the main server so that other developers can see them.\n\nCentralized source control has some advantages, such as ease of use and a clear record of changes made by each developer. It is also relatively easy to set up and maintain. However, it has some limitations, such as a single point of failure if the central server goes down, and the need for developers to be online to access the latest changes. Additionally, branching and merging can be challenging in centralized systems.",
