  "content": "I understand your frustration. Assembling equipment like a stationary bike can be a bit challenging, especially when you have no prior experience. However, most manufacturers' main aim is to make the assembly process as easy and user-friendly as possible. Sometimes, it is more practical to provide parts in separate pieces that require assembly at home to reduce shipping and storage costs. Also, by assembling the equipment yourself, you become more familiar with the bike and can learn how to fix basic problems that may arise in the long run. If assembling equipment isn't your forte, you can always look for a pre-assembled bike option or hire a professional to help you out.",
