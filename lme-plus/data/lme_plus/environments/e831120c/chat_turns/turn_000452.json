  "content": "Centralized Source Control\n\u2022 Centralized source control systems are based on the idea that there's a single \"central\" copy of\nyour project somewhere. Programmers will check in (or commit) their changes to this central\ncopy.\n\u2022 \"Committing\" a change means to record the difference in the central system. Other programmers\ncan then see this change.\n\u2022 Also, it's possible to pull down the change. The version control tool will automatically update the\ncontents of any files that were changed.\n\u2022 Most modern version control systems deal with \"changesets,\" which are a group of changes\n(possibly too many files) that should be treated as a cohesive whole.\n\u2022 Programmers no longer must keep many copies of files on their hard drives manually. The version\ncontrol tool can talk to the central copy and retrieve any version they need on the fly.\n\u2022 Some of the most common-centralized version control systems you may have heard of or used are\nTeam Foundation Version Control (TFVC), CVS, Subversion (or SVN), and Perforce.\n\u2022 If working with a centralized source control system, your workflow\nfor adding a new feature or fixing a bug in your project will\nusually look something like this:\n\u2022 Get the latest changes other people have made from the central server.\n\u2022 Make your changes, and make sure they work correctly.\n\u2022 Check in your changes to the main server so that other programmers can\nsee them.",
