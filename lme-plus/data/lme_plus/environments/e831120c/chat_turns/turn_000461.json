  "content": "To add to the previous answer, trunk-based development is a software development technique that emphasizes continuous integration and delivery by using a single, shared code repository, often referred to as the \"trunk\". In this approach, developers work on isolated branches for specific features or fixes and merge them back into the trunk as soon as possible to ensure that the main branch always contains production-quality code.\n\nStrengths of trunk-based development:\n\n* Encourages continuous integration and delivery, allowing for more frequent and reliable releases\n* Facilitates collaboration and communication among team members\n* Reduces the risk of conflicts and integration issues by continuously merging small changes into the main branch\n* Simplifies the release process by ensuring that the main branch always contains production-quality code\n\nWeaknesses of trunk-based development:\n\n* Can be challenging to manage for larger teams or projects with many branches\n* Requires a high level of discipline and coordination among team members to ensure that the main branch remains stable and reliable\n* May not be suitable for projects that require a more structured and controlled approach to software development.",
