  "content": "I'll definitely try to set a daily step goal and start with small increases. I've been doing a 30-minute brisk walk every morning, so I think I can try to add another 10-15 minutes to that. Also, I'll try to take the stairs more often and walk during my lunch break. Do you have any suggestions for some good walking routes or apps that can help me find new places to walk?",
