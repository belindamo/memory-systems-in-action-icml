Workers faced increased pressure and scrutiny, sometimes leading to labor unrest and concerns about worker exploitation (Kanigel, 1997, p. 65). This period highlights the dual nature of Pennsylvania's industrial ambitions: while progress and efficiency brought prosperity, they also raised questions about the human cost of rapid growth.\n\nThree Mile Island: The Crisis of Pennsylvania's Energy Dynasty\n\nThe Three Mile Island catastrophe serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with Pennsylvania's industrial legacy. On March 28, 1979, a partial meltdown occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, resulting in the release of radioactive gases (Walker, 2004, p. 108).
