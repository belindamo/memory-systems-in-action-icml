  "content": "That's really interesting. I've been experimenting with making Japchae at home, and I think I've finally perfected the recipe. I've got the sweet potato starch noodles down, and the trick to getting the veggies cooked just right. But I'd love to try incorporating some Indian spices into my Japchae recipe. Can you give me some suggestions on how to do that? Maybe some specific spice blends or techniques I could use?",
