  "content": "To add to the previous response, Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension to Git that allows developers to manage large files within a Git repository more efficiently. Git LFS replaces large files such as audio, video, graphics, and other binaries with \"pointer\" files that contain metadata and a reference to the actual file's location. This reference is stored in Git, while the actual binary file is stored in an external LFS server.\n\nGit LFS helps keep Git repositories small and fast by reducing the size of the repository, improving cloning and checkout performance, and making collaboration more efficient. It is particularly useful for large teams working with large files, where network bandwidth and storage capacity are limited.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that using Git LFS does come with some limitations. For example, it requires a dedicated LFS server or a third-party hosting service that supports Git LFS, and it may incur additional costs for storage and bandwidth usage. Additionally, managing LFS files can be more complex than managing regular files in Git, and there may be compatibility issues with certain Git tools and plugins.",
