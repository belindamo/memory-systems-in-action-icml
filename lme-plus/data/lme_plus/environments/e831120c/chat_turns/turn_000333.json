  "content": "Yes, there are plenty of extreme water sports and activities to try in Bali. Here are a few:\n\n1. White Water Rafting: Bali has several rivers with grade II-IV rapids that offer an exhilarating white water rafting experience. The Ayung, Telaga Waja, and Melangit rivers are popular options for rafting.\n\n2. Flyboarding: Flyboarding is a relatively new water sport that involves being propelled into the air with a water jet pack. Bali Jetpacks and Water Sports, Air Bali Parasailing, and Bali Wake Park are some operators that offer flyboarding in Bali.\n\n3. Waterfall Canyoning: This activity involves exploring canyons and waterfalls by rappelling, jumping into natural pools, and sliding down natural water chutes. Bali Sobek and Adventure & Spirit are some companies that offer waterfall canyoning tours.\n\n4. Stand-Up Paddleboarding (SUP) Yoga: Combine the challenge of SUP with the relaxation of yoga with SUP yoga classes. Floating Leaf Eco-Luxury Retreat, Serenity Yoga, and Pranava Yoga are a few studios that offer SUP yoga in Bali.\n\n5. Scuba Diving with Manta Rays: This is a thrilling activity for experienced divers. Bali's Nusa Penida Island is a popular spot to dive with giant manta rays from June to September.\n\n6. Surfing: Surfing is already a popular adrenaline-pumping water sport in Bali, but for a truly extreme experience, try big wave surfing at the infamous surf breaks of Uluwatu, Padang Padang or Shipwrecks.\n\nAlways choose licensed operators and double- check their safety record before participating in any extreme water sports or activities.",
