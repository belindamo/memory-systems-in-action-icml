known as ali words i have a bachelor's degree in philosophy and i've worked with and written about prometheus rising over the past five years last week we read chapter six the time binding semantic circuit if you missed it look it up on our youtube channel this session will also be recorded and uploaded so the exercises last time did anyone have a chance to try any of that i tried one um incidentally someone left a uh i came across a dvd of a movie called gods not dead and it is a christian film about an atheist professor who does not act like any philosophy professor i ever had um who's like violently atheist and he forces all the students on the first day of class to write like god is dead and this one kid he refuses um because he's like a devout christian and then it's like i didn't get all the way through it because of just like i've been busy lately but he uh it's about his relationship with god and i think the atheist professor at the end probably converts to christianity because he realizes maybe he should soften up a little bit but um so i'm not an atheist myself but it is definitely not the world view that i'm from it's from people that are like violently anti-philosophy whoever wrote that film uh it was very ignorant of philosophy and philosophers and like their arguments for the existence or not arguing for the existence of god just like had no connection with the history of theology like they could have just dropped in kierkegaard and resolved the whole thing so yeah i'm rambling now that's interesting but uh yeah it's good to find like movies are really easy you can find movies that support ideologies that you don't agree with um a good thing to look at that is of historical value is there a lot of um early ussr um cinema that were like avant-garde like they invented the montage so like you learn about the history of film but you also see how they're using it to like glorify the working class um and you can see a very different kind of dialectic good stuff um i had a question you know when i was doing this exercise i did get a short chance for it i find it quite hard to really have something of a new insight i was wondering if you had any like aha moments about this experience that you thought are interesting to share um not with that movie uh so one of the philosophers related to negentropy and accelerationism there's a whole movement now called accelerationism is nick land who is himself or maybe was an occultist he did stuff where he created a decimal based kabbalah system like starting with zero through nine called the pneumogram and it was like also based on like cthulhu and lovecraftian stuff but uh he has moved to china and i'm not totally up to date on him but his works at the very least are used by a lot of accelerationist they call themselves the dark enlightenment philosophers a lot of them are very fascist and racist and there are like subreddits where you can read um where they like post oh is it like the daily mold bug or something i don't keep up with it but uh and they like find articles that support their racist ideas and then they comment about it and it's interesting to see these people i actually read the subreddit for like a month or two like not every day and there were times where i could really feel the emotion and the hurt that some of these people had how threatened they felt and a lot of it is about themselves uh feeling threatened and that's like threatening their second circuit and even their their first circuit especially with the uh rioting that has happened in america this year there there were some telegram groups that i was watching where uh i was looking at both black lives matter groups and also reactionary groups just to compare the intel they were sharing was interesting and yeah it can be an experience watching like the black lives matter riots as they were happening on telegram yeah yeah i did the two sometimes you really feel definitely the different echo chambers and they touch uh here and there sometimes you know like uh even you'll see instances where the same info bit again it gets explained differently in these different groups and exactly each will use it uh just the same way as the other group is to um well fuel the fire of their cause and so on yeah i guess i stumbled yeah exactly like accidentally into this group or a couple threads that had to do with this new meme format which is um again you know relating a lot of mysticism and and philosophy ancient history you know things that are very dear to me and inspire me to do great you know people are putting this together and and sewing it into some kind of a you know ethnic supreme narrative and that's you know it's kind of quite shocking for me to see so then i figured hey let's stick around for a little bit and take a look because well i was going to go try anyway for the exercise but then to see again you know what is inspiring me to open my heart and develop things like empathy and altruism for other people it's fuel on the fire of their um like ethno nationalism and those kind of things it's it's really crazy to think about that i guess that was my my primary insight from from the exercise yeah that's what it was for me really is just having empathy and especially in the more extreme groups that um that you either agree with or you don't um they're all people and a lot of them in the more extreme groups are really afraid is what i've seen in the looking at like the more racist type groups and um you know they they deserve empathy even like anyone everyone does and if you can actually feel their fear even if you come to the conclusion that's irrational i think that that is a valuable human experience the time binding dialectic acceleration and deceleration in the dialectic between nature and the socially constructed world the human organism is transformed in this dialectic man produces reality and thereby produces himself and that is by burger and luckman in the social construction of reality the first and second circuits are evolutionary stable strategies they've worked in more or less the same form not just for primates but for other animals and many other species over vast eons of time the third semantic circuit is an evolutionary unstable strategy it could very accurately be called revolutionary rather than evolutionary the first two circuits are based on negative feedback in the biological sense they maintain homeostasis that is they return over and over to the same ecological ethological balances they function on negative feedback sorry the function of negative feedback is to return to such a steady state the time-binding semantic circuit is not based on such steady-state positive feedback it is a mechanism of what cyberneticists and biologists called positive feedback it does not return to a steady state but constantly seeks a new equilibrium at a higher energy level negative feedback returns to a fixed point like a thermostat positive feedback seeks a moving goal like a guided missile the first two circuits maintain that which is more or less constant in human affairs they are totally cyclical and relate directly to the cycles found in history by vico hegel and similar philosophers assert the third circuit has always been hemmed in and heavily sanctioned with rules laws prohibitions taboos etc because it breaks up such cycles it leads if unleashed to an upward hurling spiral in societies where the third semantic circuit has been partially unleashed it has never been totally freed in any society the upward spiral immediately appears this used to be known as progress before that word became unfashionable the upward spiral whether we call it progress or not is characteristic of what karl popper calls open societies these are secular humanistic societies cultures relatively free of taboo and dogmatism such freedom up to and including the present is only relative because many taboos are unconscious and pass themselves off as common sense or common decency whoever challenges them is by definition a heretic by definition a traitor or by definition an irresponsible nut rationalists who dominate in relatively open societies also have their own taboos as we shall see it was historian henry adams who first conceived the idea that there might be a mathematical expression describing the rate of change of human societies under the influence of newton's physics adam suggested and he was very tentative about this a fact to be remembered by those who ridicule his naivete that the utilization of energy might move forward as the inverse square of time just as newton's gravity functions as the inverse square of distance accepting the anthropology of his day adams assumed that humanity in its present form was about 90 000 plus years old he then reckoned that it took most of that time to arrive at galileo the scientific method beginnings of the industrial revolution and the great pleat and the great leap forward in energy utilization characteristic of the modern age or the open society since 300 is the inverse square of 90 000 adams assumed that the next great leap was inhab was happening while he was writing around 1900 300 years after galileo looking about him he decided this next jump to a higher energy was occurring in the researches of the curies who had just discovered radioactivity as many commentators have noted it is impossible to read atoms on the subject without feeling that he is very accurately forecasting the atomic age adams went further with the exhilaration of a great idea since 17 plus is the inverse square of 300 he predicted that the next great evolutionary stage would begin in 1917 plus and since the inverse square of 17 is 4 plus he predicted that the next step in around 19 uh that the next step would be around 1922 by then he said we should have infinite energy at our disposal it didn't quite work out that way nevertheless henry adams was on the right track his math was just oversimplified also on the right track was henry's brother brooks who is also looking for laws in history brooks observed a pattern which may or may not be entirely true but is as approximately true as the similar generalizations of vico hegel marx and twinbe every civilization brooks adams proposed goes through four stages one the monopolization of knowledge by priests eg the egyptian priests kept written language a secret among themselves as did the mayan priests two the monopolization of military power by conquerors who made themselves states or governments e.g a friend a french bastard tom payne's description of william the conqueror lands on the store a french bastard lands on the shore of england with the superior technology warriors on horse versus native warriors on foot and he becomes king his relatives and sycophants become lords of the land three the monopolization of the land by those landlords the extraction of tributes rent from those who live on the land four the monopolization of the issue of currency by national banks the extraction of tribute interest for each piece of currency put into circulation most civilizations seem to have gone through at least three of these stages not always consecutively some have passed through all four brooks adams also noted that centralized capital the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few interrelated families seems to have been moving steadily west throughout recorded history the first major accumulations are to be found in sumer the center of money power then shifted to egypt to greece to the italian peninsula to various parts of germany and then to london at the time brooks was writing around 1900 he saw the balance teetering between london and new york and he predicted the decline of the english empire would shift the balance to new york within the first half of the 20th century he seems to have been right brooks adams had no theory as to why this westward movement of wealth had been going on for 6 000 years he merely observed the pattern the shift is still continuing in the opinion of many for instance carl oglesby in the cowboy vs yankee war sees american politics since 1950 dominated by a struggle between old yankee wealth the new york boston axis which replaced london after 1900 and new cowboy wealth texas california oil and aerospace billionaires as of 1997 it looks like the cowboys are winning which is what you would expect if there were a real law between behind adam's east-west migration of capital one night in 1919 counts alfred korzynski awoke from a vivid dream tears of joy streaming down his face with a vivid sense that the passing of signals from generation to generation the third circuit time-binding function was what distinguished us from the other primates korzynski originally suggested that the time binding could be defined mathematically he dropped this idea later his math was as inadequate as henry adams but it is worth looking at for a moment to retrace the steps by which the actual law of acceleration was discovered what korzynski assumed at first was that if all the inventions discoveries etc of some hypothetical first generation of humans could be represented by p and the rates by which the second generation could surpass this r and mathematically the sum of total inventions discoveries etc at the end of the second generation would be p r p times r quite true algebraically then after third generation the stockpile would be p times r times r and after four generations p r r r generalized this becomes p times r to the power of t where c is the number of generations from whatever generation you have picked as your baseline uh there's a little blank in the copy of the pdf i have but it says the curve of if you put it on graph paper ascends more rapidly with each generation korzynski was looking straight at what alvin toffler later called future shock and was trying to write a mathematical formula for it many variables in economic t\"",
