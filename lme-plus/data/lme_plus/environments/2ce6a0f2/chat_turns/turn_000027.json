  "content": "The first part of the plot for the first chapter involved the amnesiacs waking up in separate locations. Yukiko wakes up first in an abandoned part of the tower basement, and causes takeshi's room to drop from the top of the tower, which wakes him up. They don't remember anything, and they don't know their names. They are instructed to climb a tower where the Gladiators are at by their inner demons. These inner demons also prompt the amnesiacs to technically demolish a slave encampment on the way to the tower by eliminating the encampment staff who were abusing the slaves (this introduces the player to the secret protagonists' feral state) once they finally make it too the top of the tower, they meet each other face to face for the first time and suddenly have a flashback of them fighting each other. They don't completely understand the flashback, but they are in a lot of pain and assume the other is the cause of their mental anguish. Yukiko wants to avoid Takeshi, however Takeshi attacks yukiko and wants answers. They cause an explosion and slowly fight their way down the tower, with yukiko making evasive maneuvers, and takeshi being a brute. Once they make it to the bottom, yukiko manages to trick Takeshi and trip him over the edge of a nearby cliff. However, because yukiko is not that strong, she falls in as well. Yukiko doesn't fall very far because she is able to catch herself, however Takeshi falls to the deepest part of the Ravine. This wasn't yukiko's intention, so she tried to go after Takeshi, but is too exhausted, and falls into the nearby river instead. This sets up Takeshi to be found by the Renegades and Yukiko to be found by the Gladiators. The first part ends as they fall unconscious in separate locations again. Would this be a good introduction for the amnesiacs? What are some ways to refine this first part of the plot?",
