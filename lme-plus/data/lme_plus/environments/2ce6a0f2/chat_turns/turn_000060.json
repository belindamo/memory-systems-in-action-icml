  "content": "I understand your frustration and concern regarding the symbolic representation of women during the 19th century in France. It is true that the use of Marianne and other female figures to represent the ideals of liberty and democracy may have reflected a larger societal attitude toward women and their roles in society. Moreover, it is true that women faced significant discrimination and marginalization throughout the 19th century, and the use of symbols and empty rhetoric did not necessarily translate into meaningful change in women's lives. However, it is also important to acknowledge the ways in which symbols and representation can impact social and political attitudes, and how the use of female figures as symbols can contribute to broader conversations about gender equity and representation. It is up to us to continue to challenge and examine the ways in which women and other marginalized groups are represented, and to work toward a more just and equitable society for all.",
