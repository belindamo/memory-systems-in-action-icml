  "content": "Presenting the gift in person can make it a more personal and meaningful experience for your roommate's son. If possible, consider presenting it to him in person, especially since you missed his graduation ceremony. This will give you an opportunity to congratulate him in person, apologize for missing his special day, and share in his achievement.\n\nHowever, if you can't meet up with him in person, having it shipped directly to him is still a great option. You can include a heartfelt note or a card with a personal message, explaining why you chose this gift and how proud you are of his accomplishment.\n\nIf you do decide to have it shipped directly, consider adding a small touch, such as:\n\n* A handwritten note or card with a personal message\n* A small care package with some of his favorite snacks or a MIT-themed item\n* A gift box or wrapping that matches the occasion\n\nThis will make the gift feel more thoughtful and special, even if you're not there to present it in person.\n\nRemember to check with your roommate about their son's preferences and schedule before making a final decision. They might have some insight into what would work best for him.\n\nHow do you think you'll proceed? Will you try to present it in person or have it shipped directly?",
