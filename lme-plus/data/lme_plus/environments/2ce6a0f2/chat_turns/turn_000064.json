  "content": "Yes, there are several other invasive species that scientists are concerned about in the Galapagos Islands, including:\n\n1. Common wasp: This invasive species was accidentally introduced in the 1980s and preys on native insects and spiders, causing a decline in these populations.\nScientists are using bait traps and biological controls to manage common wasp populations.\n\n2. Smooth-billed ani: A bird species that competes with native birds for food and nesting sites.\nScientists are working to control smooth-billed ani populations through manual removal and reintroduction of native bird species.\n\n3. Green iguana: A non-native species that feeds on native plants and competes with native iguanas, leading to a decline in their population.\nScientists are using a combination of trapping and hunting to manage green iguana populations.\n\n4. Mosquitoes: Several introduced mosquito species carry diseases that can affect native animals.\nScientists are using biological controls such as introducing mosquito larvae-eating fish in freshwater habitats to manage mosquito populations.\n\nOverall, the management of invasive species remains a top priority for conservation efforts in the Galapagos Islands, and scientists are continually monitoring and managing threats to protect the unique and fragile ecosystem.",
