  "content": "Francessca, Adelaide, Eugene, and Rhydderch are still separated from their respective groups, and are not present when Damjan and Damia are introduced. Instead, the two parties take the time to fully tend to their respective unconscious amnesiacs, and find enough evidence to prove that their amnesiac is the same person as their mysterious friend from the gladiator trials (not only are the tools they have and use are similar, yukiko has the bracelet Adelaide made for her before the end of the trials, and Takeshi has the same scarf cloak Rhydderch gave him.) They also analyze that their friend has sustained some form of brain trauma, and may not remember things. Does it make sense for the two parties to Platoon up with their respective amnesiac without the agreement with the rest of the team? Would it make sense for them to suspect Tamma and Yuudai to be working against the amnesiacs? It is important to note that Platoon assignments are permanent, which is why everyone needs to be in agreement in which Platoon they want to be in.",
