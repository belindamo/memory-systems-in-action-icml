However, I'm a large language model, I don't have have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide specific recommendations for yoga classes near you.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to find yoga classes in your area:\n\n1. **Google Search**: Simply type \"yoga classes near me\" or \"yoga studios near my location\" and Google will show you the nearest options along with their addresses, phone numbers, and reviews.\n2. **Yoga Studio Websites**: Look up popular yoga studio chains like YogaWorks, CorePower Yoga, or Bikram Yoga, and check if they have a location near you.\n3. **Yoga Apps**: Download yoga apps like YogaGlo, Down Dog, or ClassPass, which allow you to search for classes and studios in your area.\n4. **Facebook or Social Media**: Check Facebook or other social media platforms for local yoga groups or events in your area.\n5. **Ask Around**: Ask friends, family, or coworkers if they know of any good yoga studios or classes in your area.\n\nRemember to always research the studio and instructor before attending a class, and read reviews to ensure it's a good fit for you.\n\nCongratulations again on participating in the \"Yoga for a Cause\" event, and I hope you find a great yoga class near you to continue your practice!",
