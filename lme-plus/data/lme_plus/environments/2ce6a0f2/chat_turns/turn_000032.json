  "content": "Yes, it makes sense for Francessca and Eugene to stay behind with their respective amnesiac, as they too were close with them prior to their amnesia. This would add an extra layer of tension to the situation, as Francessca and Eugene would be at odds with Tamma and Yuudai, who are still searching for the person they believe to be their true companion. Additionally, it would also reinforce the idea that the amnesiacs have switched places, and the true identity of each person is not yet clear. This could also create a parallel situation where Adelaide and Rhydderch are in a similar situation as Francessca and Eugene, as they both believe they have found the right person, but are at odds with the other members of their team.",
