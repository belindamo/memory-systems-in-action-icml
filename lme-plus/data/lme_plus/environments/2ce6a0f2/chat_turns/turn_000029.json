  "content": "Alright, I think I have some ideas. The next part of the plot is shortly after the amnesiacs fall unconscious. There was obviously a lot of commotion with the amnesiacs making a mess of the area. However, the organization can't investigate it themselves because they don't want to expose themselves. So they wake up the Gladiators and the Renegades to have them investigate the situation in their place. Each perspective starts with a cut scene explaining the character's experience in the Gladiator Trials, as well as their connection with the amnesiacs. Since the amnesiacs are unplayable at this moment, players playing the secret perspectives will switch to either Adelaide and Rhydderch depending on which amnesiac they chose to play as. This is also where a cutscene will play explaining Adelaide's and Rhydderch's experience in the trials as well as their childhood memory of their timetraveling hero. Once the cut scene finishes and each character is ready, they leave individual confinement and are introduced to the other characters on their respective teams. It's important to note that Damjan and Damia are not present in this section. The two are made to tame the amnesiacs mental instabilities, and sense the amnesiacs have technically switched places, the organization is waiting for when the amnesiacs are found before waking up the tamer twins and deploying them into their respective teams. After introductions, normally they would let the survivors chose which Platoon they want to be in and which people they want to work with. However because they are missing some people, they decide to postpone this and deploys everyone onto the field to find their missing members. This becomes the tutorial to the six main characters. What are some ways to refine this section?",
