Here are some tips to help you master Baptiste's Burst Heal during ultimates:\n\n1. **Anticipate ultimates**: Pay attention to the enemy team's ultimate meters and anticipate when they're about to use their ultimates. This will give you time to position yourself and prepare to use your Burst Heal.\n2. **Positioning is crucial**: Make sure you're in a safe position to use your Burst Heal, ideally near the center of the team or near the heroes who will be affected by the ultimate. Avoid positioning yourself in a way that makes you vulnerable to damage or focus fire.\n3. **Watch for visual cues**: Pay attention to the visual cues that indicate an ultimate is about to be used, such as the animation, sound effects, or the ultimate's casting time. This will help you react faster and use your Burst Heal more effectively.\n4. **Use your Burst Heal proactively**: Don't wait for the ultimate to land before using your Burst Heal. Use it just before the ultimate goes off, or as soon as you see the visual cues. This will help you heal your teammates before they take damage.\n5. **Focus on the most vulnerable heroes**: Identify the heroes on your team who are most vulnerable to the ultimate and prioritize healing them first. This might be heroes with low health, or those who are already taking damage.\n6. **Use your Burst Heal in conjunction with other abilities**: Combine your Burst Heal with other abilities, such as your Biotic Launcher or Immortality Field, to create a powerful healing burst.\n7. **Practice your reaction time**: Practice using your Burst Heal in response to different ultimates and scenarios. The more you practice, the faster your reaction time will become.\n8. **Improve your situational awareness**: Develop your situational awareness by playing Baptiste regularly and learning to recognize the signs of an impending ultimate. This will help you react faster and make better decisions during critical moments.\n9. **Communicate with your team**: Communicate with your team about the enemy team's ultimates and your plan to use your Burst Heal. This will help your team stay coordinated and make the most of your healing.\n10. **Review your gameplay**: Watch replays of your own gameplay to identify areas for improvement. Analyze your reaction time, positioning, and decision-making during ultimates, and work on improving these aspects of your gameplay.\n\nTo improve your reaction time, try the following:\n\n* Practice reaction-based exercises, such as clicking on a button as soon as a visual cue appears on screen.\n* Play other fast-paced games or modes, such as Overwatch's Arcade mode, to improve your reflexes and reaction time.\n* Focus on developing your situational awareness and anticipation skills, which will help you react faster to ultimates.\n\nRemember, improving your reaction time and Burst Heal usage takes time and practice. Keep working at it, and you'll become a pro at using Baptiste's Burst Heal during ultimates!",
