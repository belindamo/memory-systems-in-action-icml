  "content": "Hi-Res Audio and FLAC are related but not exactly the same thing. Let me break it down for you:\n\n**Hi-Res Audio (HRA)**:\n\nHi-Res Audio is a term used to describe audio files that have a higher resolution than the standard CD quality (16-bit/44.1 kHz). Hi-Res Audio files typically have a higher sampling rate and bit depth, which results in a more detailed and accurate sound reproduction.\n\nCommon Hi-Res Audio formats include:\n\n* 24-bit/96 kHz\n* 24-bit/192 kHz\n* 32-bit/384 kHz\n\nHi-Res Audio can be compressed or uncompressed, and it can be encoded in various formats, such as FLAC, ALAC, or WAV.\n\n**FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)**:\n\nFLAC is a specific audio format that is a type of lossless compression. It's a way to compress audio files without losing any of the original data, resulting in a perfect, exact copy of the original audio. FLAC is often used to store and distribute Hi-Res Audio files.\n\nFLAC files are compressed using a lossless algorithm, which reduces the file size without sacrificing any of the audio quality. This makes FLAC files smaller than uncompressed audio files, but still retains the full audio data.\n\nKey differences:\n\n* Hi-Res Audio is a term that describes the quality of the audio, whereas FLAC is a specific audio format.\n* Hi-Res Audio can be compressed or uncompressed, while FLAC is a lossless compression format.\n* FLAC is a container format that can hold Hi-Res Audio files, but not all Hi-Res Audio files are in FLAC format.\n\nIn summary:\n\n* Hi-Res Audio refers to the quality of the audio, which can be stored in various formats, including FLAC.\n* FLAC is a lossless compression format that can store Hi-Res Audio files, ensuring that the audio quality is preserved.\n\nWhen you see \"Hi-Res Audio\" mentioned in music streaming services or audio equipment, it means that the audio is of high quality, but it might not necessarily be in FLAC format. If you want to ensure that you're getting the best possible sound quality, look for services or files that specifically mention FLAC or lossless compression.",
