  "content": "While these services are primarily music-focused, some of them do offer a significant collection of podcasts. Here's a brief rundown:\n\n1. **Tidal**: Tidal has a limited podcast selection, but it's growing. They've partnered with popular podcast networks like NPR, The New York Times, and BBC Sounds. You can expect to find around 10,000-20,000 podcasts on Tidal.\n2. **Amazon Music HD**: Amazon Music HD offers a large collection of podcasts, with over 100,000 titles to choose from. They've also integrated their Audible audiobook service, so you can access audiobooks and podcasts in one place.\n3. **Deezer HiFi**: Deezer HiFi has a dedicated podcast section with around 30,000-40,000 podcasts. They've also introduced a feature called \"Flow,\" which combines music and podcasts into a single, personalized stream.\n4. **Qobuz**: Qobuz focuses primarily on music, but they do offer a small selection of podcasts, around 10,000-20,000 titles. However, their podcast catalog is not as extensive as some of the other services.\n5. **Apple Music**: Apple Music has a massive podcast library with over 800,000 titles. They've also introduced a podcast-specific app, Apple Podcasts, which allows for easy discovery and subscription.\n\nIf podcasts are a crucial part of your daily commute, you might want to consider using a dedicated podcast app like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Google Podcasts, which offer even larger collections of podcasts.\n\nHowever, if you want to use a single app for both music and podcasts, Amazon Music HD or Apple Music might be a good choice. Both services offer a large music library and a significant collection of podcasts, making them a great option for your Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones.\n\nRemember, you can always try out the free trials or free versions of these services to see which one best fits your needs.",
