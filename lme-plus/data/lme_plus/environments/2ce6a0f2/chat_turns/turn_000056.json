  "content": "It is true that during the 19th century, women did not have equal rights in France or in many other parts of the world. The use of Marianne as a symbol does not excuse or mitigate the fact that women faced significant discrimination and unequal treatment in both the public and private spheres. However, it is also worth noting that the use of Marianne as a symbol was not necessarily intended to perpetuate discrimination against women. Symbols like Marianne were a way of expressing a vision of a more just and egalitarian society, and they were often used by progressive movements to advance political and social change. While it is important to hold historical figures and societies accountable for their flaws and failures, it is also important to recognize the ways in which they strove to make the world a better, more equal place.",
