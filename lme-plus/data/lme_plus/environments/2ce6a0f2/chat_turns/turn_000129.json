  "content": "I think what struck me most was the priest's emphasis on how holding onto resentment and anger can consume us, and how forgiveness can bring a sense of peace. It really hit home for me because I've been struggling to forgive someone who wronged me. The sermon gave me a new perspective on the matter and made me realize that forgiveness is not just about the other person, but about my own well-being.",
