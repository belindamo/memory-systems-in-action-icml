  "content": "Presenting the gift in person will definitely make it a more special and memorable experience for your roommate's son.\n\nAs for mentioning the gift in advance, it's up to you. Here are some pros and cons of each approach:\n\n**Mentioning the gift in advance:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Your roommate's son might be more excited and looking forward to the meeting\n* You can gauge his interest and make sure he's available to meet up\n\nCons:\n\n* It might build up expectations, and the gift might not meet them\n* It could take away from the surprise element\n\n**Keeping the gift a surprise:**\n\nPros:\n\n* The surprise and excitement will be palpable when you present the gift\n* It will be a nice, unexpected gesture that will show you care\n\nCons:\n\n* He might not be emotionally prepared for a gift, and it could catch him off guard\n* You risk him not being in the right mindset to fully appreciate the gift\n\nConsidering the occasion and the fact that you're making an effort to make up for missing his graduation, I think keeping the gift a surprise might be the way to go. It will add an extra layer of excitement and thoughtfulness to the gesture.\n\nHowever, if you're concerned about his schedule or preferences, you could mention that you have a small gift for him, without revealing what it is. This will give him a heads-up without spoiling the surprise.\n\nWhen you reach out to your roommate, you could say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I was thinking of getting together to catch up and celebrate [son's name]'s graduation. I have a small gift for him that I think he'll appreciate. Would love to schedule a time to meet up over dinner or coffee. Let me know what works for you and your family.\"\n\nThis way, you're hinting at the gift without giving away the surprise.\n\nWhat do you think? Will you keep the gift a surprise or mention it in advance?",
