Since you're attending a corporate event, it's better to err on the side of caution and dress professionally, but not too formally.\n\nHere are some tips to help you decide:\n\n* Check the invitation: If you received a formal invitation, it might specify a dress code or provide a hint about the attire. Look for keywords like \"business casual,\" \"cocktail attire,\" or \"formal.\"\n* Consider the venue: If the party is being held at a upscale venue, such as a country club or a fancy restaurant, you may want to dress more formally. If it's at a casual location, like a park or a backyard, you can dress more relaxed.\n* Time of day: If the party is during the day, you can opt for business casual attire. If it's an evening event, you might want to dress more formally.\n* Company culture: If your husband's company has a more formal or conservative culture, it's better to dress more professionally. If the company is more relaxed and casual, you can dress accordingly.\n* Dress for the guest of honor: Remember, the party is celebrating the graduate's achievement, so you might want to dress in a way that shows respect for their accomplishment.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, you can't go wrong with business casual attire, such as:\n\n* A blouse or a nice top with dress pants or a skirt\n* A dressy pair of slacks or nice jeans with a button-down shirt or a nice blouse\n* A blazer or a cardigan to add a professional touch\n* Comfortable yet dressy shoes\n\nAvoid overly casual clothing like ripped jeans, t-shirts, or sneakers. You want to show respect for the occasion and the graduate's achievement.\n\nDon't forget to RSVP by tomorrow, and have fun at the party!\n\nHow's that? Do you have any other questions about what to wear or the party itself?",
