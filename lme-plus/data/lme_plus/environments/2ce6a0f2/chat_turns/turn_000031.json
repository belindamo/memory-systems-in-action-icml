  "content": "I can work with that. It's probably important to note that Yukiko was intended to join the Renegades and for Takeshi to join the Gladiators, as this would separate yukiko from Adelaide and takeshi from rhydderch, since the two pairs were very close. As such, Tamma is hoping they find Takeshi and yuudai is hoping to find yukiko. However, after some fighitng and searching, the Gladiators find yukiko and the Renegades find Takeshi. Tamma and Yuudai say they found the wrong person, and insist they keep searching, because it was stated the person they are looking for is the opposite gender. The team acknowledges this, however Adelaide and Rhydderch are adamant that they found the right person, and should be give medical assistance, as the amnesiac they found is unconscious with possible brain damage. The teams decide to keep searching at the insistence of Tamma and Yuudai, leaving Adelaide and Rhydderch behind with their respective amnesiac. Would it also make sense for Francessca and Eugene to stay behind with their respecitve amnesiac as well, since they were also close with them before their amnesia, and do not mistake Tamma/Yuudai for their mysterious friend back in the gladiator trials?",
