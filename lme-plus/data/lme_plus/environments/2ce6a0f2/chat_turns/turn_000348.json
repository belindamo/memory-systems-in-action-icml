  "content": "I'm actually interested in exploring more recipes that use sumac and za'atar, especially since I've been cooking at home more frequently lately. I think it started about 6 weeks ago when I saw a recipe for chicken parmesan on Pinterest and decided to give it a try. Since then, I've been experimenting with new recipes and ingredients, and I'd love to try more Middle Eastern-inspired dishes. Do you have any favorite recipes that feature these spices, or can you recommend some dishes that I should try?",
