  "content": "Both Headspace and Calm offer features to help you establish a consistent meditation habit, including daily reminders. Here's how they work:\n\n**Headspace:**\n\n1. **Daily Meditation Reminder**: Headspace allows you to set a daily reminder to meditate at a specific time. To set a reminder:\n\t* Open the app and go to the \"Home\" tab.\n\t* Tap the \"Settings\" icon (gear icon) in the top-right corner.\n\t* Scroll down to \"Reminders\" and toggle the switch to \"On\".\n\t* Choose your preferred reminder time (in your case, 6:45 AM).\n2. **Take10**: Headspace also offers a \"Take10\" feature, which encourages you to meditate for 10 minutes a day for 10 days. This feature can help you establish a daily habit, and you can set a reminder for the same time each day.\n\n**Calm:**\n\n1. **Daily Calm Reminder**: Calm allows you to set a daily reminder to meditate at a specific time. To set a reminder:\n\t* Open the app and go to the \"Home\" tab.\n\t* Tap the \"Settings\" icon (gear icon) in the top-right corner.\n\t* Scroll down to \"Reminders\" and toggle the switch to \"On\".\n\t* Choose your preferred reminder time (in your case, 6:45 AM).\n2. **Daily Streak**: Calm also tracks your daily meditation streak, encouraging you to meditate consistently. You can set a goal for yourself to meditate at the same time each day, and the app will remind you to help you maintain your streak.\n\nBoth apps offer flexible reminder options, so you can choose a time that works best for your schedule. By setting a daily reminder, you'll receive a notification at 6:45 AM to help you stay on track and fit in your meditation session before heading to the gym and catching your bus.\n\nRemember, consistency is key to developing a meditation habit. Choose the app that resonates with you, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Just acknowledge the thought and gently get back on track!",
