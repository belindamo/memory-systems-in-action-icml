  "content": "Yes, there are several other films or media that have had a similar impact on social or political issues. One notable example is the 2006 documentary film, An Inconvenient Truth, which had a significant impact on public awareness and political debate about climate change. The film brought attention to the dangers of global warming and the urgent need for action to address it, and it helped to shape public opinion and political discourse on environmental issues.\n\nAnother example is the #MeToo movement, which was sparked by the widespread sharing of personal stories of sexual harassment and violence on social media. The movement led to a national conversation about sexual assault and harassment and helped to hold powerful individuals and institutions accountable for their actions.\n\nLastly, the Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by the unjust killing of several Black Americans, has had a significant impact on public opinion and discourse about race and policing in the United States. The movement has led to widespread protests, changes in policing policies, and increased awareness of systemic racism and inequality in American society.",
