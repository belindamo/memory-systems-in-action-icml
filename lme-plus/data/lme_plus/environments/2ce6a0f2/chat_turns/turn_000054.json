  "content": "The use of Marianne as a symbol of the French Republic does not necessarily indicate that women were truly given equal rights during the 19th century. However, it is worth noting that in some cases, the use of symbols like Marianne did contribute to the progress of women's rights. For example, during the early years of the Third Republic (1870-1940), the image of Marianne was often used in political propaganda, and many intellectuals and feminists argued that the values she embodied, such as liberty, equality, and fraternity, should be extended to women as well. In 1944, after the end of World War II, women in France were granted the right to vote for the first time, and this was partly due to the efforts of feminist activists who had relied on symbols like Marianne to make their case. So while the use of Marianne as a symbol was not sufficient to achieve gender equality, it was an important part of a larger movement toward greater gender equity and representation.",
