As for the system requirements, CD Projekt RED has released the minimum and recommended system requirements for Cyberpunk 2077. Here they are:\n\n**Minimum System Requirements:**\n\n* OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)\n* Processor: Intel Core i5-3470 or AMD FX 6300 (at least 3.4 GHz)\n* RAM: 8 GB\n* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 or AMD Radeon RX 460 (at least 2 GB VRAM)\n* Storage: 50 GB available space\n* DirectX: Version 12\n\n**Recommended System Requirements:**\n\n* OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)\n* Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 or AMD FX 8350 (at least 3.8 GHz)\n* RAM: 16 GB\n* Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 590 (at least 6 GB VRAM)\n* Storage: 50 GB available space\n* DirectX: Version 12\n\nAs for whether your PC can handle it, that depends on your system specifications. If you're unsure, you can check your PC's specs and compare them to the minimum and recommended requirements.\n\nKeep in mind that these requirements might change before the game's release, and the actual performance may vary depending on the game's optimization and your system's configuration.\n\nIf you're planning to upgrade your PC or build a new one to play Cyberpunk 2077, I recommend checking out reviews and benchmarks of the game once it's released to get a better idea of its performance on different hardware configurations.\n\nAre you planning on playing Cyberpunk 2077 on release day, or are you waiting for reviews and feedback before diving in?",
