The lifepaths and backgrounds you choose will influence your character's abilities, skills, and interactions with NPCs, so it'll be interesting to see how you approach the game.\n\nAs for the augmentations and cyberware, they'll play a significant role in shaping your playstyle and combat approach. You'll be able to upgrade and customize your character's abilities, which will allow you to tackle challenges in different ways. It's great that you're excited to experiment with different approaches!\n\nRegarding the game's DLC plans and post-launch support, CD Projekt RED has indeed announced that they'll be releasing free DLCs and updates for Cyberpunk 2077 after launch. They've also mentioned that they're planning to release a season pass, which will include additional content, such as new quests, characters, and gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe developers have stated that they'll be supporting the game with regular updates and DLCs for a long time after launch, similar to what they did with The Witcher 3. They've also promised that the game's DLCs will be more substantial than just cosmetic items or minor content additions.\n\nWhile we don't have exact details on the DLC plans yet, it's clear that CD Projekt RED is committed to supporting the game and its community post-launch. I'm sure we'll hear more about the DLC plans and season pass in the coming months.\n\nAre you planning on playing through the game solo, or do you think you might try out the game's multiplayer features?",
