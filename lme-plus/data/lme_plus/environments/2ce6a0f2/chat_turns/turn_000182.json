Unfortunately, as a large language model, I don't have the ability to track down specific individuals or their schedules. Jamie might not even have an online presence or a way to publicly advertise his performances.\n\nHowever, you could try a few things to see if you can find out if Jamie is performing in the city center this weekend:\n\n1. **Ask around**: When you're in the city center, ask other street performers, vendors, or locals if they know Jamie or have seen him performing recently. They might have some information about his schedule or whereabouts.\n2. **Check local busking communities**: Look for online forums, social media groups, or websites dedicated to busking or street performing in your city. You might find a thread or post about Jamie or other performers who know him.\n3. **Keep an eye out for flyers or posters**: Sometimes, street performers will post flyers or posters in the area where they'll be performing. Keep an eye out for any advertisements or promotions that might feature Jamie's name or a juggler with a similar description.\n4. **Visit the city center early**: If you arrive at the city center early, you might be able to catch Jamie setting up or preparing for a performance. You could try approaching him and asking if he's performing that day.\n\nRemember to respect Jamie's time and space if you do happen to find him. He might be busy preparing for a show or taking a break, so be considerate of his schedule.\n\nFingers crossed that you'll be able to catch Jamie's performance again!",
