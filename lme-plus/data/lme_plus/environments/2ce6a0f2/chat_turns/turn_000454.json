  "content": "I think I'll want to experiment with different roles and playstyles, at least initially. I've seen the different lifepaths and backgrounds that you can choose from, and I'm intrigued by the idea of playing as a Street Kid or a Nomad. I've also seen some of the augmentations and cyberware that you can equip, and I'm curious to see how those will affect gameplay.\n\nI've been playing a lot of RPGs lately, and I think I'll want to try out different approaches to combat and exploration. Maybe I'll start with a more stealthy approach and then switch to a more aggressive playstyle later on. The game's flexibility and customization options are really appealing to me, and I'm excited to dive in and experiment.\n\nBy the way, have you heard anything about the game's DLC plans or post-launch support? I've seen some rumors about a season pass or additional content coming after launch, but I'm not sure what to believe.",
