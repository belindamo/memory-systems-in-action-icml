Upgrading your graphics card might be a good idea, especially if you want to experience the game in all its glory.\n\nAs for the game's focus, CD Projekt RED is known for their strong narrative-driven games, and Cyberpunk 2077 is no exception. The game will have a deep, immersive storyline with complex characters, branching narratives, and player choice and consequence. The developers have mentioned that the game will have a strong focus on storytelling, character development, and player agency.\n\nThat being said, Cyberpunk 2077 is also an action-RPG, and combat will play a significant role in the game. The game will feature a variety of weapons, abilities, and augmentations that will allow you to customize your playstyle and approach to combat. The game's combat mechanics are designed to be fluid and responsive, with an emphasis on strategy and player choice.\n\nFrom what we've seen in the gameplay demos and developer diaries, the game seems to strike a good balance between storytelling, exploration, and action. The game's world, Night City, is a vast, immersive environment that's full of life and activity, and the game's narrative is deeply tied to the world and its inhabitants.\n\nCD Projekt RED has mentioned that they're aiming to create a game that's similar in scope and depth to The Witcher 3, but with a more fast-paced and dynamic combat system. If you enjoyed The Witcher 3, you'll likely feel right at home in Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nAre you planning on playing the game as a specific type of character, or do you want to experiment with different roles and playstyles?",
