  "content": "I've been getting really into cooking at home lately, and I think it started about 6 weeks ago when I saw a recipe for chicken parmesan on Pinterest and decided to give it a try. Since then, I've been experimenting with new recipes and ingredients, like sumac and za'atar. Can you recommend some Middle Eastern cookbooks or online resources that I can use to learn more about the cuisine and find new recipes to try?",
