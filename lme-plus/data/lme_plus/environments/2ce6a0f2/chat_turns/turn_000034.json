  "content": "Yes, it would make sense for Francessca, Adelaide, Eugene, and Rhydderch to Platoon up with their respective amnesiac based on the evidence they've gathered and their belief that their amnesiac is their mysterious friend from the Gladiator Trials. Their urgency to protect their friend and ensure their safety is likely a strong motivator for them to make this decision without the agreement of the rest of the team.\n\nAs for their suspicion towards Tamma and Yuudai, it would be understandable for Francessca, Adelaide, Eugene, and Rhydderch to have concerns given the conflicting information about the amnesiacs. Tamma and Yuudai's insistence on keeping the search going and their refusal to acknowledge the amnesiacs as their missing friends could be seen as suspicious behavior. However, it's also possible that Tamma and Yuudai have their own motivations and reasons for not accepting the amnesiacs right away, and it could be a point of tension and conflict within the game.",
