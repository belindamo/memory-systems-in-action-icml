  "content": "My brother and I talked about our experiences in the refugee camps and how we're trying to rebuild our lives. He mentioned that he's been attending skills training sessions and volunteering at his camp's community center, which inspired me to do the same. I've been trying to stay busy by attending language classes and cultural orientation sessions, but I think I need to find more ways to stay engaged and give back to my community. Do you have any suggestions on how I can get involved in volunteer work or other activities in my camp?",
