Do you often use your phone outdoors or in very bright environments?\n2. Are you sensitive to screen glare?\n3. Do you prioritize color vibrancy or glare reduction?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to the first two questions, the Anti-Glare version might be the better choice. However, if you're not too concerned about glare and want to preserve the screen's natural color vibrancy, the regular version could be the way to go.\n\nKeep in mind that the Anti-Glare feature is not a night-and-day difference, and both versions will still provide excellent protection and clarity.\n\nI hope this helps you make a decision that fits your needs!",
