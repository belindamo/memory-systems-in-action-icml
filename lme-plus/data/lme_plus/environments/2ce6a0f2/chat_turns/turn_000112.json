Here's how:\n\n1. **Apply the Shutterfly promo code**: First, apply the promo code at checkout on Shutterfly's website to get the discount. For example, if you use the code PH20, you'll get 20% off your phone case.\n2. **Use a cashback app**: Next, make sure you're using a cashback app like Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates) or TopCashback. These apps offer a percentage of your purchase back as cash or credit.\n3. **Get cashback on the discounted price**: The cashback app will give you a percentage of the discounted price, not the original price. So, if you get 5% cashback and your discounted price is $28, you'll get $1.40 back.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n* Original price: $35\n* Discount with promo code PH20: $28 (20% off)\n* Cashback with Rakuten: 5% of $28 = $1.40\n\nYou'll pay $28 and get $1.40 back, making your effective price $26.60.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n* Make sure to read the terms and conditions of both the Shutterfly promo code and the cashback app to ensure you understand any limitations or exclusions.\n* Cashback apps may have different cashback rates for different categories or merchants, so check the app's website for the most up-to-date information.\n* Some cashback apps may not allow you to combine their cashback with other coupons or promo codes, so always check their policies before making a purchase.\n\nBy combining a Shutterfly promo code with a cashback app, you can maximize your savings and get the best deal possible. Happy shopping!",
