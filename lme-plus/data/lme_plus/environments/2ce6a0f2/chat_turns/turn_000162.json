That's a great effort.\n\nNow, let's break down the idioms and expressions you used in your message:\n\n1. **\"catch up with someone\"**: This means to talk to someone you haven't spoken to in a while, usually to learn about what's been happening in their life. It's a common expression used to describe a conversation where you update each other on your lives.\n2. **\"escape our home country\"**: This phrase is a bit more literal, but I assume you mean that you and your brother left your home country for various reasons, possibly seeking better opportunities or a fresh start.\n\nSome additional idioms and expressions that might be helpful:\n\n* **\"Break a leg!\"**: This means \"Good luck!\" and is often used to wish someone success before a performance, interview, or challenging situation.\n* **\"Cost an arm and a leg\"**: This means something is very expensive.\n* **\"Bite off more than you can chew\"**: This means to take on more responsibilities or tasks than you can handle.\n* **\"Beat around the bush\"**: This means to avoid talking directly or clearly about something, often because it's uncomfortable or difficult.\n* **\"Cut to the chase\"**: This means to get to the point or the most important part of a conversation, without wasting time on unnecessary details.\n* **\"Give someone the cold shoulder\"**: This means to deliberately ignore or show indifference to someone.\n\nI hope these idioms and expressions help you in your English language journey!
