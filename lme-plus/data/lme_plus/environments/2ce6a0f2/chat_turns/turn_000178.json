However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about a particular city center or a specific street performer named Jamie. I can provide general suggestions and ideas, but I won't be able to give you tailored recommendations or confirm the presence of a particular individual.\n\nThat being said, city centers often have a lot to offer, and you can usually find a variety of attractions and events happening on any given weekend. Here are some general suggestions:\n\n1. **Check the city's events calendar**: Look up the official website of the city or the city center's events calendar to see if there are any festivals, concerts, or street performances happening during your visit.\n2. **Popular landmarks and attractions**: Visit iconic landmarks, museums, and galleries that are often located in the city center. These can include historical buildings, monuments, or popular tourist spots.\n3. **Street performers and buskers**: City centers often have a lively atmosphere, and you might stumble upon street performers, musicians, or buskers. You might even find a juggler or two! Keep an eye out for them, and who knows, you might even meet another Jamie.\n4. **Food and drink**: City centers usually have a variety of restaurants, cafes, and food trucks serving local cuisine. Take a stroll and explore the different options to find something that suits your taste.\n5. **Shopping**: Many city centers have shopping districts or markets where you can find unique souvenirs, local products, or high-end brands.\n6. **Walking tours**: Consider taking a guided walking tour to explore the city center's history, architecture, and hidden gems.\n\nRemember to check the city's website or a mapping app like Google Maps to plan your route and get an idea of what's happening in the area during your visit.
