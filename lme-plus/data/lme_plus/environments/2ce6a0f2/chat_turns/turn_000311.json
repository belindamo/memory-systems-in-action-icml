Your yoga space and practice will evolve over time, and that's all part of the journey.\n\nIt's great that you're excited to start your morning yoga practice! Consistency is key, so try to commit to practicing at the same time every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. You'll be amazed at how it can impact your overall well-being and sleep schedule.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'll be here, cheering you on!\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself, listen to your body, and honor its limitations. Yoga is a journey, not a competition.\n\nNamaste, and happy practicing!",
