The Temple of Dendur is an absolute must-see at the Met, and it's a great way to cap off your day after exploring the Greek and Roman Galleries.\n\nThe Temple of Dendur is an ancient Egyptian temple, built around 15 BCE during the Roman occupation of Egypt. It's an incredible example of Egyptian architecture and art, and it's one of the most impressive pieces in the Met's collection. The temple was gifted to the Met by the Egyptian government in 1978 and was reconstructed in the museum's Sackler Wing.\n\nAs you approach the temple, you'll be struck by its sheer scale and the intricate carvings that adorn its walls. The temple is dedicated to the goddess Isis, and its walls are covered in hieroglyphics and scenes depicting ancient Egyptian mythology.\n\nBe sure to take your time to explore the temple's interior, where you'll find a series of chambers and shrines. The temple's architecture and decoration are truly breathtaking, and you'll get a sense of what it must have been like to worship in an ancient Egyptian temple.\n\nAfter visiting the Temple of Dendur, you might want to explore some of the other exhibits in the Sackler Wing, which features a range of art and artifacts from ancient Egypt, the Middle East, and Asia. You could also grab a bite to eat at the Petrie Court Caf\u00e9, which is located near the temple and offers stunning views of Central Park.\n\nIf you have time, you might also want to explore some of the Met's other exhibits, such as the American Wing, the European Wing, or the Modern and Contemporary Art galleries.
