  "content": "Shutterfly often runs promotions and discounts, and I've checked their website for you.\n\nRight now, Shutterfly has a few deals that can help you stay within your budget of $30-$40:\n\n1. **20% Off All Phone Cases**: Use promo code PH20 at checkout to get 20% off all phone cases, including the iPhone 12 cases. This brings the price of a slim case down to around $24-$28.\n2. **Buy One Get One 50% Off**: Use promo code BOGO50 at checkout to buy one phone case and get a second one of equal or lesser value at 50% off. This can be a great deal if you want to get a case for yourself or as a gift for someone else.\n3. **Free Shipping**: Shutterfly often offers free shipping on orders over $39. If you're close to the $40 budget, you might be able to get free shipping on your order.\n\nKeep in mind that these promotions are subject to change, and new deals might become available. I recommend checking Shutterfly's website regularly for the latest offers.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try using cashback apps like Rakuten (formerly known as Ebates) or TopCashback, which often offer a percentage of your purchase back as cash or credit.\n\nBy combining these deals, you should be able to find a customized iPhone 12 case within your budget of $30-$40.",
