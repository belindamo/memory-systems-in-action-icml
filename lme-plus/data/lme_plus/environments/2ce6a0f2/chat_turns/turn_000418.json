I've been trying to replace my Instagram usage during lunch breaks with reading or taking a short walk outside, and it's been working pretty well so far. I also like the idea of scheduling social media checks and making a plan for my 30 minutes of social media time. I'll definitely try to implement those strategies and see how it goes.\n\nOne challenge I'm still facing is dealing with the fear of missing out (FOMO) when I'm not constantly checking my social media accounts. I feel like I might miss important updates or events if I'm not constantly connected. Do you have any suggestions for dealing with FOMO? How can I overcome the feeling that I need to be constantly connected to stay informed or up-to-date?",
