Create a schedule: Make a schedule that lists all the topics you need to study before the exam. Allocate specific time periods for each topic and stick to the schedule.\n\n2. Break it down: Divide your study materials into smaller, manageable portions. Take short breaks of 5-10 minutes after each section to maintain your focus and productivity.\n\n3. Prioritize: Identify the most important topics and subjects, and focus on them first. Organize the topics in the order of importance and urgency.\n\n4. Avoid distractions: Turn off your phone and other electronic devices that might distract you. Avoid social media and other unimportant activities that may waste time.\n\n5. Get organized: Keep your study materials organized and easily accessible. Use color-coding, stickers, or any other techniques that help you stay organized.\n\n6. Take care of yourself: Make sure to take breaks, eat healthy food, exercise, and get enough sleep. Take care of your physical and mental health to boost your productivity.\n\n7. Review and revise: Review your notes and study materials regularly. Practice solving problems and answering questions to ensure you have a good understanding of the material.",
