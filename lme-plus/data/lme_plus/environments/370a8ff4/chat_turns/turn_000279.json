However, the Act does not specifically outline the requirements for a product to be considered for emergency use.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has developed guidelines for the use of emergency use products during public health emergencies. These guidelines outline the criteria that must be met in order for a product to be considered for emergency use, including the following:\n\n1. The product must be intended to address a significant and imminent health risk.\n2. The product must be safe and effective for its intended use.\n3. There must be a reasonable expectation that the product will be effective in addressing the health risk.\n4. The benefits of using the product must outweigh the risks.\n5. The product must be of good quality and appropriate for the intended use.\n6. The product must be available in a form that is suitable for the intended use.\n7.
