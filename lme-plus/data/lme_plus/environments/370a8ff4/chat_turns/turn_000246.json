  "content": "In the previous prompts, we learned about how speech signals can be represented using spectro-temporal features in the Mel-scale, which is inspired by human speech perception and auditory processing. The spectro-temporal representation of speech is a sequence of spectral vectors extracted from short speech segments using the Fourier transform. Each spectral vector represents the frequency characteristics of the speech sound in a small time window.\n\nTo extract Mel-scale features from a speech signal, we can use the `librosa` library in Python. The `extract_melspectrogram` function takes as input a speech signal, the sampling rate, and the number of Mel coefficients, and returns a Mel-scaled representation of the signal as a numpy array. The shape of the array represents the number of frequency bands and the number of spectral vectors in the representation. We can visualize the Mel-scaled spectrogram using `librosa.display.specshow` function in Python.",
