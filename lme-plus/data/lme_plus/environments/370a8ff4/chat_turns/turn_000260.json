  "content": "Yes, the authorities at the Shrine are also using robots to assist with the management and maintenance of the site. These robots perform a range of tasks, including cleaning, transportation of goods, and providing assistance to visitors.\n\nOne example of a robot being used at the Shrine is a humanoid robot developed by a Korean company. The robot can interact with visitors in multiple languages and provide them with information and assistance. The robot is equipped with facial recognition technology, which helps it to identify visitors and tailor its assistance accordingly.\n\nAnother robot being used at the Shrine is a cleaning robot developed by a Chinese company. The robot uses advanced sensors to detect and clean the dirt on the floors and other surfaces. The robot can operate autonomously and cover large areas of the Shrine, reducing the need for manual cleaning.\n\nMoreover, the authorities are also using autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) for transportation tasks around the Shrine area. The AGVs are programmed to move between different locations automatically, carrying goods and supplies.\n\nOverall, the use of robots and AGVs contributes to the efficient management and maintenance of the Shrine. These technologies reduce the need for manual labor and allow the authorities to focus on more critical tasks.",
