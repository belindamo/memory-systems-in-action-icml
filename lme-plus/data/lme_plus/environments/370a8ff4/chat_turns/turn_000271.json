  "content": "In the context of the Interpretation Act, \"the state of being immune\" refers to the body's ability to resist infection or disease. When a person is immune to a specific disease, their body has developed the necessary defenses to protect against future infections with that disease.\n\nThere are several ways in which the body can become immune to a disease:\n\n1. Natural infection: When the body is exposed to a disease-causing microorganism, it mounts an immune response to fight the infection. If the body is successful in eliminating the infection, it may develop immunity to that disease.\n2. Vaccination: Vaccines work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a virus or bacteria to the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the infection. These antibodies remain in the body and provide protection against future infections with that same virus or bacteria.\n3. Passive immunity: Passive immunity occurs when antibodies produced by another individual or organism are transferred to the body. This can be achieved through the use of certain types of vaccines or through the transfer of antibodies from a mother to her child during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Passive immunity is usually temporary and may not provide long-term protection against disease.\n\nOverall, the state of being immune refers to the body's ability to protect itself against infection or disease through the development of immunity.",
