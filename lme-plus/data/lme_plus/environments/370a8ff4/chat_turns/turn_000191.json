In this case, you might be able to skip the walking part and go straight to jogging with short intervals.\n\nHowever, I would still recommend starting with a short walk (10-15 minutes) as a warm-up before introducing jogging intervals. This will help:\n\n1. **Get your heart rate up gradually**: Gardening may not be as intense as jogging, so a short walk will help your heart rate adjust to the increased demands of jogging.\n2. **Loosen up your muscles**: Gardening can be physically demanding, but it may not engage your running muscles in the same way. A short walk will help loosen up your legs, hips, and ankles, reducing the risk of muscle strains or pulls.\n3. **Get your breathing and rhythm back**: Jogging has a distinct rhythm and breathing pattern. A short walk will help you get back into the rhythm and prepare your breathing for the increased intensity of jogging.\n\nAfter your warm-up walk, you can introduce short jogging intervals (1-2 minutes) followed by walking breaks (2-3 minutes). As you progress, you can gradually increase the duration and frequency of your jogging intervals.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Start with a slow pace and focus on your form and breathing.\n* Pay attention to your body and stop if you experience any discomfort or pain.\n* Gradually increase your intensity and duration over time.\n\nBy starting with a short walk and introducing jogging intervals, you'll be able to ease back into jogging while minimizing the risk of injury or burnout. Happy jogging!",
