  "content": "In the data exploration section, the metadata for the speech dataset is loaded into a pandas dataframe to explore some basic properties of the dataset, such as the number of speakers and speech segments. A caution is also given against the use of external data for the project's main tasks.\n\nNext, we examine the speech waveform, which is a continuous time-varying signal representing the acoustic realization of speech. Each speech segment in the dataset is represented by a digital audio file, which can be read into memory as a waveform. We load a file into memory, extract the waveform, and play it back to hear what it sounds like. The waveform is also plotted as a function of time, which provides a visual representation of the signal's amplitude over time.\n\nLastly, we note the sampling rate used in the dataset, which is the number of samples of the waveform per second. This is an important parameter, as it determines the maximum frequency that can be represented in the signal and also affects the overall quality and fidelity of the recording. In this case, the sampling rate is 8000 Hz, which means that there are 8000 samples per second in the waveform.",
