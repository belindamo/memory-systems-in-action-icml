  "content": "The Dr. Jart+ Dermaclar Clearing Solution Set is a great choice, but it's understandable to want to ensure you're getting enough moisture, especially if you have dry or combination skin. Here are some moisturizer recommendations that you can use in addition to the set to provide extra hydration:\n\n**Moisturizers that complement the Dr. Jart+ set:**\n\n1. **Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream** ($15): A rich, non-comedogenic moisturizer that provides long-lasting hydration and won't clog pores. It's fragrance-free, making it suitable for sensitive skin.\n2. **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel** ($17): A lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that provides intense hydration without feeling greasy. It's perfect for combination skin or those who prefer a lightweight moisturizer.\n3. **Laneige Water Bank Moisturizing Cream** ($35): A rich, luxurious cream that provides 24-hour hydration and helps repair the skin's natural barrier. It's suitable for dry to combination skin.\n4. **Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream** ($38): A rich, non-greasy moisturizer that provides 24-hour hydration and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It's suitable for dry to combination skin.\n\n**Tips for using an additional moisturizer with the Dr. Jart+ set:**\n\n1. **Use the Dr. Jart+ moisturizer as a day cream:** Apply the Dr. Jart+ Dermaclar Clearing Solution Moisturizer in the morning, and then use an additional moisturizer at night for extra hydration.\n2. **Layer your moisturizers:** Apply a lightweight moisturizer (like Neutrogena Hydro Boost) in the morning, followed by the Dr. Jart+ moisturizer. At night, apply a richer moisturizer (like Cetaphil or Laneige) to lock in hydration.\n3. **Mix and match:** Experiment with different moisturizers to find the combination that works best for your skin. You might prefer a lightweight moisturizer during the day and a richer moisturizer at night.\n\nRemember, everyone's skin is different, so it's essential to patch test any new moisturizer to ensure you don't have any adverse reactions.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
