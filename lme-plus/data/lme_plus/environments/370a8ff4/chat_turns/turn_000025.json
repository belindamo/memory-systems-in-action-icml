Add some upbeat background music and captions to make it engaging.\n2. **Intro-style video**: Record a short, energetic intro that sets the tone for your stream. This could be a 10-15 second clip that showcases your personality, style, and the type of content you'll be sharing.\n3. **Sneak peek**: Give your audience a sneak peek into your stream by recording a short segment that showcases one of your favorite products or services.
