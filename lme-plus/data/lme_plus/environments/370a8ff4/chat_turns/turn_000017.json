  "content": "I'd be happy to help you brainstorm some ideas for your next stream.\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your audience and what they typically enjoy? For example:\n\n* What type of content do you usually stream (gaming, art, music, etc.)?\n* What's the general tone of your streams (serious, funny, educational, etc.)?\n* Are there any specific topics or themes that your audience has shown interest in or responded well to in the past?\n* Are there any current events, trends, or holidays that you could tie your stream into?\n\nWith a better understanding of your audience and your usual content, I can start suggesting some ideas for a new format or theme that might engage them.\n\nAlso, are you open to trying out a completely new format, or do you want to build upon something you've done before?",
