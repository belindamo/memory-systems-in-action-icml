It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to travel insurance.\n\nRegarding the Indian visa rules, yes, I'm aware of the recent changes. In April 2021, the Indian government announced several changes to the e-visa process, including:\n\n1. **Simplified application process:** The online application form has been simplified, making it easier to apply for an e-visa.\n2. **Increased validity:** E-visas are now valid for 1 year from the date of issue, instead of 6 months.\n3. **Multiple entries:** E-visas now allow for multiple entries into India, whereas previously they were only valid for a single entry.\n4. **New visa categories:** The Indian government has introduced new e-visa categories, including a \"Conference Visa\" and a \"Medical Attendant Visa\".\n5. **Biometric data:** Applicants may be required to provide biometric data, such as fingerprints, as part of the application process.\n6. **Payment gateway:** The payment gateway for e-visa applications has been upgraded, making it more secure and efficient.\n\nIt's essential to note that these changes may vary depending on your country of origin and the type of visa you're applying for. I recommend checking the official Government of India website or consulting with the Indian embassy or consulate in your country for the most up-to-date information on e-visa requirements and application procedures.\n\nRemember to apply for your e-visa well in advance of your trip to ensure you receive it in time. The Indian government typically recommends applying at least 4 days before your trip, but it's always better to apply earlier to account for any unexpected delays.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns about Indian visas or travel insurance, feel free to ask!",
