He was an experienced hiker who disappeared in the Yosemite National Park in 2004. His backpack was found on a trail, but no sign of Keith was ever found despite extensive search efforts.\"\n\nDavid pauses for a moment, taking in the scenery around him before continuing, \"There's also the case of Dennis Martin, a six-year-old boy who disappeared in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1969. He was playing hide and seek with his brother when he vanished, and despite a massive search effort, no trace of him was ever found.\"\n\nHe takes another sip of water before adding, \"Of course, there are many more cases that could be relevant, but these are just a few that come to mind. What exactly are you looking for in terms of missing persons cases?\"",
