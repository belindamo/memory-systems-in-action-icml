However, here are some ways the administration can ensure that diversity and inclusion are a priority in campus policymaking:\n\n1. Establish Policies: The administration should establish policies that promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of university life. This includes recruitment, admissions, hiring, retention, and promotion of students, faculty, and staff from diverse backgrounds.\n\n2. Conduct Trainings: The administration should conduct training for both faculty and staff on issues related to diversity and inclusion. It can also provide resources that allow the campus community to have access to information regarding different cultures, identities, and disabilities.\n\n3. Foster a Safe Environment: An environment where everyone feels safe and respected is essential. The administration must ensure that policies are in place that protect all students, faculty, and staff from harassment, intimidation, or discrimination.\n\n4. Celebrate Diversity: The administration must encourage celebrations of different cultures and identities within the campus culture. This includes events that acknowledge and value the traditions, customs, and history of underrepresented communities.\n\n5. Establish Diverse Committees: It is essential to have diverse committees that represent different groups, cultures, and identities. This ensures that the voices of all individuals are heard in the creation of university policies. \n\n6. Seek Feedback: The administration must seek feedback from underrepresented communities to understand their unique experiences and perspectives better. This helps in creating policies that are inclusive, equitable, and accessible to all. \n\n7. Monitor Campus Climate: The administration should regularly monitor the campus climate, collect data, and analyze it to identify areas of improvement. This ensures that policymakers are well-informed and can make sound decisions that take into account the needs of everyone.",
