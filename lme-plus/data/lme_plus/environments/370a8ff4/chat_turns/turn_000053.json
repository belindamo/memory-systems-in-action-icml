They consider expenses such as taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and utilities that affect operating costs.\n\n4. ROI: The rental rate must ensure that the property owner gets a return on investment that meets or exceeds their expectations. Property management companies consider the owner's ROI goals and set the rental rate accordingly.\n\n5. Tenant Demand: Lastly, demand for rental properties in the area determines the rental rate.
