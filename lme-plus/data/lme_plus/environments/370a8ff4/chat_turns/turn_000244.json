  "content": "This code extracts the Mel-scaled spectrogram of a speech signal using the `extract_melspectrogram` function and then plots the spectrogram using `librosa.display.specshow`.\n\nThe extracted spectrogram has a shape of (13, 43), where 13 is the number of frequency bands and 43 is the number of time-steps. The number of frequency bands is a hyperparameter, which can be adjusted depending on the requirements of the application.\n\nThe `librosa.display.specshow` function is used to display the spectrogram. It takes the spectrogram as input along with the sampling rate (`sr`), the x-axis label (`x_axis`), the y-axis label (`y_axis`), the colormap (`cmap`), the maximum frequency (`fmax`), and the hop length (`hop_length`). The function returns an image object, which can be used to adjust the appearance of the spectrogram using `ax` methods.\n\nThe `fig` and `ax` objects are used to set the size of the figure and the title of the plot. The `ax.label_outer()` method is used to remove the y-axis label for better visualization.",
