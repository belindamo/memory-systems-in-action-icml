  "content": "Yes, there are several ways to save money on onboard expenses during a cruise. Here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. Bring your drinks: Cruise lines often charge a premium for drinks onboard, so bringing your own drinks onboard can save you a considerable amount of money. Check with your cruise line to find out their policies on bringing drinks onboard.\n\n2. Set a budget before sailing: Before sailing, decide how much you are willing to spend each day and stick to that budget. This will help you avoid overspending on souvenirs or other purchases.\n\n3. Avoid booking expensive excursions: Instead of booking expensive excursions, consider exploring the port on your own or taking a cheaper, self-guided tour.\n\n4. Book packages: Many cruise lines offer package deals that bundle multiple onboard services (such as drinks, internet, or dining) at a lower rate than if you buy them separately.\n\n5. Take advantage of free activities: Many onboard activities and events are included in your fare, so take advantage of what's offered. This includes shows, movies, and onboard games.\n\n6. Avoid using your phone: Roaming charges on your phone can be quite expensive while at sea, so avoid using it as much as possible. Instead, use the ship\u2019s Wi-Fi package, which often costs less than roaming charges.\n\n7. Be aware of gratuities: Many cruise lines automatically charge gratuities for staff to your onboard account. Before sailing, find out what these charges are and adjust them as necessary to fit your budget.\n\nBy following these tips, you can save money on onboard expenses and stay within your budget while enjoying your cruise.",
