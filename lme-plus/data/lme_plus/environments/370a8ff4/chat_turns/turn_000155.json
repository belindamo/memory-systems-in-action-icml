  "content": "That's great to hear! Introducing new toys and activities can help stimulate your cat's mental and physical health. Interactive toys are especially wonderful for encouraging exercise, problem-solving, and engagement. I'm sure Luna is loving the new challenges and excitement they bring!\n\nAnd yay for the new food bowl! Cats can be quite particular about their eating experiences, so it's awesome that Luna has taken to the new bowl. Sometimes, a simple change like that can make mealtime more enjoyable and even improve appetite.\n\nBy the way, have you considered making some DIY cat toys to go along with your homemade treats? There are many creative and easy-to-make options using household items, like cardboard boxes, paper bags, and yarn. It can be a fun way to engage with Luna and provide her with new stimulating activities.\n\nLet me know if you need any ideas or inspiration for DIY cat toys. I'd be happy to share some purr-fectly fun and easy projects with you!",
