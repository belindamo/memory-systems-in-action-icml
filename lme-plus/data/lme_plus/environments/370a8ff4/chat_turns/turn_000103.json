  "content": "Yes, a model like this could be used to generate odds to be used by a sportsbook when setting the lines. In fact, many sportsbooks use statistical models to set their odds, and the Poisson distribution is a commonly used model for soccer matches.\n\nTo generate odds, you would need to convert the probabilities of each final score into odds, which reflect the implied probability of each outcome occurring. One way to do this is to use the following formula:\n```makefile\nodds = 1 / probability\n```\nFor example, if the probability of a final score of 2-1 is 0.15, the odds of that outcome occurring would be:\n```makefile\nodds = 1 / 0.15 = 6.67\n```\nThis means that a bettor would need to wager $6.67 to win $1 if they bet on a final score of 2-1.\n\nIt's worth noting that the odds generated by a model like this are only as good as the assumptions underlying the model. In practice, sportsbooks use a variety of models and other factors to set their odds, and they adjust their odds based on the betting activity to minimize their risk.",
