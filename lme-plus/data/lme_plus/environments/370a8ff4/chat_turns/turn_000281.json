  "content": "The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has developed guidelines for the use of emergency use products during public health emergencies. These guidelines outline the criteria that must be met in order for a product to be considered for emergency use, including requirements related to the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the product.\n\nUnder the Food and Drugs Act, the Minister of Health has the authority to authorize the use of a drug that has not been authorized for sale in Canada in order to address a significant and imminent health risk. This provision may be used in situations where there is an urgent need for a drug that is not available in Canada, such as during a public health emergency.\n\nWhile the PHAC guidelines provide guidance on the criteria that should be considered when evaluating a product for emergency use, the Minister of Health has the discretion to approve the use of a product even if it does not meet all of the guidelines. However, the Minister would be expected to consider the safety and effectiveness of the product and to ensure that the benefits of using the product outweigh the risks.\n\nIn general, the decision to authorize the use of a product on an emergency basis would be based on a careful evaluation of all available information and would be made in the best interests of public health.",
