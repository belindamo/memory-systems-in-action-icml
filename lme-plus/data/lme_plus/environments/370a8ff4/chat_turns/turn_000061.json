  "content": "Yes, some property management companies do offer dog-walking services as an amenity for their tenants. This can be a great perk to attract tenants who have pets and work long hours. It can also help alleviate stress and responsibility for pet owners, knowing that their furry friend is getting taken care of.\n\nIf you are interested in offering dog-walking services at your property, discuss it with your property management company. They can help you assess the feasibility of this amenity, and if it is implemented, they can help identify a reliable service provider to offer this service for your tenants.\n\nIt's important to note that offering additional services such as dog-walking may come with added costs, so you'll want to weigh the potential benefits against the added expense. Nonetheless, offering unique amenities like this can set your property apart from others and help you attract and retain tenants.",
