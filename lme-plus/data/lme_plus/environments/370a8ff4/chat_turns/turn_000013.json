  "content": "Turquoise earrings sound lovely! However, I have to clarify that we didn't discuss you getting new turquoise earrings earlier. We only talked about finding a local jewelry designer for a custom silver necklace with an aquamarine stone and repairing your broken silver bracelet.\n\nIf you do have new turquoise earrings, it's perfectly fine to wear them to the wedding, as long as they match the dress code and style of the event. Turquoise is a beautiful, vibrant stone that can add a pop of color to any outfit.\n\nIf you're unsure about the dress code or want to ensure your earrings complement your overall look, you might consider the following:\n\n1. **Check the wedding invitation**: Review the invitation to see if there's a specific dress code or style mentioned.\n2. **Consider the wedding theme**: If the wedding has a specific theme, such as a rustic or bohemian theme, turquoise earrings might be a great fit.\n3. **Think about the time of day**: If the wedding is during the day, you might opt for a more subtle or understated piece. If it's an evening wedding, you could go for something more bold and eye-catching.\n4. **Match your earrings to your outfit**: Ensure your turquoise earrings complement your dress, top, or accessories. You can also consider the colors of the wedding party or the overall aesthetic of the event.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what makes you feel confident and stylish. If you love your turquoise earrings, go for it!",
