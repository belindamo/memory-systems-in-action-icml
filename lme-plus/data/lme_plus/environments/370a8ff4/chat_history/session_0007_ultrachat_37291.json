Prioritize: Rank the exams in order of importance or difficulty and allocate more time for the ones that need more attention. 2.

Use a calendar: Use a calendar or planner to keep track of your schedule and set reminders for important dates like exam dates, deadlines, and study sessions. 4. Study in chunks: Break your study sessions into small, focused periods of time. Mix up the subjects to maintain focus and prevent boredom. 5. Stay organized: Keep your notes, study materials, and study schedule organized. Use color-coding, folders, and other techniques that work for you. 6. Take breaks: Taking breaks is crucial for maintaining focus and retaining information. Take short breaks every hour or two to recharge and relax. 7. Stay focused: Stay focused by minimizing distractions, reducing noise, and turning off your phone. 8. Get help when needed: Don't hesitate to ask for help from friends, teachers, or tutors if you're struggling with certain subjects. Remember to stay calm and pace yourself. Studying for multiple exams simultaneously requires planning, commitment, and discipline. With these time-management strategies, you can make the most of your study time and feel prepared and confident going into your exams."
