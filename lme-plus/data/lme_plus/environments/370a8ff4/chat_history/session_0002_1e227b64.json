This could be a powerful way to build connections with your audience and create a sense of community.\n6. **\"Goal-Setting\" Workshop**: Host a live workshop where you help your audience set and achieve their own goals. Share your own goal-setting strategies, and provide actionable tips and advice. This could be a great way to inspire and motivate your audience.\n\nWhich of these ideas resonates with you, or do you feel like they spark some inspiration for something else?\n\nRemember, the key is to stay true to your tone and style while trying out new formats and themes.
