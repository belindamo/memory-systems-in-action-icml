Can you give me some ideas for theme and decoration ideas for a 5-year-old's birthday party? By the way, I just got her a nice gift - a Barbie doll and some art supplies, which I think she'll love. Speaking of which, I've been doing a lot of shopping lately, including buying groceries for my elderly neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, about three weeks ago. I spent around $30 on milk, eggs, and other essentials for her."
