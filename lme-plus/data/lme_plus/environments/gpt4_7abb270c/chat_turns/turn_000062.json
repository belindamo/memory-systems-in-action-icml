Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **The Natural History Museum**: While not exclusively focused on space, the Natural History Museum has a vast collection of exhibits on natural sciences, including dinosaur fossils, a giant squid, and a hands-on Investigate Centre. They also have temporary exhibitions, so be sure to check what's on during your planned visit.\n2. **The Royal Institution**: This museum is dedicated to the history of science and technology, with a focus on the work of famous scientists like Faraday and Davy. They have a variety of exhibitions, lectures, and events, so you might find something that aligns with your interests.\n3. **The Wellcome Collection**: While not strictly a science museum, the Wellcome Collection explores the intersection of science, art, and human experience. Their exhibitions often feature interactive displays and thought-provoking themes, such as the history of medicine or the science of human emotions.\n4. **The Royal Observatory, Greenwich**: If you're both interested in astronomy, the Royal Observatory is a great choice. You can visit the historic Flamsteed House, see the Shepherd Gate Clock (the first clock to show Greenwich Mean Time), and explore the interactive exhibits at the Planetarium.\n5. **The Museum of London**: This museum has a range of exhibitions on the history of London, including a section on the city's scientific and technological heritage.
