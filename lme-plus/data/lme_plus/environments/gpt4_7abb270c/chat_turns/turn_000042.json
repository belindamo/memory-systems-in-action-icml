  "content": "The Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) does not prescribe a particular format for reporting. Instead, it requires companies to report relevant non-financial information in their management reports or in a separate sustainability report. The information to be disclosed includes a description of the company's business model, policies, outcomes, risks, and impacts related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, as well as information on the diversity policy applied in relation to the company's management and supervisory bodies.\n\nHowever, the European Commission has encouraged the use of internationally recognized reporting frameworks and standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), to ensure that the information disclosed is relevant, reliable, and comparable. These frameworks provide guidance on how to report non-financial information in a structured and consistent manner, but they do not prescribe a specific format for reporting.\n\nTherefore, while there is no mandatory reporting format under the NFRD, companies are encouraged to use recognized reporting frameworks and standards to improve the quality and comparability of their non-financial reporting.",
