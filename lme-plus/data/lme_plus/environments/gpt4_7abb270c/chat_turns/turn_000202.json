Here are some game and activity ideas that'll make your niece's party a royal success:\n\n**Games and Activities:**\n\n1. **Princess Dress-up Station**: Set up a dress-up corner with princess costumes, tiaras, wands, and jewelry. Let the kids take turns dressing up and striking a pose in front of a royal backdrop.\n2. **Pin the Crown on the Princess**: A princess-themed spin on the classic \"Pin the Tail on the Donkey\" game. Create a large poster of a princess without a crown, and provide each child with a small paper crown. Blindfold each child and have them take turns trying to pin their crown on the princess's head.\n3. **Princess Treasure Hunt**: Hide small princess-themed items like plastic jewelry, tiara-shaped stickers, or small stuffed animals around the party area. Create a treasure map or clues to help the kids find the hidden treasures.\n4. **Royal Tea Party**: Set up a tea party station with tiny cups, saucers, and plates. Serve juice or tea, and offer princess-themed snacks like \"fairy cakes\" and \"magic wands\" (fruit kebabs).\n5. **Princess Story Time**: Gather the kids for a princess-themed storytelling session. You can read a favorite princess book or make up your own tale.\n6. **Princess Crafts**: Set up a craft station where kids can make their own princess-themed crafts, such as crowns, wands, or coloring pages.\n\n**Cake and Cupcake Ideas:**\n\n1. **Princess Castle Cake**: Create a vanilla or pink-frosted cake with a castle design on top. You can use fondant or buttercream to create towers, turrets, and a moat.\n2. **Crown Cupcakes**: Bake and decorate cupcakes with pink or blue frosting. Use fondant or edible decorations to create crowns on top of each cupcake.\n3. **Tiara Cake Pops**: Bake a cake, crumble it, mix with frosting, and shape into balls. Dip the balls in white chocolate and add a small tiara decoration on top.\n4. **Princess Doll Cake**: Make a cake in the shape of a princess doll, complete with fondant or buttercream details like a face, dress, and crown.\n\nRemember, you can always keep it simple and order a cake or cupcakes from a bakery if you're short on time or not feeling crafty.\n\nI hope these ideas help you plan a magical Princess Party for your niece!",
