Unfortunately, I have to correct you - the golden mask of Tutankhamun is not part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection, and it's not on display in New York. The mask is actually housed at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt, where it is considered one of the country's most precious treasures.\n\nNow, let me provide you with some information about the significance of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's golden mask:\n\n**Discovery and Significance**\n\nThe golden mask of Tutankhamun was discovered in 1922 by British archaeologist Howard Carter in the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun (KV62) in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt. The mask is one of the most iconic and well-preserved artifacts from ancient Egypt, and it's considered one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century.\n\n**Symbolism and Function**\n\nThe golden mask was placed over Tutankhamun's face to protect his identity in the afterlife. It was believed that the mask would help the pharaoh to breathe, see, and speak in the afterlife. The mask is made of 11 kg (24 lbs) of solid gold and is adorned with precious stones, including lapis lazuli, carnelian, and turquoise. The mask's symbolism is multifaceted:\n\n1. **Divine Kingship**: The mask represents the pharaoh's divine right to rule and his connection to the gods.\n2. **Protection**: The mask was meant to protect Tutankhamun's identity and soul in the afterlife.\n3. **Wealth and Power**: The lavish use of gold and precious stones demonstrates the wealth and power of the Egyptian kingdom during Tutankhamun's reign.\n\n**Artistic and Cultural Significance**\n\nThe golden mask is an exquisite example of ancient Egyptian artistry and craftsmanship. Its intricate details, including the inlaid stones and the delicate modeling of the face, showcase the skill of Egyptian goldsmiths and artisans. The mask's design is also a reflection of the cultural and religious beliefs of ancient Egypt, highlighting the importance of the afterlife and the pharaoh's role in it.\n\n**Conservation and Preservation**\n\nThe golden mask is a fragile and delicate artifact, and its preservation is of utmost importance. It is displayed in a special climate-controlled case at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where it is seen by millions of visitors each year.\n\nI hope this information helps you with your essay on ancient civilizations!",
