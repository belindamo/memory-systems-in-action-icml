  "content": "I think there might be some confusion! You mentioned you booked your camping trip two months ago, but you're asking about the weather for a future trip? If you've already gone on your camping trip, then you already know the weather conditions from your experience!\n\nHowever, if you're planning another trip to Yosemite and wondering about the weather, I'd be happy to help. Since you're planning to go in late August, you can expect similar weather conditions to what I mentioned earlier: warm temperatures, dry conditions, and potential thunderstorms in the afternoon.\n\nKeep in mind that weather forecasts are always subject to change, and it's always a good idea to check the National Park Service's website or a reliable weather source for the most up-to-date information before your trip.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
