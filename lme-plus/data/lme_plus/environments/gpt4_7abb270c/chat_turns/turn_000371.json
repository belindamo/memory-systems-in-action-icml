  "content": "Whales communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, including songs, whistles, clicks, and even body language. These sounds can travel over long distances in the water and are used for a variety of purposes, including mating, hunting, and navigation.\n\nDifferent species of whales have different social structures within their pods. For example, killer whales, or orcas, live in complex family groups known as pods, which are composed of females, their offspring, and sometimes their adult male offspring. These family groups work together to hunt for food and are highly coordinated.\n\nHumpback whales, on the other hand, are known for their complex and beautiful singing, which is used primarily during the mating season. They do not form long-term social bonds and tend to be more solitary in nature.\n\nOverall, the social structures of whales are highly varied and depend on a number of factors, including species, habitat, and behavior. However, in all cases, communication plays a critical role in facilitating interactions and cooperation within and between different pods.",
