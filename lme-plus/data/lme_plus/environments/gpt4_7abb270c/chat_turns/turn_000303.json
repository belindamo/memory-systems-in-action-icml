However, I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific museums or their upcoming exhibitions and events. I'm also not aware of a Dr. Patel or a guided tour of \"The Evolution of Abstract Expressionism\" at the Modern Art Museum.\n\nBut I can suggest some general tips to help you plan your visit:\n\n1. Check the museum's website: Visit the Modern Art Museum's website to see their current and upcoming exhibitions, as well as any events or programs they may be offering.\n2. Sign up for their newsletter: Many museums offer newsletters that provide updates on new exhibitions, events, and programs.\n3. Follow them on social media: Museums often post updates and behind-the-scenes information on their social media channels.\n4. Plan ahead: Check the museum's calendar to see what's coming up during your planned visit.\n5. Consider attending a guided tour: Many museums offer guided tours that can provide valuable insights and context to the artworks on display.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful, and I'm sure you'll have a great time at the Modern Art Museum!",
