By the way, I recently attended a guided tour of the Modern Art Museum's newest installation, \"The Evolution of Abstract Expressionism\", and I was quite moved by the large-scale installation by Anselm Kiefer. Have you any information on the Modern Art Museum or any other art museums in the area that might be of interest to me or my niece?",
