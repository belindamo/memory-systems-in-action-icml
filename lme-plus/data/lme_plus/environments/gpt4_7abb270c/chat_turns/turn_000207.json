By the way, I've been thinking about my shopping list and I realized I need to pick up some more art supplies. I got my niece a nice set of art supplies as a gift, but I want to make sure I have some extras on hand for the art station at the party. Do you have any suggestions for art supplies that kids around the age of 5 usually enjoy?",
