However, it is notable that the government and regulatory bodies have taken several steps to address pollution in Sydney Harbour. For instance, they have set limits on the concentration of some pollutants in the water, introduced regulations on the discharge of certain toxic chemicals, and invested in environmental monitoring to track the quality of the water.\n\nThe government and regulatory bodies have also encouraged the adoption of sustainable fishing practices and invested in research to identify the sources of pollution and the best ways to address them.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that more could be done to reduce pollution in Sydney Harbour, like introducing stricter regulations on breeding and fertilizing agricultural practices which ultimately discharge or runoff animal feces, fertilizers, and pesticides onto nearby water sources.\n\nOverall, while the government and regulatory bodies have taken some positive steps to address pollution, it is important to note that there may be further opportunities for improvement to reduce the negative impacts on the harbor's food chain and ecosystem.",
