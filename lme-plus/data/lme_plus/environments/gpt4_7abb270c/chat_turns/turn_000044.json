  "content": "The Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) applies to large companies that are public-interest entities with more than 500 employees and that have a balance sheet total of over \u20ac20 million, or a net turnover of over \u20ac40 million. Public-interest entities are defined as companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the European Union, credit institutions, and insurance undertakings.\n\nIn addition, member states of the EU have the option to extend the scope of the NFRD to cover more companies or to require additional reporting requirements for the companies that fall under the scope of the directive.\n\nIt is worth noting that the EU is currently revising the NFRD with the aim of improving the quality, consistency, and comparability of non-financial reporting. The proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) would expand the scope of the reporting requirement to cover all large companies operating in the EU, regardless of whether they are listed or not. The CSRD is expected to be adopted in 2022 and will apply to reporting periods starting on or after January 1, 2024.",
