  "content": "Thanks for the ideas! I think I'll go with the gourmet snacks and some travel-sized toiletries. My family loves trying new foods and taking care of their skin, so those gifts should be a hit. Now that I've got my gifts sorted, I'm thinking about what to pack for my trip. Do you have any tips on how to pack lightly and efficiently, especially since I'll be visiting my family for Easter and won't need to bring a lot of clothing?",
