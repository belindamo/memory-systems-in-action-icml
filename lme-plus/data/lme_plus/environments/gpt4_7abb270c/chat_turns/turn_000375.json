  "content": "Whales have been observed communicating with other ocean creatures besides whales, although such interactions are much rarer compared to their inter-species communication. Some studies have suggested that some species of whales may communicate with dolphins, porpoises, and even seals or sea lions, mainly during shared feeding grounds, and are believed to use acoustic signals to coordinate their hunting behavior.\n\nIn addition, whales also produce sounds that can be heard by other marine animals, including fish and invertebrates. These sounds may serve to attract prey or deter predators.\n\nOverall, while communication between whales and other ocean creatures does occur, it is not yet fully understood and further research is necessary to determine the full extent of these interactions.",
