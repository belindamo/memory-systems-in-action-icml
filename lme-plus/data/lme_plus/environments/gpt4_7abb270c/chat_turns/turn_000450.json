  "content": "Sure, here are some minimum viable product (MVP) requirements for a Discord bot that listens to JIRA webhooks and determines who to mention in a Discord server based on the type of events invoked:\n\n1. The bot should be able to connect to Discord and JIRA and listen for webhook events.\n2. The bot should be able to identify which users or groups of users to mention based on the type of event it receives.\n3. The bot should be able to send a mention to the appropriate users or groups of users in the Discord server.\n4. The bot should be able to handle basic errors and issues, such as being unable to connect to Discord or JIRA or receiving an event it is not programmed to handle.\n\nThese requirements would form the core functionality of the bot and would allow it to perform its main task of mentioning the appropriate users in a Discord server based on events from JIRA. You may want to consider implementing additional features or functionality beyond these MVP requirements, depending on your specific goals for the project.",
