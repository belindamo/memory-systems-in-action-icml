I also don't have the ability to know about past events or tours that you may have attended.\n\nBut I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. Check the Modern Art Gallery's website: You can visit the gallery's official website to see their current and upcoming exhibitions, as well as any special events or programs they may be offering.\n2. Contact the gallery directly: Reach out to the gallery's customer service or information desk via phone or email to ask about their current exhibitions and any guided tours they may be offering.\n3. Follow the gallery on social media: Many art galleries have social media accounts where they post updates about their exhibitions, events, and programs. You can follow them on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter to stay up-to-date.\n\nI'm glad to hear that you enjoyed your previous guided tour focused on Abstract Expressionism! I hope you have a great time on your next visit to the Modern Art Gallery.",
