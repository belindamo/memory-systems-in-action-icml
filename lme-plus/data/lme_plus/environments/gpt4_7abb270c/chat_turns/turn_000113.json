  "content": "I think it's the combination of the characters, the stories, and the sheer absurdity of the situations that makes documentaries like \"Tiger King\" so captivating. There's something fascinating about exploring the lives of people who are often larger than life, and the wild and unpredictable nature of their stories. Additionally, I think the fact that these stories are true and not scripted makes them even more compelling.",
