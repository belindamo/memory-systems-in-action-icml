  "content": "Yes, whales do sometimes communicate with other species of whales. For example, humpback whales have been observed exchanging songs with other humpbacks in different regions, even though they may belong to different populations or subspecies. Similarly, some whales may interact with other species during feeding or migratory patterns.\n\nThe interactions between different species of whales can be complex and are not fully understood. However, it is clear that these interactions can be important for social bonding, mating, and foraging. For example, some species of whales may follow the migration of other whales in order to take advantage of food sources that are more abundant in specific regions.\n\nOverall, communication between different species of whales is just one example of the complex and fascinating social dynamics that exist within the world of cetaceans.",
