  "content": "Happy birthday to your niece! I'd be delighted to help you with theme and decoration ideas for her special day!\n\nConsidering her age, 5-year-olds often love bright colors, playful themes, and interactive activities. Here are a few theme ideas that might inspire you:\n\n1. **Princess Party**: With the Barbie doll gift, a princess theme would be a perfect fit! Decorate with fairy tale elements like crowns, wands, and a \"throne\" for the birthday girl.\n2. **Art Party**: Since you got her art supplies, an art-themed party could be a great idea. Set up various art stations with paper, paints, crayons, and markers. You could also have a \"gallery\" to showcase her creations.\n3. **Outer Space Adventure**: Blast off into the cosmos with a space-themed party! Use glow-in-the-dark decorations, starry lights, and space-themed snacks like \"galaxy cupcakes\" and \"comet\" fruit kebabs.\n4. **Fairy Garden Party**: Create a whimsical atmosphere with a fairy garden theme. Use pastel colors, flowers, and tiny furniture to create a miniature fairy world.\n\nFor decorations, consider the following ideas:\n\n* Balloons in various shapes and colors\n* Streamers in matching theme colors\n* A DIY photo booth with props like hats, wings, and wands\n* A \"Happy Birthday\" banner with your niece's name\n* A themed cake or cupcakes with matching decorations\n\nAs for the guest list, you might want to consider the following:\n\n* Close family members and friends with children around the same age as your niece\n* Keep the guest list small and manageable, around 5-10 children, to ensure everyone has a great time\n* Make sure to send out invitations well in advance to give guests ample time to RSVP\n\nI'm glad to hear you've been doing some thoughtful shopping, including helping out your elderly neighbor, Mrs. Johnson! Your kindness is truly appreciated, I'm sure.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need more ideas or have any specific questions about the party planning process. I'm here to help!",
