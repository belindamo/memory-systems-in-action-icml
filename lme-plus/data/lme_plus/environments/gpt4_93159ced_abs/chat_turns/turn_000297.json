Here are some ideas to help you stay hydrated:\n\n**1. Water Tracking Apps:**\nDownload an app like Waterlogged, Hydro Coach, or Plant Nanny that allows you to track your daily water intake. These apps can send reminders and notifications to drink water at regular intervals.\n\n**2. Alarm Reminders:**\nSet reminders on your phone to drink water at specific times of the day, such as when you wake up, at lunchtime, and before bed.\n\n**3. Sticky Notes:**\nPlace sticky notes in strategic locations where you'll see them often, like on your fridge, desk, or mirror, to remind you to drink water throughout the day.\n\n**4. Water Bottle with Measurements:**\nUse a water bottle with measurements or a hydration tracker bottle that has marked levels to help you monitor your progress and stay on track.\n\n**5. Habit-Formation:**\nMake drinking water a habit by doing it at the same time every day. For example, make it a point to drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up, before meals, or before starting work.\n\n**6. Infuse Your Water:**\nAdd slices of lemon, lime, or cucumber to your water to give it a refreshing taste and make it more enjoyable to drink.\n\n**7. Make it a Routine:**\nIncorporate drinking water into your daily routine, such as when you brush your teeth, take a break at work, or during your morning and evening routines.\n\nChoose the method that works best for you, or combine a few to stay hydrated and on track!\n\nDo you have a preferred method, or would you like me to suggest a specific app or routine?",
