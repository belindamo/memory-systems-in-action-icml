  "content": "Igneous rocks are formed when magma or lava cools and solidifies. This process involves several steps:\n\n1. Melting - Igneous rocks originate from the melting of rocks deep within the earth's crust or mantle. This may occur through processes such as heat and pressure or as a result of the introduction of volatiles like water.\n\n2. Cooling and Crystallization - As magma or lava cools, its temperature drops, and the minerals within start to crystallize. The rate of cooling determines the size of the crystals. Slow cooling allows for the formation of large, well-defined crystals, while rapid cooling results in smaller, irregularly shaped crystals.\n\n3. Solidification - Once the magma or lava has cooled sufficiently, it solidifies into a rock. This could happen underground, such as in the case of intrusive igneous rocks, or on the surface, in the case of extrusive igneous rocks.\n\n4. Weathering and Erosion - After the formation of igneous rocks, they may undergo weathering, which involves the breakdown of rocks into smaller fragments through physical, chemical, or biological processes. The fragments that result from weathering can be transported by water or wind, leading to erosion.\n\n5. Deposition - After weathering and erosion, the debris formed can be deposited in a new location where it can be compacted and turned into sedimentary rock. If the sedimentary rock is later subjected to heat and pressure, it can be metamorphosed into a metamorphic rock.",
