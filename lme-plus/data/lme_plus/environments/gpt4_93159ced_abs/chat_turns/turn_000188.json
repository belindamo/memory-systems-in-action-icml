  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data on sunrise duration in various locations. However, I can provide general information that may be useful. \n\nThe duration of sunrises can vary depending on the time of year and location. Generally speaking, the closer you are to the equator, the shorter the duration of the sunrise, and the farther away you are from the equator, the longer the duration of the sunrise. \n\nAustralia is located in the southern hemisphere, while Europe is in the northern hemisphere. Due to this, the length of daylight hours will vary depending on the season. In general, during summer in Australia (December to February), the sunrise can last around 30 minutes to an hour depending on the location. In winter (June to August), the duration of sunrise may be shorter, around 15 to 20 minutes. \n\nIn Europe, the duration of sunrise can vary depending on the latitude and season. In some Nordic countries, such as Norway or Sweden, the sun can hover over the horizon for several hours during summer (known as the Midnight Sun). In other parts of Europe, such as the United Kingdom, sunrise duration can range from 30 minutes to an hour depending on the time of year. \n\nOverall, the duration of sunrise will depend on the time of year, location, and latitude.",
