Many cities are adopting sustainable urban planning practices that seek to reduce energy consumption and increase the use of renewable energy sources. For example, some cities are mandating that new buildings meet certification standards for energy efficiency, while others are investing in public transportation infrastructure to reduce the reliance on personal cars. In addition, many cities are implementing smart city initiatives that leverage technology and data to optimize energy use and reduce waste.
