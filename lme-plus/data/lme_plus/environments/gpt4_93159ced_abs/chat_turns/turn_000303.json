Here are some advice and tips to get you started:\n\n**1. Start small:** Begin with a few meals or ingredients to prep, and gradually increase as you get more comfortable with the process.\n\n**2. Plan your meals:** Decide on the meals you want to prep for the week, and make a list of the ingredients you need. You can find inspiration online or use a meal planning app.\n\n**3. Shop smart:** Make a grocery list and stick to it. Buy ingredients in bulk if possible, and opt for fresh, seasonal produce.\n\n**4. Prep in bulk:** Cook proteins like rice, quinoa, lentils, or chicken in bulk, and use them throughout the week in different meals.\n\n**5. Portion control:** Divide your prepped meals into individual portions to make it easy to grab-and-go.\n\n**6. Label and date:** Label each container with the meal name, date, and any reheating instructions. This will help you keep track of what you have and how long it's been in the fridge.\n\n**7. Store safely:** Store your prepped meals in airtight containers and keep them in the fridge at 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below. Cooked meals can be safely stored for 3-4 days.\n\n**8. Reheat wisely:** Reheat your meals to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n\n**9. Be flexible:** Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a meal or need to adjust your plan. Life happens, and meal prep is meant to be a helpful tool, not a source of stress.\n\n**10. Have fun:** Experiment with new recipes, ingredients, and cooking techniques. Meal prep is a process, and it's okay to try new things and make mistakes.\n\nSome popular meal prep containers and tools include:\n\n* Glass or BPA-free plastic containers with lids\n* Mason jars for salads or overnight oats\n* Reusable bags for snacks or ingredients\n* Instant Pot or pressure cooker for bulk cooking\n* Meal prep bags or boxes for organization\n\nRemember, meal prep is a journey, and it's okay to start small and learn as you go.
