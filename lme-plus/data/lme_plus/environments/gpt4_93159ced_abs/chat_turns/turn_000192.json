  "content": "Yes, sure. \n\nDuring the summer solstice in Melbourne, Australia, which occurs around December 21st, the duration of sunrise may be around 30-40 minutes, depending on the exact location in Melbourne. This is due to the city's location, which is approximately 37 degrees south of the equator. \n\nOn the day of the summer solstice, the sun rises in Melbourne at around 5:54 am and sets at around 8:52 pm, resulting in approximately 14 hours of daylight. However, the actual duration of the sunrise may vary depending on factors such as weather conditions, atmospheric interference, and local topography.\n\nIt is important to note that the duration of sunrise can vary depending on the exact location within Melbourne. For example, locations closer to the coast may have slightly different timings than those situated inland. Additionally, the duration of sunrise may vary slightly from year to year due to variations in the earth's orbit and other celestial factors.",
