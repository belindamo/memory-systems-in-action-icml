  "content": "To account for the fact that maximum energy production can only grow as a result of investments in a previous period and that the maximum production of energy is always depreciating, we can modify our model by adding variables for the past and current investments in energy production, as well as the current and past maximum production of energy.\n\nLet us assume that the current maximum energy production is equal to the sum of the past maximum production, adjusted for depreciation, and the current investment in energy production. Let us also assume that the current energy production is equal to the minimum of the current maximum production and the current actual production. This means that a firm may choose to produce less energy than their maximum possible output in order to reduce costs. The depreciation rate can be a fixed parameter that determines how much of the past maximum production is lost due to depreciation each period.\n\nWe can then modify our equations for energy production, capital returns, and the production function as follows:\n\nEnergy production:\n$E\\_{f,t} = \\min{M\\_{f,t}, A\\_{f,t} L\\_{f,t}^{\\beta\\_{f}} K\\_{f,t}^{\\alpha\\_{f}}}$\n\nwhere $M\\_{f,t}$ is the current maximum energy production for sector $f$ at time $t$ and is equal to the sum of the past maximum production, adjusted for depreciation, and the current investment in energy production:\n$M\\_{f,t} = M\\_{f,t-1}(1-\\delta\\_f) + I\\_{f,t}$\n\nCapital returns:\n$r\\_{f,t} = \\frac{P\\_{f,t} E\\_{f,t}}{K\\_{f,t-1}}$\n\nwhere $K\\_{f,t-1}$ is the capital stock in sector $f$ at time $t-1$.\n\nProduction function:\n$Y\\_t = \\sum\\_f E\\_{f,t} + A\\_t L\\_t^{\\beta} K\\_t^{\\alpha}$\n\nwhere $\\sum\\_f E\\_{f,t}$ is the total energy production in the economy at time $t$.\n\nWe can also modify our investment equations to account for the fact that some of the money invested in energy production is used to negate depreciation:\n\nInvestment:\n$I\\_{f,t} = s\\_f (Y\\_{t-1} - C\\_{t-1}) - \\gamma\\_f M\\_{f,t-1}$\n\nwhere $s\\_f$ is the share of output that is invested in sector $f$, $Y\\_{t-1}$ is the output in the previous period, $C\\_{t-1}$ is the consumption in the previous period, and $\\gamma\\_f$ is the depreciation rate for sector $f$.",
