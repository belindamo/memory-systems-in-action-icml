I just pointed and shot! Maybe I'll try playing around with the camera settings next time.\n\nAnd yeah, I've played around with Google Photos' editing features, but I haven't tried the automatic video creation yet. I'll have to check that out. It sounds like a cool way to create a quick recap of my festival experience.",
