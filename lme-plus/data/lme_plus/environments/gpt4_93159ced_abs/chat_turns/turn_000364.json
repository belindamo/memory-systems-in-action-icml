This type of play mimics hunting and helps burn energy.\n2. **Interactive Toys:** Toys that require problem-solving, such as puzzle toys or treat-dispensing toys, can keep Luna engaged and active.\n3. **Tunnels and Tents:** Providing tunnels and tents can encourage Luna to run, hide, and play, burning off energy in the process.\n4. **Catnip Toys:** Many cats, including kittens, love catnip. Catnip toys or stuffed mice can encourage Luna to play and be active.\n5. **Scratching Posts:** Scratching posts can help Luna burn energy and exercise her muscles.

This can help burn energy and exercise her jaw muscles.\n4. **Window Perches:** Provide window perches or bird-watching stations to encourage Luna to observe and engage with the outdoors.\n5. **Sensory Play:** Engage Luna's senses with different textures, smells, and sounds. For example, offer her a ball of yarn or a toy with a bell inside.\n\nRemember to always supervise playtime and ensure Luna's safety.
