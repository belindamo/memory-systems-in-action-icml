Identify your values and issues you care about: Start by identifying the issues and causes that you are passionate about. Determine the goals that you would like to see happen and seek charities that support these causes\n\n2. Research: Use your search engine to seek out charities that promote issues close to you, and conduct research on them to learn more about the organization's values and mission.\n\n3. Evaluate the charity: Evaluate the charity's accountability, transparency, and accomplishments to ensure your donation will contribute to a positive impact on the world.\n\n4. Look beyond the national charities: There are many local charities that work hard to make a difference in a specific region or community. Consider using an online platform such as Just Giving to browse local charities and donate to them.\n\n5. Consider contributing to charities that address the cause from multiple angles: Some charities target an issue by approaching it from various angles, including education, therapy, and other means. These types of organizations provide a more holistic approach to addressing the issue\n\n6. Donate your time: You can also support charities by donating your time instead of money. Join their volunteer program and help them in their mission.\n\nRemember to choose charities that align with your causes, check the charity\u2019s effectiveness, and really make sure the charity embodies what you care about.",
