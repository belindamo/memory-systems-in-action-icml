However, since you're now shifting your focus to jogging, it's essential to incorporate lower body exercises to support your new goal.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Injury Prevention**: Strengthening your lower body muscles, such as your legs, glutes, and core, will help prevent injuries common in jogging, like shin splints, runner's knee, and IT band syndrome.\n2. **Improved Running Efficiency**: Building strength in your lower body will help you run more efficiently, reducing your risk of fatigue and improving your overall performance.\n3. **Better Propulsion**: Stronger legs and glutes will enable you to propel yourself forward more effectively, making jogging feel less strenuous.\n\nI recommend incorporating lower body exercises into your weightlifting routine, 2-3 times a week. You can continue to do upper body exercises, but reduce the frequency to 1-2 times a week. Here are some essential lower body exercises to focus on:\n\n1. **Squats**: Works your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core.\n2. **Lunges**: Targets quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core.\n3. **Deadlifts**: Engages glutes, hamstrings, quads, and core.\n4. **Calf Raises**: Strengthens calf muscles, essential for ankle stability during jogging.\n5. **Leg Press**: Works multiple leg muscles, including quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.\n\nYou can start with lighter weights and higher reps (12-15) to focus on endurance and muscle tone. As you get stronger, you can increase the weight and lower the reps.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Warm up before your weightlifting sessions with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and stretching.\n* Focus on proper form and technique to avoid injuries.\n* Cool down with 5-10 minutes of stretching after your workout.\n\nBy incorporating lower body exercises into your routine, you'll be better equipped to support your jogging goals and reduce your risk of injury. Keep in mind that it's essential to listen to your body and adjust your routine as needed.\n\nHow do you feel about incorporating lower body exercises into your weightlifting routine?",
