  "content": "Yes, sure! Some Nordic countries like Norway, Sweden and Finland experience the Midnight Sun phenomenon during the summer solstice due to their geographic location near the Arctic Circle. \n\nDuring the summer solstice, the Earth's northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, which means that the northern regions receive more direct sunlight than the southern regions. The Arctic Circle is an imaginary line of latitude approximately 66\u00b033' north of the equator, and any location above this line experiences at least one day of the year when the sun does not set below the horizon (known as the Polar Day or Midnight Sun). \n\nAt locations close to the Arctic Circle, the sun's path appears very different from other parts of the world. Around the time of the summer solstice, the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours, which means that it never sets and there is continuous daylight. This phenomenon occurs because the Earth's axis is tilted towards the sun, and the Arctic Circle is inclined towards the sun at this time of the year.\n\nThe duration of the Midnight Sun varies depending on the location. The further north you go, the longer the duration of the Midnight Sun. For example, in Troms\u00f8, Norway, which is located approximately 350 km north of the Arctic Circle, the Midnight Sun is visible from around May 20 to July 22. \n\nIn summary, the Midnight Sun phenomenon occurs when the sun does not set below the horizon during the summer solstice in regions located above the Arctic Circle (66.33\u00b0 N), resulting in continuous daylight.",
