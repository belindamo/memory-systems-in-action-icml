  "content": "It's possible that some fans might not fully consider the risks that fighters take when they watch a fight. Fans may be more focused on the excitement and spectacle of the sport, rather than the potential dangers that fighters are exposed to. However, the UFC and other combat sports organizations have made efforts to educate fans on the risks associated with combat sports and promote fighter safety. \n\nFor example, the UFC has implemented a number of initiatives to increase awareness around fighter health and safety, including concussion protocols, injury tracking, and medical research partnerships. The UFC has also taken steps to regulate weight-cutting practices to help prevent fighters from putting themselves at risk. \n\nOverall, while it's possible that some fans may overlook the risks associated with combat sports, it is the responsibility of the organizations promoting the sport to prioritize fighter safety and ensure that fans are aware of the potential dangers involved.",
