  "content": "The growing trend of urbanization is expected to increase the energy demands of cities. As more people migrate to urban areas, the demand for transportation, heating, cooling, lighting, and other energy-consuming activities will increase. Urban areas also tend to have higher energy consumption per capita than rural areas, due to the concentration of buildings and infrastructure. Due to this, urbanization is expected to lead to a rise in energy consumption, which could increase greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change. However, there is an opportunity to mitigate these impacts through measures such as energy-efficient buildings, renewable energy, and improvements in public transportation.",
