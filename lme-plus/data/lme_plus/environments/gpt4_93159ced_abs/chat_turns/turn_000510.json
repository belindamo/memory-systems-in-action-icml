Increase Corner Inspections: The UFC could increase the number of corner inspections during fights to ensure that fighters are not exhibiting signs of trauma or concussion.\n\n3. Encourage Safer Training: The UFC could encourage fighters to engage in safer training practices, such as using protective headgear and limiting the intensity of sparring sessions.\n\n4. Expand Medical Staff: The UFC could expand its medical staff and provide additional medical resources for fighters, such as on-site MRI machines or access to specialists in sports medicine or concussion management.\n\n5. Use Technology: The UFC could explore the use of technology such as concussion-sensing mouthguards, that alert medical personnel if a fighter exhibits signs of head trauma during a fight.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and the UFC could continue to explore new and innovative ways to enhance fighter safety and minimize the risk of injury.",
