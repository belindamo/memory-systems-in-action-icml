  "content": "I was wondering how you managed to incorporate turmeric into the yarn itself.\n\nUsing turmeric as a natural dye is a great way to create a unique and sustainable color. Turmeric contains a pigment called curcumin, which is responsible for its vibrant yellow color. When used as a natural dye, it can produce a range of shades from soft yellow to deep golden brown, depending on the mordant used and the duration of the dyeing process.\n\nI'm fascinated by natural dyeing, and I'm sure your hand-dyed yarn is truly special. The fact that you've taken the time to create a unique color using a natural process adds an extra layer of meaning and significance to your knitting project.\n\nNow that I understand the context, I'm even more excited to see how your Feather and Fan shawl turns out! The turmeric-dyed yarn will undoubtedly add a warm, sunny touch to the lace pattern.",
