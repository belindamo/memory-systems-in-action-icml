  "content": "Other combat sports such as boxing, kickboxing and Muay Thai also take several measures to ensure the safety of their athletes, including:\n\n1. Medical Screenings: Similar to the UFC, pre-fight medical screenings are required in these sports to identify any pre-existing conditions that could put the fighter at risk.\n\n2. Weight Monitoring: These sports also have strict weight-cutting regulations to prevent fighters from losing too much weight too quickly, which can be detrimental to their health.\n\n3. Referees and Judges: Referees and judges are responsible for enforcing the rules during fights and ensuring the safety of the fighters, and they have the authority to stop the fight if they believe a fighter is in danger.\n\n4. Protective Equipment: Fighters in these sports are required to wear protective equipment such as headgear and gloves to reduce the risk of injury.\n\n5. Guidelines for Fighting Style: Some of these sports also have specific guidelines for fighting style and techniques that can be used, which can help reduce the risk of injury.\n\nThe UFC can learn from the safety measures implemented by other combat sports and continuously improve their own safety protocols. Some of the measures implemented by other sports may be applicable to the UFC, and the UFC can also share its own best practices to enhance fighter safety across the combat sports industry.",
