  "content": "In Unix-like systems, commands can be customized with options and arguments to modify their behavior or specify the files or directories they should operate on. Here's how to use options and arguments with commands:\n\n1. Options: Options are used to modify the behavior of a command. They are usually specified using a dash (-) followed by a letter or a word. For example, the `ls` command can be used with the `-l` option to display detailed information about files and directories:\n```bash\nls -l\n```\nIn this example, the `-l` option is used to display file permissions, ownership, size, and modification time.\n2. Arguments: Arguments are used to specify the files or directories that a command should operate on. They are usually specified after the command and options. For example, the `ls` command can be used with an argument to display the contents of a specific directory:\n```bash\nls /path/to/directory\n```\nIn this example, `/path/to/directory` is the argument that specifies the directory whose contents should be listed.\n\nSome commands allow multiple arguments to be specified. For example, the `cp` command is used to copy files and directories, and it can be used with two arguments: the source file or directory, and the destination file or directory:\n```bash\ncp /path/to/source /path/to/destination\n```\nIn this example, `/path/to/source` is the source file or directory, and `/path/to/destination` is the destination file or directory.\n\nKeep in mind that not all commands support options and arguments, and the options and arguments that are available can vary between commands. To see the available options and arguments for a command, you can usually consult the command's manual page using the `man` command.",
