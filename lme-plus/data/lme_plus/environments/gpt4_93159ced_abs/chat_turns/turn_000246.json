I'd be happy to help you optimize your trip.\n\n**General Guidelines:**\n\nIn North America, the spring migration typically peaks in late April and early May, with the exact timing varying depending on your location and the specific species. Warblers and thrushes tend to migrate at slightly different times, but there's some overlap.\n\n**Warblers:**\n\n* Peak warbler migration usually occurs from late April to early May, with the highest diversity of species seen during this period.\n* The first wave of warblers, including species like Yellow-rumped, Palm, and Pine Warblers, typically arrives in mid-to-late April.\n* The second wave, featuring species like Black-and-white, American Goldfinch, and Common Yellowthroat, arrives around late April to early May.\n* Look for warblers in areas with dense foliage, such as woodlands, shrublands, and edge habitats, particularly during the morning and late afternoon when they're most active.\n\n**Thrushes:**\n\n* Thrushes tend to migrate a bit later than warblers, with the peak migration period usually occurring in early to mid-May.\n* Species like the American Robin, Veery, and Swainson's Thrush are among the first to arrive, often in late April.\n* The more secretive thrushes, like the Wood Thrush and Hermit Thrush, typically arrive in early May.\n* Thrushes often prefer more mature forests with dense understory and leaf litter, where they forage for food on or near the ground.\n\n**Tips for Your Trip:**\n\n1. **Timing:** Plan your trip during the peak migration periods mentioned above to increase your chances of spotting a variety of warblers and thrushes.\n2. **Weather:** A gentle, overcast day with a light breeze can be ideal for spotting warblers and thrushes, as they're more likely to be active and vocal.\n3. **Habitat:** Focus on areas with diverse habitats, such as woodlands, shrublands, and edge habitats, to increase your chances of spotting both warblers and thrushes.\n4. **Listen:** Pay attention to bird calls and songs, as many warblers and thrushes are more easily heard than seen. Familiarize yourself with their vocalizations to help you locate them.\n5. **Be Patient:** Migration patterns can be unpredictable, and some days may be slower than others. Be prepared to spend time observing and waiting for birds to appear.\n\n**State Park Specifics:**\n\nSince you didn't mention a specific state park, I couldn't provide more detailed information. However, I recommend checking with the park's website, contacting the park's naturalist or visitor center, or consulting with local birding groups to get more information on:\n\n* The park's habitat diversity and warbler/thrush hotspots\n* Any guided birding tours or events during your planned visit\n* Recent bird sightings and migration reports\n\nBy following these guidelines and tips, you should have a great time spotting warblers and thrushes during your spring migration trip to the state park!",
