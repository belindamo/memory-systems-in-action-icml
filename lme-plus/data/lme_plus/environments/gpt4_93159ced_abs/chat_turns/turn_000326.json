That's a great achievement!\n\nTo help you maintain this habit using Todoist, here are some ideas:\n\n1. **Create a \"Wake-up\" task**: Create a recurring task in Todoist called \"Wake-up\" or \"Morning Routine\" and set it to occur every Monday to Friday at 6:30 AM. This will serve as a reminder to wake up and start your day.\n2. **Set a habit tracker**: Todoist has a feature called \"Habit Trackers\" that allows you to track your progress on a specific task or habit. Create a habit tracker for your wake-up time and set the goal to wake up at 6:30 AM, Monday to Friday. This will help you visualize your progress and stay motivated.\n3. **Use the \"Daily Goals\" feature**: Todoist's Daily Goals feature allows you to set a specific goal for each day. Set a daily goal to wake up at 6:30 AM, and Todoist will remind you to complete it.\n4. **Create a \"Pre-Wake-up\" task**: Create a task called \"Pre-Wake-up\" or \"Bedtime Routine\" and schedule it for the night before (e.g., 10:00 PM). This task can serve as a reminder to wind down, prepare for bed, and get ready for the next day.\n5. **Integrate with your calendar**: Make sure to integrate your Todoist tasks with your calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) so you can see your tasks and habits alongside your other commitments.\n6. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your progress in Todoist and adjust your habits as needed. If you miss a day or two, don't get discouraged. Instead, identify the reasons why and make adjustments to your routine.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you'll be able to:\n\n* Stay consistent with your wake-up time\n* Build a strong morning routine\n* Track your progress and stay motivated\n* Make adjustments to your routine as needed\n\nRemember, the key is to be consistent and make small adjustments as you go along. Good luck, and I hope Todoist helps you maintain your wake-up habit!",
