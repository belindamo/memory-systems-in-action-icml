  "content": "No, igneous rocks are not formed from any type of rock. Igneous rocks are formed from the solidification of magma or lava, which are molten materials that originate from within the Earth. However, not all types of rock can melt to form magma or lava. Two types of rocks that can be melted to produce igneous rocks are:\n\n1. Sedimentary rocks: These are rocks formed from the accumulation of sedimentary particles, such as sand, silt, and clay. With sufficient heat and pressure, these rocks can be transformed into metamorphic rocks. However, they can also be melted to form magma or lava, which can subsequently solidify into igneous rocks.\n\n2. Other igneous rocks: Igneous rocks can also be melted and re-solidified to form new igneous rocks. For example, the melting of basaltic rock can result in the formation of granite, an intrusive igneous rock.\n\nIn summary, while not all types of rock can form igneous rocks directly, they can be transformed into a form that is capable of producing igneous rocks.",
