  "content": "Both Whistler Blackcomb and Zermatt are fantastic choices for a lively atmosphere, but they have some differences that might make one more suitable for your group than the other.\n\n**Whistler Blackcomb:**\n\n* Whistler Village is a bustling hub with a wide range of restaurants, bars, and clubs.\n* The village is pedestrian-friendly, making it easy to explore and stumble upon live music, events, or impromptu parties.\n* Whistler has a strong apr\u00e8s-ski culture, with many bars and clubs staying open late into the night.\n* The resort hosts various events throughout the winter season, including concerts, festivals, and firework displays.\n* Whistler is a large resort, so you'll have plenty of opportunities to meet new people and make friends on the slopes.\n\n**Zermatt:**\n\n* Zermatt's village is smaller and more laid-back than Whistler's, but still offers a charming, lively atmosphere.\n* The resort has a more European, boutique-hotel feel, with many upscale bars and restaurants.\n* Zermatt's apr\u00e8s-ski scene is more low-key, with a focus on cozying up in a mountain hut or bar with a warm drink.\n* The resort has a strong focus on cuisine, with many high-end restaurants serving delicious Swiss and international dishes.\n* Zermatt is a bit more intimate than Whistler, with a strong sense of community among visitors and locals.\n\nConsidering you're looking for a lively atmosphere with your friends, I'd recommend Whistler Blackcomb. The village is designed to facilitate socializing, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to meet new people and party the night away. However, if you're looking for a more laid-back, sophisticated vibe with a focus on food and drinks, Zermatt might be the better fit.\n\nKeep in mind that both resorts offer an incredible skiing experience, so you can't go wrong either way!\n\nWhich one do you think you're leaning towards?",
