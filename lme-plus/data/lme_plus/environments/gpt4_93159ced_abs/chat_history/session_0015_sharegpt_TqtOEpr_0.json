User enters their information, including name, email address, and password\n3. System validates user's information and checks for existing accounts\n4. If user's information is valid and there are no existing accounts, system creates a new account and sends a confirmation email to the user\n5. User confirms their account through the confirmation email\n6. System logs user in and redirects them to the member dashboard\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to expand on any part of the diagram."
