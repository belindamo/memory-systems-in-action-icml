The movie will explore the oceans of Pandora, which will be filled with new creatures and environments, creating a whole new visual experience for audiences. Additionally, James Cameron has said that the film will push the boundaries of technology, and he has been working on developing new camera systems and motion capture technology to capture the performance of the actors underwater. So it's safe to say that Avatar 2 is going to be a visual feast for moviegoers!"
