Speaking of instructors, my salsa instructor Maria is great, and she breaks down the steps really well. I was a bit nervous at first because I'd never taken a dance class before, but she made me feel comfortable."

      "content": "That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you've found an instructor like Maria who makes you feel comfortable and helps you learn effectively. Having a good instructor can make all the difference in your learning experience, especially when you're new to dance.\n\nBreaking down steps is an essential skill for any dance instructor, and it's fantastic that Maria is able to do so in a way that works for you. It's also excellent that she's helped you feel comfortable and confident, which is crucial for learning and enjoying the dance.\n\nAs you prepare for the bachata festival, you might find that you'll encounter different teaching styles and approaches.

      "content": "They were actually hip hop classes, which I really enjoyed. The high-energy vibe was a lot of fun, but I'm glad I made the switch to salsa because it's more low-key and I can actually learn the steps."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hip hop classes can be a lot of fun, but they can also be high-energy and fast-paced, which can be challenging to follow if you're new to dance. Salsa is a great choice if you're looking for a more low-key and structured approach to learning dance.\n\nIt's great that you made the switch and found a style that works better for you. Salsa is a wonderful dance style that can be very rewarding to learn, and it's awesome that you're enjoying it. The fact that you can learn the steps and feel more confident in your dancing is a huge plus!\n\nWhat do you think it is about salsa that you enjoy more than hip hop? Is it the rhythm, the steps, the cultural aspect, or something else entirely?"
