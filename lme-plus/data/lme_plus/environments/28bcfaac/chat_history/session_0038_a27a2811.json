However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or real-time knowledge of specific locations or weather conditions. I can provide general information and suggestions, but I won't be able to recommend trails in a specific area without more context.\n\nTo get started, could you please provide me with more information about the mountains you're planning to visit? Here are some questions to help me narrow down some options:\n\n1. Which mountain range or region are you planning to visit?\n2. What is your preferred level of difficulty for hiking trails? Are you looking for easy, moderate, or challenging trails?\n3. How long would you like your hikes to be? Are you looking for short day hikes or longer, multi-day treks?\n4. Are there any specific features you're looking for in a trail, such as scenic views, waterfalls, or wildlife viewing opportunities?\n\nOnce I have more information, I'd be happy to provide you with some general recommendations and resources to help you plan your trip.\n\nAs for the weather, I'm glad you're enjoying the start of summer! However, I don't have real-time knowledge of weather conditions, so I can't comment on the current weather or how it compares to previous seasons."
