It is famous for its water fights and celebrations all across the city. During the festival, the streets are turned into a massive water fight, and people pour water on each other as a symbol of purification and blessings. Alongside the water fights, there are parades, street food, music, and traditional dance performances, as well as cultural and religious ceremonies. Festivities can last up to a week in some areas, and it is one of the most celebrated festivals in Thailand."
