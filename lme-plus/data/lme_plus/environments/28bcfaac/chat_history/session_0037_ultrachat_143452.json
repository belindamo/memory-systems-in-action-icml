Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2\nDirected by Quentin Tarantino, these two movies follow the story of an assassin known as \"The Bride\" (played by Uma Thurman) seeking revenge on those who wronged her. It's full of action, suspense, and empowering moments.\n\n2. Salt\nStarring Angelina Jolie, Salt is a spy thriller that follows the story of a CIA agent who goes on the run after being accused of being a Russian sleeper agent. It's a fast-paced, intense movie that showcases Jolie's talent as an action hero.\n\n3. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\nBased on the best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson, this movie follows the story of a computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara) as she helps a journalist investigate a decades-old missing-person case. It's a dark, suspenseful movie that's not for the faint of heart, but it's a great showcase of Mara's talent and a compelling story."
