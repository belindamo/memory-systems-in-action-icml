When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, \"perplexity\" and \"burstiness.\" Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the article, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. \n2. You are to write in a tone that was written 100% human. \n3. Do not repeat or rephrase any content in the article. All must be uniquely written. \n4.

This can be done due to the court\u2019s order, an agreement written in the building contract or both parties volunteering to resort to this resolution. This is more like a negotiation between both parties which all of them must agree once they come up with a resolution.\nFor this type of dispute resolution, the mediator must not decide for both parties nor take sides. Instead the mediator may suggest or even come up with facts that might not have been considered by either party. The important thing is, they must reach to an agreement and all parties must agree with that settlement. In addition, most mediators are senior or retired lawyers and judges.\n\nPlease adjust the word count to 150 words.

      "content": "Mediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) where an independent third party facilitates the negotiation between disputing parties. This can be done through a court order, a contractual agreement, or through mutual consent. Unlike litigation, where a judge or arbitrator makes the final decision, in mediation, the parties themselves decide on the outcome. The role of the mediator is to assist the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution. Mediators do not take sides, nor do they make decisions for the parties involved. They may suggest options, provide information, and help parties identify areas of agreement and disagreement. Mediation is often a faster, less expensive, and less formal process than litigation, making it suitable for resolving many types of disputes."
