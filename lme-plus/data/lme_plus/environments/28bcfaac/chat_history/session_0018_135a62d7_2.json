      "content": "It sounds like Sarah's workshop really resonated with you, and you're looking for a program that can help you continue to develop your skills in a holistic way.\n\nI've got a few suggestions for you to consider:\n\n1. **Theater schools with musical theater programs**: Many theater schools offer programs that focus on musical theater, which would cover singing, acting, and dancing. These programs might have a more comprehensive approach, teaching you how to integrate all three skills to bring a character to life. Some examples in the city might include the City Theater Academy, the Performing Arts Conservatory, or the Theater Arts Institute.\n2. **Musical theater studios**: Some studios specialize in musical theater training and offer classes or workshops that focus on the triple threat (singing, acting, and dancing). These studios might have a more focused approach, with instructors who are experienced in teaching musical theater. Examples might include the Musical Theater Studio, the Triple Threat Academy, or the Broadway Bound Studio.\n3. **Workshop series or intensives**: If you're looking for something more condensed, you might consider workshop series or intensives that focus on musical theater. These might be offered by individual instructors, studios, or schools, and could range from a few days to a few weeks. These can be a great way to get a taste of comprehensive training without committing to a longer program.\n4. **Online resources**: If you're not finding what you're looking for in-person, you might consider online resources. There are many online platforms, YouTube channels, and websites that offer musical theater training, including classes, workshops, and tutorials. Some popular options include Masterclass, Broadway Artists Alliance, or Musical Theater Online.\n\nTo get started, I'd recommend doing some research on these options and seeing which ones resonate with you. You might also consider reaching out to Sarah, the instructor from your workshop, and asking if she knows of any programs or resources that might be a good fit for you.\n\nHow do these suggestions sound? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or would you like more information on any of these options?"
