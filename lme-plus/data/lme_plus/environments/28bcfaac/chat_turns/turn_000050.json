It's great to hear that she appreciated the thought and the gift.\n\n**Including a card**:\n\nAbsolutely! Including a card with your gift is a wonderful way to add a personal touch and make it even more special. A card allows you to express your congratulations, share a heartfelt message, and make the gift feel more thoughtful and intentional.\n\nFor a baby shower gift, a card can include:\n\n* A congratulatory message to the new parents\n* A sweet comment about the baby or the blanket/onesie\n* A personal anecdote or memory about your friendship\n* A message of support and encouragement for the new parents\n\nYou can choose a card that matches the occasion, or opt for a more general \"Congratulations\" or \"New Baby\" card. Make sure to sign it with a personal message and your name.\n\n**Tips for the card**:\n\n* Keep the message brief and heartfelt. Aim for 1-2 sentences or a short paragraph.\n* Consider adding a fun or inspirational quote related to babies or parenting.\n* If you're close to the expecting mother, you could include a personal joke or inside reference to make her smile.\n\nIncluding a card will add a few dollars to your overall cost, but it's a small price to pay for the emotional value it brings to the gift.\n\nFor your $30 budget, you could consider a card in the $5-$10 range, depending on the design and quality. This will leave you with $20-$25 for the personalized blanket or onesie.\n\nHow does that sound?",
