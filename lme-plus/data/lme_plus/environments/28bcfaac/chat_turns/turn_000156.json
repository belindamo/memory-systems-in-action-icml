You are correct that Resolution 36-NQ/TW also focuses on the overseas Vietnamese community's economic potential and its ability to act as a bridge with foreign businesses and organizations.\n\nResolution 36-NQ/TW recognizes the important role of the overseas Vietnamese community in promoting economic and cultural exchange between Vietnam and other countries. The resolution calls for the development of policies and programs to engage with the overseas Vietnamese community, tap into its economic potential, and strengthen its connections with businesses and organizations in other countries.\n\nThe resolution also emphasizes the need to support and leverage the expertise and knowledge of overseas Vietnamese professionals and intellectuals, many of whom hold important positions in agencies, research and training institutions, companies, and international organizations. By building stronger relationships with these individuals and organizations, Vietnam can enhance its international competitiveness and promote sustainable economic growth.\n\nOnce again, I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous answer, and I hope this response better addresses your question about Resolution 36-NQ/TW.",
