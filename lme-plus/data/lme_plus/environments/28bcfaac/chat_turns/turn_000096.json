  "content": "Yes, A Plain Account of Christian Perfection was very well-received among Wesley's followers at the time. It became one of his most popular and influential works, and many Methodists found it to be a helpful guide for their spiritual journey. The book was widely circulated within the Methodist movement and beyond, and it continues to be studied and appreciated by Christians of many denominations today. \n\nWesley himself believed that the book had the power to transform lives and wrote in the preface, \"I hope this little book may be a means, under God, of promoting justifying, sanctifying faith among those who are seeking to know Jesus Christ, and him crucified.\"",
