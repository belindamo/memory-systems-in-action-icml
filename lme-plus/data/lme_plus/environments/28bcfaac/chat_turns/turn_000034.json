However, I have to clarify that I couldn't find any information on an RPG called \"Eternity's Edge.\" It's possible that it's a lesser-known game, a prototype, or a game that hasn't been widely released yet.\n\nIf you could provide more details about Eternity's Edge, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, and setting, I can try to suggest similar games that you might enjoy. Alternatively, you can also give me an idea of what you liked about Eternity's Edge, and I can recommend games that share similar elements.\n\nFor example, did you enjoy the:\n\n* Tactical combat mechanics?\n* Deep storytelling and character development?\n* Exploration and discovery aspects?\n* Fantasy or sci-fi setting?\n* Party-based gameplay or solo play?\n\nAny additional information you can provide will help me give you more tailored recommendations.",
