It has a great cast, including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon, and it won multiple Academy Awards.\n\nAnother movie that you might enjoy is Prisoners, starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. It's a suspenseful thriller that follows a desperate father seeking justice for his kidnapped daughter, and it has some great plot twists and intense scenes.\n\nFinally, you might also like Zodiac, directed by David Fincher.
