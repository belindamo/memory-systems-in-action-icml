She might have some valuable insights to share, especially since she's familiar with your learning style and experience.\n\nIt's also convenient that you used to take dance classes near your work. Having a studio nearby can make it easier to fit dance classes into your schedule. Did you enjoy the classes you took at that studio? Were they also salsa classes, or was it a different style of dance?",
