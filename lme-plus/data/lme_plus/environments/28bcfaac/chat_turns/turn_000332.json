Customers will appreciate the thought and feel more satisfied with their purchase.\n\nTo effectively display the information, consider the following:\n\n1. **Clear signage**: Create a clear and prominent sign that states the free gift offer, such as \"Spend $50, get a free packet of artisanal matches\" or \"Spend $75, receive a complimentary candle care guide\".\n2. **Display the free gift prominently**: Showcase the free gift near the checkout area or on a nearby shelf, so customers can see what they'll receive.\n3. **Use eye-catching graphics**: Use colorful graphics or images to draw attention to the free gift offer, making it hard to miss.\n4. **Highlight the free gift on your display**: Use a chalkboard or whiteboard to highlight the free gift offer, and make sure it's easily visible to customers.\n5. **Include the free gift in your marketing materials**: Make sure to include the free gift offer in your social media posts, flyers, and any other marketing materials to drive awareness and attract customers to your stall.\n6. **Train your staff**: Make sure your staff is aware of the free gift offer and can clearly communicate it to customers, answering any questions they may have.\n\nWhen choosing the free gift, consider the following:\n\n1. **Relevance**: Choose a gift that's relevant to your candles, such as artisanal matches or a candle care guide.\n2. **Value**: Select a gift that has a perceived value that's commensurate with the minimum spend threshold.\n3. **Uniqueness**: Choose a gift that's unique and not easily found elsewhere, making it a special treat for your customers.\n\nBy offering a free gift with purchase, you'll create a win-win situation for both you and your customers.
