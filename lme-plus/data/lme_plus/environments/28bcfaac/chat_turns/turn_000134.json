  "content": "Getting tickets to popular screenings at Sundance can be challenging, especially for buzzworthy films. Here are some tips to increase your chances of scoring tickets:\n\n**1. Create a Sundance Account and Register for the Festival**: Make sure you have a Sundance account and register for the festival as early as possible. This will give you access to the online ticketing system and allow you to participate in the eWaitlist.\n\n**2. eWaitlist**: The eWaitlist is a virtual waiting list for sold-out screenings. If a ticket becomes available, you'll be notified via email or text. Be prepared to act fast, as tickets are usually released in real-time.\n\n**3. Ticket Availability**: Check the Sundance website or mobile app regularly for ticket availability. Tickets often become available due to returns or cancellations.\n\n**4. Waitlist in Person**: If you're in Park City, you can waitlist in person at the Sundance Box Office or at the theater where the screening is taking place. Be prepared to wait in line, and dress warmly, as lines can be long and cold!\n\n**5. Consider Off-Peak Screenings**: If you're flexible, attend screenings during off-peak hours (e.g., early morning or late evening) when ticket availability might be higher.\n\n**6. Package Deals**: Sundance offers various package deals, such as the \"Explorer Pass\" or \"Ticket Package,\" which can guarantee tickets to multiple screenings, including popular ones.\n\n**7. Industry Connections**: If you have industry connections or know someone involved with the film, you might be able to score tickets through them.\n\n**8. Volunteer**: Volunteering for Sundance can provide access to tickets, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at the festival.\n\n**9. Follow Sundance on Social Media**: Keep an eye on Sundance's social media accounts, as they sometimes release tickets or offer last-minute availability notifications.\n\n**10. Be Prepared to Act Fast**: When tickets become available, be ready to act quickly. Have your account information and payment method ready to go.\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n\n* Plan ahead: Research the films and create a schedule in advance to ensure you're ready to pounce on tickets when they become available.\n* Be flexible: Be open to attending different screenings or changing your schedule if tickets become available for a popular film.\n* Consider attending press screenings: These screenings are usually less crowded, and you might have a better chance of getting tickets.\n\nRemember, getting tickets to popular screenings at Sundance can be challenging, but with persistence, flexibility, and a little luck, you might just score tickets to that buzzworthy film!",
