  "content": "Tapu is an important concept in Maori culture and has significant meaning in Maori tattooing, or ta moko. Tapu refers to the spiritual and cultural restrictions within Maori society. It is a concept that governs the behavior of individuals and the relationship between people and their environment.\n\nIn ta moko, tapu is a crucial aspect that is observed during the tattooing process. It is believed that when a person undergoes ta moko, their spirit is opened up to the spiritual realm. Therefore, it is essential that tapu is maintained at all times. The observance of tapu ensures that the person being tattooed is protected from any negative spirits or influences during the process.\n\nThe tattoo artist performing the ta moko must follow specific protocols to maintain tapu during the process. Before starting, they will often engage in a prayer, reciting karakia, to ensure that the spirits are present and the process is protected. Additionally, tattooing implements must be treated with respect, and the tattoo artist must maintain a specific demeanor throughout the process.\n\nThe observance of tapu during the ta moko process goes beyond protecting the person receiving the tattoo. It also acknowledges the continuity of the cultural tradition, and the importance of maintaining the sanctity of the practice to preserve Maori culture.",
