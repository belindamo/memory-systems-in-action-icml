  "content": "It's a new RPG that hasn't been released yet, that's why you couldn't find any info on it. At the gaming event, I got to play a demo of it and I really liked the action combat and the fantasy setting. It had a really interesting storyline too, with a lot of character customization options. Can you suggest some other RPGs with similar elements that I might enjoy?",
