Both of the options you mentioned are great choices, as they:\n\n* Congratulate the new parents on their baby\n* Express your well-wishes for their new journey\n* Are neutral and applicable to any baby shower or new parent\n\nThe beauty of a simple message is that it allows the new parents to focus on the thought and love behind the gift, rather than getting caught up in elaborate words.\n\nSome other options to consider, if you'd like:\n\n* \"Wishing you joy, love, and sleep ( eventually!) as you welcome your new baby!\"\n* \"Congratulations on your new little bundle of joy! Wishing you all the best as you start this new adventure.\"\n* \"So thrilled for you both as you embark on this exciting new chapter. Congratulations on your baby!\"\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be sincere and genuine in your message.
