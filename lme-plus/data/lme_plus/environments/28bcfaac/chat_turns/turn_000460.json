I'm a text-based AI assistant, and my knowledge is based on my training data, which may not include information about specific events or authors that are not well-known or widely published.\n\nHowever, I can suggest a few options to help you find more information about the author or the event:\n\n1. Check the library's website or social media pages: You can visit the local library's website or social media pages to see if they have a calendar of events or a blog post about the book reading event. They may have a list of past events or a description of the event that includes information about the author.\n2. Contact the library: You can reach out to the library directly and ask if they have any information about the author or the event. They may be able to provide you with more details or direct you to someone who can help.\n3. Search online: You can try searching online for information about the author or the event. You can use search engines like Google and try searching for keywords like \"Jane Smith author\", \"The Lost City book\", \"February 10th book reading event\", or \"local library author event\".\n4. Check bookstores or literary organizations: You can also try contacting local bookstores or literary organizations in your area to see if they have any information about the author or the event.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find more information about the author or the event. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
