  "content": "The Maori people of New Zealand have a rich tradition of tattooing, known as ta moko. Some of the traditional tattoo designs and techniques used by Maori tribes include:\n\n1. Spiral shapes: These represent life, growth, and eternity.\n\n2. Koru: These rounded shapes represent new life, growth, and the unfolding of a fern frond.\n\n3. Tiki: The tiki is a carving or tattoo of a human figure with prominent eyes, representing the spiritual connection between humans and the divine.\n\n4. Whakairo: This intricate, swirling design is often used to decorate weapons or carvings, and is also found in ta moko designs.\n\n5. Tapu: The tapu symbol is a series of lines that represent the restrictions of the spiritual world.\n\n6. Kowhaiwhai: This decorative pattern is often found on the rafters of meeting houses, and is used in ta moko to represent familial connections and relationships.\n\n7. Chiseling: Instead of using a needle, some traditional Maori tattoo artists use a chisel to cut designs into the skin.\n\n8. Ink rubbing: This technique involves rubbing ink into cuts made on the skin, leaving a permanent tattoo.\n\nToday, ta moko remains an important cultural tradition for the Maori people, and many choose to get these traditional designs as a way to honor their cultural heritage.",
