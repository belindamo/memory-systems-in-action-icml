  "content": "What a thoughtful gesture! Onigiri is indeed a popular snack in Japan, but its familiarity can vary in other East Asian countries, including China.\n\nWhile onigiri is not a traditional Chinese snack, it's possible that your roommate might have encountered it before, especially if they:\n\n1. Have traveled to Japan or Korea: If your roommate has visited Japan or Korea, they might have tried onigiri during their trip.\n2. Are familiar with Japanese or Korean culture: If your roommate has an interest in Japanese or Korean culture, they might have come across onigiri through media, such as anime, dramas, or food blogs.\n3. Have friends from Japan or Korea: If your roommate has friends from Japan or Korea, they might have been introduced to onigiri through them.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that your roommate might not be familiar with onigiri, especially if they're from a region in China where Japanese or Korean cuisine is not as well-represented.\n\nTo play it safe, you could approach the situation in a few ways:\n\n1. Ask your roommate if they've heard of onigiri: You could casually ask your roommate if they know what onigiri is or if they've tried it before. This will give you an idea of their familiarity with the snack.\n2. Introduce it as a new snack: If your roommate isn't familiar with onigiri, you could introduce it as a new snack you'd like to share with them. You could explain what it is, how it's made, and its cultural significance in Japan.\n3. Offer a variety of fillings: To make it more appealing, you could offer a variety of fillings, such as salmon, tuna, pickled plum, or even Chinese-inspired ingredients like Peking duck or Szechuan pepper. This will give your roommate a chance to try something new and familiar at the same time.\n\nRemember, sharing food is a great way to bond and show appreciation for each other's cultures. Good luck, and I hope your roommate enjoys the onigiri!",
