Recording your sightings, notes, and sketches can help you develop a deeper understanding of the birds you see and identify patterns and habits.\n\nYou're right that some shorebirds can be challenging to distinguish, even in non-breeding plumage. This is because many shorebirds have similar shapes, sizes, and plumage patterns, making it difficult to tell them apart. However, by paying attention to subtle differences in shape, size, and behavior, you can improve your skills.\n\nHere are some additional tips to help you identify shorebirds in non-breeding plumage:\n\n1. **Focus on the basics**: Look for differences in size, shape, and overall structure. For example, plovers tend to be shorter and more compact, while sandpipers are often longer and more slender.\n2. **Pay attention to bill shape and size**: Even in non-breeding plumage, shorebirds often retain their distinctive bill shapes and sizes. For example, Dunlins have a distinctive black belly patch and a short, stout bill.\n3. **Look for subtle color differences**: While breeding plumage can be flashy, non-breeding plumage often features more subdued colors. Look for subtle differences in tone, such as the warm brown color of a Sanderling versus the cooler gray of a Semipalmated Sandpiper.\n4. **Observe behavior**: Shorebirds often have distinct behaviors, such as foraging styles or flight patterns, that can help you identify them. For example, Sanderlings are known for their rapid, clockwork-like running along the beach, while Dunlins tend to forage in a more deliberate, stop-and-start manner.\n5. **Use habitat cues**: Different shorebirds often prefer specific habitats, such as mudflats, sandy beaches, or rocky shores. By understanding the habitat preferences of different species, you can narrow down the possibilities when you encounter an unknown bird.\n\nIt's great to hear that you're keeping a journal and recording your sightings! That's a great way to track your progress and reflect on your experiences. Your sighting of American Goldfinches and a Red-winged Blackbird on March 17th is a great addition to your journal, and I'm sure you'll continue to add many more exciting entries as you continue to develop your birding skills.",
