  "content": "It's a good idea to rotate your puppy's toys regularly to keep them interested and engaged. Just like people, puppies can get bored with the same toys every day, and rotating their toys can provide much-needed mental stimulation and prevent destructive behavior. You can set up a toy rotation system where you offer a few different toys each day or every other day, and put the other toys away for a little while. This way your puppy will have a variety of toys to play with and won't get bored of them easily. When rotating toys, make sure to clean them regularly and inspect them for any signs of wear or tear. Discard any toys that are damaged, or have pieces that can be chewed off and swallowed, to ensure your puppy's safety.",
