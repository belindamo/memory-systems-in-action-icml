Speaking of language, I've been thinking about my own mixed ethnicity and how it's influenced my experiences. I'm half Korean, a quarter Japanese, and a quarter Caucasian. I've been exploring my Korean heritage lately, but I've never really delved into my Japanese side. Do you have any recommendations for resources or websites that could help me learn more about Japanese culture and history?",
