It's possible that she's a new or emerging author, or that the book hasn't received widespread attention yet.\n\nHowever, I'd love to help you try to find more information about her or her work. Can you tell me more about the book \"The Lost City\"? What's it about, and what did you like about it? Was it a fantasy novel, a mystery, or something else?\n\nAdditionally, do you remember any other details about the author or the event where you met her? Was it a small, local event or a larger literary festival? Any details you can provide might help me narrow down the search.\n\nIf we can't find more information about Jane Smith, I'd be happy to recommend some books or authors that might appeal to you based on your interests in magical realism and \"The Lost City\". Just let me know!",
