  "content": "I'm happy to help! However, I need to clarify that Eternity's Edge is not a real game, and it's not possible to pre-order it. It seems that it was a demo or a prototype you played at the gaming event, and it's not a publicly announced game.\n\nIf you're looking for games with similar combat mechanics or gameplay elements, I'd be happy to recommend some games that might scratch that itch. Since you enjoyed the action combat and fantasy setting of Eternity's Edge, here are some games that might be up your alley:\n\n1. **Monster Hunter: World** - An action RPG with a focus on hunting and slaying massive monsters in a fantasy world.\n2. **Nioh** - A dark fantasy action RPG with a focus on challenging combat and a rich storyline.\n3. **Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen** - An open-world action RPG with a focus on exploration, combat, and character customization.\n4. **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt** - An action RPG with a deep storyline, engaging combat, and a vast open world to explore.\n5. **Horizon Zero Dawn** - An action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world, with a focus on hunting robotic creatures and exploring a vast open world.\n\nThese games all have elements of action combat, exploration, and character customization that might appeal to you. However, keep in mind that they may not be exact matches to Eternity's Edge, as it's a unique game that hasn't been publicly announced.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further recommendations, feel free to ask!",
