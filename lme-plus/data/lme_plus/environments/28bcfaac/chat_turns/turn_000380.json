  "content": "Hip hop classes can be a lot of fun, but they can also be high-energy and fast-paced, which can be challenging to follow if you're new to dance. Salsa is a great choice if you're looking for a more low-key and structured approach to learning dance.\n\nIt's great that you made the switch and found a style that works better for you. Salsa is a wonderful dance style that can be very rewarding to learn, and it's awesome that you're enjoying it. The fact that you can learn the steps and feel more confident in your dancing is a huge plus!\n\nWhat do you think it is about salsa that you enjoy more than hip hop? Is it the rhythm, the steps, the cultural aspect, or something else entirely?",
