  "content": "I use my smartphone and laptop most frequently. My typical wake-up time is around 7 am, and bedtime varies, but I'm aiming for 10:30 pm on weekends and 10 pm on weekdays. On an average day, I think I spend around 4-5 hours on screens, including work and leisure time. My top 3 most used apps are social media, email, and Netflix. I'm most tempted to mindlessly scroll in the evenings, usually after dinner around 7-8 pm when I'm watching TV or before bed when I'm winding down.",
