It features a strong ensemble cast, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell.\n2. **Servant**: This psychological thriller from M. Night Shyamalan follows a young couple who hire a nanny to care for their baby, but things take a dark and mysterious turn. It's a slow-burning, atmospheric series that explores themes of grief, trauma, and the supernatural.\n3. **See**: Set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans have lost the sense of sight, this epic drama follows a tribe of survivors as they navigate their new reality. It's a visually stunning series with a strong cast, including Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard.\n4. **Defending Jacob**: Based on the bestselling novel, this crime drama follows a district attorney who's forced to confront his own family's dark past when his son is accused of murder. It's a thought-provoking exploration of family, justice, and morality.\n5. **Truth Be Told**: This true-crime podcast-inspired series follows a journalist who re-examines a murder case she covered years ago, only to discover new evidence that challenges everything she thought she knew. It's a gripping, well-crafted show with a strong performance from Octavia Spencer.\n6. **Dickinson**: This comedy-drama reimagines the life of Emily Dickinson as a young woman living in the 19th century. It's a witty, charming, and anachronistic take on the classic poet's life, with a great performance from Hailee Steinfeld.\n\nThese shows offer a range of genres and tones, so you're likely to find something that suits your taste.
