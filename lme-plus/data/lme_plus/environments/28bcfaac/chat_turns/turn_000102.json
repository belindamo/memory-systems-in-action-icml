However, it is generally recognized that people's ability to process complex information and ideas has increased with the rise of literacy, education, and advancements in technology. \n\nHowever, even with the rise of literacy and education, there is still a need to communicate ideas in accessible language for many reasons. It may be to reach audiences who are new to a particular topic or who may not have a strong background in the subject matter. It may also be because people learn and process information differently, and some may require a simpler language or way of presenting information to fully comprehend it. \n\nMoreover, in today's world, where information overload is a common phenomenon, presenting complex information in a clear and concise way can be essential for cutting through the noise and making a message more accessible and impactful.
