Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location or personal information, so I can't provide you with specific studios near your workplace. However, I can suggest a few ways to find dance studios that offer salsa classes in your area:\n\n1. **Google Search**: Type \"salsa classes near me\" or \"dance studios near [your workplace zip code]\" and browse through the results. You can also use Google Maps to search for dance studios in your area and filter the results by rating, distance, and hours of operation.\n2. **Online Directories**: Websites like DanceStudioFinder, DanceClass, or ClassBento allow you to search for dance studios and classes in your area. You can filter your search by location, dance style, and schedule.\n3. **Social Media**: Check social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram to see if local dance studios have pages or groups where they post about their classes and schedules. You can also ask your friends or colleagues for recommendations.\n4. **Local Community Centers**: Many community centers, recreation centers, or YMCAs offer dance classes, including salsa. Check their websites or visit in person to see if they have classes that fit your schedule.\n5. **Word of Mouth**: Ask your coworkers or friends who live or work near your office if they know of any good dance studios in the area. Personal recommendations can be a great way to find a studio that's a good fit for you.\n\nRemember to research the studios, read reviews, and check their schedules to ensure they offer salsa classes at a time that works for you.
