  "content": "I think Sarah's workshop was a one-time event, but it was really inspiring and I'd love to find something similar. She taught us how to combine singing, acting, and dancing to bring a character to life, and I felt so empowered by the end of it. I'm open to regular classes or workshops, as long as they focus on that kind of comprehensive training.",
