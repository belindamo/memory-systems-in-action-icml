  "content": "D. services are provided by a public, private, or hybrid deployment\n\nA cloud-based network topology is a type of network architecture that uses cloud computing technologies to deliver network services over the Internet. In a cloud-based network topology, services such as data storage, computing, and networking are provided by a cloud provider and accessed by users over the Internet.\n\nOne characteristic of cloud-based network topology is that services are provided by a public, private, or hybrid deployment. A public cloud deployment is one in which the cloud provider makes its services available to the general public over the Internet. A private cloud deployment is one in which the cloud provider makes its services available only to a specific organization or group of users. A hybrid cloud deployment is one in which the organization uses both public and private cloud services.\n\nIn a cloud-based network topology, the physical infrastructure and resources required to support the services are owned and maintained by the cloud provider, rather than by the individual users or organizations that consume the services. This allows users to access the services they need without the need to invest in and manage their own hardware and software resources.",
