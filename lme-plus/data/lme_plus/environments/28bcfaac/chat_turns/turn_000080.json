The announcement was made in January 2020, just a few weeks after the season 1 finale.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan will return as the showrunner, and the entire main cast, including Lauren Ambrose, Toby Kebbell, Nell Tiger Free, and Rupert Grint, are set to reprise their roles.\n\nWhile there's no official release date for season 2 yet, Shyamalan has mentioned that they're aiming to start production in the spring of 2020, with a possible premiere date in late 2020 or early 2021.\n\nAs for rumors, there haven't been any major spoilers or plot leaks, but Shyamalan has hinted that season 2 will explore the consequences of the events in the season 1 finale. He's also mentioned that the next season will delve deeper into the characters' backstories and introduce new mysteries to keep viewers guessing.\n\nKeep in mind that Apple TV+ is still a relatively new player in the streaming market, and they're investing heavily in their original content. Given the show's critical acclaim and dedicated fan base, I'm confident that Servant will continue to receive the support it needs to thrive.\n\nNow, get back to bingeing, and I'll see you in the Servant fandom!",
