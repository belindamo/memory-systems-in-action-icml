  "content": "Yes, Wesley did have other works that were more nuanced and aimed at more advanced readers. Some of Wesley's other works that are specifically focused on theology and doctrine include \"The Doctrine of Original Sin According to Scripture, Reason, and Experience,\" and \"The Doctrine of Justification By Faith.\" These works are more complex and require a deeper understanding of theological concepts.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Wesley's focus was always on making his ideas accessible to as many people as possible. He believed that anyone could understand and benefit from his teachings, regardless of their level of education or background. This is evidenced by the fact that he often preached in open-air settings and used simple language that the common people could understand. \n\nOverall, Wesley's approach was to offer different works for different readers, depending on their level of understanding and interest in the subject matter. However, he always prioritized accessibility and the goal of reaching as many people as possible with his message.",
