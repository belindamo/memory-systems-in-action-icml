  "content": "D. compare the destination IP address to the IP routing table\n\nThe data plane of a network device refers to the part of the device that is responsible for forwarding packets through the network. The data plane performs actions such as receiving incoming packets, examining their headers to determine their destination, and forwarding them to the appropriate output interface.\n\nOne action that occurs within the data plane is comparing the destination IP address of an incoming packet to the IP routing table. The IP routing table is a data structure that stores the paths to different destination networks. When a packet arrives at a network device, the device looks up the destination IP address in the routing table to determine which interface to use to forward the packet. This process is known as routing, and it is an essential part of the data plane's function.\n\nOther actions that occur within the data plane include examining the packet headers to determine the packet's protocol, applying any configured Quality of Service (QoS) policies, and performing any necessary packet manipulation or modification. These actions are all designed to ensure that the packet is properly forwarded to its destination.",
