  "content": "Sure, here's a fun kayak polo training session that takes about 1.5 hours and can be done with around 15 people:\n\nWarm-Up (15 minutes)\n\n* Begin with a 5-10 minute light paddle to warm up the muscles.\n* Follow with 5 minutes of stretching to increase flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nDrills (45 minutes)\n\n* Pass and Shoot: Divide the group into pairs and have them practice passing the ball back and forth while paddling towards the goal. The passer should lead the receiver so that they have an open shot at the goal. Have the pairs take turns shooting at the goal from different angles.\n* Blocking: Have the group pair up and practice blocking each other's shots. The blocker should use their kayak and paddle to prevent the shooter from scoring.\n* Scrimmage: Divide the group into two teams and have them play a scrimmage with one ball and two goals. Allow the teams to practice passing, shooting, and blocking. Switch the teams' positions after 10 minutes.\n\nGame Play (30 minutes)\n\n* Set up two goals on opposite ends of the playing area.\n* Divide the group into two teams of seven players each.\n* Play a game of kayak polo with two 15-minute halves.\n* Encourage the teams to practice their passing, shooting, and blocking skills.\n* Allow substitutions as needed.\n\nCool-Down (15 minutes)\n\n* End with a 5-10 minute light paddle to cool down the muscles.\n* Follow with 5 minutes of stretching to improve flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nNote: Make sure to establish clear boundaries for the playing area and to set rules for safe play. It's also recommended to wear appropriate safety gear, including a properly fitting life jacket, and to play in a calm and safe water environment.",
