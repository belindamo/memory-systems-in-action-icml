  "content": "Bread flour is a great choice for sourdough baking! Storing flour properly is crucial to maintain its quality and performance. Here are some tips to help you store bread flour:\n\n1. **Airtight containers:** Store bread flour in airtight containers, such as glass or plastic bins, to prevent air, moisture, and pests from getting in. You can also use paper bags or cardboard containers, but make sure they are tightly sealed.\n2. **Cool, dry place:** Keep flour away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and humid areas. A cool, dry place like a pantry or cupboard is ideal. Avoid storing flour near ovens, dishwashers, or refrigerators, as they can generate heat and moisture.\n3. **Low humidity:** Bread flour is sensitive to humidity, so it's essential to store it in an environment with a relative humidity of 60% or lower. You can use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity level in your storage area.\n4. **Room temperature:** Store bread flour at room temperature (around 70\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F or 21\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). Avoid storing it in the refrigerator or freezer, as this can cause the flour to absorb moisture and become stale faster.\n5. **Use within a reasonable time:** Bread flour typically has a shelf life of 6 to 12 months. Try to use your flour within 6 months for optimal performance. If you notice any changes in the flour's texture, smell, or performance, it's best to use a fresh batch.\n6. **Freeze for long-term storage:** If you won't be using your bread flour within 6 months, consider freezing it. Place the flour in an airtight container or freezer bag and store it in the freezer at 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or below. Frozen flour can be stored for up to 2 years. When you're ready to use it, simply thaw the flour at room temperature or in the refrigerator.\n7. **Sift before using:** Before using stored flour, sift it to remove any lumps or compacted particles that may have formed during storage. This ensures the flour is evenly distributed and performs well in your recipes.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to maintain the quality of your bread flour and enjoy consistent results in your sourdough baking adventures!",
