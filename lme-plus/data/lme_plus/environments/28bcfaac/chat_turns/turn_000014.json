  "content": "Great question! If the participants already have some basic flatwater skills and you want to focus on the whitewater part, here's a training session that you can use:\n\nWarm-Up (10-15 minutes)\n\n* Begin with a 5-10 minute light paddle to warm up the muscles.\n* Follow with 5 minutes of stretching to increase flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nSafety Briefing (10-15 minutes)\n\n* Review basic safety information, including wearing a properly fitting life jacket and helmet, how to perform a wet exit, and how to swim in whitewater.\n* Discuss the importance of communication and staying together as a group.\n* Go over hand signals and basic river rescue techniques.\n\nWhitewater Skills Practice (60-90 minutes)\n\n* Start with a section of easy class 2 rapids to warm up and review basic whitewater skills.\n* Practice paddling through small waves and eddies, using eddies to rest and avoid hazards, and ferrying to cross the current.\n* Practice catching and exiting eddies in faster-moving water and using peel-outs to exit eddies and get back into the current.\n* Practice running small drops and waves in a controlled manner, using proper technique to avoid capsizing.\n* Practice eddy hopping, or catching one eddy and then quickly moving to the next, to navigate more complex sections of river.\n* Encourage the group to communicate and work together to navigate the rapids safely.\n\nCool-Down (10-15 minutes)\n\n* End with a 5-10 minute light paddle to cool down the muscles.\n* Follow with 5 minutes of stretching to improve flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nNote: Make sure to choose an appropriate section of river for the skill level of the kayakers and to always practice safety measures when kayaking in moving water. It's also recommended to wear appropriate safety gear, including a properly fitting life jacket and helmet, and to paddle with a trained instructor or experienced kayaker.",
