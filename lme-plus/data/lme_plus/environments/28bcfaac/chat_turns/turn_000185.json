  "content": "It sounds like you're looking for a comprehensive musical theater program that covers all three aspects of the craft. I'd be happy to help you find a program that fits your needs.\n\nSince you're in the city, there are likely many options available to you. Can you tell me more about the workshop you attended with Sarah? Was it a one-time event, or was it part of a larger program or school? Did she mention any specific techniques or approaches that she teaches?\n\nAlso, are you looking for a program that offers classes on a regular schedule (e.g. weekly or bi-weekly), or are you open to workshops or intensives that might be more condensed?\n\nI can suggest some general options, but I'd love more information to give you more targeted recommendations.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few questions to consider:\n\n* Are you interested in programs that focus on a specific style of musical theater, such as jazz, classical, or contemporary?\n* Are you looking for programs that offer performance opportunities, such as productions or showcases?\n* Are you interested in programs that cater to beginners, or are you looking for more advanced training?\n\nLet me know your thoughts, and I can start suggesting some options for you!",
