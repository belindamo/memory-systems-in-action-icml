I've been on a theater kick lately, and I just watched the 2020 Tony Awards ceremony online, which got me excited about all the new shows and performances. I've also been listening to show tunes from Dear Evan Hansen on Spotify, which I even got to discuss with friends at a viewing party. Do you have any suggestions on what I should see live on Broadway next?",
