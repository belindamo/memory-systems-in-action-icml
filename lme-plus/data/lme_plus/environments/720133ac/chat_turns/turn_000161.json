  "content": "That's really helpful, thanks! I think I need to revisit my feature engineering process and explore different techniques to identify the most important features. I've been relying too much on my domain knowledge, but I realize now that I need to use more quantitative methods to validate my assumptions. I'll definitely look into correlation analysis, mutual information, and permutation importance to get a better understanding of which features are driving the churn behavior. \n\nAlso, I want to experiment with different algorithms beyond logistic regression. I've heard that random forests and gradient boosting machines can handle complex interactions between features, which might be useful in this case. Do you have any advice on how to tune the hyperparameters for these algorithms?",
