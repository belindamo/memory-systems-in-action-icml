I'm happy to help you with that!\n\nMaking homemade noodles from scratch can be a bit time-consuming, but it's a rewarding process, and the result is well worth the effort. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Grandma-Style Homemade Noodles**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 2 eggs\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* Water, as needed\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Combine flour and salt**: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.\n2. **Make a well**: Create a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the eggs.\n3. **Mix and knead**: Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs, starting from the inner rim of the well. As the mixture comes together, switch to kneading with your hands until a dough forms.\n4. **Knead and rest**: Knead the dough for about 10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.\n5. **Roll out the dough**: Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll out each piece into a long, thin rope.\n6. **Cut the noodles**: Cut the rope into 1/4-inch thick slices. You can use a pasta cutter or a sharp knife to get the desired thickness.\n7. **Dry the noodles**: Lay the noodles out on a clean towel or pasta drying rack to dry for at least 30 minutes. This step is crucial to prevent the noodles from sticking together.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use a high-protein flour, like bread flour or all-purpose flour with a high protein content, to produce a chewier noodle.\n* Don't overwork the dough, as this can make the noodles tough.\n* If you find the dough too sticky, add a little more flour. If it's too dry, add a little more egg.\n* To achieve the soft and chewy texture, it's essential to not overcook the noodles. Cook them in boiling salted water for about 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface.\n\nNow, let's talk about incorporating these noodles into your grandma's chicken soup recipe. Do you remember any other details about her soup, such as the type of chicken she used, any specific spices or herbs, or the cooking method?",
