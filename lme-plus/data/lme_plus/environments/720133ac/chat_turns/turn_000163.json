  "content": "I plan to start by performing a grid search over a range of hyperparameters for both random forest and gradient boosting machine models. I'll use a validation set to evaluate the performance of each model with different hyperparameters and monitor performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. I'll also consider using Bayesian optimization to search for the optimal hyperparameters, especially if the grid search takes too long.\n\nI'll start with the default hyperparameters and then tune them based on the performance of my model. I'll also make sure to avoid overfitting by monitoring the performance metrics and adjusting the hyperparameters accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, I'll consider using techniques like cross-validation to ensure that my model generalizes well to new data. I'll also experiment with different feature engineering techniques, such as feature scaling and feature selection, to see if they improve the performance of my model.\n\nOverall, I'm excited to dive deeper into hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to see if I can improve the performance of my",
