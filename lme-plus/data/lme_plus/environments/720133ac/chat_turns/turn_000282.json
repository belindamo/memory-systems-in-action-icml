  "content": "Live streamers use different tools to keep up with comments and questions coming in from their audience. Some common tools are:\n\n1. Moderators \u2013 They have moderators who help them manage the comments as they come in, and they can identify and remove offensive or inappropriate comments.\n\n2. Chatbots \u2013 Streamers also use chatbots to help with repetitive tasks such as responding to greeting messages or sending out predefined messages to their viewers.\n\n3. Dedicated moderators \u2013 They also designate a close friend, family member or loyal viewers to help moderate the chat - this helps keep them from being too overwhelmed.\n\n4. Personal assistant \u2013 For high profile streamers or those who have a big following, they may hire personal assistants to help manage their social media accounts and chat interactions with followers.\n\nOverall, most streamers prioritize engagement with their audience and find ways to keep up with the comments and questions coming in as best they can.",
