  "content": "Arm & Hammer Super Scoop is a popular and reliable choice for many cat owners, and I'm sure Lola will do well with it.\n\nRegarding the cat food, $35 for a 20-pound bag sounds like a good deal! It's great to hear that Lola is doing fine with it. What type of food did you get? Was it a specific brand or formulation (e.g., grain-free, limited ingredient, etc.)?\n\nIt's always a good idea to monitor Lola's health and adjust her diet as needed. Make sure to keep an eye on her weight, coat condition, and stool quality, and consult with your vet if you have any concerns.\n\nBy the way, have you considered a litter box with a low-dust design or a litter mat to help reduce tracking and mess? These can be really helpful in keeping your home clean and reducing the amount of litter that gets scattered outside the litter box.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
