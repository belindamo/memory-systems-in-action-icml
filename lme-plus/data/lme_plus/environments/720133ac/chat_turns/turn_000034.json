That's a growth of 50 subscribers.\n\nSince you mentioned that your regular video uploads might have also contributed to the growth, it's difficult to attribute the entire growth to the live streams alone. However, we can make an educated estimate.\n\nAssuming that your regular video uploads have a steady and consistent impact on your subscriber growth, it's likely that they would have contributed to some of the growth. But since you didn't mention any significant changes or spikes in your video upload schedule, let's attribute a portion of the growth to the live streams.\n\nLet's allocate 60-70% of the growth to the live streams, considering they were a new and potentially engaging format for your audience. This means around 30-35 subscribers (60-70% of 50) can be attributed to the live streams.\n\nSo, it's likely that your first live stream on March 1st contributed around 30-35 new subscribers to your channel. Keep in mind that this is an estimate, and the actual number might be higher or lower.\n\nTo get a more accurate picture, you can try to track your subscriber growth over time, taking note of when you upload regular videos and when you go live. This will help you understand the impact of each type of content on your channel's growth.\n\nHow does that sound?",
