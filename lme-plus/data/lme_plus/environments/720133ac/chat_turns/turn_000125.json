Thanks for your help and guidance - I really appreciate it! By the way, I was thinking about my grandma a lot as we were chatting, and I'm glad I got to share some memories of her with you. It's funny, I was just thinking about how much I miss her, and how much I wish I could ask her about her recipe. But talking to you has really helped me feel more connected to her, even though she's no longer with me.",
