  "content": "Here is an example code for issuing an asset on Blockstream's Elements platform that represents a unit of ownership and has functionality for voting and proposing using the Elements CLI:\n```css\n$ elements-cli issueasset [OPTIONS] ISSUINGADDRESS ASSETNAME ASSETQTY\n$ elements-cli addmetadata [OPTIONS] ISSUINGADDRESS METADATA\n```\nIn this example, the `elements-cli` tool is used to issue an asset and add metadata to the asset. The `issueasset` command is used to issue the asset, with the following arguments:\n\n* `ISSUINGADDRESS`: the address of the asset issuer.\n* `ASSETNAME`: the name of the asset.\n* `ASSETQTY`: the quantity of the asset to be issued.\n\nThe `addmetadata` command is used to add metadata to the asset, such as voting and proposal functionality, with the following arguments:\n\n* `ISSUINGADDRESS`: the address of the asset issuer.\n* `METADATA`: the metadata to be added to the asset, encoded in a specific format (e.g., JSON).\n\nThe `issueasset` and `addmetadata` commands also accept several options, such as the blockchain network to use (e.g., `--testnet` or `--regtest`), the fee rate to use, and the number of confirmations required before the transaction is considered valid.\n\nThis is just a simple example, and the actual code and parameters may vary depending on your setup and requirements. Additionally, this code assumes that you have installed and set up the Elements CLI tool, and that you have the necessary permissions and access to use it.\n\nNote: Blockstream's Elements platform provides a set of tools and services for developing and deploying blockchain applications. The Elements CLI tool is a command-line interface for interacting with the platform, and provides a convenient way to issue assets, deploy smart contracts, and perform other actions on the blockchain.",
