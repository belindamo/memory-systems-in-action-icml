A customized picture frame with a special photo from his high school graduation will surely be a heartfelt and meaningful gift for your brother.\n\nRegarding AdornMe, if you've had a good experience with them before, it's likely a safe bet to go with them again. They must have done something right to earn your trust!\n\nBefore making a final decision, you might want to:\n\n1. Check their website or social media for any promotions or discounts that might be available.\n2. Review their product offerings and pricing to ensure they still meet your expectations.\n3. Read recent reviews from other customers to ensure their quality and service haven't changed.\n\nIf everything checks out, it's likely a good idea to stick with a vendor you trust. AdornMe has already demonstrated their ability to meet your expectations, so it's reasonable to assume they'll do so again.\n\nIf you do decide to go with AdornMe, make sure to:\n\n1. Double-check the production and shipping times to ensure the frame arrives in time for your brother's graduation celebration.\n2. Carefully review the customization options and proofread the text or message you want to include, if any.\n3. Consider upgrading to a premium frame material or adding a special touch, like a matte finish or a personalized message on the back of the frame.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure your brother will love the customized picture frame!",
