Their exhibitions are more geared towards interactive, immersive experiences with a focus on optical illusions, 3D installations, and interactive art.\n\nHowever, there are other museums and galleries in NYC that might interest you:\n\n1. **The Museum of Contemporary Art (MoCA)**: You've already visited them, but they often feature exhibitions related to street art and graffiti. Keep an eye on their upcoming exhibitions and events.\n2. **The Street Museum of Art (SMoA)**: A relatively new museum in NYC, dedicated to showcasing street art and graffiti. They feature rotating exhibitions, so be sure to check their website for current and upcoming shows.\n3. **The Bronx Museum of the Arts**: While not exclusively focused on street art, they have featured exhibitions on graffiti and urban art in the past. They're worth keeping an eye on for future exhibitions.\n4. **Graffiti Hall of Fame**: Not a traditional museum, but an outdoor exhibit space in East Harlem featuring a collection of graffiti murals by local and international artists.\n\nTo stay updated on street art and graffiti exhibitions in NYC, I recommend following local art organizations, galleries, and street art collectives on social media.
