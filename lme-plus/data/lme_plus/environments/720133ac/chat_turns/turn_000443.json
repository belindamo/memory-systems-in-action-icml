  "content": "Congratulations on the new kitty, Lola!\n\nI'd be happy to help you with cat litter recommendations. Odor control is a top priority for many cat owners, and there are several great options out there.\n\nBefore I dive into specific brands and types, can you tell me a bit more about your preferences? For example:\n\n1. Do you have a preferred litter texture or type (clumping, silica gel, natural, etc.)?\n2. Are you looking for a budget-friendly option or are you open to investing in a premium product?\n3. Does Lola have any sensitivities or allergies you need to consider?\n4. How often do you scoop the litter box, and how many cats use it?\n\nAs for flea and tick prevention, $25 for a 3-month supply sounds like a good deal! Which product did you choose?\n\nNow, here are some popular cat litter brands and types known for their odor control:\n\n1. **Arm & Hammer Super Scoop**: A clumping litter with excellent odor-absorbing properties.\n2. **Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Premium**: A highly absorbent, odor-controlling litter made from 100% natural minerals.\n3. **World's Best Cat Litter**: A natural, clumping litter made from whole kernel corn that's gentle on paws and effective at controlling odors.\n4. **Swheat Scoop Natural Cat Litter**: A non-clumping, natural litter made from whole kernel corn that's biodegradable and odor-absorbing.\n5. **Blue Buffalo Naturally Fresh**: A clumping litter with a natural odor-neutralizing agent and a low dust formula.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many more options available. I'd be happy to provide more recommendations based on your specific needs and preferences.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
