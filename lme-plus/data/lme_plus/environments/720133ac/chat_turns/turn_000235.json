By the way, I've already got him a customized phone case and a gift card to H&M, but I want to make sure he has a memorable celebration. Oh, and I also got my coworker a gift card to a local restaurant with a card for their wedding, so they could enjoy a nice dinner on us - that was a $50 gift card, I think it was a great idea!",
