Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a game called \"Echoes of Eternity\" that has been officially announced or has a public presence. It's possible that it's a very early-stage game or a small indie project that hasn't been widely announced yet.\n\nHowever, I can definitely recommend some great resources where you can find information on upcoming RPGs:\n\n1. **RPGamer**: A dedicated RPG news and review website that covers a wide range of RPGs, including indie and lesser-known titles.\n2. **Game Informer**: A popular gaming magazine that often features previews, reviews, and news on upcoming RPGs.\n3. **IGN**: A large gaming media outlet that covers news, reviews, and previews of various games, including RPGs.\n4. **Polygon**: A gaming news and culture website that often features articles and interviews about upcoming RPGs.\n5. **Reddit's r/RPG**: A community-driven subreddit dedicated to RPGs, where users share news, discuss games, and ask questions.\n6. **Gamasutra**: A website focused on game development, which often features articles and interviews about upcoming RPGs from developers and industry professionals.\n7. **Steam**: Keep an eye on Steam's \"Coming Soon\" section, which often features upcoming games, including RPGs.\n\nYou can also try searching for gaming forums, social media groups, or Discord servers dedicated to RPG enthusiasts. These communities often share news, rumors, and discussions about upcoming RPGs.\n\nIf you remember any details about the game, such as the developer, publisher, or any distinctive features, it might help me narrow down the search.",
