These are significant events that warrant special gestures.\n2. **Number of gifts:** You've only mentioned two gifts, so the average spend per gift is around $212.50, which is still a generous amount.\n3. **Your budget:** The most important factor is whether this amount fits within your personal budget and financial goals. If you can afford it without compromising your own financial stability, then it's not necessarily a problem.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to reflect on your spending habits and ensure you're not overspending or accumulating debt. You might want to ask yourself:\n\n* Are there any other upcoming expenses or financial priorities I need to consider?\n* Could I have achieved the same level of thoughtfulness with a lower budget?\n* Are there any areas where I can cut back on discretionary spending to balance out my gift expenses?\n\nRemember, what matters most is the thought and love behind the gifts, not the price tag. Your brother and coworker will likely appreciate the gestures regardless of the cost.\n\nTake this opportunity to review your budget and adjust your spending habits as needed. It's essential to find a balance between being generous and responsible with your finances.",
