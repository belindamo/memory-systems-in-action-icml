  "content": "Here is an example code for adding voting functionality to an asset using the `addmetadata` command of the Elements CLI:\n```css\n$ elements-cli addmetadata [OPTIONS] ISSUINGADDRESS METADATA\n```\nIn this example, the `elements-cli` tool is used to add metadata to an existing asset. The `addmetadata` command is used to add the metadata, with the following arguments:\n\n* `ISSUINGADDRESS`: the address of the asset issuer.\n* `METADATA`: the metadata to be added to the asset, encoded in a specific format (e.g., JSON).\n\nThe metadata in this example would specify the voting functionality, including the voting options and the duration of the vote. The metadata would also specify the rules and procedures for counting votes and determining the outcome of the vote.\n\nThe `addmetadata` command also accepts several options, such as the blockchain network to use (e.g., `--testnet` or `--regtest`), the fee rate to use, and the number of confirmations required before the transaction is considered valid.\n\nThis is just a simple example, and the actual code and parameters may vary depending on your setup and requirements. Additionally, this code assumes that you have installed and set up the Elements CLI tool, and that you have the necessary permissions and access to use it.\n\nNote: Blockstream's Elements platform provides a set of tools and services for developing and deploying blockchain applications. The Elements CLI tool is a command-line interface for interacting with the platform, and provides a convenient way to add metadata, deploy smart contracts, and perform other actions on the blockchain.",
