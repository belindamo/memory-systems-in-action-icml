  "content": "I'm looking for some information on Monet's water lily paintings. I saw them at the City Art Museum a few months ago and was fascinated. By the way, speaking of museums, I participated in the Museum Mile event today, where several museums along the mile-long stretch offered free admission and extended hours. Anyway, back to Monet - do you know if there are any notable exhibitions featuring his work coming up?",
