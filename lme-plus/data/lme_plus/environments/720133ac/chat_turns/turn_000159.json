I've been trying to use logistic regression, but I'm getting a decent accuracy of around 80%. I'm not sure if that's good enough or if I should try to improve it further. Also, I'm having some trouble with feature engineering - I'm not sure which features are most relevant to the problem. Do you have any advice on how to choose the most important features?",
