Before each live stream, take note of your current subscriber count.\n2. After each live stream, take note of your new subscriber count.\n3. Calculate the difference between the two numbers to determine the growth.\n\nYou can use a spreadsheet or a simple table to keep track of the data. Here's an example:\n\n| Live Stream Date | Subscribers Before | Subscribers After | Subscriber Growth |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| March 1st | 100 | 150 | 50 |\n| [Next Live Stream] | [Current Subscribers] | [New Subscribers] | [Growth] |\n\nEach time you go live, fill in the corresponding columns with the correct numbers. This will help you visualize the impact of each live stream on your subscriber growth.\n\nAdditionally, you can also track other metrics, such as:\n\n* View count and engagement (likes, comments, etc.) for each live stream\n* Average watch time and audience retention\n* Peak concurrent viewers and when they occurred\n* Any notable events or milestones during the live stream\n\nThis data will give you a better understanding of what works and what doesn't, helping you refine your live streaming strategy to attract and retain more subscribers.\n\nRemember to also keep an eye on your overall channel performance, including your regular video uploads, to get a comprehensive picture of your growth.\n\nHow does that sound?",
