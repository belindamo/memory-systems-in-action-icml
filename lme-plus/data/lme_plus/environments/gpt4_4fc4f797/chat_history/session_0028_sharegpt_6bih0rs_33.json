The author emphasizes that while seeking medical help is necessary for these conditions, the book's concepts and exercises can provide a great foundation for building a more specific treatment plan.\n\nThe chapter begins by discussing disc herniations, a severe condition that requires medical attention. The author suggests that if the pain is too severe to start with the book, a steroid injection may be necessary to calm the pain down. Nerve flossing is also recommended to remove disc material or scar tissue that can cause or exacerbate pain.\n\nNext, the author addresses hypermobile sacroiliac (SI) joint pain, which can be one of the most challenging and stubborn conditions to treat. In addition to medical intervention, the author recommends isometric adduction and abduction exercises to strengthen the muscles without moving the unstable SI joint.\n\nThe author concludes by reminding readers to strike a balance between medical help and the advice provided in the book. The two-sided approach can provide significant relief for individuals with these special conditions, and seeking specific treatment after building a foundation with the book's exercises can lead to a complete, permanent solution."
