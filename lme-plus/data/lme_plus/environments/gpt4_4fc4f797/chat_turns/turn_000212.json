  "content": "To calculate the standard deviation of the combined measurements for the amount of liquid and the amount of alcohol in the liquid, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the sample measurements for the amount of liquid:\nMean liquid = (95+97+101+102+104)/5 = 99.8 grams\n2. Calculate the mean of the sample measurements for the amount of alcohol:\nMean alcohol = (26+28+31+33)/4 = 29 grams\n3. Calculate the deviation of each measurement for the amount of liquid from the mean:\nDeviation of 95 = 95 - 99.8 = -4.8\nDeviation of 97 = 97 - 99.8 = -2.8\nDeviation of 101 = 101 - 99.8 = 1.2\nDeviation of 102 = 102 - 99.8 = 2.2\nDeviation of 104 = 104 - 99.8 = 4.2\n4. Calculate the deviation of each measurement for the amount of alcohol from the mean:\nDeviation of 26 = 26 - 29 = -3\nDeviation of 28 = 28 - 29 = -1\nDeviation of 31 = 31 - 29 = 2\nDeviation of 33 = 33 - 29 = 4\n5. Calculate the variance of the combined measurements using the formula for the variance of a sum of two random variables:\nVariance = Variance of liquid + Variance of alcohol + 2 x Covariance of liquid and alcohol\n\nwhere\nVariance of liquid = variance of the sample measurements for the amount of liquid = 10^2 = 100\nVariance of alcohol = variance of the sample measurements for the amount of alcohol = 4.4^2 = 19.36\nCovariance of liquid and alcohol = [(95-99.8)x(26-29) + (97-99.8)x(28-29) + (101-99.8)x(31-29) + (102-99.8)x(33-29) + (104-99.8)x(33-29)]/(5-1)\n= [(-4.8)x(-3) + (-2.8)x(-1) + (1.2)x2 + (2.2)x4 + (4.2)x4]/4\n= 19.75\n\nVariance = 100 + 19.36 + 2 x 19.75 = 159.86 grams^2\n6. Calculate the standard deviation of the combined measurements by taking the square root of the variance:\nStandard deviation = sqrt(159.86) = 12.65 grams\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the combined measurements for the amount of liquid and the amount of alcohol in the liquid is 12.65 grams. This means that the actual amount of liquid and alcohol in the liquid is expected to vary from their respective means by approximately plus or minus 12.65 grams.",
