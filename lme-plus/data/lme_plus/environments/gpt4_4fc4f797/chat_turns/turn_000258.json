  "content": "While both shows are primarily classified as drama, they do have some sci-fi elements and themes that might appeal to fans of \"Stranger Things\". Here's a breakdown:\n\n**The Leftovers**\n\n* Sci-fi elements: The Sudden Departure, the event that drives the plot, is a mysterious, unexplained phenomenon that has sci-fi undertones. As the series progresses, the show explores the implications of this event, which might appeal to fans of sci-fi.\n* Supernatural elements: The show features mysterious, unexplained events, including strange creatures, eerie occurrences, and unexplained phenomena. While not traditionally sci-fi, these elements have a supernatural, otherworldly quality that might appeal to fans of \"Stranger Things\".\n* Mysteries and conspiracies: The Leftovers is all about uncovering the truth behind the Sudden Departure, which leads to a complex web of mysteries and conspiracies. Fans of \"Stranger Things\" might enjoy the show's slow-burning, suspenseful approach to unraveling the truth.\n\n**Fleabag**\n\n* Sci-fi elements: None, really. Fleabag is a grounded, realistic drama that focuses on the protagonist's inner life and relationships.\n* Supernatural elements: There are no supernatural elements in Fleabag. The show's focus is on the human experience, relationships, and emotional struggles.\n* Mysteries and conspiracies: While there are no sci-fi mysteries or conspiracies in Fleabag, the show does explore the complexities of human relationships and the mysteries of the human psyche. The show's use of non-linear storytelling and unreliable narrators might appeal to fans of complex, suspenseful storytelling.\n\nWhile neither show is traditional sci-fi, both have elements that might appeal to fans of the genre. \"The Leftovers\" has a stronger sci-fi bent, with its mysterious, unexplained events and supernatural undertones. \"Fleabag\", on the other hand, is a more grounded, realistic drama that focuses on the human experience.\n\nIf you're looking for a show that scratches your sci-fi itch, \"The Leftovers\" might be the better choice. However, if you're open to exploring a more grounded, character-driven drama with complex themes and relationships, \"Fleabag\" is an excellent choice.",
