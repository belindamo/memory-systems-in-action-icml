  "content": "I'm definitely excited to try out some healthy baking recipes. The banana bread recipe you shared sounds delicious, and I love that it uses almond flour and coconut oil. I've been meaning to experiment with alternative flours, so this is a great starting point. By the way, I've also been making overnight oats every night before bed, and I've been adding some honey and cinnamon to give it an extra boost. Do you have any other overnight oats recipes or flavor combinations you could share?",
