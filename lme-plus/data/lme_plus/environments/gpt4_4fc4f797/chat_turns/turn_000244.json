  "content": "One major case that was impacted by the changes in the Lord Chancellor's role is the case of R (on the application of Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, commonly referred to as the Brexit case. \n\nThis case was brought to determine whether the UK government had the legal authority to trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which would start the process of leaving the European Union. The case was heard by the UK Supreme Court, which delivered its judgment in January 2017.\n\nThe Brexit case was significant because it was the first time the UK Supreme Court was making a decision without the involvement of the Lord Chancellor. Prior to the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005, the Lord Chancellor would have been present in the court during the hearing, but following the reforms, the Lord Chancellor was no longer involved in judicial appointments or in overseeing the judiciary. \n\nThe constitutional significance of the case was evident in the Supreme Court's judgment, which confirmed that the UK government did not have the legal authority to trigger Article 50 without parliamentary approval. The judgment underscored the importance of the separation of powers, ensuring that the judiciary had the power to interpret the law and hold the government to account, independent of political influence. \n\nThis case demonstrated the importance of the reforms and the impact they had in modernizing the UK justice system, ensuring greater independence of the judiciary, and protecting the rule of law.",
