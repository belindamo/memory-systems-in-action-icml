  "content": "I think these resources sound really helpful, especially the book recommendations and online courses. I'm definitely going to check out \"The Anxiety and Worry Workbook\" and \"Feeling Good\" - they seem like they could be really beneficial in helping me understand and manage my anxiety. I'm also interested in exploring the online courses and therapy platforms, especially CBT Online and BetterHelp. Do you think it's a good idea to talk to Sarah, my therapist, about these resources and get her opinion on them?",
