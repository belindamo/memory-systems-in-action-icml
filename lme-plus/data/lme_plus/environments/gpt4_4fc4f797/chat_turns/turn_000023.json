  "content": "I apologize for any confusion. I made an error in my previous response. \"Isis Unveiled\" is not actually on the \"Lepaca Kliffoth\" album, but rather on Therion's 1996 album \"Theli.\" \"Theli\" is also an album that draws heavily on ancient Egyptian and other mythologies for inspiration, and it features a powerful blend of symphonic metal and operatic vocals. The track listing for \"Theli\" is as follows:\n\n1. \"Preludium\"\n2. \"To Mega Therion\"\n3. \"Cults of the Shadow\"\n4. \"In the Desert of Set\"\n5. \"Interludium\"\n6. \"Nightside of Eden\"\n7. \"Opus Eclipse\"\n8. \"Invocation of Naamah\"\n9. \"The Siren of the Woods\"\n10. \"Grand Finale / Postludium\"\n11. \"Adulruna Rediviva\" (bonus track on some versions)\n\n\"Isis Unveiled\" appears as track 7 on \"Theli\" and is one of the standout tracks on the album, with its epic orchestral arrangements, haunting vocals, and references to ancient Egyptian mythology.",
