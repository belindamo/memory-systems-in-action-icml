  "content": "Avocado toast with poached eggs is a delicious and nutritious choice.\n\nNow, about those coffee drinks to help increase energy levels and wakefulness, I've got some suggestions for you:\n\n1. **Americanos**: A classic choice, Americanos are made with espresso and hot water, providing a strong caffeine kick to help increase alertness and energy.\n2. **Cappuccinos**: A combination of espresso, steamed milk, and a layer of foam, cappuccinos offer a balanced blend of caffeine and protein to help stimulate your morning.\n3. **Lattes with an Extra Shot**: If you prefer a milder flavor, a latte with an extra shot of espresso can provide an extra boost of caffeine to help increase energy levels.\n4. **Cold Brew**: Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarse-ground coffee beans in cold water for an extended period, resulting in a smoother, less acidic flavor. It's also higher in caffeine than hot-brewed coffee, making it a great choice for a morning pick-me-up.\n5. **Mocha with Coconut Oil**: Adding a spoonful of coconut oil to your mocha can provide a sustained energy boost due to the medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) present in coconut oil. MCTs are easily absorbed and can provide a quick energy boost.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be mindful of your caffeine intake and adjust according to your sensitivity. Too much caffeine can lead to jitters, anxiety, and an energy crash later on.\n\nEnjoy your avocado toast and coffee, and I hope you feel more energized and awake soon!",
