Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:\n\n**Step 1: Create a new Google Data Studio report**\n\n* Go to [datastudio.google.com](http://datastudio.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.\n* Click on the \"+\" button to create a new report.\n* Choose \"Blank Report\" and give your report a name, such as \"Family Reunion Demographics.\"\n\n**Step 2: Create a data table**\n\n* In the report, click on the \"Create\" button and select \"Data\" > \"Create a data table.\"\n* Name your data table, for example, \"Reunion Attendees.\"\n* Add two columns: \"Gender\" and \"Count.\"\n* Enter the following data:\n\t+ Gender: Female, Male\n\t+ Count: 22, [insert total number of males at the reunion]\n\n**Step 3: Create a pie chart**\n\n* Click on the \"Insert\" button and select \"Chart\" > \"Pie chart.\"\n* Drag and drop the pie chart onto your report canvas.\n* In the \"Data\" tab, select the \"Reunion Attendees\" data table.\n* Set the \"Dimension\" to \"Gender\" and the \"Metric\" to \"Count.\"\n* Click \"Apply\" to see your pie chart take shape.\n\n**Step 4: Customize your pie chart**\n\n* You can customize the appearance of your pie chart by clicking on the three vertical dots at the top-right corner of the chart.\n* Experiment with different colors, font sizes, and layout options to make your chart more engaging.\n\nHere's an example of what your pie chart might look like:\n\nPie Chart Example\n\n* Female: 22 (55%) [assuming 40 total attendees]\n* Male: 18 (45%) [assuming 40 total attendees]\n\nThis chart shows that females make up 55% of the attendees, which is a significant proportion considering your family's historical trend of having more males.\n\nTips and variations:\n\n* You can add more data columns to your table to explore other demographics, such as age ranges or relationships.\n* Use filters to narrow down the data and create separate charts for different subgroups (e.g., female attendees by age range).\n* Experiment with different chart types, like bar charts or stacked charts, to visualize your data in different ways.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with creating a pie chart in Google Data Studio!
