It's amazing how much of a difference it can make to stay connected and keep your devices charged throughout the flight.\n\nWow, flying business class with British Airways to London sounds like an incredible experience! Lie-flat beds can make all the difference on long-haul flights, and it's great that you got to enjoy that level of comfort. British Airways' business class is known for its high-quality amenities and service, so I'm not surprised you had a fantastic time.\n\nLie-flat beds are definitely a game-changer for long-haul flights. It's amazing how much more rested and refreshed you can feel when you can stretch out and get some proper sleep during the flight. Did you find that the lie-flat bed made a significant difference in your overall travel experience, or was there anything else that stood out to you about British Airways' business class?\n\n(By the way, I'm curious - did you redeem miles for that business class ticket or was it a paid fare?)",
