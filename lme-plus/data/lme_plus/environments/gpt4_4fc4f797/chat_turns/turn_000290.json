Piazza Maggiore: This main square is the heart of Bologna and a great place to take in the city's history and architecture.\n2. Two Towers: As symbols of the city, these towers are a must-see for visitors. The taller one, Torre degli Asinelli, offers a climb and stunning view of the city.\n3. Basilica of San Petronio: One of the largest churches in the world, this basilica is located on Piazza Maggiore and features beautiful artwork and architecture.\n4. Museo Civico Archeologico: This archaeological museum is home to a large collection of ancient artifacts and displays ranging from the prehistoric period to the Renaissance.\n5. Porticoes: Bologna is famous for its porticoes - covered walkways that line many of the streets in the city.
