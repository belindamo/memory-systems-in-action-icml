  "content": "To add two standard deviations within a dataset, you will first need to calculate the standard deviation of the dataset, and then multiply it by 2. Once you have this value, you can add it to the mean of the dataset to find the upper bound of the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean. Similarly, you can subtract this value from the mean to find the lower bound of the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean. Here are the steps to do this:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the dataset.\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of the dataset.\n3. Multiply the standard deviation by 2.\n4. Add the product obtained in step 3 to the mean to find the upper bound of the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean.\n5. Subtract the product obtained in step 3 from the mean to find the lower bound of the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a dataset of exam scores with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 10. To add two standard deviations within this dataset, you would:\n\n1. Mean = 80\n2. Standard deviation = 10\n3. 2 \\* standard deviation = 20\n4. Upper bound = 80 + 20 = 100\n5. Lower bound = 80 - 20 = 60\n\nTherefore, the range that is two standard deviations away from the mean is 60 to 100.",
