And by packing them in a separate compartment, you'll be able to keep them away from bulkier items that could potentially wrinkle or crease them.\n\nRemember to also consider packing a travel-sized steamer or a portable iron, just in case you need to remove any wrinkles when you arrive at your destination.\n\nIt sounds like you're all set for packing your nicer outfits. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask. Safe travels, and I hope you have a great time with your friends!\n\n(P.S. Don't forget to leave some extra space in your luggage for souvenirs and any items you might purchase during your trip!)",
