  "content": "Excellent decision to start with a dedicated notebook or digital document for each workshop!\n\nPrioritizing which workshop to review first can be a personal preference, but here are some suggestions to help you decide:\n\n**1. Start with the most recent workshop**:\nSince the most recent workshop is freshest in your mind, it might be easier to recall the details and review your notes. This approach can help you build momentum and get into a rhythm for reviewing the remaining workshops.\n\n**2. Choose the workshop with the most urgent action items**:\n Identify the workshop with the most pressing action items or tasks you want to implement. Reviewing this workshop first will help you tackle the most critical tasks and make progress on your goals.\n\n**3. Select the workshop with the greatest impact**:\nReflect on which workshop had the most significant impact on you, either emotionally or intellectually. Reviewing this workshop first can help you relive the excitement and inspiration, and you might gain new insights from your reflection.\n\n**4. Group similar workshops together**:\nIf you attended multiple workshops on related topics, consider reviewing them together. This can help you identify common themes, patterns, or insights that emerged across the workshops.\n\n**5. Set a schedule and review in chunks**:\n Divide your review process into manageable chunks, dedicating a specific time slot for each workshop. For example, you could allocate 2-3 hours per day or 1-2 hours per week to review each workshop. This approach can help you stay focused and make steady progress.\n\n**6. Create a \"parking lot\" for ideas and questions**:\nAs you review each workshop, create a \"parking lot\" (a separate section in your notebook or document) for ideas and questions that arise. This will help you capture any new insights or connections that come up during your review process.\n\nRemember, there's no one \"right\" way to prioritize which workshop to review first. You can experiment with different approaches to find what works best for you and your learning style.\n\nTo make the most of your review process, consider the following tips:\n\n* Set a specific goal for each review session, such as identifying key takeaways or creating an action plan.\n* Use a timer to keep yourself focused and on track.\n* Take breaks to refresh your mind and avoid burnout.\n* Be kind to yourself if you don't complete a review in one sitting \u2013 it's a process, and it's okay to take your time.\n\nBy following these suggestions, you'll be able to review and reflect on each workshop effectively, extract valuable insights, and apply what you've learned to your work or personal projects.",
