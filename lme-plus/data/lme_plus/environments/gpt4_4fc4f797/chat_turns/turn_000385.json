Your phone's GPS can definitely provide a good starting point, and you can always upgrade later if needed.\n\nNow, about improving your braking technique, especially in the fast corners at VIR...\n\nBraking is a crucial aspect of track driving, and it's great that you're focusing on it. Here are some tips to help you improve your braking technique:\n\n**1. Understand the braking zone:** Identify the optimal braking points for each corner, taking into account the track's layout, your car's speed, and the corner's radius. Practice braking at different points to find the sweet spot.\n\n**2. Look where you want to go:** Keep your eyes focused on the corner's apex, not on the brake markers or the track's edge. This will help you stay smooth and maintain a consistent line.\n\n**3. Use gentle, progressive braking:** Avoid slamming on the brakes, as this can cause weight transfer, reduce traction, and lead to understeer or oversteer. Instead, use gentle, progressive braking to slow down smoothly.\n\n**4. Brake in a straight line:** Try to brake in a straight line, rather than braking and turning at the same time. This will help you maintain stability and avoid upsetting the car.\n\n**5. Use threshold braking:** Threshold braking involves braking at the maximum rate possible without locking up the wheels. This takes practice, but it can help you reduce your lap times.\n\n**6. Practice, practice, practice:** The more you practice braking, the more comfortable you'll become with the sensation and the better you'll be able to judge your speed and braking points.\n\n**Specific tips for VIR's fast corners:**\n\n* For Turn 1 (T1), brake before the apex to set up for the long, sweeping corner. Use gentle, progressive braking to maintain speed and avoid understeer.\n* For Turn 3 (T3), brake before the crest of the hill to avoid losing speed and momentum. Use threshold braking to slow down quickly and maintain control.\n* For Turn 10 (T10), brake before the apex to set up for the fast, sweeping corner. Use gentle, progressive braking to maintain speed and avoid understeer.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Make sure your brakes are properly maintained, with fresh pads and decent brake fluid.\n* Use the correct brake bias for your car and driving style.\n* Practice braking with different levels of grip, such as in the wet or on different tire compounds.\n* Consider getting feedback from instructors or experienced drivers to help you improve your braking technique.\n\nRemember, braking is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient, stay focused, and keep working on your technique. With time and practice, you'll become a braking master!",
