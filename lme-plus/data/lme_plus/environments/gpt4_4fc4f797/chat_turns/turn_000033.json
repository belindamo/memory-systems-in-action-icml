The NHS is funded through taxes and provides a wide range of healthcare services, including:\n\n* Doctor's appointments (GP surgeries)\n* Hospital care\n* Prescriptions\n* Maternity care\n* Mental health services\n* Dental care (although some treatments may incur a fee)\n\n**Am I eligible for NHS care as an international student?**\n\nAs an international student, you may be eligible for NHS care, but it depends on your individual circumstances. You'll need to meet certain criteria, such as:\n\n1. Being enrolled on a course that's at least 6 months long\n2. Being a national of a country that has a reciprocal healthcare agreement with the UK (check with your home country's government website to see if they have an agreement)\n3. Having a valid visa that allows you to study in the UK\n\nIf you're eligible, you'll need to register with a local doctor (GP) to access NHS services.\n\n**How do I register with a local doctor (GP)?**\n\nTo register with a local doctor, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find a GP surgery:** Look for a GP surgery near your accommodation or university. You can search online using the NHS website ([www.nhs.uk](http://www.nhs.uk)) or ask your university's international student office for recommendations.\n2. **Check if the GP surgery is accepting new patients:** Before registering, ensure the GP surgery is accepting new patients. You can check their website, call them, or visit in person.\n3. **Gather required documents:** You'll need to provide:\n\t* Your passport\n\t* Your visa (if applicable)\n\t* Proof of address (e.g., a utility bill or tenancy agreement)\n\t* Your university ID or acceptance letter\n4. **Register at the GP surgery:** Take the required documents to the GP surgery and fill out a registration form. You may need to provide your NHS Number, which will be assigned to you after registration.\n5. **Wait for your registration to be processed:** The GP surgery will process your registration, which may take a few days. You'll receive a registration letter with your NHS Number and details about your GP practice.\n\n**What to expect from your GP:**\n\nOnce registered, you can book appointments with your GP for:\n\n* Routine check-ups\n* Illnesses or injuries\n* Prescriptions\n* Referrals to specialists (if needed)\n\nKeep in mind that you may need to pay for certain services, such as:\n\n* Prescriptions (\u00a39.35 per item, or \u00a329.10 for a 3-month prescription prepayment certificate)\n* Dental care (some treatments may incur a fee)\n* Optical care (some treatments may incur a fee)\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Register with a GP as soon as possible after arriving in the UK to ensure you have access to healthcare services.\n* Be honest about your medical history and any pre-existing conditions when registering.\n* If you have a medical condition, bring relevant medical records or documentation with you to the UK.\n\nI hope this helps!
