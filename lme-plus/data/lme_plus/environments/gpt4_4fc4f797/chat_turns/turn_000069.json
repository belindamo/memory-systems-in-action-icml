You can use a meditation app like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer to guide you.\n2. **Get ready (15 minutes)**: 7:45 am - 8:00 am\nTake a few minutes to wash your face, brush your teeth, and get dressed for the day.\n3. **Breakfast (30 minutes)**: 8:00 am - 8:30 am\nPrepare a healthy breakfast to fuel your body for the day ahead. You can make something quick and easy like oatmeal, scrambled eggs, or yogurt with fruits.\n4. **Short workout (20 minutes)**: 8:30 am - 8:50 am\nFit in a short workout to get your blood pumping and energy levels up. This could be a quick yoga routine, a 20-minute HIIT session, or a brisk walk/jog around the block.\n5. **Get ready to leave (10 minutes)**: 8:50 am - 9:00 am\nPack your bag, grab your lunch (if you haven't already), and head out the door to catch your commute to the office.\n\n**Tips to optimize your morning routine:**\n\n* Prepare everything you need the night before to save time in the morning. This includes laying out your clothes, packing your bag, and preparing your breakfast ingredients.\n* Keep your workout short and sweet to avoid feeling rushed. You can always do a longer workout during your lunch break or after work.\n* Be flexible with your routine. If you're not feeling up for meditation or a workout, swap them out with another activity that brings you joy, like reading or listening to music.\n* Leave some buffer time in case things take longer than expected. You don't want to feel stressed or rushed in the morning.\n\nFeel free to adjust this routine to suit your needs and preferences. Remember to prioritize self-care, and don't be too hard on yourself if you can't fit everything in.",
