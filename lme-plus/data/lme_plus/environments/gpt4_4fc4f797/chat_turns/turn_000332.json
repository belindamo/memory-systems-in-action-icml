  "content": "I like the ideas you provided. I think creating a dedicated notebook or digital document for each workshop is a great starting point. I'll definitely try to review my notes within 24-48 hours and identify the top 3-5 key takeaways from each workshop. Since I attended five workshops in the past three months, I might need to block out some dedicated time to review each one. Do you have any suggestions on how to prioritize which workshop to review first, or should I just start with the most recent one?",
