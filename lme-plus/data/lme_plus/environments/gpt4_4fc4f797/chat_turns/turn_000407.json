  "content": "I'm sorry, but there are no rooftop restaurants in Holborn as it is an area in Central London and does not have many tall buildings suitable for rooftop dining. However, there are many other areas across London which do have stunning rooftop views. Some restaurants in nearby areas which offer excellent views of the city include:\n\n1. Madison - A stylish rooftop bar and restaurant with panoramic views of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral and the London skyline.\n\n2. Aqua Shard - A stylish, contemporary restaurant located on the 31st floor of The Shard, offering sweeping views of the city.\n\n3. SUSHISAMBA - Located on the 38th and 39th floors of the Heron Tower, SUSHISAMBA has an outdoor terrace with views of the city.\n\n4. Coq d'Argent - A contemporary French restaurant with a rooftop garden and stunning views of London's skyline.\n\n5. Galvin at Windows - Located on the 28th floor of the London Hilton on Park Lane, this Michelin-starred restaurant provides panoramic views of the city.\n\nI hope this helps you find a restaurant with a great view!",
