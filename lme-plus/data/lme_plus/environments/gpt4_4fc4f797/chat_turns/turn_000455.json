  "content": "That's a great plan! Social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn are excellent ways to start searching for your classmates. Since you graduated in May 2012, you can try searching for people who were in your class year or shared similar interests. Remembering specific people you were close to or shared common interests with will help you narrow down your search.\n\nChecking your college's alumni directory is also a fantastic idea. Many colleges and universities have online directories that allow you to search for alumni by name, class year, or major. This can be a great way to find people who might not be active on social media or who you lost touch with over the years.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider the following:\n\n* Join your college's alumni group on Facebook or LinkedIn to connect with other graduates from your school.\n* Attend alumni events or reunions, if possible, to catch up with classmates in person.\n* Reach out to mutual friends or acquaintances who might be able to help you get in touch with people you're looking for.\n* Be patient and don't get discouraged if you don't find everyone right away. It may take some time to track down people, but it's worth the effort.\n\nRemember to respect people's privacy and boundaries when reaching out. If someone doesn't respond or doesn't want to reconnect, that's okay. Focus on the people who do respond and are interested in catching up.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you're able to reconnect with some of your old classmates!",
