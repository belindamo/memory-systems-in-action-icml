I like the idea of focusing on the ones that are both urgent and important, and then scheduling the ones that are important but not urgent. Since I've got a bunch of notes and insights scattered across different notebooks and documents, I'll also try to organize them in a way that makes sense for each category. Do you have any suggestions on how to organize my notes and insights in a way that makes it easy to review and reflect on them?",
