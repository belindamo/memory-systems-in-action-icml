Keep in mind that these suggestions are based on your interest in atmospheric, character-driven storytelling:\n\n**Drama:**\n\n1. **The Leftovers** (HBO): A thought-provoking, mysterious drama that explores the aftermath of a global event that vanishes 2% of the world's population. It's a slow-burning, emotionally charged show that delves into grief, trauma, and human connection.\n2. **This Is Us** (NBC): A family drama that masterfully weaves together multiple timelines, exploring themes of family, love, loss, and identity. It's a heartwarming, emotional rollercoaster with exceptional character development.\n3. **Big Little Lies** (HBO): A dark, atmospheric drama that follows a group of mothers and their families in a small coastal town. It's a gripping, character-driven exploration of relationships, secrets, and the complexities of human nature.\n4. **The Sinner** (USA Network): A crime drama that focuses on the why behind a crime, rather than the who. It's a slow-burning, atmospheric show that delves into the psychological motivations of its characters.\n\n**Comedy:**\n\n1. **Fleabag** (Amazon Prime): A critically acclaimed, dry-witted comedy that follows a complex, flawed protagonist as she navigates relationships, family, and trauma. It's a heartwarming, uncomfortable, and hilarious exploration of human relationships.\n2. **Schitt's Creek** (Netflix): A heartwarming, offbeat comedy that follows a wealthy family who loses everything and moves to a small town they purchased as a joke. It's a show about love, acceptance, and growth, with exceptional character development.\n3. **What We Do in the Shadows** (FX): A mockumentary-style sitcom that follows a group of vampires living in New York City. It's a hilarious, clever, and heartwarming exploration of the mundane aspects of immortal life.\n4. **Russian Doll** (Netflix): While you mentioned you're interested in this show, I'll include it here as well! It's a dark comedy-drama that explores the consequences of time loops, but it's also a deeply emotional and thought-provoking show.\n\nThese shows might not be directly related to sci-fi, but they all share some elements of atmospheric storytelling, complex characters, and emotional depth that you might appreciate. Take a chance, and you might discover a new favorite show!\n\nRemember, the key to exploring new genres is to start with shows that resonate with your interests and tastes.
