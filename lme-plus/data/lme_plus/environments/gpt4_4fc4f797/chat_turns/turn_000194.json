  "content": "found ways to work around them and have fun together.\n\nOver the course of the evening, Jack and Lucy went on a walk through the park, played a game of mini-golf, and stopped for ice cream at a local shop. They enjoyed each other's company and had a great time getting to know each other.\n\nAs the night wore on, Emily and Sarah checked in on them periodically, making sure that everything was going well. They were happy to see that Lucy was having a great time, and that Jack was being a kind and attentive partner.\n\nEventually, it was time for the date to come to an end. Emily and Sarah returned to pick up Lucy and bring her home, but not before Jack asked if he could see her again soon. Lucy eagerly agreed, and Emily and Sarah couldn't have been happier.\n\nFrom then on, Lucy and Jack continued to see each other, exploring new places and trying new things together. Despite the challenges that Lucy's flattened form presented, they found ways to make their relationship work and have fun together. And Emily and Sarah were thrilled to see their sister happy and having a great time.",
