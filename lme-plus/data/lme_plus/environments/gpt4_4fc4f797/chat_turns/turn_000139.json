Since the 25-45 age bracket represents 65% of all women, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(65% of all women) \u00d7 x = 80% of all women\n\n**Step 3: Solve for x**\n\nTo solve for x, we can convert the percentages to decimals and multiply:\n\n0.65 \u00d7 x = 0.80\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.65:\n\nx = 0.80 / 0.65\nx \u2248 1.23\n\nSince x cannot be greater than 1 (100%), we know that the proportion of women in the 25-45 age bracket who had at least one child is at least 100%. This means that all women in this age bracket had at least one child.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nBased on the calculations, we can conclude that 100% of the women in the 25-45 age bracket had at least one child. This suggests that family responsibilities might be a significant aspect of this demographic group.\n\nKeep in mind that this calculation assumes that the 80% of women with at least one child is a representative sample of all women, and that the 25-45 age bracket is a homogeneous group. If you have more data or context about the event, you may be able to refine your analysis further.\n\nI hope this helps you better understand the demographics of the charity event!",
