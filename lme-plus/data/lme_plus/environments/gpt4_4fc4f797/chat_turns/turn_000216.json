  "content": "To calculate the combined standard deviation, you can use the following formula, assuming that the measurements of the amount of liquid and the amount of alcohol are independent:\n\nCombined standard deviation = sqrt((SD1)^2 + (SD2)^2)\n\nwhere SD1 is the standard deviation of the measurements of the amount of liquid and SD2 is the standard deviation of the measurements of the amount of alcohol.\n\nFor example, if the standard deviation of the measurements of the amount of liquid is 2.24 grams and the standard deviation of the measurements of the amount of alcohol is 2.01 grams, then the combined standard deviation is:\n\nCombined standard deviation = sqrt((2.24)^2 + (2.01)^2) = 3.01 grams\n\nTherefore, the combined standard deviation is approximately 3.01 grams.",
