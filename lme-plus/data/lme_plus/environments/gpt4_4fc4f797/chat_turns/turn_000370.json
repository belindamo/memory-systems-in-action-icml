  "content": "I've been thinking about applying for a travel rewards credit card to earn points or miles for my upcoming Europe trip. Since I've been flying so frequently, I think it's time I start earning some rewards. I've got a good amount of points scattered across different airline and hotel loyalty programs, including 23,000 points on United, 15,000 on American Airlines, and 30,000 on Hilton Honors. Do you think I should focus on earning points with a specific airline or hotel chain, or go for a more general travel rewards credit card?",
