  "content": "I think these tips are really helpful! I especially like the hanger trick - it's a great way to see what I'm actually wearing and what's just taking up space. I'm also thinking about using the categorize and group method to see what I have and what I can get rid of. I have a lot of clothes that are similar, so I think grouping them together will help me see what I can let go of.\n\nI'm actually most looking forward to going through my tops and dresses. I feel like I have a lot of them, and I'm not sure what I really wear and what I don't. I'm also thinking about getting rid of some of my old college clothes - I know I'll never wear them again, and they're just taking up space.\n\nDo you have any tips on how to decide what to do with items that are still in good condition but don't fit me anymore? I feel bad about getting rid of them, but at the same time",
