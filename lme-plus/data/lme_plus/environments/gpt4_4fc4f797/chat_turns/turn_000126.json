I have a lot of clothes that I haven't worn in a while, and I think it's time to go through them and decide what to keep and what to donate. I also want to get my grey joggers altered - the hem is still a bit too long, and I've been meaning to take them to the tailor for weeks now. Do you have any tips on how to declutter my closet and decide what to keep and what to let go of?",
