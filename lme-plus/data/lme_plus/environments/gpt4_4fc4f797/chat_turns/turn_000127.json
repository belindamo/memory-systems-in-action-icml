Decluttering and curating your wardrobe can be a therapeutic experience, and it's amazing how it can boost your mood and confidence.\n\nDeciding what to keep and what to let go of can be challenging, but here are some tips to help you make those tough decisions:\n\n**1. Take everything out**: Start by taking everything out of your closet, including clothes, shoes, accessories, and storage containers. This will give you a clear view of what you have and help you decide what's worth keeping.\n\n**2. Categorize and group**: Group similar items together (e.g., all dresses, all tops, all pants). This will make it easier to see what you have and identify duplicates or items that don't fit well.\n\n**3. Ask yourself questions**: As you go through each item, ask yourself:\n\t* When was the last time I wore this?\n\t* Do I feel confident and comfortable in this item?\n\t* Is it in good condition, or is it worn out or damaged?\n\t* Does it fit me well, or is it too big or too small?\n\t* Is it suitable for my lifestyle and personal style?\n\t* Can I replace it if I need it again in the future?\n\n**4. Use the hanger trick**: Hang your clothes with the hangers facing the opposite direction. When you wear an item, hang it back up with the hanger facing the normal direction. After a few months, consider donating or discarding items that are still facing the opposite direction.\n\n**5. Consider the 80/20 rule**: This rule suggests that 80% of the time, you likely wear 20% of your clothes. Be honest with yourself \u2013 are there items in your closet that you wear regularly, and are there others that you haven't touched in months?\n\n**6. Keep items that spark joy**: This philosophy, popularized by Marie Kondo, suggests that you should only keep items that bring you joy or serve a purpose. If an item doesn't make you feel good or serve a functional purpose, consider letting it go.\n\n**7. Store out-of-season clothes**: Consider storing out-of-season clothes in separate containers or bins to free up space in your closet and reduce clutter.\n\n**8. Get items altered or repaired**: If you have items that need alterations, like your grey joggers, make a plan to get them fixed. This will help you enjoy the items more and make them feel like new again.\n\nRemember, decluttering your closet is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Be kind to yourself, and don't feel guilty about letting go of items that no longer serve you.\n\nHow do you feel about these tips? Are there any specific areas of your closet that you're most looking forward to tackling?",
