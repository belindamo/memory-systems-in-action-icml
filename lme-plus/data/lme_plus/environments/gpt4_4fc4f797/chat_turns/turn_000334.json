I've been wanting to explore my creative side more, and I remember really enjoying the writing exercises during the workshop. Since I attended five workshops in the past three months, I'm curious - do you have any suggestions on how to connect the dots between these workshops, or identify any common themes or patterns that emerged across them?",
