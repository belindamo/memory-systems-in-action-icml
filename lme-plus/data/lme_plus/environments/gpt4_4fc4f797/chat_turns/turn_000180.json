  "content": "I'm excited to include a section for author events and signings, as well as a section for quotes and passages that resonated with me. I think it would be great to have a visual element, like a photo of the author or a ticket stub, to commemorate the event. I also want to include a section for my personal reflections and thoughts on the book, as well as any connections I make to my own life or experiences.\n\nI'm thinking of using a physical notebook with a mix of writing and collage elements. I love the idea of making it visually appealing and personal. Do you have any tips on how to incorporate collage elements into my journal? Should I use glue, tape, or something else to attach the memorabilia?",
