Consider an air fryer with customizable settings for more flexibility.\n4. **Non-stick basket**: A non-stick basket can make food release and cleaning easier.\n5. **Noise level**: If you plan to use your air fryer during early morning or late evening hours, look for one with a lower noise level.\n6. **Additional features**: Some air fryers come with additional features like dehydrating, roasting, or grilling functions.\n\n**Popular air fryer options:**\n\n1. **Philips Airfryer**: A high-end option with advanced features like automatic stirring and a large capacity.\n2. **GoWISE USA Air Fryer**: A budget-friendly option with a compact design and digital touchscreen.\n3. **Black+Decker Air Fryer**: A mid-range option with a large capacity and simple, intuitive controls.\n4. **Ninja Air Fryer**: A popular option with a large capacity and advanced features like dehydrating and roasting functions.\n5. **Instant Pot Air Fryer**: A multi-functional air fryer that also works as a pressure cooker and slow cooker.\n\n**Tips for using an air fryer:**\n\n1. **Pat dry food**: Remove excess moisture from food to achieve crispiness.\n2. **Don't overcrowd**: Cook food in batches to ensure even cooking and crispiness.\n3. **Shake halfway**: Shake the basket halfway through cooking to ensure even cooking and crispiness.\n4. **Experiment with recipes**: Try different seasonings, marinades, and cooking times to find your favorite combinations.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision when choosing an air fryer!",
