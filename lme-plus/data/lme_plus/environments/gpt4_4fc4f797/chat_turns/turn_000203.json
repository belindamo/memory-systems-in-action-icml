Evelyn's story is just so captivating, and the way the author weaves together the different timelines and narratives is really impressive. I loved how the book explored the highs and lows of Evelyn's life, and how it touched on issues like identity, love, and the power of storytelling. It's definitely a book that's stuck with me long after I finished reading it.\n\nAnd actually, I haven't read any of Taylor Jenkins Reid's other works yet, but they're definitely on my radar now. I've heard great things about \"Maybe in Another Life\" and \"After I Do\", so I might have to add them to my reading list soon.\n\nSpeaking of which, do you have any recommendations for books that might be similar to \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\"? I'm always looking for more books that combine great storytelling with strong characters",
