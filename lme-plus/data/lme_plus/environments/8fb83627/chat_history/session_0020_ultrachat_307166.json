    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain how the scoring system works in gymnastics competitions!\n\nGymnastics competitions are judged based on the execution and difficulty of each routine. The scoring system used is called the Code of Points, which assigns each skill a value based on its difficulty. The more difficult a skill or combination of skills, the higher the assigned value. \n\nDuring a routine, gymnasts perform a series of skills on different apparatuses (e.g., floor, balance beam, vault). Each skill's difficulty level is multiplied by the gymnast's execution score (ranging from 0 to 10) to arrive at a total point value for the routine. \n\nThe execution score is determined by a panel of judges. Each judge evaluates the routine and assigns a score based on the following categories:\n\n- Artistry (e.g., body position, gracefulness)\n- Technique (e.g., form, control)\n- Difficulty (e.g., number of skills, connections)\n\nThe highest and lowest execution scores are dropped, and the remaining scores are averaged to determine the final execution score. \n\nIn addition to execution and difficulty, deductions are made for mistakes such as falls, wobbles, steps on landing, and other errors. These deductions are taken from the total point value of the routine.\n\nOverall, the Code of Points system aims to provide a fair and objective scoring system that values both the difficulty and execution of a gymnast's routine."
