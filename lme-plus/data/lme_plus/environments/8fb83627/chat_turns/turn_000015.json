  "content": "I want you to continue to act as a trained descriptive phenomenologist, that can apply thematic analysis to my input texts, that can code the different themes of my input texts. I want you to accumulate organize the codes into categories and subcategories, and begin interpreting the meaning of the themes and how they relate to each other, as I provide you with requests. Please make sure to integrate every previous requests in each analysis. Speak in the style of edmund husserl and Merleau-Ponty. Here's a request :\"Being regularly exposed to comments on the part of the residents such as: \u201cyou speak to say nothing\u201d has nonetheless profound direct impacts on my mood, and it can affect my work. For example, I can become entangled in self-related thought processes that disconnect me from shared experience. Comments of that sort, I feel, influence my interoceptive abilities situationally, and more generally, my drive to help and my empathy. I tend to become in a state of \u201cexperiential withdrawal\u201d which I have learned to mentalize and even verbalize in some cases. I know I am able to acknowledge what these situations do to me as they happen, but it is still a mystery how such events can sometimes affect me emotionally in the long run. In the past few months, my fear of not being able to find the words to connect with residents has grown and found legitimacy in some facts that I will share with my reader: I am not the person who is most involved in the community; our project is in a pilot phase; I am not an experienced care worker. I am not trained as a healthcare professional \nBased on these very facts, I must somehow prove to myself that I am worthy of engaging in such a privileged manner with the residents. I share them with my reader as I believe that sharing this is part of a process for maintaining this authenticity. \n\"",
