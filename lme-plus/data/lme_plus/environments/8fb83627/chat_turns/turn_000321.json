  "content": "Tofu is an excellent protein source, and with the right techniques, it can be incredibly delicious!\n\nCooking tofu can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you make it taste amazing:\n\n1. **Press and drain**: Remove excess liquid from the tofu by wrapping it in a clean dish towel or paper towels and pressing it between two plates. This helps the tofu absorb flavors better.\n2. **Marinate**: Marinate the tofu in your favorite seasonings, herbs, and spices for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This will help infuse flavor into the tofu.\n3. **Pan-fry or bake**: Pan-fry the tofu with a small amount of oil until golden brown and crispy on the outside, or bake it in the oven with some seasonings until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.\n4. **Add umami flavor**: Tofu can be a bit bland, but adding umami flavor with ingredients like soy sauce, miso paste, or mushroom-based sauces can make a huge difference.\n5. **Don't overcook**: Cook the tofu until it's lightly browned and still tender. Overcooking can make it dry and rubbery.\n6. **Add texture**: Mix cooked tofu with different textures like crunchy veggies, nuts, or seeds to add depth to your dishes.\n\nSome delicious meal prep recipes using tofu:\n\n* **Tofu stir-fry**: Marinate tofu in soy sauce, garlic, and ginger, then stir-fry with mixed veggies and serve over brown rice or quinoa.\n* **Tofu scramble**: Crumbling tofu into small pieces and cooking it with turmeric, paprika, and veggies creates a scrambled egg-like texture and flavor.\n* **Tofu curry**: Marinate tofu in a mixture of coconut milk, curry powder, and lime juice, then simmer in a flavorful curry sauce with veggies and serve over rice or with naan bread.\n* **Tofu skewers**: Marinate tofu in a mixture of soy sauce, maple syrup, and rice vinegar, then grill or bake with veggies and serve as a snack or add to salads.\n\nSome popular seasonings and marinades for tofu:\n\n* **Soy sauce and ginger**: A classic Asian-inspired flavor combination\n* **Lime juice and cumin**: Adds a bright, citrusy flavor with a hint of spice\n* **Italian seasoning and olive oil**: Gives tofu a herby, Mediterranean flavor\n* **Chili flakes and garlic**: Adds a spicy kick and savory flavor\n\nRemember, the key to making tofu taste great is to experiment with different seasonings, marinades, and cooking techniques.
