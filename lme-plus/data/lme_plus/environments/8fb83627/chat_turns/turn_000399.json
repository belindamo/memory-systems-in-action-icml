Here are some tips to help you find a good fit:\n\n1. **Identify your interests**: Think about what activities you enjoy or want to try. This could be anything from fitness classes, team sports, hiking, photography, book clubs, language exchange, or even board game groups. Make a list of your top interests.\n2. **Research online**:\n\t* Google search for gyms or clubs in your area that align with your interests.\n\t* Check out online platforms like Meetup.com, which offers various groups and activities.\n\t* Look for Facebook groups or local community pages related to your interests.\n3. **Check schedules and availability**:\n\t* Look at the gym or club's schedule to ensure it fits your availability. If you're only free on weekends, find a gym or club that offers activities during those times.\n\t* Check if they offer trial periods or guest passes to test the waters before committing.\n4. **Read reviews and ask around**:\n\t* Check online reviews on Google, Yelp, or Facebook to get an idea of the gym or club's reputation and atmosphere.\n\t* Ask friends, family, or colleagues if they know anyone who's a member or has experience with the gym or club.\n5. **Visit in person**:\n\t* If possible, visit the gym or club in person to get a feel for the atmosphere and facilities.\n\t* Introduce yourself to the staff or members and ask questions about their activities and community.\n6. **Consider costs and commitments**:\n\t* Look into membership fees, contract lengths, and any additional costs (e.g., equipment rental or class fees).\n\t* Think about your budget and whether you're comfortable with committing to a certain number of classes or sessions per month.\n\nRegarding your concern about not seeing your friends as often, it's common for social circles to shift as people's lives and priorities change. You might consider:\n\n1. **Reach out and schedule regular catch-ups**: Make an effort to regularly schedule coffee dates, walks, or other activities with your friends.\n2. **Plan a group outing**: Organize a group activity or outing that interests multiple friends, making it easier to get everyone together.\n3. **Join a social activity with friends**: Suggest trying a new activity or class together, which can help you bond and create new memories.\n\nRemember, it might take some time to find the right fit, but with persistence and an open mind, you can discover a gym or club that suits your interests and schedule, and even rekindle your friendships along the way!",
