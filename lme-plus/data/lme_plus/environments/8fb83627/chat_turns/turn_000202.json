I did notice it had a distinctive call, kind of a \"peter-peter-peter\" sound. Also, I've been getting out to the nearby nature reserve pretty regularly, at least twice a week, and I've seen some other birds there that I'm trying to identify too. Do you think you could help me with those as well?",
