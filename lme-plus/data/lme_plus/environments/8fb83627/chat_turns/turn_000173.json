  "content": "DNS Zone Transfer is a mechanism that allows a secondary DNS server to obtain a copy of the DNS database (or zone) from a primary DNS server. The zone contains information about the domain names and IP addresses of the hosts in a domain.\n\nIn a DNS zone transfer, the secondary server sends a request to the primary server for a copy of the zone. If the primary server is configured to allow zone transfers to the requesting IP address, it will respond with a copy of the zone. The secondary server then uses this information to answer DNS queries for the domain.\n\nZone transfers are an important part of DNS replication and redundancy, as they allow for multiple servers to hold a copy of the same information. However, they can also be used for reconnaissance and information gathering by an attacker. This is why many organizations restrict zone transfers to trusted IP addresses and take other measures to protect their DNS infrastructure.",
