  "content": "I've been thinking about trying to incorporate leading lines into my flower photography, especially after completing that online module on composition. I remember buying a new camera lens, a 50mm prime lens, about 6 weeks ago, and I've been experimenting with it ever since. I took it with me on a trip to Yosemite National Park 4 weeks ago and got some amazing shots of the valley floor and half dome. I was particularly proud of the sunset shot I got from Tunnel View, the golden light really brought out the details of the granite cliffs. Do you think I could use the lines of the flower stems or the edges of the petals to create leading lines in my macro shots?",
