They're extremely affordable and can be used in a variety of dishes. (~ $1-2 per can)\n2. **Eggs**: Eggs are an excellent source of protein and can be boiled, scrambled, or made into omelets. They're also very affordable and versatile. (~ $1.50-2.50 per dozen)\n3. **Canned Tuna**: Look for tuna packed in water or olive oil to avoid added salt and preservatives.
