I think I've been focusing too much on trying to catch up on everything we've missed, instead of just enjoying each other's company and having meaningful conversations. I'll definitely try to ask more open-ended questions and show genuine interest in what my friends are saying. Do you have any suggestions on how to stay in touch with my online friends, too? We've been chatting regularly, but I feel like we're not really getting to know each other beyond just talking about our daily lives and TV shows.",
