You could also consider a wine tasting, a hot air balloon ride, or a fun activity like rock climbing or indoor skydiving.\n3. **Subscription services**: A subscription to a streaming platform, a monthly book club, or a gourmet food delivery service (like a wine and cheese box) provides a gift that keeps on giving throughout the year.\n4. **Customized care packages**: Put together a basket or box filled with your friend or family member's favorite treats, teas, or self-care goodies. You could also create a themed package, like a cozy movie night or a spa day at home.\n5. **Handmade or artisanal goods**: Consider gifting something handmade, like a knitted scarf, a painting, or a piece of artisanal home decor.
