Here are some ideas to make it a standout part of the gift:\n\n**Movie ticket invitation:**\n\n1. **Design a movie ticket**: Create a custom movie ticket with the title of the movie, the \"showtime\" (i.e., \"Cozy Movie Night\"), and your friend's name. You could also add a fun tagline, like \"Starring [Friend's Name] in the lead role!\"\n2. **Attach it to the DVD**: Attach the movie ticket to the DVD case or wrap it around the DVD itself. This will make it look like a real movie ticket and add a fun touch to the gift.\n\n**Movie-themed packaging:**\n\n1. **Mini movie clapboard**: Create a mini clapboard with the title of the movie and the \"take\" number (e.g., \"Take 1: Cozy Movie Night\"). You could also add a fun message, like \"Action! Enjoy the show!\"\n2. **Film reel packaging**: Wrap the DVD in a paper or cardboard film reel, complete with a label that looks like a film canister. This will add a nostalgic and movie-like feel to the gift.\n\n**Special delivery:**\n\n1. **Movie delivery box**: Create a small box that looks like a movie delivery box, complete with a label that says \"Fragile: Movie Inside\" or \"Handle with Care: Cozy Movie Night.\"\n2. **Popcorn box**: Place the DVD in a popcorn box or a small container that looks like a popcorn bucket. This will add a fun and playful touch to the gift.\n\n**Personalized movie poster:**\n\n1. **Design a poster**: Create a custom movie poster with the title of the movie, your friend's name, and a fun tagline. You could also add a photo of the two of you or a inside joke to make it more personal.\n2. **Attach it to the package**: Attach the poster to the package or include it as a separate item. This will make the gift feel like a special, one-of-a-kind experience.\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and be creative!
