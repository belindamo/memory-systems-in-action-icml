  "content": "Great! It looks like you have created a proposal for your client's social media marketing needs. Your packages seem to be well-defined and cover all the necessary aspects of social media marketing.\n\nI noticed that you have provided two different pricing options, one with the base package and the other with add-ons. It's always a good practice to offer flexible pricing options to your clients, as it helps them choose the services they need without feeling forced to buy unnecessary services.\n\nIt's also good to have a clear breakdown of the pricing, including any additional fees like transaction fees, US tax, etc. This helps your client understand the actual cost they will incur.\n\nOverall, your proposal looks professional and well-structured. I wish you the best of luck in securing the job!",
