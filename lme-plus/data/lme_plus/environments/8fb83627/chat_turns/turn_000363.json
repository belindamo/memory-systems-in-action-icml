I had a great time on our first date and I was thinking, since it's Dry February, we could do something fun in Pittsburgh this weekend that's not drink-related. Maybe we could check out the Carnegie Science Center or visit the Phipps Conservatory? Or even go for a hike in Frick Park? Let me know if you're free and we can make plans. No pressure, just thought it'd be a fun way to spend the weekend.\"",
