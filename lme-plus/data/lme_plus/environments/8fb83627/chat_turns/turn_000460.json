As a digital AI assistant, I don't have personal travel plans or experiences, but I can certainly provide information and advice on booking travel insurance.\n\nYou're right, though - travel insurance can be a valuable investment, especially for frequent travelers or those embarking on international trips. It can provide financial protection against unforeseen events like trip cancellations, medical emergencies, or travel disruptions.\n\nWhen considering travel insurance, it's essential to research and compare policies to find one that suits your specific needs and travel plans. Some factors to consider include:\n\n1. **Coverage:** What's included in the policy? Does it cover trip cancellations, medical emergencies, travel delays, or baggage loss?\n2. **Destination:** Are you traveling to a high-risk area or engaging in adventure activities that may require additional coverage?\n3. **Duration:** How long will you be traveling, and does the policy cover the entire duration of your trip?\n4. **Pre-existing conditions:** Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that may affect your coverage?\n5. **Cost:** What's the premium, and are there any discounts available?\n\nThere are many travel insurance providers to choose from, including companies like Allianz, AXA, and TravelGuard. You can also check with your credit card issuer or travel agent to see if they offer any travel insurance options.\n\nRemember to carefully review the policy terms and conditions before making a purchase, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you're unsure about any aspect of the coverage.\n\nI hope that helps! Do you have any other questions about travel insurance or planning your trip to Europe?",
