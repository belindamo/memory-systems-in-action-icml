  "content": "That's great to hear that you've started making healthier and more budget-friendly choices! I'm happy to help you with some recommendations, but I need a bit more information from you.\n\nCould you please share your workplace location or the nearby neighborhoods? That way, I can provide you with more tailored suggestions for salad bars and food trucks in your area.\n\nAdditionally, do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free) that I should keep in mind while making recommendations?\n\nLastly, kudos to you for taking control of your finances and diet! Packing your own lunch and exploring affordable options can make a significant difference in the long run.",
