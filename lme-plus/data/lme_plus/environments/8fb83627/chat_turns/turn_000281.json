Blurring the background can be a bit tricky, but it's usually a combination of factors, not just the autofocus or distance alone. Let's break it down:\n\n**Autofocus:** Autofocus can affect the background blur, but it's not the primary culprit. If your camera's autofocus is accurate and you're focusing on your subject's eyes, it should be sharp. However, if the autofocus is struggling or hunting, it might affect the overall image quality, including the background blur.\n\n**Distance between subject and background:** This is a significant factor in creating a blurred background. The farther away the background is from your subject, the more it will blur. This is because the depth of field decreases as the distance between the subject and background increases.\n\n**Other factors that affect background blur:**\n\n1. **Focal length:** A longer focal length (e.g., 85mm or 135mm) will generally produce a more pronounced background blur compared to a shorter focal length (e.g., 35mm or 50mm). This is because longer focal lengths compress the perspective, making the background appear closer to the subject.\n2. **Aperture:** As I mentioned earlier, a lower f-stop value (e.g., f/1.8) will result in a shallower depth of field, which means a more blurred background.\n3. **Sensor size:** A full-frame sensor will generally produce a more blurred background compared to a crop sensor or micro four-thirds sensor. This is because full-frame sensors have a larger sensor size, which allows for a shallower depth of field.\n4. **Background texture and color:** A busy or high-contrast background can make it harder to blur. If the background has a lot of texture or bold colors, it might still be distracting even with a wide aperture.\n\n**Tips to improve background blur:**\n\n1. **Increase the distance:** Move your subject away from the background as much as possible.\n2. **Use a longer focal length:** If possible, switch to a longer focal length lens (e.g., 85mm or 135mm) to increase the compression and blur.\n3. **Open up the aperture:** Try shooting at a lower f-stop value (e.g., f/1.8 or f/2.2) to create a shallower depth of field.\n4. **Use a prime lens:** Prime lenses tend to have a more pronounced background blur compared to zoom lenses.\n5. **Pay attention to background texture and color:** Try to find a background with a simple texture and muted colors to make it easier to blur.\n6. **Experiment with angles:** Shooting from a slightly low or high angle can help separate your subject from the background and create a more blurred background.\n\nRemember, it's all about experimentation and finding the right combination of factors to achieve the desired background blur. Keep practicing, and you'll get there!",
