By switching to calming content before bed, you'll help your brain wind down and prepare for a restful night's sleep.\n\nRemember, consistency is key. Try to stick to your 11 pm bedtime goal and establish a calming pre-sleep routine that works for you. This might include activities like:\n\n1. **Winding down with a book**: Listen to a calming audiobook, read a physical book, or enjoy some relaxing music.\n2. **Meditation or deep breathing**: Practice gentle stretches, meditation, or deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and body.\n3. **A warm bath or shower**: Soak in a warm bath or take a relaxing shower to help your muscles relax and unwind.\n4. **Dim lighting and cozy atmosphere**: Create a calming atmosphere by dimming the lights, lighting candles, or using a white noise machine.\n5. **Avoiding screens**: Try to avoid screens (like phones, tablets, or laptops) for at least 30 minutes before bed, as the blue light can interfere with your sleep.\n\nBy establishing a consistent bedtime routine, you'll signal to your brain that it's time to sleep, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.\n\nRemember, it might take some time to adjust to your new routine, so be patient and flexible. Don't hesitate to experiment with different calming activities and find what works best for you.\n\nSweet dreams!",
