The soundtrack, featuring indie and folk music, perfectly complements the game's tone and atmosphere.\n\n**Episode Structure**: Each episode is a self-contained story, but they're all connected by the overarching narrative. You'll play through each episode in a relatively linear fashion, with some opportunities to explore and make choices that affect the story.\n\n**Awards and Accolades**: Life is Strange has received widespread critical acclaim, winning several awards, including the BAFTA for Best Story and the Golden Joystick for Best Narrative.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that focuses on storytelling, characters, and player choice, Life is Strange is an excellent choice.
