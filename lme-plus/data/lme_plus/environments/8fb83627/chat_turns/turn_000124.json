Here's a brief overview:\n\n**What is the Magna Carta?**\n\nThe Magna Carta (Latin for \"Great Charter\") is a medieval charter that was signed by King John of England on June 15, 1215. It's a 63-clause document that established the principle that the king was not above the law and protected the rights of the nobility and the church.\n\n**Why is the Magna Carta significant?**\n\nThe Magna Carta is considered a cornerstone of liberty and democracy because it:\n\n1. **Limited the power of the monarch**: For the first time, the king's power was limited by a written document, establishing the idea that even the king was subject to the law.\n2. **Protected individual rights**: The Magna Carta guaranteed certain rights to individuals, such as the right to a fair trial, the right to life, and the right to own property.\n3. **Established the rule of law**: The Magna Carta introduced the concept of the rule of law, where the law applies equally to all, including the king and the nobility.\n4. **Influenced future documents**: The Magna Carta influenced the development of many other important documents, including the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n**Salisbury Cathedral's connection to the Magna Carta**\n\nSalisbury Cathedral is one of the few places where you can see an original copy of the Magna Carta. The cathedral's chapter house, where the document is housed, is a beautiful example of medieval architecture. The Magna Carta is displayed in a special exhibition, along with other artifacts and interactive displays that tell its story.\n\nDuring your visit to Salisbury Cathedral, you'll have the opportunity to see the Magna Carta up close and learn more about its history and significance. It's a truly unique experience that will give you a deeper understanding of the document's importance in shaping the course of human history.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll find the Magna Carta exhibit fascinating!",
