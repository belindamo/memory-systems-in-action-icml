Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Typical vaccinations for baby goats:**\n\n1. **CDT (Clostridium perfringens type C and D, and tetanus):** This is a core vaccination for goats, and it's usually given at 2-3 weeks of age, with a booster 2-3 weeks later.\n2. **Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida):** This vaccine is often given at 2-3 months of age, with a booster 2-3 weeks later. It helps protect against pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.\n3. **Other vaccinations:** Depending on your region, your vet may recommend additional vaccinations, such as those for diseases like Coccidiosis, Giardiasis, or Leptospirosis.\n\n**Specific health concerns for baby goats:**\n\n1. **Neonatal care:** Ensure Luna and Leo receive adequate colostrum (first milk) from their mother or a high-quality colostrum supplement within the first few hours of life. This helps protect them from infections and provides essential nutrients.\n2. **Scours (diarrhea):** Baby goats are prone to scours, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Monitor their stool quality, and consult your vet if you notice any signs of scours.\n3. **Pneumonia:** Respiratory issues are common in baby goats. Keep an eye out for signs like coughing, rapid breathing, or nasal discharge, and seek veterinary attention if you notice any of these symptoms.\n4. **Hypothermia:** Baby goats can quickly become hypothermic, especially in cold or wet conditions. Ensure they have a warm, dry place to sleep, and monitor their body temperature regularly.\n5. **Parasite control:** Regularly check for external parasites like ticks, lice, and mites, and internal parasites like worms. Consult your vet for guidance on parasite control and treatment.\n6. **Nutritional deficiencies:** Ensure Luna and Leo receive a balanced diet, including adequate milk or milk replacer, and a high-quality starter feed. Monitor their growth and development, and consult your vet if you notice any signs of nutritional deficiencies.\n7. **Umbilical cord care:** Keep the umbilical cord clean and dry to prevent infection. Apply an antibacterial ointment or iodine solution to the cord stump daily.\n8. **Disbudding/dehorning:** If you plan to disbud or dehorn Luna and Leo, consult with your vet to determine the best time and method for this procedure.\n\n**Regular health checks:**\n\nSchedule regular health checks with your vet to monitor Luna and Leo's development, address any health concerns, and stay on top of vaccinations and parasite control.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your veterinarian to determine the best vaccination and health care plan for your baby goats. They can provide personalized guidance based on your region, climate, and specific circumstances.",
