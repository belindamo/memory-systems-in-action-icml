Dig Inn and Sweetgreen are both great options for salads.\n\nNow, about keeping your meals fresh and avoiding dryness when reheating:\n\n1. **Cooling and storage**: Cool your cooked meals to room temperature before refrigerating or freezing. This helps prevent bacterial growth and keeps your meals fresh for longer. Store them in airtight, shallow containers to prevent moisture from accumulating.\n2. **Portion control and packaging**: Divide your meals into individual portions and store them in separate containers. This ensures that each meal is reheated only once, preventing moisture loss and dryness. Use airtight containers or freezer bags to maintain freshness.\n3. **Reheating techniques**: When reheating, use a low to medium heat to prevent overheating, which can dry out your meals. You can also add a splash of water or broth to help maintain moisture. For example, when reheating rice or grains, add a tablespoon or two of water and cover the container with a microwave-safe lid or plastic wrap.\n4. **Moisture-rich ingredients**: Incorporate moisture-rich ingredients like vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your meals. These will help maintain moisture levels during reheating.\n5. **Freezer-friendly meals**: When freezing meals, choose ingredients that freeze well, such as soups, stews, or casseroles. These tend to retain their moisture and texture better than other dishes.\n6. **Reheat and refresh**: When reheating, add some fresh ingredients to give your meal a boost of flavor and moisture. This could be a squeeze of lemon juice, a sprinkle of fresh herbs, or a dollop of yogurt or salsa.\n\nSome specific reheating tips for common meal prep dishes:\n\n* **Rice and grains**: Reheat with a splash of water or broth, and fluff with a fork to restore texture.\n* **Proteins**: Reheat in a sauce or with a splash of broth to maintain moisture.\n* **Vegetables**: Reheat with a splash of water or steam to preserve texture and nutrients.\n* **Soups and stews**: Reheat gently, adding water or broth as needed to maintain consistency.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your meal prep creations throughout the week without sacrificing flavor or texture.\n\nDo you have any favorite meal prep recipes or ingredients you'd like to share? I'd love to hear about them!",
