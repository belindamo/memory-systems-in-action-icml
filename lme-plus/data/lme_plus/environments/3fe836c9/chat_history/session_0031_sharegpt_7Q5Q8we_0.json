      "content": "The psychological principle you are referring to is called the \"Labor Illusion.\" It suggests that people may perceive a task or a software tool as being more valuable or effective if it takes longer to complete the task, giving the impression that more effort or work is being put into it. This illusion can be used to make users feel that the tool is working harder or producing better results, even if the actual output or efficiency remains the same."

      "content": "While it is difficult to determine the specific intentions behind software design choices, one example of a photo editing tool that may leverage the labor illusion is Prisma. Prisma is an app that uses artificial intelligence to apply artistic filters to photos, transforming them into paintings or drawings in various styles. When using Prisma, you might notice a progress bar, as well as a \"creating artwork\" message while the app processes your photo. This delay, combined with the message, could give users the impression that the app is working diligently to create a high-quality, unique piece of art from their image. Although the app might be able to apply filters more quickly, the labor illusion could contribute to the perception of better quality and greater value.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is just one example and may not represent the intentions of Prisma's developers. Additionally, other photo editing tools may incorporate similar design elements without necessarily leveraging the labor illusion principle."
