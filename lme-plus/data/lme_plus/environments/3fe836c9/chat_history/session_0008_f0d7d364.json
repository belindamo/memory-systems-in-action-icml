      "content": "Spooky season is just around the corner! Universal Studios Florida's Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) is a highly popular event that takes place on select nights from mid-September to early November. It's a separately ticketed event, meaning you'll need to purchase a ticket specifically for HHN, which is not included with regular park admission.\n\nHere's what you can expect from this year's Halloween Horror Nights:\n\n**Dates:** Typically, HHN runs on select nights from mid-September to early November. The exact dates vary from year to year, but you can check the Universal Orlando website for the most up-to-date information.\n\n**Haunted Houses:** The main attraction of HHN is the haunted houses, also known as \"mazes.\" These are highly themed, extremely detailed, and often feature iconic horror franchises or original creations. You can expect 5-7 houses each year, with some featuring live actors, special effects, and intense scares.\n\n**Scare Zones:** Throughout the park, you'll find designated \"scare zones\" where roaming hordes of scareactors will attempt to frighten and entertain you. These areas are usually themed to match the haunted houses and add to the overall immersive experience.\n\n**Shows and Entertainment:** HHN often features live shows, including a nightly show on the Universal Studios Florida lagoon and other performances throughout the park.\n\n**Ticket Options:** You can purchase a single-night ticket or consider an upgrade to a multi-night ticket or an Express Pass, which grants you priority entry to haunted houses and attractions.\n\n**Tips and Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Plan ahead:** Buy your tickets early, as prices tend to increase closer to the event dates.\n2. **Arrive early:** Get to the park before the event starts to beat the crowds and make the most of your night.\n3. **Dress code:** Wear comfortable clothing and shoes, as you'll be doing a lot of walking and potentially waiting in lines.\n4. **Bring a friend:** It's more fun with a buddy, and you can help each other through the scares!\n5. **Consider a behind-the-scenes tour:** If you want to learn more about the creation of the haunted houses and scare zones, look into booking a guided tour.\n6. **Take breaks:** HHN can be overwhelming, so be sure to take breaks to grab a snack, rest your feet, or step outside for some fresh air.\n\n**Important Note:** Halloween Horror Nights is a mature event, recommended for guests 13 years and older. The event features intense scares, graphic content, and may not be suitable for younger children.\n\nNow that you know what to expect, are you ready to face your fears and experience the terror of Halloween Horror Nights?"
