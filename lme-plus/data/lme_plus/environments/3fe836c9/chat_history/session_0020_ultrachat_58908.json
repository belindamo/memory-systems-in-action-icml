Diversity and inclusion start at the top, so researching the diversity of a company's leadership team can give insight into its culture.\n\n4. Check the company's diversity metrics. Some companies release diversity reports, which provide information about their employee composition by race, gender, and other demographics. These reports can be found on the company's website or through a Google search.\n\n5. Reach out to employees or alumni. Connecting with current or former employees can provide valuable insights into a company's culture and commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\nUltimately, it's important for job seekers to find a company that aligns with their own values and priorities."
