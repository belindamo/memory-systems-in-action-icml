  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot say for certain whether there are sales or discounts for tourists in Graz. However, some shops in Graz offer tax-free shopping or VAT refunds for non-EU tourists, which can save you some money on your purchases. You will have to ask the retailer whether they offer this option, and they might require you to show your passport and provide your address outside the EU. \n\nAdditionally, some shops offer discounts and promotions throughout the year, especially during the holiday season, after major holidays, and during sales seasons like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It\u2019s always a good idea to check with the shops you\u2019re interested in purchasing from to see if they offer any discounts or promotions for tourists. Finally, many tourist information offices have discount booklets or tourist cards that may offer discounts on shopping and other activities in the city.",
