However, here's the answer to your question:\n\nThe train crew usually determines whether or not to allow additional passengers on board based on several factors. These include:\n\n1. Safety concerns: The train crew must ensure that passengers can board and exit the train safely. If the train is already at capacity, adding more passengers may create a safety hazard.\n\n2. Availability of seats: Even if there is standing room available on the train, the crew may not allow additional passengers on board if there are no seats available. This is because standing on a moving train can be dangerous, especially during sudden stops or turns.\n\n3. Scheduled stops: The crew may also consider how far the train is from its next scheduled stop. If the train is close to its destination or the next station, the crew may not allow additional passengers on board to avoid overcrowding at the next stop.\n\n4. Passenger requests: In some cases, the crew may allow additional passengers onboard if they are able to accommodate the extra passengers safely and if the passengers are able to make the necessary arrangements with their fellow travellers.\n\nUltimately, the decision to allow additional passengers on board is up to the discretion of the train crew.",
