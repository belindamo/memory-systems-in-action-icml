  "content": "Roasting sweet potatoes is a fantastic way to bring out their natural sweetness and add depth of flavor to your breakfast burritos. Here's a simple recipe to roast sweet potatoes:\n\n**Roasting Sweet Potatoes:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n2. Scrub the sweet potatoes clean and dry them with a paper towel.\n3. Poke some holes in the sweet potatoes with a fork to allow steam to escape.\n4. Rub the sweet potatoes with a little bit of oil and sprinkle with salt.\n5. Place the sweet potatoes directly on the middle rack of the oven.\n6. Roast the sweet potatoes for 45-60 minutes, or until they're tender when pierced with a fork.\n7. Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and let them cool.\n\nTo dice the roasted sweet potatoes for the burrito, follow these steps:\n\n**Dicing Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**\n\n1. Once the sweet potatoes have cooled, peel them using a spoon or your hands.\n2. Place the peeled sweet potatoes on a cutting board and dice them into small cubes, about 1/2 inch (1 cm) in size.\n3. Try to make the dice as uniform as possible so that they cook evenly in the burrito.\n\nTips:\n\n* You can roast sweet potatoes ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze them for up to 2 months.\n* To speed up the roasting process, you can cut the sweet potatoes into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes before roasting. This will reduce the cooking time to about 20-30 minutes.\n* If you're short on time, you can also use canned sweet potatoes or cooked, mashed sweet potatoes as a substitute.\n\nNow that you have your roasted sweet potatoes, you can add them to your Veggie Delight breakfast burrito along with scrambled eggs, black beans, saut\u00e9ed spinach and bell peppers, and shredded cheese (if using). Simply assemble the burrito, fold it up, and freeze it for a quick and easy breakfast on-the-go!",
