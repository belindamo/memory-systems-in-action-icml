  "content": "The Berghoff is a great choice for a quick and delicious breakfast sandwich and coffee. Their breakfast sandwich is a great way to start your day, and it's a more manageable option before a flight. You can't go wrong with a classic combo like scrambled eggs, sausage, and cheese on a bun.\n\nAnd don't worry, you can always come back to try their famous Chicago-style hot dog another time. It's a must-try when you're in Chicago, but it's definitely a more substantial meal.\n\nIf you have time, take a stroll around the terminal and enjoy the atmosphere before your flight. And don't forget to grab a reusable water bottle and fill it up before you board \u2013 staying hydrated is key during flights!\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you enjoy your breakfast sandwich and coffee at The Berghoff!",
