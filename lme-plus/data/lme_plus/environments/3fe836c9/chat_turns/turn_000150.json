Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Immediate Action**\n\n1. **Act fast**: The sooner you treat the stain, the better. Coffee stains can set over time, making them harder to remove.\n2. **Blot, don't rub**: Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove excess coffee. Avoid rubbing, as this can push the stain deeper into the fabric.\n3. **Rinse with cold water**: Run cold water over the back of the stain to flush out as much of the coffee as possible.\n\n**Removal Methods**\n\n1. **White vinegar and water**: Mix 1 part white vinegar with 2 parts water. Soak the stained area in the solution for about an hour. Then, rinse the blouse with cold water and check if the stain is still visible.\n2. **Baking soda and water**: Make a paste by mixing 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of cold water. Apply the paste to the stain and let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour. Rinse with cold water and check the stain.\n3. **Hydrogen peroxide**: Apply hydrogen peroxide directly to the stain, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, and then rinse with cold water.\n4. **Stain remover or laundry detergent**: Apply a stain remover like OxiClean or Shout, or a laundry detergent specifically designed for removing tough stains. Follow the product's instructions and test a small area first.\n5. **Enzyme-based stain remover**: If the stain is still present, try using an enzyme-based stain remover like Biz or OxiClean Versatile Stain Remover. These products contain enzymes that break down protein-based stains like coffee.\n\n**Laundry**\n\n1. **Wash in cold water**: Wash the blouse in cold water using a mild laundry detergent.\n2. **Soak if necessary**: If the stain is still visible after washing, try soaking the blouse in cold water with a laundry detergent specifically designed for removing tough stains.\n3. **Check before drying**: Before putting the blouse in the dryer, check to make sure the stain is completely gone. If it's still visible, repeat the removal process or try a different method.\n\n**Tips and Precautions**\n\n* Always test a small, inconspicuous area of the blouse before applying any removal methods to ensure the solution doesn't damage the fabric.\n* Avoid using hot water, as it can set the stain or damage the fabric.\n* Don't use bleach, as it can damage or discolor certain fabrics.\n* If the stain is particularly stubborn, you may need to repeat the removal process several times before it's completely gone.\n\nI hope these tips help you remove the coffee stain from your white blouse! If the stain is still persisting, you might consider taking it to a professional cleaner for further assistance.",
