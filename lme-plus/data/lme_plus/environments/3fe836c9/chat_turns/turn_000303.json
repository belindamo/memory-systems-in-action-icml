By the way, speaking of salsa events, I recently attended a salsa social event at my local dance studio on March 17th, and it was a blast. I met some fellow dancers who share my passion for the genre, and we danced to some amazing tracks. Do you have any tips on how to improve my salsa dancing skills, especially when it comes to leading and following?",
