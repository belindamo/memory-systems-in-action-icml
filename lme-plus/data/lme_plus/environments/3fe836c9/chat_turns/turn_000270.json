However, I can provide an answer to your question based on my programming.\n\nIn general, train crews cannot simply create extra space to accommodate additional passengers on board. Train cars have a specific capacity limit that is set for safety reasons. Overcrowding a train car can create a dangerous situation in the event of an emergency, such as a sudden stop or accident.\n\nMoreover, different jurisdictions have regulations that specify the maximum number of passengers that can be transported in a given train car. These regulations often take into account factors such as the number of doors and the size of the train car.\n\nTherefore, while the train crew may exercise some discretion when it comes to allowing additional passengers on board, they must also adhere to established safety regulations and policies in order to ensure the safety of all passengers.",
