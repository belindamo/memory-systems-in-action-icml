  "content": "Yes, one example of a novel that explores race and social class through its setting is \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The novel is set in the Roaring Twenties in the wealthy neighborhoods of Long Island, New York, where the social elite spend their days and nights indulging in lavish parties and extravagant lifestyles.\n\nThe setting of the novel allows Fitzgerald to explore the stark differences between the wealthy upper class and the working-class individuals who live in the nearby city. He highlights the extravagant wealth of characters like Jay Gatsby and Tom and Daisy Buchanan while contrasting it with the poverty and struggles of characters like George Wilson and Myrtle Wilson.\n\nIn addition, the novel also explores race through the character of Tom Buchanan, who reveals his racist attitudes towards Black individuals during a scene in which he reads a book about the \"racial superiority\" of white people.\n\nOverall, the setting of \"The Great Gatsby\" allows Fitzgerald to examine the disparities between different social classes and to uncover the prejudices and biases present in the society of the time.",
