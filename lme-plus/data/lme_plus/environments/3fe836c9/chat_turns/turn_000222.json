  "content": "Basil is a wonderful addition to any garden, and it pairs perfectly with tomatoes.\n\nWhen planting basil seeds, here are some general guidelines to follow:\n\n1. **Depth**: Plant basil seeds about 1/8 inch (3-4 mm) deep in well-draining soil. You can also start basil seeds indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost date in your area and then transplant them outside when the weather warms up.\n2. **Spacing**: Plant basil seeds about 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) apart. As they grow, you can thin them out to about 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) apart to allow for good air circulation and sunlight penetration.\n3. **Soil temperature**: Basil prefers warm soil, so wait until the soil has warmed up to at least 60\u00b0F (15\u00b0C) before planting. You can check the soil temperature by inserting a thermometer or by waiting until the danger of frost has passed.\n4. **Lighting**: Basil loves full sun to partial shade, so choose a location that receives at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day.\n5. **Watering**: Keep the soil consistently moist during the first few weeks after planting. Once established, basil is relatively drought-tolerant, but it will still appreciate regular watering.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Basil is a warm-season crop, so it does best in temperatures between 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C) and 85\u00b0F (29\u00b0C).\n* Pinch off flower buds as they form to encourage bushy growth and prevent the plant from going to seed.\n* Fertilize basil regularly with a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy growth and flavor.\n* Harvest individual leaves or stems as needed, or pinch off the top sets of leaves to encourage branching.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to grow delicious and fragrant basil to complement your tomatoes and other companion plants!\n\nHappy planting, and I hope you enjoy your basil harvest!",
