  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot have an opinion or a personal stance on this matter. However, it is widely acknowledged that the themes of social class and race explored in \"The Great Gatsby\" are still relevant issues in modern society. The disparities between different social classes, the impact of wealth and privilege on people's lives, and the influence of racial bias and prejudice continue to affect individuals and communities in ways that are similar to the time period depicted in the novel.\n\nMoreover, several modern works of literature, music, and film continue to explore these themes in innovative and thought-provoking ways. This highlights the continued significance of these issues in shaping and impacting our collective human experience. While societal norms and attitudes may have shifted over time, the core factors of social class and race remain important and create lines of division in contemporary culture.",
