  "content": "Yes, there are many other animals that scientists use to monitor environmental health. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Birds: Birds are often used to monitor air and water quality, as they can accumulate pollutants in their feathers, tissues, and eggs. Scientists use bird populations as indicators to track changes in environmental conditions.\n\n2. Fish: Fish are sensitive to changes in water quality and can show signs of stress or disease when conditions are not optimal. Researchers use fish to monitor water pollution, habitat degradation, and the effects of climate change.\n\n3. Insects: Insects, such as bees and butterflies, are important pollinators and can indicate the health of ecosystems. Scientists use insect populations to monitor changes in plant diversity, pesticide use, and climate change.\n\n4. Amphibians: Amphibians, such as frogs and salamanders, are sensitive to changes in water quality and habitat loss. Scientists use amphibians to monitor environmental health, as they can be indicators of changes in wetland ecosystems.\n\nOverall, animals can serve as valuable indicators of environmental health, and scientists use them to track changes in ecosystems over time.",
