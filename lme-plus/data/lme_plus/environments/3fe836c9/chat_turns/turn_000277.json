  "content": "I'll definitely consider those factors. Speaking of watches, I also have a vintage 1960s Omega Seamaster that I inherited from my grandfather, which I got appraised last month and found out it's worth around $5,000. I've been thinking of getting it serviced and authenticated by Omega themselves, but I haven't had the time to do so. Do you know if there are any recommended service centers or authenticators for vintage watches like mine?",
