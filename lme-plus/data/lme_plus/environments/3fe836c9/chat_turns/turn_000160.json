  "content": "Congratulations on your new home!\n\nBudgeting for home maintenance is a wise decision. The general rule of thumb is to set aside 1% to 3% of your home's value annually for maintenance and repairs. Based on your sale price, that would be:\n\n* 1% of $325,000 = $3,250 per year\n* 2% of $325,000 = $6,500 per year\n* 3% of $325,000 = $9,750 per year\n\nThis amount can cover routine maintenance, repairs, and replacements for various systems and components in your home. Here are some common expenses to consider:\n\n1. Plumbing: Leaks, pipe replacements, and fixture repairs ($500-$2,000 per year)\n2. HVAC: Filter replacements, maintenance, and repairs ($500-$2,000 per year)\n3. Roofing: Inspections, repairs, and replacements ($500-$5,000 per year)\n4. Electrical: Outlet and switch replacements, circuit breaker repairs ($500-$2,000 per year)\n5. Pest control and termite inspections ($100-$500 per year)\n6. Appliance maintenance and replacements (e.g., water heater, furnace, AC unit)\n7. Gutters and downspout cleaning and repairs ($100-$500 per year)\n8. Lawn and landscaping maintenance (mowing, trimming, fertilization, etc.)\n9. Painting and interior maintenance (e.g., drywall repairs, caulk replacement)\n10. Miscellaneous repairs (e.g., leaky faucets, toilet issues, door and window repairs)\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and your actual costs may vary depending on the age, condition, and location of your home. It's always better to err on the side of caution and overestimate your maintenance costs, especially in the first few years of homeownership.\n\nAs you settle into your new home, be sure to:\n\n* Inspect your home regularly to identify potential issues before they become major problems.\n* Keep a record of maintenance and repairs to track your expenses and plan for future costs.\n* Consider setting aside a portion of your budget for unexpected expenses, like a sudden need for a new furnace or roof repair.\n\nEnjoy your new home, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns!",
