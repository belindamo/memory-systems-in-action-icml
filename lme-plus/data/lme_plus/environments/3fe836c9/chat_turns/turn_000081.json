  "content": "A possible movie poster for \"(500) Days of Summer\" could feature a split-screen design. On one side, there could be a picture of Tom (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) looking happy and in love with Summer (played by Zooey Deschanel). On the other side, there could be a picture of Tom looking sad and alone, with Summer absent from the frame. The two sides could be separated by a jagged line, symbolizing the nonlinear narrative of the movie. The background of the poster could be a muted blue color, representing the emotions and mood of the film. The tagline could read, \"Love is not a fairy tale,\" emphasizing the realistic and raw portrayal of love in the movie.",
