For the nest, I can use a combination of wire and hot glue to attach the twigs and leaves together, and then attach it to the bird's body using wire or hot glue. I'll also experiment with adding some texture to the fabric using fabric paint or markers. Do you have any suggestions on how to add some movement or dynamic feel to the bird's wings or tail?",
