You can also sow them on the surface and rake them in lightly.\n2. **Spacing**: Plant nasturtium seeds about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) apart. As they grow, you can thin them out to about 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) apart to allow for good air circulation and sunlight penetration.\n3. **Soil temperature**: Nasturtiums prefer cooler soil, so you can plant them as soon as the soil can be worked in the spring. Wait until the soil has reached around 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) to 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C) before planting.\n4. **Lighting**: Nasturtiums love full sun to partial shade, so choose a location that receives at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day.\n5. **Watering**: Keep the soil consistently moist during the first few weeks after planting. Once established, nasturtiums are relatively drought-tolerant, but they'll still appreciate regular watering.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Nasturtiums have a long taproot, so make sure to loosen the soil to a depth of about 12 inches (30 cm) to allow for proper root growth.\n* Nasturtiums are natural repellents for aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that can harm cucumbers, so plant them around the perimeter of your cucumber bed for added protection.\n* Nasturtiums come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, red, and cream, so choose a color that complements your garden's theme.\n* Nasturtiums are annuals, so they'll need to be replanted every year. You can also let them self-seed, but be aware that they can spread quickly and become invasive in some areas.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to grow vibrant and pest-repelling nasturtiums around your cucumbers!\n\nHappy planting, and I hope you enjoy the benefits of companion planting!",
