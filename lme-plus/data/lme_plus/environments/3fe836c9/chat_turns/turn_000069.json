  "content": "Universal Studios Florida's Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) does have some rules and restrictions in place for costumes, especially when it comes to masks and props. While these rules might change from year to year, here are some general guidelines to help you prepare:\n\n**Costume Guidelines:**\n\n1. **No Masks:** Generally, HHN prohibits masks that cover the entire face, including full-face masks, helmets, or anything that obstructs the face. This is a safety measure to ensure that guests can be easily identified and to prevent any potential security issues. However, some exceptions might be made for costumes that require a partial mask, such as a character's nose or mouth.\n2. **Props:** Props are usually allowed, but they must be safe and not pose a risk to others. No weapons, sharp objects, or anything that could be used as a projectile are permitted. This includes fake guns, swords, knives, or any other item that could be mistaken for a real weapon.\n3. **Size and Obstruction:** Costumes should not be so large or obstructive that they impede the flow of foot traffic or block walkways. You should be able to move freely and comfortably through the park without causing any issues.\n4. **Inappropriate Content:** HHN has a policy of no nudity, profanity, or offensive content. Costumes should be family-friendly and respectful of others.\n5. **Costume Height:** Costumes should not exceed 7 feet in height to ensure clearance in haunted houses and other areas of the park.\n\n**Guest Costume Contest Rules:**\n\n1. **Registration:** Typically, guests must register for the costume contest in advance, either online or at the park on the day of the event. Registration might include providing contact information and a brief description of your costume.\n2. **Categories:** The costume contest might have specific categories, such as \"Best Solo Costume,\" \"Best Group Costume,\" \"Best Scary Costume,\" or \"Best Creative Costume.\" Make sure to check the rules for the specific categories and judging criteria.\n3. **Judging Criteria:** Judges will evaluate costumes based on creativity, originality, craftsmanship, and overall presentation. They might also consider how well the costume fits the theme of HHN.\n4. **Prizes:** Prizes for the costume contest can vary, but past winners have received awards such as cash, Universal Orlando resort stays, or even a chance to be a scareactor for a night.\n\n**Tips and Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Check the Official HHN Website:** For the most up-to-date information on costume guidelines and contest rules, visit the official Halloween Horror Nights website or the Universal Orlando website.\n2. **Plan Ahead:** Design and prepare your costume well in advance to ensure it meets the guidelines and is comfortable to wear for an extended period.\n3. **Be Creative:** Don't be afraid to think outside the box and create a unique, original costume that showcases your creativity and skills.\n\nBy following these guidelines and rules, you'll be well on your way to creating an amazing costume and potentially winning a prize at the guest costume contest!",
