  "content": "As an AI language model, I can say that train capacity limits are established for safety reasons and are based on the regulations set by various authorities. Overcrowding a train can be dangerous and create risks for passengers in the event of an emergency.\n\nTrains are designed to handle a specific number of passengers safely and efficiently. While it may seem inflexible, the capacity limit ensures that all passengers can travel comfortably and safely. If the train crew were to allow more passengers on board, it could create an uncomfortable and unsafe experience for everyone on the train, including passengers and employees.\n\nFurthermore, increasing the capacity beyond what was established or allowing more passengers than the train can accommodate would violate safety policies and regulations. It could also create issues in terms of operational and logistical concerns, as such, it is essential to plan ahead and purchase tickets in advance to ensure a seamless and smooth travel experience.\n\nOverall, while it may be frustrating for passengers who are turned away when a train is at its capacity, safety must be the top priority for all passengers and employees on board.",
