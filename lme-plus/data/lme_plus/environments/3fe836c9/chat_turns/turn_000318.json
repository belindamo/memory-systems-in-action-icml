Both The Story Graph and Leafmarks are great options for that.\n\nRegarding your reading goal, finishing a book every two weeks is a reasonable goal, but it ultimately depends on your reading speed, schedule, and personal preferences. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Reading speed**: If you're a fast reader, you might be able to finish a book in a week or less. If you're a slower reader, two weeks might be a more realistic goal.\n* **Book length**: Are you reading novellas, graphic novels, or epic fantasy tomes? The length of the books you're reading can greatly impact your reading pace.\n* **Schedule**: Do you have a consistent block of time dedicated to reading each day or week? If you have a busy schedule, you might need to adjust your goal to accommodate your availability.\n* **Personal preferences**: Are you someone who likes to savor books and take their time, or do you prefer to devour them quickly? Consider your reading style and what works best for you.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to set a goal that's challenging yet achievable. If you're new to setting reading goals, you might want to start with a more conservative goal and adjust as needed.\n\nHere are some alternative goals you could consider:\n\n* **Page count**: Instead of focusing on finishing a book every two weeks, aim to read a certain number of pages per day or week.\n* **Time commitment**: Commit to reading for a certain amount of time each day or week, regardless of how many pages you finish.\n* **Book variety**: Focus on reading a certain number of books from different genres, authors, or topics within a set timeframe.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to set a goal that makes you happy and motivates you to keep reading!",
