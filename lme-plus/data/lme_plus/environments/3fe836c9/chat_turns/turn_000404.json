  "content": "Avoiding PMI can save you hundreds of dollars per year, and making a larger down payment is a great way to do so.\n\nTo avoid PMI on a conventional loan, you'll typically need to put down at least 20% of the purchase price. Based on a $350,000 loan, that would mean:\n\n* 20% of $350,000 = $70,000 down payment\n\nThis would leave you with a loan amount of:\n\n* $350,000 - $70,000 = $280,000\n\nBy putting down 20%, you'll avoid PMI and qualify for better loan terms, including lower interest rates and lower monthly payments.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of how your monthly payments might look without PMI:\n\n* Loan amount: $280,000\n* Interest rate: 4% (assuming a similar rate to before)\n* Loan term: 30 years\n\n**Monthly Payment:** approximately $1,337.41\n\nThis is a significant reduction from the original estimate of $1,664.41. By putting down 20%, you'll save around $327 per month, which can add up to thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll still need to factor in property taxes and insurance, which will add to your monthly costs. However, avoiding PMI can provide significant long-term savings.\n\nSome things to consider when deciding on a down payment:\n\n* Do you have enough savings for a 20% down payment, or will you need to explore other options?\n* Will you need to tap into other savings or investments to make a larger down payment?\n* How will a larger down payment affect your cash flow and emergency fund?\n\nIt's essential to weigh the pros and cons of making a larger down payment and consider your overall financial situation before making a decision.\n\nI hope this helps you make a more informed decision about your down payment!",
