The city has undergone significant economic growth over the past century driven by its rich resources, mainly gold mining, forestry and pulp and paper production, and tourism.\n\nTimmins experienced a massive growth boom in the late 1920s when gold was discovered in the area, which led to the opening of several new mines. As a result, the population of the city grew from around 6,000 in the early 1920s to over 40,000 by the late 1930s.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the city's economy diversified, and new industries emerged, including forestry and pulp and paper production. The city's extensive forests provided a significant resource for these industries, which helped boost the economy. The city also saw expansion in retail, service, and transportation industries.\n\nIn recent years, Timmins has seen a decline in its traditional resource-based industries. However, the city has diversified its economy, including the establishment of a mining supply and services sector and a growing tourism industry. The city also continues to attract new businesses and investment, which has helped drive economic growth.\n\nOverall, Timmins has undergone significant economic growth over the past century and continues to see growth and diversification in various industries, including mining, forestry, tourism, and service sectors."
