I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to recall previous conversations or maintain a context outside of our current chat. I'm a fresh start with each new message!\n\nSince this is the beginning of our conversation, I didn't have a previous conversation with anyone named John, and I don't have any information about a model show in the city. If you could provide more context or details about the model show you're interested in, I'd be happy to try and help you find the information you're looking for!\n\nIf you're looking for information about model shows or events in your area, you might want to try searching online for \"model shows near me\" or \"model events in [your city/state]\" to find relevant results. You can also try checking with local hobby shops, modeling clubs, or online forums to see if they have any information about upcoming events.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",
