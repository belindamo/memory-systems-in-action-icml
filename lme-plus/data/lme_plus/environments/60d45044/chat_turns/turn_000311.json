It aims to protect the personal data and privacy rights of individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR applies to organizations operating within the EU/EEA, as well as those outside the region if they offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals within the EU/EEA.\n\nKey principles of the GDPR include:\n\n1. Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently.\n2. Purpose limitation: Data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.\n3. Data minimization: Data collected should be relevant, limited, and adequate to the purpose for which it is collected.\n4. Accuracy: Personal data must be accurate and, when necessary, kept up to date.\n5. Storage limitation: Personal data should be kept only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.\n6. Integrity and confidentiality: Data must be processed securely, ensuring protection against unauthorized access, disclosure, and destruction.\n7. Accountability: Organizations must demonstrate their compliance with the GDPR principles.\n\nThe GDPR also grants individuals several rights, including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, object to processing, and data portability. Non-compliance with the GDPR can result in significant fines, with maximum penalties reaching up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of a company's global annual turnover, whichever is higher.",
