Use a small amount of salt, about 1/4 teaspoon per onigiri.\n4. **Keep them away from air:** Air can cause onigiri to dry out, so make sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and store them in an airtight container.\n5. **Store them in the refrigerator:** The refrigerator will help to keep the onigiri cool and fresh.\n6. **Consume within 3-5 days:** Onigiri are best consumed within 3-5 days of making them. If you don't plan to eat them within that timeframe, consider freezing them.\n7. **Freeze them:** If you don't plan to eat the onigiri within 3-5 days, consider freezing them. Frozen onigiri can be stored for up to 2-3 months.\n8. **Refrigerate at the right temperature:** Make sure your refrigerator is set at a consistent temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) to prevent bacterial growth and keep the onigiri fresh.\n\nBy following these tips, you can enjoy your onigiri for a longer period and keep them fresh and delicious!\n\nI hope that helps!
