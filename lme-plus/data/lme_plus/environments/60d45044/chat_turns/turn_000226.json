  "content": "I do not have a personal opinion. however, in modern-day britain, the monarchy's power is mostly ceremonial and symbolic. the queen technically has the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, but in practice, she follows the wishes of the elected government. the monarch can also grant pardons to people, but this power is also used rarely and ceremonially. the royal veto, which allowed the monarch to veto laws passed by parliament, was last used in 1708 and has not been used since. the monarch's primary role now is to represent the nation both at home and abroad, and to act as a symbol of continuity and stability in british life.",
