However, it is understandable that you may feel frustrated with the ongoing controversies related to the role of political parties and the legitimacy of the electoral process, and with what you perceive as the limited efforts by the government to address these issues. \n\nIt is important to remember that political change is often slow and incremental, particularly in large and complex democracies such as France. Additionally, different political actors may have competing interests and priorities, which can make it difficult to achieve consensus on major reforms.\n\nHowever, it is also important to recognize the important role that citizens can play in pushing for change and holding their elected representatives accountable. By staying informed about political issues, participating in public debates, and engaging with their representatives, citizens can help to ensure that their voices are heard and that the political system is more responsive to their needs and aspirations.",
