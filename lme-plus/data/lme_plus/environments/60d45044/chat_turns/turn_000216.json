  "content": "It's understandable to feel that way. Filmmakers have a responsibility to represent the time period they're depicting with accuracy and respect to those who endured it. While awards are certainly an important part of the filmmaking industry, using the historical context solely as a means to achieve critical acclaim can come off as exploitative or insincere. It's critical to remember that the events depicted in historical films have real-life consequences, and the people who lived through them deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. It's up to the filmmakers to approach the subject matter with sensitivity and honesty, and to devote themselves to creating a story that honors the real-life events and people that inspired it. When filmmakers fail to do so, it can be disrespectful to the individuals they are attempting to honor and can diminish the impact of the story they are trying to tell.",
