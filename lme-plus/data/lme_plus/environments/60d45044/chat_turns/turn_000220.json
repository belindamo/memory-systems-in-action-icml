  "content": "While the use of historical events in films can have drawbacks, it's essential to remember that filmmakers have different perspectives and approaches to storytelling. Some filmmakers may feel that using a historical context in their films is an artistic and meaningful way to convey important messages and educate the audience. However, it's crucial for filmmakers to approach the topic with care and respect, and to do their research to represent the historical events accurately. If done thoughtfully, the use of a historical event or context can add depth and meaning to a story and generate empathy and understanding in audiences. However, it's understandable that some people may feel that filmmakers use historical events as a gimmick or prop for their films, and it's important to voice those opinions and hold filmmakers accountable for their choices.",
