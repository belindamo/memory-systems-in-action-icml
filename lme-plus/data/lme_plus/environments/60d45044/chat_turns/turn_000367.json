However, it is worth noting that the French government has taken some steps in recent years to promote greater transparency and accountability in public affairs. For example, in 2013, the government passed a law requiring political parties to disclose the sources and amounts of all donations greater than 10,000 euros ($11,576). Additionally, in 2017, the government unveiled a package of electoral reforms aimed at enhancing the transparency and fairness of the electoral process. These reforms included measures such as stricter rules on campaign finance, greater transparency in party financing, and the introduction of electronic voting machines in polling stations.\n\nHowever, there are still concerns among some citizens and political commentators that these measures do not go far enough to address the root causes of the ongoing controversies related to the role of political parties and the legitimacy of the electoral process. Some critics argue that more fundamental reforms are needed to ensure that the French political system is truly democratic and responsive to the needs and interests of all citizens. These debates are ongoing, and it remains to be seen what actions the Chamber of Deputies and the broader French government will take in response to these concerns.",
