Olivaw is a robot, specifically a humanoid robot, who plays an important role in Asimov's Robot and Empire series. He is a central character in several of the Robot novels, including \"The Caves of Steel,\" \"The Naked Sun,\" and \"Robots and Empire.\"\n\nOlivaw is unique among robots in that he was created to be capable of feeling emotions and is equipped with a \"positronic brain\" that allows him to reason and think much like a human. He is loyal to his human partner, Elijah Baley, and helps him solve numerous crimes and mysteries throughout the Robot series. Olivaw also has a significant impact on the larger history of Asimov's universe, including playing a role in the formation of the Galactic Empire and the development of the laws of robotics.",
