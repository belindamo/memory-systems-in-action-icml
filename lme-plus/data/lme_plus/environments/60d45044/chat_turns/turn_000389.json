I'd be happy to help you find a sturdy tripod that can support your gear.\n\nWhen choosing a tripod, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Weight capacity**: Look for a tripod that can hold at least 1.5 to 2 times the weight of your camera and lens combined.\n2. **Material**: Aluminum or carbon fiber tripods are popular choices. Carbon fiber tripods are lighter and more expensive, while aluminum tripods are more affordable and durable.\n3. **Leg type**: There are two main types: twist-lock and flip-lock. Twist-lock legs are more common and easier to use, while flip-lock legs are more secure and less prone to accidental opening.\n4. **Head type**: You'll need a tripod head that can support your camera's weight and provides smooth pan and tilt movements. Ballheads and panheads are popular choices.\n5. **Height and adjustability**: Consider a tripod that can extend to a comfortable height for you and has adjustable leg angles for shooting on uneven terrain.\n\nBased on these factors, here are some tripod recommendations:\n\n**Budget-friendly options:**\n\n1. **Manfrotto BeFree Live**: A compact, lightweight tripod that can hold up to 15.4 lbs (7 kg).
