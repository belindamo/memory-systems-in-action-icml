Here are some tips on planting marigolds with your tomatoes:\n\n**Why marigolds?**\n\nMarigolds (Tagetes spp.) contain a chemical called alpha-terthienyl, which has natural nematicidal properties, helping to repel and kill nematodes. This makes them an excellent companion plant for tomatoes, which are often susceptible to nematode damage.\n\n**Planting marigolds with tomatoes:**\n\n1. **Choose a variety**: Opt for French marigolds (Tagetes patula) or African marigolds (Tagetes erecta), which are both effective against nematodes.\n2. **Sow marigold seeds**: Directly sow marigold seeds around 1-2 inches deep and 6-12 inches apart, about 2-3 weeks before planting your tomatoes.\n3. **Plant marigolds around the perimeter**: Plant marigolds around the perimeter of your tomato bed, about 6-12 inches away from the tomato plants. This will help create a barrier against nematodes.\n4. **Interplant marigolds**: You can also interplant marigolds among your tomatoes, but make sure to leave enough space (about 12-18 inches) between the two plants.\n\n**How many marigolds to plant:**\n\nA general rule of thumb is to plant 3-5 marigold plants per 10 square feet of tomato bed. This will provide a sufficient amount of nematode-repelling chemicals to help protect your tomatoes.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Companion planting benefits**: Marigolds also attract beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewings, which prey on pests that target tomatoes.\n2. **Marigold growth**: Marigolds can grow quite tall (up to 3 feet). You can trim them back to encourage bushy growth and prevent them from shading your tomatoes.\n3. **Marigold lifespan**: Marigolds are annuals and typically last for one growing season. You'll need to replant them every year to maintain their nematode-repelling benefits.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to create a nematode-deterring marigold barrier around your tomatoes. Happy planting!",
