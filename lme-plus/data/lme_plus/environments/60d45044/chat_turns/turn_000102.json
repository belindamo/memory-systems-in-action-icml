  "content": "I'm planning to drive along the Pacific Coast Highway in California, and I'm thinking of starting from San Francisco and ending in San Diego. I've got about 5 days for the trip. I'm interested in scenic coastal routes, beaches, and maybe some wine country stops. I've had some great experiences with hotels and condos in the past, like the time I stopped overnight at a hotel in Flagstaff, Arizona, and then spent three nights at a beachfront condo in La Jolla.",
