  "content": "Here are some quotes from The Giver that illustrate the differences between Jonas's view of himself and the committee's view of him in chapters 7-8:\n\nJonas's view of himself:\n\n1. \"He felt such love for Asher and for his parents. But he knew that even if he begged for his own release, it wouldn't matter. The decision was not his.\" (Chapter 7)\n\nThis quote shows that Jonas is beginning to realize that he is different from his peers, and that he has no control over his own fate. He is feeling emotions that no one else seems to feel, and he is starting to question the rules and traditions that govern their lives.\n\n2. \"It's just that... without the memories it's all meaningless.\" (Chapter 8)\n\nThis quote shows that Jonas is starting to see the limitations of his society. He is realizing that without the memories of the past, life is dull and unfulfilling. He is beginning to question the wisdom of a society that denies its citizens access to knowledge and experience.\n\nThe committee's view of Jonas:\n\n1. \"He has shown us all that he has the potential to become a Receiver. And he has been given an unprecedented level of trust.\" (Chapter 7)\n\nThis quote shows that the committee sees Jonas as a model citizen who is excelling in his training. They are impressed with his intelligence and his ability to grasp complex concepts quickly.\n\n2. \"He has the potential to become one of our most respected leaders.\" (Chapter 7)\n\nThis quote shows that the committee sees Jonas as someone who will go on to do great things for the community and uphold its values and traditions. They see him as a potential leader who will maintain the status quo.\n\n3. \"We have given you a great honor, Jonas.\" (Chapter 8)\n\nThis quote shows that the committee sees Jonas's training as a privilege and an honor. They view him as someone who has been entrusted with a great responsibility, and they expect him to use his knowledge and skills to serve the community.",
