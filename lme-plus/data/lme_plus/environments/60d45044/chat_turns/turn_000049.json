I'm an AI, I don't have personal preferences or taste buds, but I'm always happy to provide information and suggestions to help you explore new snack options!\n\nHowever, I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to try new nuts and seeds! Mixing and matching different types is a great way to create a trail mix that suits your taste preferences, and roasting them can definitely enhance their flavor and texture.\n\nRemember, nuts and seeds are a nutritious snack option, rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber. They can help curb hunger, support heart health, and even provide a boost of energy. So, go ahead and get creative with your snack choices \u2013 your body (and taste buds) will thank you!",
