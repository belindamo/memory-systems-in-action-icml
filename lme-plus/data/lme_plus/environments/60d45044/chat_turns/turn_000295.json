Here are some tips to help keep them away from your tomato plants:\n\n**Physical barriers:**\n\n1. **Copper tape**: Slugs and snails don't like to cross over copper, so place copper tape around the base of your tomato plants or on the soil surface.\n2. **Crushed eggshells**: Slugs and snails don't like to crawl over rough surfaces, so sprinkle crushed eggshells around your plants.\n3. **Sharp gravel**: Similar to eggshells, sharp gravel can deter slugs and snails from reaching your plants.\n\n**Traps:**\n\n1. **Beer traps**: Place a small amount of beer in a shallow container and bury it in the soil near your tomato plants. Slugs and snails are attracted to the yeast and will fall in and drown.\n2. **Yeast and sugar traps**: Mix yeast and sugar with water to create a trap. Slugs and snails are attracted to the mixture and will get trapped in the container.\n\n**Repellents:**\n\n1. **Garlic spray**: Mix crushed garlic with water and spray it around your tomato plants. Slugs and snails don't like the smell of garlic.\n2. **Coffee grounds**: Slugs and snails don't like the caffeine in coffee grounds, so sprinkle them around your plants.\n3. **Hot pepper spray**: Mix hot peppers with water and spray it around your tomato plants. The capsaicin in hot peppers will deter slugs and snails.\n\n**Companion planting:**\n\n1. **Marigolds**: Plant marigolds around your tomato plants. Marigolds repel nematodes, which can attract slugs and snails.\n2. **Chives**: Plant chives around your tomato plants. Chives are said to repel aphids and other pests, including slugs and snails.\n\n**Other methods:**\n\n1. **Hand-picking**: Go out at night with a flashlight and pick off any slugs and snails you find.\n2. **Traps with bait**: Use commercial slug and snail traps with bait like lettuce or cabbage leaves.\n3. **Organic baits**: Use organic baits like iron phosphate-based pellets or powder to kill slugs and snails.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be consistent and persistent in your efforts to keep slugs and snails away from your tomato plants. Good luck!",
