Six weeks is a good amount of time to get a sense of the market and find the right fit.\n\nAttending open houses and viewing properties in your desired neighborhoods is a great way to get a feel for the area and see different types of homes. You must have seen some interesting properties and met some real estate agents along the way!\n\nWhat's been your favorite part of the home search process so far? Have you found any properties that have really stood out to you, or are you still waiting for that perfect match?\n\nAlso, what are your top priorities in a home?
