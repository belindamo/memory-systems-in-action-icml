  "content": "Storing Vallejo paints properly is crucial to maintaining their quality, consistency, and shelf life. Here are some tips to help you store your Vallejo paints and prevent them from drying out or getting contaminated:\n\n1. **Store them upright**: Keep the paint bottles upright to prevent the paint from coming into contact with the cap or lid, which can cause them to dry out.\n2. **Tighten the caps**: Make sure the caps are tightly closed after use to prevent air from entering the bottle and causing the paint to dry out.\n3. **Store in a cool, dry place**: Avoid storing Vallejo paints in direct sunlight, near a heat source, or in areas with high humidity. Ideal storage temperatures range from 60\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (15\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C).\n4. **Use a paint storage box or case**: Invest in a paint storage box or case specifically designed for Vallejo paints. These cases usually have individual compartments and a secure closure system to prevent the paints from getting mixed up or contaminated.\n5. **Keep them away from chemicals**: Store Vallejo paints away from chemicals, cleaning products, or other substances that could contaminate the paints or affect their performance.\n6. **Clean the caps and surrounding area**: Regularly clean the caps and surrounding area with a soft brush or cloth to remove any dried paint or debris that could contaminate the paints.\n7. **Use a desiccant packet**: Consider placing a desiccant packet (like silica gel) near your paint storage to absorb any excess moisture and maintain a dry environment.\n8. **Label and organize**: Label each paint bottle with its corresponding color and date of purchase. Organize your paints by color, type, or frequency of use to ensure easy access and minimize the risk of contamination.\n9. **Check on them regularly**: Periodically inspect your paints for signs of drying out, such as thickening, skinning, or mold. If you notice any issues, it's best to discard the affected paint.\n10. **Use a paint saver**: Vallejo offers a product called Vallejo Paint Saver, which is a gel-like substance that you can add to the paint bottle to prevent it from drying out. This is especially useful for paints that you don't use frequently.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you can help maintain the quality and consistency of your Vallejo paints, ensuring they remain fresh and ready to use for your next project.\n\nRemember, it's essential to handle and store your paints with care to prevent contamination and extend their shelf life. Happy painting!",
