If you're using regular rice, try adding a small amount of rice vinegar to help it hold its shape.\n2. **Prepare the rice:** Cool the cooked rice to room temperature. This will help it hold its shape better. If the rice is too hot, it will be too sticky and difficult to shape.\n3. **Use the right amount of rice:** Use about 1/2 cup of cooked rice for each onigiri. This will give you a good balance between size and shape.\n4. **Moisten your hands:** Dampen your hands with water to prevent the rice from sticking to them.\n5. **Shape the onigiri:**\n\t* Hold a small handful of rice in your palm and gently shape it into a triangle.\n\t* Apply gentle pressure to the rice, starting from the center and working your way outwards.\n\t* Use your thumbs to shape the corners and edges of the triangle.\n\t* Make sure the rice is evenly distributed and the edges are crisp.\n6. **Tuck in the filling:** Place your chosen filling (e.g., salmon, tuna, pickled plum) in the center of the triangle and gently fold the rice over it.\n7. **Press and shape:** Press the onigiri gently to flatten the bottom and shape the top into a triangle.\n8. **Repeat and refine:** Continue shaping and refining the onigiri until you're happy with the shape.\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n\n* Using too much rice, which can make the onigiri too large and difficult to shape.\n* Applying too much pressure, which can cause the rice to crack or break.\n* Not moistening your hands, which can cause the rice to stick to them.\n* Not shaping the onigiri gently, which can cause them to become misshapen.\n\n**Practice Makes Perfect:**\nDon't be discouraged if your first few onigiri don't turn out perfectly. With practice, you'll develop the technique and get a feel for the right amount of pressure and shaping required.\n\nI hope these tips help you create beautiful and delicious onigiri!",
