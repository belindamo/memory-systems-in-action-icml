  "content": "Leiden is considered to be a relatively expensive city to live in compared to other cities in the Netherlands. The cost of living, including housing, transportation, groceries, and other daily expenses, is higher in Leiden than in many other Dutch cities. However, it is still less expensive than Amsterdam, which is known for its high cost of living.\n\nThe cost of housing in Leiden is particularly high due to the city's popularity with students and expats. Renting a one-bedroom apartment in the city center can cost around \u20ac1,200 per month, while a similar apartment outside the center can cost around \u20ac900 per month.\n\nTransportation costs in Leiden are relatively low compared to other Dutch cities, with a monthly public transport pass costing around \u20ac95. Groceries and other daily expenses are also generally affordable in Leiden.\n\nOverall, while Leiden is considered a more expensive city to live in, it is still more affordable than many other popular Dutch cities like Amsterdam, Utrecht, and The Hague.",
