  "content": "I understand your frustration. It can be disappointing when filmmakers rely solely on the historical context to make their movies seem more important without putting in the effort to create a well-crafted story. However, it's essential to note that the historical context of a film can provide a rich backdrop that enhances the story's depth and meaning. When done correctly, it can be a powerful tool that creates a sense of urgency and authenticity that would be impossible to achieve otherwise. It's up to the filmmaker to find the right balance between the historical context and the narrative's fictional elements. When done with care and respect, it can help the audience feel a personal connection to the story and better understand the events that inspired it.",
