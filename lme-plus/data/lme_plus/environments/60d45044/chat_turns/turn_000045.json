Oatmeal raisin with nuts is a classic combination, but I'm more than happy to suggest some healthier cookie options and flavor combinations for you to try:\n\n**Healthier Cookie Options:**\n\n1. **Coconut Sugar Cookies**: Replace refined sugar with coconut sugar, which has a lower glycemic index and fewer calories.\n2. **Almond Flour Cookies**: Use almond flour instead of all-purpose flour to reduce carbohydrates and increase protein content.\n3. **Oat Flour Cookies**: Oat flour is higher in fiber and protein compared to all-purpose flour, making it a great alternative.\n4. **Coconut Oil Cookies**: Replace butter with coconut oil, which is higher in healthy fats and has antimicrobial properties.\n5. **Egg-Free Cookies**: Use flaxseed or chia seeds as egg replacers to reduce cholesterol and add omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n**Flavor Combinations:**\n\n1. **Cranberry White Chocolate Chip**: Dried cranberries and white chocolate chips create a sweet and tangy combination.\n2. **Peanut Butter Banana**: Mash ripe bananas and mix with peanut butter for a creamy and indulgent flavor.\n3. **Dark Chocolate Cherry**: Dark chocolate chips and dried cherries create a rich and fruity combination.\n4. **Pumpkin Spice**: Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, and nutmeg for a seasonal and warm flavor.\n5. **Lemon Rosemary**: Brighten up your cookies with lemon zest and chopped rosemary for a refreshing and herby flavor.\n6. **Nutella Espresso**: Add instant espresso powder and Nutella for a mocha-flavored cookie.\n7. **Cinnamon Apple**: Mix in diced apples and cinnamon for a sweet and autumnal flavor.\n8. **Maple Pecan**: Use pure maple syrup and chopped pecans for a sweet and nutty combination.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n1. **Add-ins**: Experiment with different nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, etc.), seeds (chia, flax, etc.), or dried fruits (cranberries, apricots, etc.) to add texture and flavor.\n2. **Spices**: Try adding different spices like cardamom, ginger, or cloves to create unique flavor profiles.\n3. **Grain-free**: Use almond flour or coconut flour to create grain-free cookies.\n4. **Vegan options**: Replace eggs with flaxseed or chia seeds, and use vegan-friendly alternatives like coconut oil or almond milk.\n\nFeel free to experiment with these healthier cookie options and flavor combinations to create your perfect treat!",
