Since you remember the date of the event, you can also try searching online for \"Sarah Lee author events January 10th\" or \"Sarah Lee book reading January 10th\" to see if any relevant results come up.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try searching for Sarah Lee's official website, social media profiles, or author pages on platforms like Goodreads or Amazon. Sometimes, authors will post updates about their upcoming events, tours, or new releases on their official channels.\n\nIf you're still unable to find information about Sarah Lee or her upcoming events, you might consider reaching out to the library directly and asking if they have any information about her schedule or if they can provide more details about the event you attended. They might be able to provide you with more information or point you in the right direction.\n\nRemember to also try to recall any other details about the book or the event that might help you identify the title or find similar authors. Good luck, and I hope you're able to find the information you're looking for!",
