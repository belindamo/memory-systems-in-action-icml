  "content": "In chapter 2 of The Giver, Jonas begins his first day of training as the new Receiver of Memory. He meets his mentor, the current Receiver of Memory, who is an old man with pale eyes like Jonas's. The old man gives Jonas his first memory, which is of sliding down a snowy hill on a sled. Jonas experiences the joy and thrill of this memory, but he is also confused by it because he has never experienced snow or sleds before. The old man explains that he is the only one in the community who has access to memories of the past, and that it is his job to transfer those memories to Jonas so that he can help the community make better decisions. Jonas learns that the old man is in pain and takes medication to help him deal with the memories he holds. Jonas leaves the session feeling overwhelmed but also excited to learn more about the past.",
