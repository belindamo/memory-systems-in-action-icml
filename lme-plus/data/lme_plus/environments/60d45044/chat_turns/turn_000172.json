The recommended aspect ratio for Twitter card images is 1.91:1, and this size of 1200x628 pixels fits within that aspect ratio and provides a high-quality preview for your link.\n\nIt's also a good idea to make sure that your image is served with the correct content type (e.g. `image/jpeg` or `image/png`), and that the image file size is not too large (less than 5 MB). You can find more information about these requirements in Twitter's documentation: <https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started>",
