U create your EPIC IDEAL LIFE.\n\nDaySculpting is broken down into 3 easy to accomplish segments throughout your day\u2026\n~The Morning Lift Process\u2026which sets U up with a MindState of Success and a design for U to follow throughout your day\u2026There is a morning email\u2026SMS text\u2026Inspiring Video\u2026Future Forward Tuning IN\u2026And a 3 step Success Step Declaration Process\u2026this only takes 15 minutes\u2026\n~Mid-Day Reconnect Process\u2026whatever your miid-day is\u2026U are encouraged to stop doing what U are doing and disconnect so U can re-connect\u2026by listening to a 5-minute Tuning In Re-Connection. We know that somewhere in the middle of our day it\u2019s easy to lose momentum and drift from our best intentions because of all the demands on our attention. It has been scientifically proven that when U disconnent for between 3 to 5 minutes at the midpoint of your day\u2026.your brain resets\u2026and your energy is replenished\u2026I like to call it a MindState Re-Boot that will inspire U to re-ignite your imagination\u2026this only takes 5 minutes\n~Highlight And Insight Review Process\u2026we all review our day however what DaySculpting \nanchors for U is an activation and integration process that gets U to see your day as being successful\u2026by celebrating your successes (your highlights) and being present to things U could have improved on (your insights) so U can make your insights into highlights..most people when they review their day fail to celebrate even the smallest increments of success\u2026they focus on what they didn\u2019t do and that puts them in a negative energy\u2026Success has challenges and the\nhighlights and insight process encourages and empowers U to honestly see what U are doing each day so U Sculpt new MindStates Of Success rather than the energy of uncertainty\u2026\nthis takes 10 minutes\n\nThe whole DaySculpting process takes 30 minutes a day\u2026and as I always say if U don\u2019t have \n30 minutes to change your life then U don\u2019t want to change your life and U are okay with living \na mediocre life\u2026\n\nDay Sculpting is about targeting specific Chief Aims U have for your life\u2026and creating the Habits that will get U there\u2026Imagine being able to replace the MindTraps (your limiting beliefs) with empowering rituals and habits that become your new normal\u2026\n\nThrough the repetition of doing the daily DaySculpting process U are carving into your Subconscious memory thoughts, beliefs and actions that result in U sculpting the masterpiece known as U\u2026\n\nThere are many programs out there that attempt to instill new success behaviors however many fall short of actually shifting your MindStates into a frequency of possibility where U get to actually see your daily results immediately\u2026DaySculpting does this\u2026\n\nThis is not science fiction\u2026 and it's not wishful thinking, or some tired old self-improvement, goal-setting program\u2026 DaySculpting is a program that empowers U to manifest and realize your Chief Aims in life\n\n\"DaySculpting\" -- is a tool that takes just MINUTES a day for you to use\u2026\n\nIt is designed to FREE UP hours in your day\u2026 while at the SAME time empowering you for greater success in ANY area of your life.\n\nDaySculpting sheds light and solves an age-old problem:\nWHY we often fight against the very changes we desire to make\n\nHave you ever experienced the FEELING that you deserve MORE out of your life?

Week after week, month after month go by and you still are no farther ahead of the game\u2026stuck in the status quo that never seems to change.\n\nBreaking free means that the status quo of your life has to change\u2026 your habits of expectation have to change \u2026your mindset has to change\u2026you have to uncover those old behaviors that have held you back and be willing to create a new mindset.\n\nYou have to be willing to shift your daily focus inwards towards what you need to do today rather than tomorrow. Because when you create a great day today you welcome in a more powerful tomorrow.\n\nWe all have the same 24 hours each day. But why are some people building fabulous careers, achieving healthy lifestyles, enjoying great relationships and incomes, living their passions, and creating what they truly desire as a life?\n\nImagine that you could clear away the distractions that you unconsciously create. You know the stuff that consumes your time causes stress and disconnects you from your purpose and passion. \n\nImagine every day you embrace the energy for what you are choosing to create in your life. Your thoughts empower you, your choices inspire you and your actions create momentum, opportunity and possibility.\n\nYou can create a GREAT LIFE, the life you want to live by focusing your efforts on Creating a Great Day Today. That\u2019s Day Sculpting. Seven intentional sculpted days turn into a month of wonderful weeks and a year of magnificent months creating an amazingly successful life.\n\nNone of this is going to work though if you believe that what you were born with is all you will get\u2026\n\nNo one will ever attempt to do something when they are convinced that they will fail.\n\nResearch has shown that the brain will actually stop itself from doing what\u2019s necessary to succeed if a person believes that they cannot succeed.\n\nIt\u2019s the small concrete indicators of success today that will prove you can have whatever it is you want and the process of Day Sculpting will empowers, inspire and motivates you each step of the way.\n\nYou see: Confidence + Discipline = Desired Outcomes \n\nIt\u2019s time to stop looking at your life from a fear based I don\u2019t know how to mindset but rather be open to creating a solutions focused change consciousness that embraces your gift and talents and encourages you sharing them.\n\nLet me share a bit of nuero-chemistry with you\u2026\nWhat fires together wires together\u2026\n\nSo rather than Fall back on old habits\u2026\nTake the transitional step\u2026of being fully present to whats trying emerge as your ideal future and to help it along start building confidence each day\u2026\n\nAnd your possibility muscle and an intended thought process that leads to a more focused and clear out picturing of your desires.\n\nYou see...It\u2019s one thing to set goals and to make to do lists and to say your going to use the law of attraction to manifest what you want in life\u2026\n\nI\u2019m still looking at the many lists I have created.\n\nWhat it\u2019s really about is having a clear and purposeful intention in order to create the energy and the MindState Of success that will propel you into action.\n----\n\nWhen done ask me for part 2"
