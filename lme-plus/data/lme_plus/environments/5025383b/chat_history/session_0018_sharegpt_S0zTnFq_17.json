      "content": "To find the probability that a family selected at random is a buyer of a car given that they belong to the income group of 20k $ and above, we need to use conditional probability.\n\nLet B denote the event that a family is a buyer of a car, and A denote the event that a family belongs to the income group of 20k $ and above. We want to find P(B|A), the probability that a family is a buyer of a car given that they belong to the income group of 20k $ and above.\n\nWe can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:\n\nP(B|A) = P(A|B) \\* P(B) / P(A)\n\nHere, P(A|B) is the probability that a family belongs to the income group of 20k $ and above given that they are a buyer of a car, which is given by the table as 42/80.\n\nP(B) is the probability that a family is a buyer of a car, which is given by the table as 80/200.\n\nP(A) is the probability that a family belongs to the income group of 20k $ and above, which is the total number of families in that income group, given by the table as 80/200.\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\nP(B|A) = (42/80) \\* (80/200) / (80/200)\n= 0.525\n\nTherefore, the probability that a family selected at random is a buyer of a car given that they belong to the income group of 20k $ and above is 0.525 or 52.5%."

      "content": "We can use the formula for z-score to determine how many standard deviations away from the mean is a pack that weighs 0.260 kg:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the weight of the pack, \u03bc is the mean weight, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nz = (0.260 - 0.295) / 0.025\n= -1.4\n\nTherefore, a pack that weighs 0.260 kg is 1.4 standard deviations away from the mean. Since the z-score is negative, we know that the weight of the pack is below the mean."
