      "content": "To download files from the FTP server and save them in a specific local directory, you can use the `lcd` (local change directory) command before issuing the `get` command. The `lcd` command allows you to change the local directory on your machine where the files will be saved.\n\nFirst, change the local directory to the desired folder where you want to save the files:\n```lua\nftp> lcd /path/to/your/local/folder\n```\nReplace `/path/to/your/local/folder` with the actual path to the folder on your machine where you want to save the files.\n\nThen, download the files as you did before:\n```arduino\nftp> get flag3\nftp> get passwd\nftp> get shadow\n```\nThe files will be saved in the specified local folder. If you want to download files from the `hiddenftpfolder` without overwriting the files you just downloaded, change the local directory again before issuing the `get` commands for the files in the `hiddenftpfolder`.\n\nFor example:\n```lua\nftp> lcd /path/to/another/local/folder\n```\nAnd then download the files from `hiddenftpfolder`. This way, you will avoid overwriting the files you downloaded earlier."

      "content": "i think it's 500 isntead of 1800, and how should the hashed file needs to look like, but succesfully done it, now let's move to task 5, 2. 2. Performing a brute force attack.\nUse a brute force attack to crack the remainder of the passwords, either from passwd or your hashes.txt.\nFor the purpose of this task, I have set the largest password size as six characters.\nPasswords may contain lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters.\nUse John the Ripper for this task.\nProvide screenshots and a description of any configuration files you change.\nProvide screenshots that demonstrate the attack command and display the results.\n\nextra helpful information\n\nPart 5 \u2013 Password Cracking\nThis part is taking a long time on some computers; you can take a strategic approach to this password cracking exercise.\n1. After you have \u201cunshadowed\u201d the password and shadow file, remove any unnecessary accounts.\nIf you look inside the unshadow file you will find 60 different accounts. Most of these were created by the default installation of Kali\u2026and are not related to this assignment \u2013 so you can remove these.\n\nRemove lines 1-55. The first password you should have is for \u201cfrustrated employee\u201d.\n\nYou should also have the password for the cfinnigan account already; so you can remove the line that starts with \u2018cfinnigan.\n\nThis should leave you with the following users\u2026 \u201cfrustratedemployee\u201d, \u201cuser1\u201d, \u201cuser2\u201d, and \u201cuser3\u201d.\n\nBelow is some more insider information about the passwords. (uc = uppercase, lc = lowercase)\nUser1 -> 8 characters long (uc + lc)\nUser 2 -> 4 characters long (uc + lc + symbols)\nUser 3 -> 6 characters long (uc + lc + numbers + symbols, based on - but more complicated than User2)\nfrustratedemployee -> 6 characters long (uc + lc + numbers + symbols)\n\n2. Attack the weakest passwords first\nIn the configuration file for \u2018john\u2019 you will find different types of incremental approach. For example, [Incremental: Alphanum] has 52 characters (all uppercase and all lowercase).\nIf you change the configuration file so that the section for [Incremental: Alphanum] has a MinLen of 4 and MaxLen of 4 then you can issue the following command,\njohn --incremental=alphanum --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n\nThis will attack the user1 password only.\nIf you change the [Incremental: ASCII] to a MinLen of 4 and a MaxLen of 4 then it will attack passwords for User1 and User2.\n\\*\\*\\*Note \u2013 you only need to include the passwords you are attacking in the unshadow file.\n\n3. Attack the stronger passwords next\nThe passwords for \u201cfrustratedemployee\u201d and \u201cuser3\u201d are both 6 characters long with uppercase, lowercase, symbols and numbers in the password \u2013 and they will take a lot longer to crack.\nBecause of this you only need to demonstrate HOW you will crack these passwords without actually having to crack them.\nIn your template file, provide the details of any configuration file changes so that it cracks a 6-character password with all the variants of the characters (lower, upper, symbols, numbers). Then issue the command to crack the password\u2026let it run for a few seconds, then press the Q button to quit. Make sure you provide a screenshot so that we can see you have issued the correct command.\n\n4. Part 6 isn\u2019t possible without accessing the original password and shadow files\nBecause you\u2019re not going to be cracking all the passwords, part 6 isn\u2019t possible. So\u2026let\u2019s make the assumption that you have cracked the password for your account during the previous step. You already know the password \u2013 so you can go ahead and capture the flag without providing proof that you have cracked the password.\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n\u2022 After you successfully, brute-force the password of cfinnigan account, you might find that the password does not work when you attempt to ssh into the Blue machine with the cfinnigan account. Provide possible explanation(s) for this.\n\u2022 Considering what you now know (intel) about how the password for cfinnigan is selected (2 words camel-capped), are you able to ssh into the Blue machine with the cfinnigan account?\n\u2022 Alternatively, are you able to ssh into any of the other accounts whose passwords you have successfully cracked?\n\nok but the jhon the ripper doesn't have Incremental Alphanum whaty else can be used instead of it, it's also used as an example....."

      "content": "You are correct that the hash type should be 500 for the Unix DES-based crypt, which is the default crypt in the passwd file. I apologize for the confusion.\n\nNow, let's move on to Task 5.2:\n\nYou can use the following configuration options in the john.conf file for the different users:\n\n1. User1 (8 characters long, uppercase and lowercase):\n```makefile\n[Incremental:User1]\nFile = $JOHN/ascii.chr\nMinLen = 8\nMaxLen = 8\nCharCount = 52\n```\n1. User2 (4 characters long, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols):\n```makefile\n[Incremental:User2]\nFile = $JOHN/ascii.chr\nMinLen = 4\nMaxLen = 4\nCharCount = 94\n```\nBefore moving forward, make sure you have the unshadowed file ready with only the relevant users (frustratedemployee, user1, user2, and user3).\n\nNow, to perform the brute force attack for each user using John the Ripper, use these commands:\n\nFor User1:\n```css\njohn --incremental=User1 --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n```\nFor User2:\n```css\njohn --incremental=User2 --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n```\nFor the passwords of frustratedemployee and user3, as they will take longer to crack, you can demonstrate the method without fully cracking the passwords. Set up the configuration in john.conf as follows:\n```makefile\n[Incremental:StrongPass]\nFile = $JOHN/ascii.chr\nMinLen = 6\nMaxLen = 6\nCharCount = 94\n```\nThen, issue the following command:\n```css\njohn --incremental=StrongPass --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n```\nRun it for a few seconds and then press 'Q' to quit. Make sure you provide screenshots of your commands and results.\n\nRegarding your question about the \"Incremental Alphanum\" mode, it appears that the mode is not included in the default configuration. Instead, you can create a custom incremental mode like the \"User1\" example I provided above, which targets uppercase and lowercase characters."
