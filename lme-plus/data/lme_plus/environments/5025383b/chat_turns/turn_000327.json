His work on climate change helped to raise awareness of the urgency and severity of the issue, and he played a key role in pushing for action to address it. Here are some specific ways his advocacy impacted the United States and the world:\n\n1. The Kyoto Protocol: Gore played a significant role in negotiating the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was signed in 1997 and represented a major step forward in international efforts to address climate change. While the US ultimately did not ratify the treaty, the negotiations and discussions surrounding the agreement helped to build momentum for future action on climate change.\n\n2. Clean Energy: Gore has been a vocal advocate for clean energy and renewable technologies. He has pushed for the development of solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy as alternatives to fossil fuels.\n\n3. Public Education: Gore has worked to increase public awareness of climate change and its impacts, through books, documentaries, and public speaking engagements. His documentary, \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" and his subsequent work on climate change have helped to bring the issue into the mainstream and to highlight the effects of climate change on vulnerable populations around the world.\n\n4. Green Jobs: Gore has also been a strong proponent of green jobs and the potential for the clean energy sector to create new employment opportunities. He has argued that investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency can help to spur economic growth while also addressing climate change.\n\nOverall, Gore's environmental advocacy has helped to raise awareness of climate change and its impacts, while also pushing for concrete policy solutions and action to address the issue. His work has helped to make climate change a more prominent issue on the global agenda and has inspired many people to take action to reduce their carbon footprints and advocate for change.",
