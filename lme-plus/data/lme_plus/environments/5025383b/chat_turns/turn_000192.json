  "content": "When a building work is overrunning, homeowners have several options available to them. These options include:\n\n1. Negotiating a new timeline: Homeowners can negotiate a new timeline with their builder to complete the work. This can be done either informally or formally, with the help of a mediator or lawyer.\n2. Termination of the contract: If the builder is unable to complete the work within the agreed timeline, the homeowner can terminate the contract. This option should only be exercised after seeking legal advice and making sure that the builder has breached the contract.\n3. Compensation for losses: If the builder is responsible for the delay, the homeowner may be entitled to compensation for any losses they have incurred as a result of the delay. This can include costs associated with living elsewhere while the work is completed or financial losses incurred as a result of the delay.\n4. Claiming damages: Homeowners can also claim damages from the builder for breach of contract. This would involve making a claim for compensation for any losses incurred as a result of the builder's breach of contract.\n\nIt is important for homeowners to seek legal advice before pursuing any of these options to ensure that they understand their rights and obligations under the contract.",
