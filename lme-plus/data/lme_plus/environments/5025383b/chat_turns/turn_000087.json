I've been taking a different route to work lately, which gives me about 15-20 minutes of extra time in the morning. I can use that time to do some freewriting or work on a short story. Additionally, I can try to write for 10-15 minutes before my yoga class, which would be a great way to clear my mind and get focused before the class.",
