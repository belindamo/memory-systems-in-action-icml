  "content": "I think the Fresh Fruit Skewers would be a great option. It's light, refreshing, and easy to transport. Plus, it's a great way to celebrate the arrival of spring with fresh seasonal fruits. By the way, today's celebration at my church was lovely. We had a beautiful outdoor procession and a potluck lunch, and it was nice to see everyone come together to celebrate the spring equinox. I helped set up the tables and chairs, and it was a great way to get involved in the community.",
