Here's how it works:\n\n**What are Scheduled blocks?**\n\nScheduled blocks are a feature in Freedom that allows you to block distracting websites and apps at specific times of the day or week. You can schedule blocks in advance to help you stay focused during certain periods, such as during work hours, study sessions, or when you're trying to relax.\n\n**How do Scheduled blocks work?**\n\nHere's how Scheduled blocks work:\n\n1. **Create a schedule**: Open the Freedom app and navigate to the Scheduled blocks section. Create a new schedule by selecting the days and times you want to block distracting websites and apps.\n2. **Choose your blocks**: Select the websites and apps you want to block during the scheduled period. You can choose from your existing block lists or create a new one.\n3. **Set the duration**: Set the duration of the block, which can range from 30 minutes to 24 hours.\n4. **Save and sync**: Save your schedule and Freedom will sync it across all your devices.\n\n**Customization options**\n\nFreedom's Scheduled blocks offer several customization options to help you tailor them to your needs:\n\n* **Custom schedules**: Create multiple schedules to cater to different times of the day or week. For example, you might have a schedule for work hours, study sessions, and relaxation time.\n* **Recurring blocks**: Set recurring blocks to occur at the same time every day or week. This is useful for blocking social media during your daily commute or during your lunch break.\n* **One-time blocks**: Schedule one-time blocks for specific events or tasks, such as blocking social media during a project deadline or a study session.\n* **Block lists**: Create custom block lists for different scenarios. For example, you might have a block list for social media, another for email, and another for news websites.\n* **Override options**: Set override options to allow access to blocked websites or apps in case of an emergency or if you need to make an exception.\n\n**Tips and variations**\n\nHere are some tips and variations to help you get the most out of Scheduled blocks:\n\n* **Start small**: Begin with small blocks of time and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the feature.\n* **Combine with other Freedom features**: Use Scheduled blocks in conjunction with other Freedom features, such as Locked mode and custom blocks, to create a comprehensive productivity system.\n* **Schedule breaks**: Use Scheduled blocks to take breaks from your devices and reduce screen time. For example, you might block social media during your lunch break or after dinner.\n* **Share your goals**: Share your Scheduled blocks with a friend or accountability partner to increase your motivation and commitment.\n\nIt's great that you're taking steps to address your social media use and its impact on your mental health. Remember, small changes can add up over time, and Freedom's Scheduled blocks can be a powerful tool in helping you develop healthier habits.\n\nBy the way, that article in The New Yorker was a great catalyst for change, wasn't it?
