  "content": "We can use the formula for z-score to determine how many standard deviations away from the mean is a pack that weighs 0.260 kg:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the weight of the pack, \u03bc is the mean weight, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nz = (0.260 - 0.295) / 0.025\n= -1.4\n\nTherefore, a pack that weighs 0.260 kg is 1.4 standard deviations away from the mean. Since the z-score is negative, we know that the weight of the pack is below the mean.",
