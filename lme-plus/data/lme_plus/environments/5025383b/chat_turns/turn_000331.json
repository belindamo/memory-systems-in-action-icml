  "content": "During his time as Vice President, Al Gore's environmental advocacy was not always well-received by the general public. Gore's early work on climate change and environmental issues was seen as somewhat tangential to his role as Vice President, and he was often criticized for being too focused on a single issue.\n\nHowever, with time, Gore's advocacy around climate change began to resonate with more people. His 1992 book, \"Earth in the Balance,\" helped to frame environmental issues in a way that was more accessible and relatable to the general public. He focused on issues like air pollution, traffic congestion, and the importance of forests and other natural resources.\n\nIn 1998, Gore became more visible in his role as an environmental advocate, delivering a major speech on climate change in which he called for a \"Marshal Plan\" to address the issue. He also helped negotiate the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which helped to galvanize public support for climate action.\n\nOverall, the public's reaction to Gore's environmental advocacy during his time as Vice President was somewhat mixed. While his message was not always well-received, Gore's work helped to raise awareness of environmental issues and laid the groundwork for more aggressive action on climate change in the years to come. His continued advocacy on the issue even after leaving office has made him a leading figure in the fight against the climate crisis.",
