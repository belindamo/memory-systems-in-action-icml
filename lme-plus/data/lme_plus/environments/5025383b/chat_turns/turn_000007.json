It's always a good idea to review your notes and business cards after an event to make sure you follow up with the people you met.\n\nNow that you have his contact information, you can reach out to the lawyer and take him up on his offer to review your startup's contracts. Don't forget to send a polite and professional email, reintroducing yourself and expressing your gratitude for his offer.\n\nRemember to also update your networking spreadsheet with the lawyer's contact information, so you can keep track of your conversation and follow-up tasks.\n\nIf you need any more assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your outreach, and I hope the lawyer's review helps your startup!",
