For every trio x, y, z in NN, if x = y and y = z then x = z\n4. For every number a, if b is in NN and a = b, then a is in NN\n5. If x in NN and y in NN and x = y, then y = x\n6. If m and n belong to NN, and m = n, then WN(m) = WN(n)\n7. If for m and n, WN(m)=WN(n), then m = n\n8. WN(m) is not 0 for any m in NN\n9. WN(0) is defined as 1\n10. WN(1) is defined as 2\n11. WN(2) = 3, WN(3) = 4, WN(4) = 5, etc.\n12. For every a, b in NN, a # b = WN(a + b)",
