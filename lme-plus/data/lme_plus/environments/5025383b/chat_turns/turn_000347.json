Your revised response is perfect.\n\nYou're absolutely right, Freedom's Scheduled blocks allow you to create custom block lists and schedules that cater to your specific needs and goals. By blocking social media during certain times of the day or week, you can reduce distractions and stay focused on more important tasks.\n\nYour example is a great illustration of how this feature can be used in a practical way. By blocking social media from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, you can avoid mindless scrolling during your morning routine and stay focused on your work or studies. Meanwhile, allowing access to email, news, and productivity tools ensures that you can still stay connected and productive during that time.\n\nThanks for providing a clear and concise explanation!
