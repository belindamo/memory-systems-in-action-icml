Both the Asparagus and Lemon Pasta Salad and the Spring Pea and Mint Risotto are perfect for a spring-themed potluck.\n\nFor a simple dessert that's easy to transport and serve, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Lemon Bars**: A classic dessert that's easy to make, transport, and serve. A shortbread crust, a tangy lemon filling, and a sprinkle of powdered sugar make for a refreshing and sweet treat.\n2. **Fresh Fruit Skewers**: Skewer fresh seasonal fruits like strawberries, grapes, kiwi, and pineapple onto wooden skewers. You can also add a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of sugar for extra flavor. This dessert is light, easy to transport, and visually appealing.\n3. **Spring-themed Sugar Cookies**: Bake and decorate sugar cookies with spring-inspired designs like flowers, butterflies, or eggs. You can also package them in cute containers or bags with a spring-themed label.\n4. **Mini Lavender Shortbread Cookies**: These bite-sized cookies are easy to make, transport, and serve. The lavender flavor is subtle and pairs well with a cup of tea or coffee.\n5. **No-Bake Energy Bites**: Mix together rolled oats, peanut butter, honey, and chocolate chips to create bite-sized energy balls that are easy to transport and serve. You can also add spring-themed sprinkles or chopped nuts for extra color and texture.\n\nAll of these options are easy to make, transport, and serve, and they're perfect for a spring-themed potluck.
