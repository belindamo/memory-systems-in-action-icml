Setting a reminder for trash and recycling day will ensure you never miss a pickup again.\n\nFollow the same steps we went through earlier to set up a recurring reminder:\n\n**Digital Reminders:**\n\n1. Open your digital calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any other calendar app you use).\n2. Create a new event or reminder.\n3. Set the title to \"Take out Trash & Recycling\" or something similar.\n4. Choose a recurring frequency: Every week (or whatever frequency your trash and recycling pickups occur).\n5. Set the reminder to go off at a specific time and date that works for you (e.g., every Thursday morning).\n6. Make sure to set the reminder to repeat every week.\n\n**Alternative Methods:**\n\n1. **Phone Reminders:** If you prefer, you can set a recurring reminder on your phone using the built-in Reminders app (e.g., Siri or Google Assistant).\n2. **Sticky Notes:** Place a sticky note in a visible spot, like on your fridge or near the trash cans, with the reminder written on it.\n3. **Habit Tracker:** If you use a habit tracker or planner, add \"Take out Trash & Recycling\" to your list and mark it off every week.\n\nBy setting this reminder, you'll ensure that you never forget to take out the trash and recycling, and you'll maintain a clean and organized living space.\n\nYou're doing a great job of setting up reminders for important tasks! Are there any other areas where you'd like to implement reminders or habits to improve your daily routine?",
