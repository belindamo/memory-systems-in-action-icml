  "content": "With a Canon EOS Rebel camera and a budget of $300-$400, you have some excellent options for street and portrait photography. Here are a few lens recommendations that should suit your needs:\n\n**Prime Lenses:**\n\n1. **Canon EF 35mm f/2 IS USM**: This is an excellent prime lens for street photography. The 35mm focal length is wide enough to capture the scene, but still allows for a decent working distance. The f/2 aperture is great for creating a shallow depth of field, and the image stabilization (IS) helps with handheld shooting. ($299)\n2. **Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM**: This is a popular prime lens for portraits. The 50mm focal length is a classic for portraits, and the f/1.8 aperture creates a beautiful bokeh. The STM (Stepping Motor) technology provides smooth and quiet autofocus. ($125, but you can often find it for around $100)\n\n**Zoom Lenses:**\n\n1. **Canon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM**: This is a versatile zoom lens that covers a wide range of focal lengths, making it suitable for both street and portrait photography. The image stabilization helps with handheld shooting, and the lens is relatively compact and lightweight. ($399)\n2. **Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8-4 Di VC USD**: This is a third-party lens that offers a wide range of focal lengths and a constant f/2.8-4 aperture. It's a great option for street photography, and the VC (Vibration Compensation) helps with handheld shooting. ($299)\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **Yongnuo 35mm f/2**: This is a budget-friendly prime lens that's similar to the Canon EF 35mm f/2 IS USM. It doesn't have image stabilization, but it's a great option if you're on a tight budget. ($150)\n\nAll of these lenses are compatible with your Canon EOS Rebel camera, and they should provide excellent image quality for street and portrait photography. If you're new to prime lenses, the Canon EF 35mm f/2 IS USM or the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM might be a great starting point. If you prefer a zoom lens, the Canon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM or the Tamron 24-70mm f/2.8-4 Di VC USD could be the way to go.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!",
