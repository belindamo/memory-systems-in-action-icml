With Freedom's Scheduled blocks, you can set up a custom schedule that blocks social media during certain times of the day while still allowing access to other websites and apps. Here's how:\n\n**Custom block lists**: Create a custom block list specifically for social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others. This way, you can block these websites and apps during certain times of the day without affecting your access to other websites and apps.\n\n**Scheduled blocks**: Set up a schedule to block the social media block list during specific times of the day or week. For example, you might block social media during your morning routine, during work hours, or during your evening relaxation time.\n\n**Allowing exceptions**: If you need to access specific websites or apps during the blocked period, you can add them to your \"Allowed\" list. This way, you can still access essential websites or apps, such as email, news, or productivity tools, while keeping social media blocked.\n\nHere's an example of how you could set up your schedule:\n\n* Block social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM (during work hours)\n* Allow access to email, news, and productivity tools during this time\n* Block social media from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM (during evening relaxation time)\n* Allow access to streaming services, online books, or other relaxing activities during this time\n\nBy setting up a custom schedule with Freedom's Scheduled blocks, you can strike a balance between staying connected and prioritizing your mental health. Remember, it's all about finding a balance that works for you and your unique needs.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to give it a try and see how it helps you stay on track with your goals?",
