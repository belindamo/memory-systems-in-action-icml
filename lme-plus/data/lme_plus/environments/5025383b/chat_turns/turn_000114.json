Designating a shoe zone and getting a shoe rack will help you create a sense of structure and make it easier to maintain your shoes.\n\nIt's great to hear that you've been consistent with your morning routine, making your bed, and tidying up the living room. Those habits can make a big difference in your daily life.\n\nGetting back into the habit of wiping down the bathroom sink and toilet after use is a great goal. Here are a few tips to help you get back on track:\n\n1. **Make it a part of your routine**: Try to wipe down the sink and toilet immediately after use, so it becomes a habitual part of your daily routine.\n2. **Keep cleaning supplies handy**: Store cleaning wipes or a small cleaning caddy with essentials like toilet cleaner, paper towels, and a microfiber cloth near the bathroom sink and toilet. This will make it easy to clean up quickly.\n3. **Break it down into smaller tasks**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, break down the task into smaller chunks. For example, focus on wiping down the sink one day and the toilet the next. Once you've got those habits established, you can combine them.\n4. **Create a reminder**: Set a reminder on your phone or put a note on your bathroom mirror to remind you to wipe down the sink and toilet after use.\n5. **Make it a mindful habit**: As you're wiping down the sink and toilet, take a few seconds to appreciate the cleanliness and freshness of your bathroom. This can help make the task more enjoyable and increase your motivation to maintain the habit.\n\nRemember, it might take some time to get back into the habit, but with consistent effort, it'll become second nature again.\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions? Are there any other areas of your daily routine that you're struggling to get back into?",
