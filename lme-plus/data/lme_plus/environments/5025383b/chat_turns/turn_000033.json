Here are some tips to help you edit your night shots:\n\n**Contrast and Exposure:**\n\n1. **Adjust the tone curve**: Use the tone curve to add contrast to your image. A gentle S-curve can help to separate the shadows and highlights.\n2. **Local adjustments**: Use local adjustment tools, such as the Adjustment Brush or Gradient Filter, to add contrast and exposure to specific areas of the image.\n3. **Shadow and highlight recovery**: Use the Shadows and Highlights sliders to recover detail in the darkest and brightest areas of the image.\n\n**Color and Saturation:**\n\n1. **Color grading**: Use color grading tools, such as the Color Grading panel or the Tone Curve, to add a consistent color tone to your image.\n2. **Saturation control**: Desaturate or saturate specific colors to draw attention to certain elements in the scene.\n3. **Color harmony**: Use color harmony principles, such as complementary or analogous colors, to create a visually appealing color palette.\n\n**Noise and Grain:**\n\n1. **Noise reduction**: Use noise reduction tools, such as the Noise Reduction panel or third-party plugins, to minimize digital noise in the image.\n2. **Grain addition**: Add grain to the image to give it a more film-like quality and to hide noise.\n\n**Specifically for wide-angle lenses:**\n\n1. **Lens corrections**: Apply lens corrections to remove distortion, chromatic aberration, and vignettes introduced by the wide-angle lens.\n2. **Perspective correction**: Use perspective correction tools to straighten lines and correct converging verticals.\n3. **Crop and compose**: Crop the image to remove distractions and emphasize the main subject, and use composition tools to balance the elements in the frame.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Work in layers**: Edit your image in layers to keep your adjustments organized and non-destructive.\n2. **Use reference images**: Use reference images to compare your edit to and ensure you're achieving the desired look.\n3. **Take breaks and revisit**: Take breaks from editing and revisit the image with fresh eyes to catch any mistakes or areas for improvement.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to bring out the best in your night shots taken with a wide-angle lens.
