Performing a brute force attack.\nUse a brute force attack to crack the remainder of the passwords, either from passwd or your hashes.txt.\nFor the purpose of this task, I have set the largest password size as six characters.\nPasswords may contain lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters.\nUse John the Ripper for this task.\nProvide screenshots and a description of any configuration files you change.\nProvide screenshots that demonstrate the attack command and display the results.\n\nextra helpful information\n\nPart 5 \u2013 Password Cracking\nThis part is taking a long time on some computers; you can take a strategic approach to this password cracking exercise.\n1. After you have \u201cunshadowed\u201d the password and shadow file, remove any unnecessary accounts.\nIf you look inside the unshadow file you will find 60 different accounts. Most of these were created by the default installation of Kali\u2026and are not related to this assignment \u2013 so you can remove these.\n\nRemove lines 1-55. The first password you should have is for \u201cfrustrated employee\u201d.\n\nYou should also have the password for the cfinnigan account already; so you can remove the line that starts with \u2018cfinnigan.\n\nThis should leave you with the following users\u2026 \u201cfrustratedemployee\u201d, \u201cuser1\u201d, \u201cuser2\u201d, and \u201cuser3\u201d.\n\nBelow is some more insider information about the passwords. (uc = uppercase, lc = lowercase)\nUser1 -> 8 characters long (uc + lc)\nUser 2 -> 4 characters long (uc + lc + symbols)\nUser 3 -> 6 characters long (uc + lc + numbers + symbols, based on - but more complicated than User2)\nfrustratedemployee -> 6 characters long (uc + lc + numbers + symbols)\n\n2. Attack the weakest passwords first\nIn the configuration file for \u2018john\u2019 you will find different types of incremental approach. For example, [Incremental: Alphanum] has 52 characters (all uppercase and all lowercase).\nIf you change the configuration file so that the section for [Incremental: Alphanum] has a MinLen of 4 and MaxLen of 4 then you can issue the following command,\njohn --incremental=alphanum --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n\nThis will attack the user1 password only.\nIf you change the [Incremental: ASCII] to a MinLen of 4 and a MaxLen of 4 then it will attack passwords for User1 and User2.\n\\*\\*\\*Note \u2013 you only need to include the passwords you are attacking in the unshadow file.\n\n3. Attack the stronger passwords next\nThe passwords for \u201cfrustratedemployee\u201d and \u201cuser3\u201d are both 6 characters long with uppercase, lowercase, symbols and numbers in the password \u2013 and they will take a lot longer to crack.\nBecause of this you only need to demonstrate HOW you will crack these passwords without actually having to crack them.\nIn your template file, provide the details of any configuration file changes so that it cracks a 6-character password with all the variants of the characters (lower, upper, symbols, numbers). Then issue the command to crack the password\u2026let it run for a few seconds, then press the Q button to quit. Make sure you provide a screenshot so that we can see you have issued the correct command.\n\n4. Part 6 isn\u2019t possible without accessing the original password and shadow files\nBecause you\u2019re not going to be cracking all the passwords, part 6 isn\u2019t possible. So\u2026let\u2019s make the assumption that you have cracked the password for your account during the previous step. You already know the password \u2013 so you can go ahead and capture the flag without providing proof that you have cracked the password.\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n\u2022 After you successfully, brute-force the password of cfinnigan account, you might find that the password does not work when you attempt to ssh into the Blue machine with the cfinnigan account. Provide possible explanation(s) for this.\n\u2022 Considering what you now know (intel) about how the password for cfinnigan is selected (2 words camel-capped), are you able to ssh into the Blue machine with the cfinnigan account?\n\u2022 Alternatively, are you able to ssh into any of the other accounts whose passwords you have successfully cracked?\n\nok but the jhon the ripper doesn't have Incremental Alphanum whaty else can be used instead of it, it's also used as an example.....",
