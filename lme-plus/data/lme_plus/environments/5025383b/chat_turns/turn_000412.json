  "content": "Yes, Jim Morrison's legal troubles did impact his career and image. Many people viewed him as a troublemaker and a bad influence on young people. His arrests for indecent exposure and other offenses caused some radio stations to boycott his music and some concert venues to cancel his shows. The negative publicity also affected The Doors' album sales and prevented them from performing in certain cities. However, Morrison's fans remained loyal to him despite his legal troubles, and he continued to be a cultural icon after his death.",
