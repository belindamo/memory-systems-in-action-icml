  "content": "There have been improvements since the Victorian era in terms of how religion affects society, but some problems remain.\n\nFor instance, in many societies today, religion still plays a role in promoting discrimination and oppression. Women, the LGBTQ+ community, and other marginalized groups may still face discrimination based on religious beliefs and teachings.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also religious movements and organizations that work towards progressive goals and social justice causes. They aim to harness the power of religion to make positive changes in the world and promote greater respect for diversity and inclusion.\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize that religion can have both positive and negative impacts on society, and it is up to individuals to critically evaluate religious teachings and work towards an inclusive and respectful society that values equality and human rights.",
