In step 2, you calculate 1 # 3 = 1 # WN(2), but the only rule that allows for changing the left side of the addition from a natural number to WN(a) is rule 10, and it states that a # WN(b) = WN(a # b), not WN(a) # WN(b) = WN(a # b).\n\nAdditionally, in step 5, you calculate 0 # 1 = 0 # WN(0) = WN(0), which doesn't follow the rules for NN arithmetic either. The only rule that mentions 0 # a or a # 0 is rule 9, which states that a # 0 = a.\n\nI'm not sure what you meant by the inductive step in the end. The answer to 1 # 3 in NN cannot be determined based on the rules you provided.",
