  "content": "You are correct that the hash type should be 500 for the Unix DES-based crypt, which is the default crypt in the passwd file. I apologize for the confusion.\n\nNow, let's move on to Task 5.2:\n\nYou can use the following configuration options in the john.conf file for the different users:\n\n1. User1 (8 characters long, uppercase and lowercase):\n```makefile\n[Incremental:User1]\nFile = $JOHN/ascii.chr\nMinLen = 8\nMaxLen = 8\nCharCount = 52\n```\n1. User2 (4 characters long, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols):\n```makefile\n[Incremental:User2]\nFile = $JOHN/ascii.chr\nMinLen = 4\nMaxLen = 4\nCharCount = 94\n```\nBefore moving forward, make sure you have the unshadowed file ready with only the relevant users (frustratedemployee, user1, user2, and user3).\n\nNow, to perform the brute force attack for each user using John the Ripper, use these commands:\n\nFor User1:\n```css\njohn --incremental=User1 --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n```\nFor User2:\n```css\njohn --incremental=User2 --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n```\nFor the passwords of frustratedemployee and user3, as they will take longer to crack, you can demonstrate the method without fully cracking the passwords. Set up the configuration in john.conf as follows:\n```makefile\n[Incremental:StrongPass]\nFile = $JOHN/ascii.chr\nMinLen = 6\nMaxLen = 6\nCharCount = 94\n```\nThen, issue the following command:\n```css\njohn --incremental=StrongPass --format=md5crypt unshadowfile\n```\nRun it for a few seconds and then press 'Q' to quit. Make sure you provide screenshots of your commands and results.\n\nRegarding your question about the \"Incremental Alphanum\" mode, it appears that the mode is not included in the default configuration. Instead, you can create a custom incremental mode like the \"User1\" example I provided above, which targets uppercase and lowercase characters.",
