  "content": "Yes, Walter Mondale played a significant role in expanding the role and responsibilities of the Vice Presidency during his tenure in office. Prior to Mondale's vice presidency, the role of the Vice President was largely ceremonial and symbolic, with the Vice President often taking a backseat to the President in terms of decision-making and policy formulation.\n\nHowever, Mondale worked to change this dynamic by pushing for greater involvement in policy discussions and decision-making, and by creating a more active and influential Vice Presidency. He was a regular participant in Cabinet meetings and National Security Council meetings, and also played a key role in shaping the President's legislative agenda.\n\nAdditionally, Mondale helped to establish a more formalized system of communication and consultation between the President and Vice President, which included regular one-on-one meetings and policy briefings. By expanding the role and responsibilities of the Vice Presidency, Mondale helped to set a precedent for future Vice Presidents to become more involved in the workings of the White House and to have a greater impact on the course of U.S. history.",
