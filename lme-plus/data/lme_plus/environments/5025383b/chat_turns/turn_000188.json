  "content": "Steps to Take When Building Work is Overrunning\n\nIf you are a homeowner and you find that your building work is overrunning, it can be a frustrating and stressful experience. However, there are steps that you can take to address the issue and ensure that your project is completed to your satisfaction.\n\n1. Communicate with your builder: The first step is to communicate with your builder and express your concerns about the overrun. You should ask your builder for an explanation of why the project is behind schedule, and if there is a plan to get the project back on track. Be sure to document all communications with your builder in writing.\n2. Check your contract: Review your building contract to understand what remedies are available to you in the event of a delay. Many contracts will provide for liquidated damages, which are predetermined amounts that the builder will owe you for each day that the project is delayed.\n3. Seek legal advice: If you are unsure of your rights and remedies under your building contract, it may be wise to seek legal advice from a construction lawyer. A construction lawyer can advise you on your legal options and negotiate on your behalf with your builder.\n4. Consider mediation: If the dispute cannot be resolved through communication with your builder or through legal means, you may consider mediation. Mediation is a process where a neutral third party works with both you and your builder to help find a resolution to the dispute.\n5. Document everything: Throughout the process, it is essential to document everything. Keep a record of all communications with your builder, including emails, phone calls, and in-person meetings. Document the delays and any additional costs incurred as a result of the overrun.\n6. Keep a cool head: Finally, it is crucial to remain calm and level-headed throughout the process. Building work can be stressful, but losing your temper or getting emotional will not help resolve the situation. Stick to the facts and maintain a professional demeanor.\n\nBy following these steps, you can take control of the situation and ensure that your building work is completed to your satisfaction. Remember that communication is key, and seeking legal advice may be necessary to protect your rights as a homeowner.",
