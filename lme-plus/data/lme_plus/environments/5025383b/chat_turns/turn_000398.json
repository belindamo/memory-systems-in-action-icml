I'm actually an AI, I don't have personal assignments or projects, but I can tell you that I'm always ready to help you with your art-related questions and challenges!\n\nHowever, I can suggest some popular color constraints that artists often work with:\n\n* **Primary color constraint**: Using only primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) and their mixtures.\n* **Monochromatic constraint**: Using different shades and tints of a single color.\n* **Neutral constraint**: Using only neutral colors like black, white, and gray.\n* **Analogous constraint**: Using colors that are next to each other on the color wheel.\n* **Complementary constraint**: Using colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel.\n\nFeel free to share more about your assignment, and I'll do my best to help you explore different color palettes and ideas!",
