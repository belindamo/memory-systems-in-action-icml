  "content": "The Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo is a popular choice, and I'm happy to help you with that question.\n\nAfter checking, I found that the Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo does contain sulfates, specifically sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES). These sulfates are common foaming agents used in many shampoos, but some people may be sensitive to them or prefer to avoid them due to concerns about their potential impact on hair and scalp health.\n\nIf you're looking for a sulfate-free shampoo, Moroccanoil does offer a sulfate-free alternative: the Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Sulfate-Free Shampoo. This formula is designed to gently cleanse and nourish dry, damaged, or color-treated hair without stripping it of its natural oils.\n\nKeep in mind that sulfate-free shampoos might not produce as much lather as traditional shampoos, but they can still be effective cleansers.\n\nIf you're still interested in trying the original Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo, it's worth noting that while it does contain sulfates, it's still a gentle and moisturizing formula that's designed to repair and nourish hair.\n\nWould you like to explore more sulfate-free options or stick with the original Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo?",
