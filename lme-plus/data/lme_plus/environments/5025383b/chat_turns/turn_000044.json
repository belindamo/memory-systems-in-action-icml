Here's more information to whet your appetite:\n\n**The Haunting of Hill House**\n\n* Genre: Horror, Sci-Fi, Drama\n* Creator: Mike Flanagan\n* Episodes: 10 (Season 1), 9 (Season 2)\n* Runtime: 45-60 minutes per episode\n\n\"The Haunting of Hill House\" follows the story of the Crain family, who grew up in a haunted house that had a profound effect on their lives. The series jumps back and forth between the past (when the family lived in the house) and the present day, where the siblings are still struggling with the consequences of their experiences.\n\nThe show explores themes of trauma, grief, mental health, and the supernatural. It's more of a psychological horror series than a jump-scare fest, focusing on building tension and atmosphere through its storytelling and cinematography.\n\nThe show features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Michiel Huisman as Steven Crain\n* Elizabeth Reaser as Shirley Crain\n* Oliver Jackson-Cohen as Luke Crain\n* Victoria Pedretti as Eleanor \"Nell\" Crain\n* Timothy Hutton as Hugh Crain\n\n**The OA**\n\n* Genre: Sci-Fi, Mystery, Drama\n* Creators: Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij\n* Episodes: 8 (Season 1), 8 (Season 2)\n* Runtime: 30-60 minutes per episode\n\n\"The OA\" follows Prairie Johnson, a young woman who returns after being missing for seven years. She was blind when she disappeared, but now she can see. Prairie refuses to talk to her parents or the FBI about her disappearance, instead gathering a group of misfits to whom she tells her story.\n\nThe series explores interconnected storylines, near-death experiences, and interdimensional travel. It's a thought-provoking, atmospheric show that delves into themes of trauma, identity, and the power of storytelling.\n\nThe show features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Brit Marling as Prairie Johnson / The OA\n* Emory Cohen as Homer Roberts\n* Scott Wilson as Abel Johnson\n* Phyllis Smith as Betty \"BBA\" Broderick-Allen\n* Alice Krige as Nancy Johnson\n\nBoth shows have received critical acclaim for their unique storytelling, atmospheric settings, and complex characters. If you enjoy thought-provoking sci-fi with a strong focus on character development, you'll likely appreciate both \"The Haunting of Hill House\" and \"The OA\".\n\nKeep in mind that both shows have complex, non-linear storytelling, so be prepared to pay close attention and piece together the puzzles alongside the characters.",
