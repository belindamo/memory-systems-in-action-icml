  "content": "A new moisturizer can help to enhance the benefits of the Sunday Riley C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum. Here are some moisturizer recommendations that would complement the serum nicely:\n\n**Look for moisturizers with:**\n\n1. **Hyaluronic acid**: Hyaluronic acid is a natural humectant that attracts and retains moisture in the skin. It can help to hydrate and plump the skin, making it an excellent pairing with the vitamin C serum.\n2. **Antioxidants**: Antioxidants like vitamin E, ferulic acid, or green tea extract can help to enhance the benefits of vitamin C and provide additional protection against free radicals.\n3. **Nourishing ingredients**: Ingredients like glycerin, ceramides, or niacinamide can help to nourish and support the skin's barrier function, making it more receptive to the benefits of the vitamin C serum.\n\n**Moisturizer recommendations:**\n\n1. **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel**: A lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that provides intense hydration and contains hyaluronic acid.\n2. **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid**: A gentle, non-comedogenic moisturizer that soothes and hydrates the skin, while containing antioxidants and caffeine to reduce puffiness.\n3. **Dr. Jart+ Water-Replenishing Moisturizer**: A hydrating moisturizer that contains hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and trehalose to provide long-lasting moisture and support the skin's natural barrier function.\n4. **SkinCeuticals Emollience**: A rich, non-greasy moisturizer that contains antioxidants, glycerin, and ceramides to nourish and hydrate the skin.\n5. **Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream**: A rich, luxurious moisturizer that contains hyaluronic acid, vitamin B3, and Amino-Peptide Complex to plump and firm the skin.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Choose a moisturizer that suits your skin type**: If you have oily skin, look for lightweight, oil-free moisturizers. If you have dry skin, look for richer, more nourishing moisturizers.\n* **Read the ingredient list**: Ensure the moisturizer doesn't contain any ingredients that may react with the vitamin C serum or your skin.\n* **Patch test**: Always patch test a new moisturizer to ensure you don't have any adverse reactions.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect moisturizer to pair with your Sunday Riley C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum!",
