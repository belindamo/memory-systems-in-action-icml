Choosing the right lens can be a bit overwhelming, especially with so many options available. As a beginner, it's essential to find a lens that's easy to use, versatile, and fits your budget.\n\nBefore I recommend some lenses, let me ask you a few questions:\n\n1. What type of camera do you have? Is it a DSLR or a mirrorless camera? What's the brand and model?\n2. What kind of photography are you most interested in? (e.g., portraits, landscapes, street, wildlife, etc.)\n3. What's your budget for the lens?\n\nBased on your online research and Lightroom skills, I'll assume you're looking for a lens that's a good all-around performer. Here are some popular beginner-friendly lens options:\n\n**Kit Lenses:**\nIf you already have a DSLR or mirrorless camera, you might have received a kit lens with it. Kit lenses are usually an 18-55mm or 14-42mm lens, which is a great starting point. They're versatile, lightweight, and often affordable.\n\n**Prime Lenses:**\nPrime lenses are great for learning about aperture, depth of field, and composition. They're usually faster (wider aperture) and sharper than kit lenses. Here are a few popular prime lens options:\n\n* Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 (~ $125)\n* Nikon AF-S Nikkor 50mm f/1.8G (~ $220)\n* Sony E 50mm f/1.8 OSS (~ $250)\n\n**Zoom Lenses:**\nZoom lenses offer more flexibility than prime lenses, allowing you to adjust the focal length without changing lenses. Here are some popular zoom lens options:\n\n* Canon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM (~ $400)\n* Nikon AF-P DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR (~ $250)\n* Sony E 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS (~ $350)\n\n**Third-Party Lenses:**\nThird-party lenses can offer similar quality at a lower price point than brand-name lenses. Here are a few popular options:\n\n* Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 DC HSM Art (~ $400)\n* Tamron 18-400mm f/3.5-6.3 Di II VC HLD (~ $650)\n\nRemember, these are just a few examples, and there are many other lenses available. When choosing a lens, consider the following factors:\n\n* Image quality\n* Build quality and durability\n* Weight and size\n* Price\n* Compatibility with your camera brand and model\n\nI hope this helps you get started! If you provide more information about your camera and preferences, I can give you more tailored recommendations.",
