  "content": "of paper on the floor on which each of your feet are on the outside edge. As you rise up and bring your hips forward, you want to rip the paper apart with your feet (your feet don\u2019t actually move; you are just pushing outward on them into the floor). \n4. At the same time, you are pressing outward/spreading the floor/ripping the paper in half. Squeeze your buttocks just like you do in the bridge exercise. Use the gluteal muscles to bring your hips up and forward to the starting position. Try this several times.\n5. Can you feel the glutes engaging? This is tricky. You should now feel the glutes working more than the quads. If not, read through this exercise again and try it a few more times. If you can\u2019t get it, go to Troubleshooting, following. \n6. If your back or knees hurt before, does engaging the glutes get rid of or significantly decrease the pain? It should. If not, try this exercise a few more times. If it still doesn\u2019t, go to Troubleshooting, following. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m not feeling the glutes engaging.\u201d This issue is common and it may take time to master this exercise. You are trying to change a good many years of behavior here and it isn\u2019t going to happen overnight. Try these first:\n\u25a0 Make sure the feet are turned forward, not outward. \n\u25a0 Make sure your knees aren\u2019t coming forward over your toes as you squat back.\n\u25a0 Make sure you are lightly pressing outward on your knees and/or heels (try both: some cues work for some people and some don\u2019t) as you bring your hips up and forward.\n\u25a0 If you still can\u2019t feel them, go back and try a few clamshells, bridges, and hip extensions, and then come back and try again.\n\u25a0 If it still doesn\u2019t work, go to the trigger point chapter (Chapter 14) and then try again.\n\u2022 \u201cMy knees and/or low back hurt.\u201d Keep in mind that a very small percentage of people may never be able to squat pain-free. That being said, the vast majority of you will be able to squat to some degree with little to no knee or back pain. Pain in the low back usually means you aren\u2019t maintaining neutral spine and/or you aren\u2019t engaging the glutes, which is putting too much load through the spine. See the first troubleshooting item and make sure you are engaging the glutes. Try squatting with a very small range of motion for a time, slowly increasing your range of motion over the coming weeks. If your knees or low back still hurt, go on to the trigger point chapter (Chapter 14) and then come back and try this again. \nSplit Squat\nThe last \u201cglute integrated\u201d movement we will cover in this chapter is the split squat. There is an \u201cadded plus\u201d to learning this one: For many back pain sufferers, the split squat offers a painless way to get up off of the floor. We\u2019ll go over applied movement in a moment, but first try this (admittedly challenging) exercise. \nMany of you have probably heard of the \u201clunge\u201d exercise. The split squat is the precursor to the lunge. If you know what a lunge is, think of the split squat as a lunge in which your feet stay in place. The key (and the challenge) is to use the glutes (in the rear leg), not the quads (in front) to bring your body up.\nStep 1: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in place. \n\nStep 3: Step forward, putting one leg in front of the other, about two feet apart, depending on your height. The distance between your feet is likely going to be slightly greater than you naturally want. Step out of your comfort zone a little bit. If you are worried about falling you can hold on to something to help you balance. Try to distribute your weight evenly on both feet. This is your starting position for the exercise.\n\nStep 4: Slowly and carefully lower your torso toward the ground. Don\u2019t bend forward, just lower straight down. Think of an elevator. If you can, go down so that the top half of your front leg (your thigh) is parallel with the floor and the lower part of your front leg is perpendicular to the floor.\nStep 5: As you are going down, bend your back knee so that it points straight toward the floor (not forward). \nStep 6: Here\u2019s the hard part: As you start to rise, initiate the movement with the glutes of your rear leg, not the quads (thigh) of your front leg. Read that again: It\u2019s counterintuitive. Use the glutes of the rear leg to pull yourself, relying as little as possible on the quads. Aim for a 60/40 ratio (or even a 70/30 ratio) of glutes to quads. \nStep 7: Come up to the starting position, maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core. Your feet should never move out of starting position. \nStep 8: Repeat for ten to twelve reps, and two to three sets, with three being the goal. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t have the balance.\u201d In the beginning, hold on to a table, chair, etc., until you develop the engagement and strength of the glutes. Your stability/balance will improve as you learn to use these muscles.\n\u2022 \u201cMy knee(s) hurt(s).\u201d Guess why? I\u2019m starting to sound like a broken record here. Your glutes aren\u2019t working. Take one hand and press into the glutes of the rear leg as you do the exercise. Do you feel them tightening? Your hip should be extending as you come up. If you don\u2019t feel the glutes tightening as you rise, go back to the standing hip extension for a while, and then try this exercise again after you feel the glutes working in that exercise. \nYou may have struggled with this chapter. That makes sense: Your glutes have atrophied and these are glute exercises, so of course they\u2019re hard. Your glutes atrophied because of years and years (geologic time for you) of poor spine habits and behavior. You are not",
