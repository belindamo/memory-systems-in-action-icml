Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n\n**3. Disconnect from screens**: Avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs, etc.) for at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light they emit can interfere with your sleep.\n\n**4. Practice relaxation techniques**: Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga to calm your mind and body.\n\n**5. Get ready for bed**: Brush your teeth, change into comfy PJs, and prepare your bed for a cozy night's sleep.\n\n**6. Limit stimulating activities**: Avoid stimulating activities like exercise, playing video games, or watching exciting movies at least 2-3 hours before bedtime.\n\n**7. Try a warm drink**: Enjoy a warm, non-caffeinated drink like tea, milk, or herbal tea to help you relax.\n\n**8. Write in a journal**: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help process your day and clear your mind before sleep.\n\n**9. Get some fresh air**: Take a short walk outside or open a window to let in some fresh air and clear your mind.\n\n**10. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep**: Ensure you're getting enough sleep each night to feel rested and refreshed for the next day.\n\n**11. Try aromatherapy**: Certain scents like lavender, vanilla, and chamomile can promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.\n\n**12.
