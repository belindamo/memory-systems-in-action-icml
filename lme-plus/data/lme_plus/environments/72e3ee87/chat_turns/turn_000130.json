Here is the revised response from the user's perspective:\n\nI think I'll implement these suggestions by scheduling regular email maintenance sessions and using the \"One Touch Rule\" to handle new emails immediately. I'll also make sure to keep my filters up-to-date and use automation tools to streamline my email management process.

Thanks for the helpful tips!",
