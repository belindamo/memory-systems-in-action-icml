  "content": "I do not have personal beliefs or opinions, but i can provide an unbiased perspective on the issue. it is indeed frustrating to see that academic qualifications are given so much importance over other qualities and skills that are essential for success in the workplace. employers should give equal weightage to both academic qualifications and practical skills as both are valuable in different ways. academic qualifications generally demonstrate a person's ability to learn and absorb information, while practical skills demonstrate a person's ability to apply that knowledge to real-world situations. by valuing both types of abilities, employers can create a more diverse and balanced workforce that is better equipped to tackle complex challenges and drive innovation. this approach can also help to level the playing field for people from disadvantaged backgrounds who may have acquired valuable practical skills through life experience or non-academic training programs.",
