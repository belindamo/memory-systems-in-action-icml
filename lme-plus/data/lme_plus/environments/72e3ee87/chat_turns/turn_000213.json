  "content": "Excessive focus on academic qualifications can impact representation and inclusion of those from disadvantaged backgrounds in Western workplaces in several ways:\n\n1. Limited access to higher education: Students from disadvantaged backgrounds may face financial, social or cultural barriers to accessing higher education. As a result, they may not be able to obtain the necessary academic qualifications required for certain roles in Western workplaces.\n\n2. Reinforcement of social inequalities: Overreliance on academic qualifications can reinforce inequalities as academic achievement can be influenced by social, economic and cultural factors. This means that people from more privileged backgrounds are more likely to excel academically and be better positioned to secure high-paying jobs.\n\n3. Narrow definition of talent: Excessive focus on academic qualifications may lead employers to overlook other important qualities and skills such as creativity, problem-solving, leadership and teamwork, which may not be captured by academic qualifications. This means that people from disadvantaged backgrounds who may possess these qualities but lack the academic credentials may be excluded from job opportunities.\n\n4. Lack of diversity in the workplace: A narrow focus on academic qualifications can lead to a lack of diversity in the workplace as people from diverse backgrounds may not have equal access to academic qualifications due to systemic barriers in education or careers, cultural bias or discrimination.\n\n5. Stifled innovation and progress: Overreliance on academic qualifications can lead to a narrow view of what constitutes knowledge and expertise, stifling innovation, and progress. It can also create homogeneity in the workplace, where employees lack diverse experiences and perspectives, and innovation suffers as a result.",
