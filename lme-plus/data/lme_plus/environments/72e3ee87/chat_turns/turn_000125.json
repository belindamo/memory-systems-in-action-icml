Tackling your \"Touch Once\" system right after your morning tidy will help you create a sense of momentum and set a productive tone for the day.\n\nNow, let's tackle that digital clutter! Organizing your computer files and folders can be a daunting task, but with a solid system, you'll be able to find what you need quickly and reduce digital stress. Here are some suggestions to get you started:\n\n1. **Create a clear folder hierarchy**: Set up a logical folder structure that mirrors your physical filing system. This will help you navigate your digital files more easily. For example:\n\t* Documents > Work > Projects > [Project Name]\n\t* Documents > Personal > Finance > [Year]\n2. **Use descriptive file names**: Use clear, concise, and descriptive file names that include keywords. This will help you search for files quickly and avoid duplicates. For example:\n\t* \"Smith_Project_Proposal_2023.docx\"\n\t* \"2022_Tax_Return_PDF.pdf\"\n3. **Use tags and labels**: Most operating systems and cloud storage services allow you to add tags or labels to files. Use these to categorize files by type, project, or deadline. This will enable you to filter and search files more efficiently.\n4. **Purge unnecessary files**: Be ruthless \u2013 if you don't need it, delete it! Remove duplicates, outdated files, and unnecessary documents. This will help declutter your digital space and reduce storage needs.\n5. **Designate a \"Someday\" folder**: Create a folder for files that don't have a deadline or can be dealt with later. This will help you clear your main folders and focus on priority tasks.\n6. **Use cloud storage**: Consider using cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive to store and sync your files across devices. This will help you access your files from anywhere and reduce the risk of data loss.\n7. **Set up a regular backup system**: Regularly back up your files to an external hard drive or cloud storage service to ensure your data is safe in case of a disaster.\n8. **Create a \"Digital Landing Strip\"**: Designate a specific folder or area on your computer as a \"Digital Landing Strip\" where you'll place new files and documents. This will help you process and organize new files more efficiently.\n\nRemember, the key to maintaining a organized digital space is to create a system that works for you and stick to it consistently.\n\nHow do you think you'll approach organizing your computer files and folders? Do you have any specific challenges or areas of concern?",
