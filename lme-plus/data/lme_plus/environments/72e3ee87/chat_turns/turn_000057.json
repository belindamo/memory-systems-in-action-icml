Make sure to check their websites, reviews, and testimonials to get an idea of their expertise and reputation.\n\n**Referrals:**\nAsking friends and family for referrals can be incredibly valuable. They may have had a positive experience with an appraiser in the past, and their recommendation can give you confidence in the appraiser's abilities.\n\n**Multiple Appraisals:**\nNow, about getting multiple appraisals for each item... It's not necessary to get multiple appraisals for each item, but it's not a bad idea either. Here are some scenarios where multiple appraisals might be beneficial:\n\n1. **High-value or rare items:** If you have an extremely rare or high-value item, it may be worth getting multiple appraisals to ensure accuracy and to provide a range of values.\n2. **Complex or unusual items:** If you have an item that's difficult to appraise or has unique characteristics, multiple appraisals can help provide a more comprehensive understanding of its value.\n3. **Insurance requirements:** Some insurance companies may require multiple appraisals or a second opinion to validate the value of an item.\n\nHowever, for most cases, one appraisal report from a reputable and certified appraiser should be sufficient.\n\n**Pros and Cons of Multiple Appraisals:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Provides a range of values and opinions\n* Can increase confidence in the appraisal value\n* May be required by insurance companies\n\nCons:\n\n* Increased cost (you'll need to pay for each appraisal)\n* May lead to conflicting opinions or values\n* Can be time-consuming and delay the insurance process\n\nIf you do decide to get multiple appraisals, make sure to:\n\n1. **Choose appraisers from different organizations:** Select appraisers from different organizations, such as NAJA and ASA, to ensure a diverse range of opinions.\n2. **Compare apples to apples:** Ensure each appraiser is evaluating the item using the same criteria and methodology.\n3. **Review and reconcile differences:** If the appraisals result in significantly different values, review the reports carefully and reconcile the differences to determine a fair market value.\n\nRemember, the goal is to get an accurate and reliable appraisal value, not to shop for the highest value.",
