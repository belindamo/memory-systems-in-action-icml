  "content": "To address this issue and ensure that people from disadvantaged backgrounds have equal opportunities in Western workplaces, the following can be done:\n\n1. Broaden the definition of talent: Employers should broaden their definition of talent beyond academic achievement to consider a wider range of skills, qualities and experiences that are relevant to the job. This can help to create a more inclusive workplace culture where people from diverse backgrounds are valued for their unique talents.\n\n2. Improve access to education: Governments and employers could work together to improve access to education for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, by providing financial support, mentorship and guidance programs, and other resources to help overcome social, economic and cultural barriers to higher education.\n\n3. Implement diversity and inclusion policies: Employers should implement diversity and inclusion policies to ensure that they are actively recruiting, retaining, and promoting people from diverse backgrounds. This can help to create a workplace culture that values diversity and promotes equality.\n\n4. Offer alternative pathways to employment: Employers should offer alternative pathways to employment, such as apprenticeships, traineeships and internships, which allow people from disadvantaged backgrounds to gain work experience and develop skills and knowledge without necessarily requiring a university degree.\n\n5. Address biases and stereotypes: Employers should be aware of their unconscious biases and stereotypes that may hinder the recruitment and promotion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds. They should take active steps to address these biases and promote equality in the workplace.",
