  "content": "I'm definitely Team Elphaba! I love her complexity and depth as a character, and her songs are so powerful and emotional. My favorite song from the show is probably \"Defying Gravity\" - it's just such an iconic and uplifting anthem.\n\nI've never really explored opera or ballet before, but I'm always open to new experiences! I've heard that opera can be really dramatic and over-the-top, which might be right up my alley. Do you have any recommendations for beginners?\n\nOh, and by the way, I should mention that I watched the movie adaptation of \"Dear Evan Hansen\" on Amazon Prime recently, and it really got me in the mood for more musicals.",
