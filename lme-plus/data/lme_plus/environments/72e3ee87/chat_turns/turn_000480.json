Here are some key tips to help you fine-tune your nutrition plan:\n\n**Carbohydrate Loading (2-3 weeks out)**\n\n1. **Increase Carbohydrate Intake**: Gradually increase your daily carbohydrate intake to 3-4 grams per kilogram of body weight. Focus on complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n2. **Periodized Carbohydrate Intake**: Alternate between high-carbohydrate and moderate-carbohydrate days to optimize glycogen storage and reduce muscle fatigue.\n\n**Hydration and Electrolytes (2-3 weeks out)**\n\n1. **Hydrate Adequately**: Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day, and make sure to drink 16-20 ounces of water or a sports drink 1-2 hours before the event.\n2. **Electrolyte-Rich Foods**: Include electrolyte-rich foods like bananas, avocados, nuts, and seeds in your diet to help regulate fluid balance.\n\n**Protein and Amino Acids (2-3 weeks out)**\n\n1. **Adequate Protein Intake**: Ensure you're consuming 1.2-1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight from sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based options.\n2. ** Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)**: Consider adding BCAA supplements or consuming BCAA-rich foods like lean meats, fish, and eggs to help reduce muscle damage and fatigue.\n\n**Race-Day Nutrition (June 19th)**\n\n1. **Pre-Race Meal**: Eat a balanced meal with complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats 2-3 hours before the event.
