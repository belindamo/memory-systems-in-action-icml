The most common contingency plan for rain is to delay the race until the weather improves, or to postpone it until the following day.\n\nIn recent years, the Daytona International Speedway has also invested in a state-of-the-art weather monitoring system that allows race officials to track approaching storms with greater accuracy. This system provides advanced warning of inclement weather, which allows officials to make more informed decisions regarding race delays and cancellations.\n\nAdditionally, the speedway is equipped with a number of safety measures, including lightning detection systems and evacuation plans in case of severe weather.
