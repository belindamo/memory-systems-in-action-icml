  "content": "Outside Lands is an amazing festival, and you're in for a treat! Both exploring the smaller stages and catching the headliners are great ways to experience the festival, but I'd recommend a mix of both. Here's why:\n\n**Discovering new artists on smaller stages:**\n\n1. **Uncover hidden gems**: You might stumble upon an act that becomes your new favorite band. Many notable artists have been discovered at festivals like Outside Lands.\n2. **Intimate settings**: Smaller stages often provide a more intimate setting, allowing you to connect with the artists and the music on a deeper level.\n3. **Less crowded**: You'll likely encounter smaller crowds, making it easier to get close to the stage and enjoy the performance without feeling overwhelmed.\n4. **Diverse lineup**: Outside Lands features a diverse range of genres and acts on the smaller stages, so you might discover new sounds and styles you haven't explored before.\n\n**Catching headliners and well-known acts:**\n\n1. **Iconic performances**: Headliners like Tame Impala and The 1975 are sure to deliver unforgettable performances that will be talked about for years to come.\n2. **High-energy crowds**: The main stages tend to draw larger crowds, creating an electric atmosphere that's hard to match.\n3. **Production quality**: The production values for headlining acts are often top-notch, with elaborate lighting, sound, and visual effects that enhance the overall experience.\n4. **Sing-along moments**: You'll likely know many of the songs by heart, making it a great opportunity to sing along with fellow fans and create unforgettable memories.\n\n**Tips for balancing both:**\n\n1. **Plan ahead**: Check the schedule and prioritize the acts you want to see. Make time for both headliners and smaller stage performances.\n2. **Arrive early**: Get to the festival grounds early to explore the smaller stages and discover new artists before the headliners take the stage.\n3. **Take breaks**: Take breaks between sets to grab food, explore the festival grounds, or simply rest your ears. This will help you pace yourself and make the most of your day.\n4. **Be flexible**: Be open to changes in the schedule or unexpected discoveries. You might stumble upon an amazing act that you hadn't planned to see, and that's part of the festival magic!\n\nBy balancing your time between the smaller stages and the headliners, you'll get the best of both worlds and make the most of your Outside Lands experience. Have an amazing time at the festival!",
