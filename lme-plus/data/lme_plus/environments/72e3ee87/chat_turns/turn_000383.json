I'm particularly interested in learning more about Indian history, so I think I'll start with \"The Wonder That Was India\" and \"The Story of India\" documentary series. I've also been wanting to learn more about Hinduism, so I'll check out \"The Hindus: An Alternative History\". Can you recommend any Indian music or movies that might help me connect with my cultural heritage?",
