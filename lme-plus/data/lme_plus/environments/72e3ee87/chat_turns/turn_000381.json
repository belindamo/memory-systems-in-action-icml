  "content": "I just got back from a cultural festival in my neighborhood and it got me thinking about my own cultural identity. As an Indian American, I often feel like I'm caught between two cultures - I'm proud of my Indian heritage, but I don't fully fit in with traditional Indian culture, and at the same time, I don't fully identify with American culture either. Can you recommend some resources for learning more about Indian culture and history?",
