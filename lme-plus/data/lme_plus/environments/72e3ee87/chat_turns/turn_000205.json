  "content": "It looks like your data model is designed to keep track of users, their Discord and JIRA IDs, and the rules that govern which users should be mentioned in a Discord server based on JIRA webhook events. Here are a few suggestions based on this data model:\n\n1. Consider adding fields to the User model to store additional information about the user, such as their name or email address. This could be useful for identifying and addressing users in Discord messages.\n2. You may want to consider adding a field to the EventRule model to specify the Discord channel that users should be mentioned in. This could allow you to mention users in different channels based on the type of event.\n3. Consider adding a field to the UserType model to specify the default behavior for mentioning users when an event occurs. For example, you might want to mention all users of a certain type by default, unless they are explicitly excluded by an EventRule.\n4. You might also want to consider adding a field to the EventRule model to specify the JIRA project or issue type that the rule applies to. This could allow you to tailor your bot's behavior to different types of issues or projects.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like more information on any of these points.",
