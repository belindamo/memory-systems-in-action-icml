  "content": "You make a fair point! The indie-electronic genre did indeed experience a rise in popularity during the early 2000s, which means that there were a lot of artists experimenting with similar sounds and techniques. Some notable contemporaries of The Postal Service include bands like Death Cab for Cutie, The Shins, and Modest Mouse, as well as electronic artists like Aphex Twin, Four Tet, and Boards of Canada.\n\nThat being said, while The Postal Service's sound may not have been entirely novel at the time, they did manage to put their own unique spin on it. Their use of acoustic instruments and vocal layering, as I mentioned earlier, helps to differentiate them from other indie-electronic artists. Additionally, their lyrics and themes are very specific to their band, with references to mailboxes, postcards, and other postal-related imagery weaving throughout their discography.\n\nSo while The Postal Service's sound may not be entirely unique, their ability to combine different genres and create a distinctive aesthetic has helped them stand the test of time and continue to resonate with listeners today.",
