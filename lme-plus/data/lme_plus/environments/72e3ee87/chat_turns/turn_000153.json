It shows that you're interested in her and value the connection you made.\n\nRemember to be genuine, authentic, and respectful in your approach. Don't try to sell or pitch anything too aggressively, but instead focus on building a relationship and exploring potential opportunities for collaboration or mutual support.\n\nAlso, be sure to follow up promptly and respond to any messages or emails from Sarah in a timely manner. This will show that you're interested in continuing the conversation and value her time.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your follow-up email or LinkedIn connection request, and I hope it leads to a fruitful conversation and potential collaboration with Sarah!",
