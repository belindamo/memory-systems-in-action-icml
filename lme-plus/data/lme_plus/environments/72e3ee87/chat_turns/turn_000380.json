  "content": "Team Elphaba all the way! \"Defying Gravity\" is an incredible song, and it's a great choice for a favorite. Elphaba's character arc is so compelling, and her music is just stunning.\n\nOpera and ballet can be intimidating if you're new to them, but they're definitely worth exploring. Opera is known for its drama and grandeur, so if you enjoy musical theater, you might find opera appealing. Here are some beginner-friendly recommendations:\n\n**Opera:**\n\n1. **La Boh\u00e8me**: A classic Puccini opera about young artists living in Paris, featuring beautiful music and a relatable story.\n2. **The Magic Flute**: A Mozart opera with a fantastical storyline, catchy music, and a sense of wonder.\n3. **Carmen**: A Bizet opera with a fiery protagonist, memorable music, and a dramatic plot.\n\n**Ballet:**\n\n1. **Swan Lake**: A classic ballet with beautiful music, stunning choreography, and a timeless story.\n2. **The Nutcracker**: A festive ballet perfect for the holiday season, with enchanting music and delightful characters.\n3. **Giselle**: A romantic ballet with a haunting story, beautiful music, and exquisite dancing.\n\nThese are all great introductions to opera and ballet, and they're relatively accessible for beginners. You can find recordings or live performances online or in your local area.\n\nI'm glad you mentioned the \"Dear Evan Hansen\" movie adaptation! It's a great way to experience the story and music, and it's wonderful that it got you in the mood for more musicals.
