King) - This is an English translation of an ancient Gnostic text that portrays Mary Magdalene as a leading disciple and visionary.\n\n2. \"Mary Magdalene, The First Apostle: The Struggle for Authority\" by Ann Graham Brock - This book argues that Mary Magdalene was an important leader in early Christianity and that her authority was later suppressed by the male-dominated church hierarchy.\n\n3. \"The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament\" by Jane Schaberg - This book examines the various legends and apocryphal texts that feature Mary Magdalene, as well as her depiction in the New Testament.\n\n4. \"The Hidden Gospel: Decoding the Spiritual Message of the Aramaic Jesus\" by Neil Douglas-Klotz - This book offers a unique interpretation of Jesus' teachings based on the original Aramaic language and cultural context, which includes a more positive and central role for Mary Magdalene.\n\nThese sources can help provide a broader perspective on the status and significance of Mary Magdalene in early Christianity, particularly from a feminist theological perspective.",
