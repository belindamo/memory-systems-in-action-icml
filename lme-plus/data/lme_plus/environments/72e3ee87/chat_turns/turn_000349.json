  "content": "Sure!\n\n`ADDR_MX_TORQUE_ENABLE` and `ADDR_MX_GOAL_POSITION` are addresses of control table items in the Dynamixel servo's memory.\n\n`ADDR_MX_TORQUE_ENABLE` is the address of the control table item that enables or disables the servo's torque. When the torque is enabled (i.e., set to 1), the servo can move and maintain its position under load. When the torque is disabled (i.e., set to 0), the servo is free to rotate and doesn't maintain its position under load.\n\n`ADDR_MX_GOAL_POSITION` is the address of the control table item that sets the servo's goal position. The goal position is the position that the servo will move to when it receives a command to move. The value of the goal position is a 2-byte integer, with a range of 0 to 1023 for most Dynamixel servos. The actual position of the servo is stored in another control table item at address `ADDR_MX_PRESENT_POSITION`.\n\nIn the example code, `ADDR_MX_TORQUE_ENABLE` and `ADDR_MX_GOAL_POSITION` are used to enable the torque on the servo and set the servo's goal position, respectively. The `setServoPosition()` function takes an integer argument representing the desired goal position, checks that it is within the limits of the servo, and then writes it to the `ADDR_MX_GOAL_POSITION` control table item using the `packetHandler->write4ByteTxRx()` function.",
