  "content": "\"Way Down Hadestown\" is an amazing song! The whole soundtrack is just incredible, and Ana\u00efs Mitchell's lyrics are so clever and poignant.\n\nIt sounds like you have a great taste in musicals! \"Hamilton\", \"Dear Evan Hansen\", \"Waitress\", and \"The Greatest Showman\" are all amazing shows with incredible music. I'm sure you'll love the new recommendations I suggested earlier.\n\nYour movie marathon sounds like so much fun! \"Chicago\", \"Moulin Rouge\", and \"Sweeney Todd\" are all classics, and they're perfect for a cozy night in. Homemade pizza is the best, too!\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to see \"Wicked\" when it comes to town! It's such an iconic musical, and it's always a treat to see it live. Making a whole day of it with your sister sounds like a great plan - you'll have to take lots of photos and enjoy every moment of it!\n\nSince you mentioned \"Wicked\", I have to ask: are you Team Elphaba or Team Glinda? And do you have a favorite song from the show?\n\nAlso, have you thought about exploring other forms of musical theater, like opera or ballet? There are some amazing productions out there that might interest you, and I'd be happy to recommend some!",
