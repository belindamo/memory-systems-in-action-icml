Through a range of works by talented artists, we aim to challenge the dominant ideologies perpetuated by the toy industry and invite you to question your own relationship with play and consumption.\n\nEach piece on display will offer a unique perspective on these themes, exploring topics such as the commodification of play, the infantilization of adulthood, the manipulation of cultural symbols, and the impact of waste and pollution on the environment.
