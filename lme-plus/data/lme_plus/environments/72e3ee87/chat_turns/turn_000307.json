Start with mild dishes: Begin with dishes that are known to be less spicy, like Pesarattu Dosa or Ulava Charu. This will help your taste buds adjust to the flavors gradually. 2. Ask the server for recommendations: If you are unsure about which dishes to order, ask the server or chef for their recommendations. They will be able to suggest dishes that are flavorful but not overly spicy. 3. Use yogurt or milk: Yogurt or milk can help neutralize the spiciness in your mouth. You can take a small spoonful of yogurt or sip some milk after a particularly fiery dish. 4. Avoid bite-sized chillies: If you are served whole chillies with your dish, avoid biting into them as it can make the dish even spicier. Instead, remove them from the dish or set them aside. 5. Take breaks: If you feel overwhelmed by the spiciness, take a break from eating and sip some water or a non-spicy drink. This will help you freshen up your taste buds and prepare for the next dish. Remember that the spiciness is an integral part of the flavors of Guntur cuisine. If you take it slow and use these tips, you will be able to enjoy the unique flavors of the region without overwhelming your taste buds.",
