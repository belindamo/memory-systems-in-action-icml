I'd be happy to help you create a daily routine that fits in your love for Crash Course episodes.\n\nTo get started, I'll need to know a bit more about your schedule and preferences. Please answer the following questions:\n\n1. What time do you wake up and go to bed on a typical day?\n2. What are your work/school hours? (If you're a student, assume a standard 8-hour school day)\n3. How long is your lunch break?\n4. How many Crash Course episodes do you want to watch daily? (Assuming 10-15 minute episodes)\n5. Are there any other activities you want to prioritize in your daily routine, such as exercise, reading, or hobbies?\n6. Do you have any fixed appointments or commitments that you need to schedule around (e.g., classes, meetings, family time)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a daily routine that incorporates your Crash Course episodes, lunch break, and other important activities.\n\nAnd, by the way, you're doing great on the Science series! Episode 10 is a big milestone. Keep it up, and you'll be a science whiz in no time!",
