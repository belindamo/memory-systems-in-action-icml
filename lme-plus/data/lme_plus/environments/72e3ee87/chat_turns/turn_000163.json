  "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to recommend some sunscreen brands that are safe for sensitive skin and have an SPF of 30 or higher! Here are a few options:\n\n1. Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Sunscreen: This sunscreen is designed specifically for sensitive skin and has an SPF of 60. It's oil-free, fragrance-free, and non-comedogenic, which means it won't clog your pores.\n\n2. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral: This sunscreen is a great option for those with sensitive skin and provides broad-spectrum protection with an SPF of 50. It's also free of fragrances, parabens, and other potential irritants.\n\n3. Aveeno Protect + Hydrate Sunscreen: This sunscreen is formulated with oatmeal, which can soothe and moisturize dry or sensitive skin. It offers broad-spectrum protection with an SPF of 50 and is free of fragrances and oils.\n\n4. Cotz Sensitive Sunscreen: This sunscreen is specifically designed for sensitive and acne-prone skin and has an SPF of 40. It's free of fragrances, oils, and chemical sunscreens, which can be irritating to some people.\n\nRemember to always test new products on a small patch of your skin before applying them all over your face or body. It's also important to reapply sunscreen every few hours, especially if you're spending a lot of time outside.",
