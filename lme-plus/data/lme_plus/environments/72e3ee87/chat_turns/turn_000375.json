  "content": "I think what I love most about musicals is how they can convey complex emotions and tell stories in a way that's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I've been listening to a lot of musical soundtracks on Spotify lately, and I recently discovered the musical \"Hadestown\" which I've been listening to nonstop. I even made a playlist with all my favorite show tunes and have been listening to it on my daily commute.",
