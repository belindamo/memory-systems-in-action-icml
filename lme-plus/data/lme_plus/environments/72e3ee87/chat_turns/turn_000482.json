A proper bike fit can help you maintain a comfortable riding position, reduce the risk of injury, and improve your overall cycling efficiency. Here are some tips to help you get a proper bike fit:\n\n**1. Get a Professional Bike Fit**: Consider consulting a professional bike fitter who has experience with triathlon bikes and athletes. They will assess your riding style, flexibility, and body geometry to ensure a customized fit.\n\n**2. Know Your Measurements**: Take your measurements before getting a bike fit. You'll need to know your:\n\n\t* Inseam (crotch to floor)\n\t* Arm length (armpit to wrist)\n\t* Torso length (shoulder to hip)\n\t* Leg length (hip to ankle)\n\n**3. Saddle Height and Fore/Aft Position**:\n\n\t* Saddle height: Your leg should be almost fully extended when the pedal is in its lowest position. A slight bend in the knee (10-15\u00b0) is ideal.\n\t* Fore/aft position: The saddle should be positioned so that your knee is directly above the pedal spindle when the pedal is in its 3 o'clock position.\n\n**4. Handlebar Height and Reach**:\n\n\t* Handlebar height: The handlebars should be at a height that allows you to maintain a comfortable riding position with your elbows slightly bent (10-15\u00b0).\n\t* Reach: The distance between the saddle and handlebars should allow you to maintain a comfortable riding position with your arms relaxed and your back straight.\n\n**5. Stem Length and Angle**:\n\n\t* Stem length: The stem should be long enough to allow you to maintain a comfortable riding position with your arms relaxed and your back straight.\n\t* Stem angle: The stem angle should be adjusted to allow you to maintain a comfortable riding position with your back straight and your arms relaxed.\n\n**6. Cleat Position**:\n\n\t* Cleat position: The cleats should be positioned so that your foot is centered over the pedal and your ankle is in a neutral position.\n\n**7. Check Your Riding Position**:\n\n\t* Sit on the bike with your hands on the hoods or drops.\n\t* Your back should be straight, and your shoulders should be relaxed.\n\t* Your knees should be bent at a 10-15\u00b0 angle when the pedal is in its lowest position.\n\t* Your feet should be flat on the pedals or slightly pointed downwards.\n\n**8. Consider a Bike Fit Session**:\n\n\t* Many bike shops offer bike fit sessions, which typically include a thorough assessment of your riding position and adjustments to the bike to optimize your fit.\n\t* A bike fit session can help you identify any issues with your riding position and make adjustments to improve your comfort, efficiency, and performance.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to get a proper bike fit and optimize your cycling performance. Remember to consult a professional bike fitter if you're unsure about any aspect of the bike fit process. Good luck with your triathlon training, and I hope you have a great ride on June 19th!",
