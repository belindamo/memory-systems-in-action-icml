I've been using a lot of random folders and vague file names, so I think that's where I'll start. I also like the idea of a \"Digital Landing Strip\" - that will help me stay on top of new files and documents. One thing I'm struggling with is dealing with email clutter. I have thousands of unread emails in my inbox, and it's overwhelming. Do you have any suggestions on how to tackle that?",
