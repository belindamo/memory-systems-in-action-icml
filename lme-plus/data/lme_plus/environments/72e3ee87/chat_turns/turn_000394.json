Here are some tips to help you improve your display and build on your success:\n\n1. **Eye-catching Visuals**: Create a visually appealing display that grabs attention from a distance. Use vibrant colors, patterns, and textures to make your products stand out. Consider using tablecloths, banners, or signs to add visual interest.\n2. **Product Grouping**: Group similar products together (e.g., all soaps, all jams, all candles) to create a cohesive look. This makes it easier for customers to browse and compare products.\n3. **Tiered Display**: Use risers, crates, or shelves to create a tiered display. This adds depth and makes your products more visible from different angles.\n4. **Product Facing**: Ensure that your products are facing forward and are easily accessible to customers. This encourages them to pick up and examine your products.\n5. **Signage**: Clearly label each product with prices, ingredients, and any relevant information. Consider using chalkboard signs or labels to add a personal touch.\n6. **Demonstrations**: Consider offering demonstrations or samples of your products. This allows customers to experience your products firsthand and can increase sales.\n7. **Personal Touches**: Add personal touches, such as decorative elements or plants, to create a welcoming atmosphere. This helps customers connect with your brand and feel more comfortable approaching your stand.\n8. **Easy Payment**: Make it easy for customers to pay by having a clear and visible payment system in place. Consider using a credit card reader or a cash box with a sign indicating prices.\n9. **Engage with Customers**: Greet customers warmly and be prepared to answer questions about your products. Engage with them, share your story, and provide excellent customer service to build loyalty and encourage repeat business.\n10. **Rotate Products**: Rotate your products regularly to keep your display fresh and interesting. This encourages customers to explore your stand more thoroughly and can help you identify which products are most popular.\n11. **Weather Protection**: Be prepared for outdoor market conditions by bringing a canopy, weights, and protective covers to ensure your products and display are safe from the elements.\n12. **Take Photos**: Take photos of your display and products to use on social media or for future marketing purposes.
