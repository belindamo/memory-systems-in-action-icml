  "content": "It depends on the store and the size of their inventory. Some stores, especially larger ones, may have more sophisticated inventory management systems in place that allow them to have a high level of visibility into their inventory. These systems may include software that tracks inventory levels in real-time and alerts store personnel when it is time to reorder. However, smaller stores or stores with less complex inventory systems may not have the same level of visibility into their inventory. In general, though, most retailers try to maintain as much control over their inventory as possible in order to optimize sales and minimize waste.",
