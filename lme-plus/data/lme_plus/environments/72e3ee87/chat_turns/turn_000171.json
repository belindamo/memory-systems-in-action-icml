They're known for being super soft and lightweight, similar to cashmere.\n\t* Look for their Relaxed-Fit or Classic-Fit sweaters in neutral colors like beige, cream, or light gray.\n\t* They often have sales on their loungewear, so keep an eye out for discounts on sweatshirts, hoodies, and joggers.\n2. **Target:**\n\t* Check out their Cat & Jack or Art Class brands for comfortable, affordable loungewear.\n\t* Their Threshold brand offers a range of soft, lightweight sweaters in neutral colors.\n\t* Look for their Cozy Sweaters or Soft-Knit Tops in beige, cream, or gray.

Super-soft cotton or cotton-blend fabrics\n4. Faux cashmere or synthetic materials that mimic the feel of cashmere\n\nRemember to check the sizing charts and reviews to ensure the best fit.
