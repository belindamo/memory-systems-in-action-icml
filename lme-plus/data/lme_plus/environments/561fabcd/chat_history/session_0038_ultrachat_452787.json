Fried chicken: Fried chicken is a classic indulgence. Opt for baked chicken instead of deep-fried, and use healthy seasonings like garlic and herbs.\n\n4. Nachos: Nachos can be an indulgent snack. Limit portion sizes and choose toppings like fresh salsa, black beans, and avocado rather than processed cheese and sour cream.\n\nRemember, indulging in junk food occasionally is okay, but make sure to balance it out with plenty of fresh, healthy foods and regular exercise to maintain overall health and well-being."
