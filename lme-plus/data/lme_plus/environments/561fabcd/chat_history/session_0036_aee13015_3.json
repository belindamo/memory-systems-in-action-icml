      "content": "Both \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Narcos\" are highly acclaimed and engaging shows. Here's the episode and season information you requested:\n\n**Breaking Bad**\n\n* Total episodes: 62\n* Seasons: 5 (available on Netflix in the US)\n* Episode length: Approximately 45-60 minutes each\n\n**Narcos**\n\n* Total episodes: 30 (across 3 seasons)\n* Seasons: 3 (available on Netflix in the US)\n* Episode length: Approximately 45-60 minutes each\n\nNote that both shows are complete series, meaning all episodes are available on Netflix, and there won't be any new seasons or episodes added.\n\nTo give you a rough idea of the time commitment, here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Breaking Bad**: 62 episodes x 50 minutes (avg. episode length) = around 31 hours of viewing time\n* **Narcos**: 30 episodes x 50 minutes (avg. episode length) = around 15 hours of viewing time\n\nBoth shows are well-paced and engaging, so you might find yourself binge-watching several episodes in a row!\n\nBefore you start, keep in mind that both shows deal with mature themes, strong language, and graphic content, so viewer discretion is advised."

      "content": "\"The Walking Dead\" is a priority, isn't it? Don't worry, I've got you covered!\n\nThe next season of \"The Walking Dead\" is Season 11, and it's expected to premiere on **August 22, 2021**, on AMC. This will be the final season of the show, and it's been split into three parts, with a total of 24 episodes.\n\nIf you're planning to finish \"Breaking Bad\" before the new season of \"The Walking Dead\" starts, you've got some time. With 62 episodes, you'd need to watch around 3-4 episodes per week to finish the entire series before August 22nd. That's definitely doable, but it depends on your viewing schedule and pace.\n\nIf you're concerned about not having enough time, you could always start with \"Narcos\" instead, which has fewer episodes (30) and might be a quicker binge. Alternatively, you could start \"Breaking Bad\" now and take breaks in between to catch up on other shows or movies. The important thing is to enjoy the show at your own pace!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"
