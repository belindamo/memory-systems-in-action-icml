That's one less thing to worry about, and you can start looking forward to your stay in Tokyo!\n\nRegarding your flight tickets, I hope you hear back from Sakura Travel Agency soon. If you're concerned about the delay, you might consider reaching out to them again to request an update on the status of your booking.\n\nIn the meantime, you can start thinking about other aspects of your trip, such as planning your itinerary, researching things to do and see in Tokyo, or looking into transportation options from the airport to your hotel (which we discussed earlier).\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to double-check your travel documents, including your flight itinerary and hotel reservation, to ensure everything is in order before your trip.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!",
