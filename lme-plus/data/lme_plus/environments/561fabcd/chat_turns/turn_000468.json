  "content": "I really like your ideas for the Fissionator! The AoE attack would definitely make it a formidable enemy and add a new level of challenge to the map. I also think the radiation poisoning effect fits well with the theme, and the idea of turning zombies into radioactive ones when it dies is a great way to introduce new enemies and keep the gameplay fresh.\n\nThe visual of the slime-parasite reacting to the radiation burst is also a nice touch, and adds a bit of horror to the encounter. Overall, I think the Fissionator would make a great addition to the game, and your ideas for its abilities and appearance are excellent.",
