It's always a good feeling to have everything organized and within reach.\n\nRegarding the universal power adapter, you're correct that you might not need one for Denver, as the outlets in hotels and public areas in the United States typically use standard Type A and Type B plugs, which are compatible with standard US plugs.\n\nIn the US, the standard voltage is 120V, and the standard frequency is 60Hz. Most modern devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, can handle this voltage and frequency range. However, it's always a good idea to check your device's power adapter to ensure it's compatible with US outlets.\n\nIf you're planning to visit other countries in the future, a universal power adapter can be a valuable investment. But for a trip to Denver, you can likely get by without one.\n\nTo be extra prepared, you might consider packing:\n\n* A spare charger or two for your devices, in case you need to charge multiple devices at once or if you lose one.\n* A small extension cord or power strip (as we discussed earlier) to ensure you have enough outlets for all your devices.\n\nBut for a trip to Denver, a universal power adapter is unlikely to be necessary.",
