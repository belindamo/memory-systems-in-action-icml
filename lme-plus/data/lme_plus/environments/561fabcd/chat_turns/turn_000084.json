  "content": "Although there are no planned missions to Uranus at the moment, some of its moons could be potential exploration targets for future spacecraft. Miranda, with its unique surface features, has been suggested as a particularly interesting target. Additionally, Ariel, which is believed to have a subsurface ocean, and Titania, which has a variety of geological features, could also be attractive exploration targets. Despite this potential, exploring Uranus and its moons would be a challenging task due to the considerable distance from Earth and the extreme cold and radiation environment in the Uranian system.",
