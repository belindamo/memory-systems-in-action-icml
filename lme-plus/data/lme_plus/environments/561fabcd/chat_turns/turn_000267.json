  "content": "While it's true that writing is writing and one can certainly become a great writer without any experience in comic books, it's important to acknowledge that the medium of comic books is unique and requires a particular set of skills that aren't necessarily developed through just writing traditional novels. The combination of visual storytelling, character design, and the pacing of comic books require a very specific approach to narrative that can be useful in other forms of writing as well. \n\nFurthermore, it's certainly not necessary to be a comic book writer in order to become a great novelist, but the experience that Gaiman gained from working in this medium gave him a unique perspective and approach to storytelling that has undoubtedly influenced his writing style. Additionally, Gaiman himself has spoken about the influence that comic books have had on his work, and has mentioned that his experience in that medium has contributed to his development as a writer.",
