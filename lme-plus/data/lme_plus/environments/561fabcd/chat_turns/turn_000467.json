This would also give an extra purpose to the vision-distortion it causes; not only is it a hindrance to the player, it's also a warning to not get any closer without risking your life. Perhaps the AoE damage would be nullified by Cosmic Cleanse, bht the vision effect would only be partially negated, leaving some of the challenge present if you get too close.\n\nAs for the Fissionator's attacks, I like the idea of them causing radiation poisoning! Maybe to add to this, the Fissionators death causes a radioactive burst that turns zombies into radioactive ones, upping their damage and making them, too, give the radiation effect when they attack the player. To signal this, maybe they could get a light green glow and you could see the slime-parasite within the host body reacting violently to the sudden radiation exposure",
