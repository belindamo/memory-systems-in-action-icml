  "content": "I completely agree that ultimately the quality of Neil Gaiman's writing should be judged on its own merit, regardless of his past experiences in any other field. While his experience in comics has undoubtedly had an impact on his writing style, it shouldn't be the sole focus of any discussion about his work. \n\nAt the end of the day, what truly matters is the quality of the writing itself and the impact that it has on readers. Neil Gaiman's work has resonated with countless readers around the world, and that is a testament to the strength of his writing and the stories that he tells. His success as a writer is due to his own talent, hard work, and creativity, and his contributions to literature should be valued for their own sake, regardless of where he gained his writing skills.",
