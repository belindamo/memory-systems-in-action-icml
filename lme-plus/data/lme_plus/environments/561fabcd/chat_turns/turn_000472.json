  "content": "Sure thing! Here are some potential design elements for the Fissionator:\n\n* The host body could be bloated and disfigured, with large tumors and blisters covering the skin. The skin itself could have a sickly green tint, as if it's being irradiated from within.\n* The parasite could be visible under the skin, writhing and pulsating in a disturbing way. It could be slimy and amorphous, constantly shifting and changing shape.\n* The host's eyes could be milky and glazed over, or maybe they're glowing with an eerie green light.\n* The Fissionator could have a hunched, lurching gait, as if its mutated body is too heavy to move properly.\n* Its movements could be jerky and spasmodic, as if it's in constant pain.\n* It could emit a low, guttural growl, or maybe it makes no noise at all aside from the sound of its heavy breathing.\n\nAs for the radiation effects, here are some ideas for how that could manifest:\n\n* The Fissionator could leave a trail of green, glowing slime wherever it goes. This slime could be dangerous to touch, causing radiation damage over time.\n* Its attacks could leave a lingering radiation field in their wake, causing damage to anyone standing in the affected area.\n* On death, the Fissionator could explode in a burst of radiation that transforms nearby zombies into radioactive ones, as you mentioned earlier.\n* Maybe its radiation effects are powerful enough to even affect the environment itself, causing objects to become irradiated and dangerous to touch.\n\nI hope these ideas help!",
