His talent and hard work have undoubtedly played the biggest role in his success as a writer, but it's also worth noting that his background in comics has had a significant impact on his writing style.\n\nWhile it's certainly not necessary for a writer to work in comics in order to become successful, the unique skills and techniques required in that medium can be beneficial for writers in other fields. Gaiman's experience in comics allowed him to experiment with a variety of storytelling techniques that he may not have been exposed to otherwise, and he was able to hone his skills in a way that would have been more difficult without that experience.\n\nUltimately, it's up to each individual writer to determine what experiences and influences have shaped their writing style. For Neil Gaiman, his experience in the comic book industry played a role in his development as a writer, but his talent and hard work are the primary reasons why he has become one of the most beloved authors of his generation.",
