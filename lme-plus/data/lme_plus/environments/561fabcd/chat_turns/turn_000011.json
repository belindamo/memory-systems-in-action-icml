When it comes to deciding between a percentage off or a fixed amount off, consider the following:\n\n**Percentage off:**\n\n1. **Flexibility**: A percentage off allows you to apply the discount to various products or bundles, making it easier to manage and promote.\n2. **Easy to calculate**: Buyers can easily calculate the discount themselves, which can reduce confusion and make the offer more appealing.\n3. **Perceived value**: A percentage off can create a sense of value and savings, especially if it's a higher percentage (e.g., 20% off).\n\n**Fixed amount off:**\n\n1. **Simple and clear**: A fixed amount off is easy to understand and communicate, making it clear what buyers will save.\n2. **Targeted promotion**: You can target specific products or bundles with a fixed amount off, making it a more focused promotion.\n3. **Limited scope**: A fixed amount off is usually applied to a specific product or range, which can help you manage inventory and minimize losses.\n\nConsider the following questions to help you decide between a percentage off or a fixed amount off:\n\n1. What is the average price range of your products? If your prices are relatively low, a fixed amount off might be more effective. If your prices are higher, a percentage off might be more appealing.\n2. What is the discount amount you're comfortable with? If you want to offer a more significant discount, a percentage off might be better. If you want to offer a smaller discount, a fixed amount off could be more suitable.\n3. How do you want to position your brand? A percentage off can create a sense of luxury and high-end value, while a fixed amount off can be more approachable and accessible.\n\nFor an early bird discount at the Downtown Art Festival, you might consider offering a fixed amount off (e.g., $10 off all purchases made before 12 pm) to create a sense of urgency and encourage people to visit your booth early. This can also help you drive sales and increase revenue during the slower morning hours.\n\nRemember to clearly communicate the discount terms and conditions, including any restrictions or limitations, to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth customer experience.",
