Here are some tips to help you attract more customers to your stall:\n\n**1. Eye-catching display**: Create a visually appealing display that showcases your products in an attractive and organized manner. Use risers, baskets, or shelves to add depth and visual interest.\n\n**2. Product grouping**: Group similar products together, such as all soap products or all candle products. This makes it easy for customers to find what they're looking for and compare products.\n\n**3. Signage**: Use clear and prominent signage to identify your business name, product names, and prices. This will help customers quickly understand what you're selling and how much it costs.\n\n**4. Product labeling**: Label each product with its name, ingredients, and price. This will help customers make informed purchasing decisions and reduce questions.\n\n**5. Demo products**: Display demo products or testers for customers to touch, smell, and experience.

Themed decor**: Add a touch of summer festivity to your stall with themed decor, such as balloons, flowers, or summer-themed tablecloths. This will help create a fun and inviting atmosphere.\n\n**7. Product placement**: Place your most popular or new products at eye-level or near the front of the stall to grab customers' attention.\n\n**8. Lighting**: Ensure good lighting in your stall to showcase your products in the best possible way. Consider using table lamps or string lights to add warmth and ambiance.\n\n**9. Interactive experience**: Create an interactive experience by offering free samples, hosting a \"make your own soap\" or \"candle-making\" station, or providing a \"scratch and sniff\" station for customers to explore.\n\n**10. Personal touch**: Add a personal touch to your stall by displaying personal stories, photos, or testimonials that showcase your passion and commitment to creating high-quality, handmade products.\n\n**Example display ideas:**\n\n* Create a \"Soap Bar\" with a sign that says \"Build Your Own Soap Bundle\" and offers customers the opportunity to choose from different scents and ingredients.\n* Set up a \"Candle Corner\" with a sign that says \"Find Your Perfect Scent\" and features a selection of candles in different fragrances.\n* Create a \"Summer Favorites\" section that showcases your best-selling products for the season.\n\nBy implementing these display tips, you'll be able to attract more customers to your stall, increase engagement, and ultimately drive sales.
