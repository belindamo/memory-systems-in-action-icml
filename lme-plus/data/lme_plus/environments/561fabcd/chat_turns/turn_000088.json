  "content": "As of now, there are no official plans for future missions to Uranus and its moons. However, there have been some proposals for missions to explore the Uranian system. Some of these proposals include the Uranus Pathfinder mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission, and the Uranus and Neptune Orbiter mission. These missions would involve sending spacecraft to orbit Uranus, land on one of its moons, and study the planet and its moons in detail. Despite these proposals, it is important to note that funding and support for these missions have not been secured, and they may not become a reality. However, the potential for future exploration of Uranus and its moons is always an exciting possibility!",
