  "content": "The error message suggests that the axes object being used in the `plt.scatter` function call is not an instance of `GeoAxes`, which is required for `transform=ccrs.Mercator()` to work.\n\nThis error might occur if the `axes` object was not created with the `projection=ccrs.Mercator()` argument. To fix this error, make sure that the `ax` object you are using in the scatter plot was created with the correct projection argument, as shown below:\n```scss\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=ccrs.Mercator())\n\nfor index, airport in airports_ireland.iterrows():\n    ax.scatter(float(airport['latitude']), float(airport['longitude']), marker='o', color='red', transform=ccrs.Mercator())\n```\nThis will create the `ax` object with the `Mercator` projection, and the `plt.scatter` function call should now work properly.",
