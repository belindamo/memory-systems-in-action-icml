  "content": "Korean-Style BBQ Beef is a staple in Korean cuisine, and it pairs perfectly with the spicy and crunchy kimchi slaw. I'd be happy to provide you with a simple recipe.\n\n**Korean-Style BBQ Beef Recipe**\n\nThis marinade is a classic Korean-style BBQ sauce, with a sweet and savory flavor profile. You can adjust the level of spiciness to your liking by adding more or less gochugaru.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 lb beef short ribs or thinly sliced beef (such as ribeye or sirloin), cut into bite-sized pieces\n* 1/2 cup soy sauce\n* 1/4 cup Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons garlic, minced\n* 2 tablespoons grated ginger\n* 2 tablespoons sesame oil\n* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a blender or food processor, combine soy sauce, gochugaru, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and black pepper. Blend until smooth.\n2. In a large bowl, combine the beef pieces and the marinade. Mix well to coat the beef evenly.\n3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n4. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the beef from the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off.\n5. Grill the beef for 3-4 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness.\n6. Let the beef rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain.\n\n**Serving Options:**\n\nYou can serve the Korean-Style BBQ Beef with either warm flour tortillas or steamed rice, depending on your personal preference. Here are some pros and cons of each option:\n\n* **Warm Flour Tortillas:** This will give your dish a more taco-like feel, and the tortillas will help to soak up the juices from the beef and kimchi slaw. You can also add some crispy kimchi slaw on top of the beef for extra crunch.\n* **Steamed Rice:** Serving the beef with steamed rice will provide a more traditional Korean-style meal. The rice will help to balance the spiciness from the kimchi slaw, and you can also add some kimchi on the side for extra flavor.\n\nIf you want to try something different, you could also serve the beef with a combination of both tortillas and rice. This way, you can have the best of both worlds!\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the steps.",
