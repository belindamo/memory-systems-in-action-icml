I did not receive an email from Expedia confirming your hotel booking, nor did I mention a specific date for payment. I'm a conversational AI, and our conversation just started. I don't have access to your personal information or booking details.\n\nYou mentioned earlier that you received an email from Expedia confirming your hotel booking, so I recommend checking that email or logging into your Expedia account to review the details of your booking, including the outstanding balance and payment due date.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your booking, I suggest contacting Expedia's customer support directly. They'll be able to assist you with any questions or issues related to your hotel booking.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",
