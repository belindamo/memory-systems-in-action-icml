  "content": "I'd love to see more of Ellie and Joel's story, but at the same time, I think Neil Druckmann's approach of not wanting to do a sequel just for the sake of it is the right one. The Last of Us Part II's story felt very complete and satisfying, and I think it's okay to leave some things open to interpretation. If they do decide to explore more stories within the universe, I'd be interested in seeing something focused on the Seraphites or the Fireflies, like you mentioned. Their ideologies and motivations were really intriguing, and I think there's a lot of potential for depth and complexity there.",
