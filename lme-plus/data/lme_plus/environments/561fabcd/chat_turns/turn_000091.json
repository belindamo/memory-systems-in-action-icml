  "content": "I'm thinking of starting a small herb garden on my balcony and I'm a bit unsure about the best potting soil to use. I've had a good experience with a specific potting mix for my African Violet plant, which I repotted into a slightly larger pot recently, but I'm not sure if it's suitable for herbs. Can you recommend a good potting soil for herbs like mint, cilantro, and parsley?",
