Here are some tips to help you determine the right prices for your handmade soaps and candles:\n\n1. **Calculate your costs**: Make a list of all the expenses involved in creating each product, including:\n\t* Materials (ingredients, packaging, etc.)\n\t* Time (labor costs, including preparation, production, and packaging)\n\t* Overheads (stall rental, transportation, marketing, etc.)\n\t* Any other relevant expenses (insurance, licenses, etc.)\n2. **Research the market**: Look at what similar products are selling for at the market, online, and in local stores. This will give you an idea of what customers are willing to pay.\n3. **Determine your target profit margin**: Decide how much profit you want to make on each item. A common range is 25-50% profit margin.\n4. **Consider the event**: Summer Fest is likely to attract a larger crowd than the Farmers' Market. You may want to adjust your prices slightly higher to take advantage of the increased foot traffic and demand.\n5. **Price per unit vs. price per ounce**: For soaps, consider pricing per unit (e.g., $5 per bar) or per ounce (e.g., $0.50 per ounce). For candles, price per unit is usually more common.\n6. **Tiered pricing**: Offer different sizes or variations of your products at different price points to appeal to a wider range of customers.\n7. **Psychological pricing**: Use pricing strategies like charm pricing (e.g., $4.99 instead of $5.00) or prestige pricing (e.g., $10.00 instead of $9.99) to influence customer perception.\n8. **Start with a base price**: Set a base price for each product and then adjust based on the event, competition, and customer feedback.\n9. **Be prepared to adjust**: Monitor your sales and customer feedback at the Summer Fest event, and be prepared to adjust your prices if needed.\n10. **Keep records**: Track your sales, expenses, and profit margins to refine your pricing strategy for future events.\n\nHere's an example of how you could apply these tips:\n\n**Soap:**\n\n* Material cost: $1.50 per bar\n* Labor cost: $2.00 per bar (based on 30 minutes of labor at $40/hour)\n* Overheads: $0.50 per bar (stall rental, transportation, etc.)\n* Total cost: $4.00 per bar\n* Target profit margin: 30%\n* Base price: $5.20 per bar\n* Adjusted price for Summer Fest: $5.50 per bar (to account for increased demand)\n\n**Candle:**\n\n* Material cost: $5.00 per candle\n* Labor cost: $3.00 per candle (based on 1 hour of labor at $30/hour)\n* Overheads: $1.00 per candle (stall rental, transportation, etc.)\n* Total cost: $9.00 per candle\n* Target profit margin: 40%\n* Base price: $12.60 per candle\n* Adjusted price for Summer Fest: $13.50 per candle (to account for increased demand)\n\nRemember to stay competitive, but also ensure you're making a profit. Good luck at the Summer Fest event!",
