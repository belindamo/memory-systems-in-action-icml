I'd be happy to help you plan your visit.\n\n**What is the Alamo?**\nThe Alamo is a former Spanish mission and one of the most famous landmarks in Texas. In 1836, a small group of Texan rebels, including legendary figures like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, defended the Alamo against the Mexican army, led by General Santa Anna, in a pivotal battle for Texas independence. Although the defenders ultimately lost the battle, their bravery and sacrifice inspired the Texans to continue fighting for independence, which they eventually won at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836.\n\n**Planning Your Visit:**\n\n1. **Location:** The Alamo is located in downtown San Antonio, at 300 Alamo Plaza, San Antonio, TX 78205.\n2. **Hours:** The Alamo is open daily from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with extended hours during peak season (March to October).\n3. **Admission:** Admission is free, although guided tours are available for a fee.\n4. **Getting There:** You can walk to the Alamo from many downtown hotels, including the ones I mentioned earlier.
