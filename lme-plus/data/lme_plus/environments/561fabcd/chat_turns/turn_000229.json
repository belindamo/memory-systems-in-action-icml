  "content": "Yes, you can file both a criminal case and a civil lawsuit against the person who robbed you. The criminal justice system is responsible for punishing the offender and upholding the law, while civil suits allow victims to recover damages and compensation for the harm, loss or injury. The outcomes of both cases would be separate, and one does not determine the outcome of the other. However, it is recommended that you consult with an attorney who can advise you on the best course of action based on the specific facts and circumstances of your case.",
