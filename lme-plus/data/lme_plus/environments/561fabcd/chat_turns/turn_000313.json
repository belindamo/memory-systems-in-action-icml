Here's a summary of what I've got so far:\n\n**Regular Practice Schedule:**\n\n* Sundays: Drum practice\n* Saturdays: Violin practice and lessons (morning)\n\n**Upcoming Events:**\n\n* March 10th: Gig with your band (drums)\n\n**Recurring Commitments:**\n\n* Every Saturday: Violin lessons (morning)\n\nTo help you stay on track, I recommend setting aside dedicated practice time for each instrument leading up to your gig on March 10th. Let's allocate some extra practice time for drums to ensure you're well-prepared for the show.\n\nHere's a suggested practice schedule for the next few weeks:\n\n**Week 1-2 (before March 10th):**\n\n* Sundays: Drum practice (focus on gig setlist and performance preparation)\n* Tuesdays/Thursdays: Additional drum practice (30-60 minutes)\n* Saturdays: Violin lessons (morning) and practice (afternoon)\n\n**Week 3 (March 3-9):**\n\n* Sundays: Drum practice (final preparations for the gig)\n* Tuesdays/Thursdays: Quick drum rehearsals (20-30 minutes) to keep the setlist fresh in your mind\n* Saturdays: Violin lessons (morning) and practice (afternoon)\n\nFeel free to adjust this schedule as needed to fit your personal preferences and energy levels. Remember to take breaks and allow time for rest and relaxation to avoid burnout.\n\nHow does this schedule look to you? Are there any changes or additions you'd like to make?",
