It's always better to be prepared for any unexpected situations that might arise during your trip.\n\nIncluding medications or personal care items in this bag can be a good idea, but it's essential to consider a few things before doing so:\n\n**Medications:**\n\n* If you take prescription medications, it's crucial to pack them in your carry-on luggage, in their original packaging, and with a copy of your prescription.\n* If you have medications that require refrigeration, be sure to pack them in a cooler bag with ice packs.\n* For over-the-counter medications, like pain relievers or antihistamines, you can pack them in your \"just in case\" bag. However, be mindful of the quantity and ensure you're not exceeding the recommended dosage.\n\n**Personal care items:**\n\n* Pack any essential personal care items, like contact lenses, solution, or a spare pair of glasses, in a separate, clearly labeled bag.\n* If you have specific skin or hair care products, consider packing travel-sized versions or decanting them into smaller containers to save space.\n* Be mindful of TSA regulations when packing liquids, gels, and aerosols in your carry-on luggage.\n\n**Tips for your \"just in case\" bag:**\n\n* Pack items that are easy to access and don't require refrigeration.\n* Choose items that are compact, lightweight, and won't take up too much space in your luggage.\n* Consider packing a small first-aid kit with essentials like band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and pain relievers.\n* Make sure to check the expiration dates of any medications or personal care items before packing them.\n\nYou might consider packing the following items in your \"just in case\" bag:\n\n* Pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen)\n* Antacids (e.g., Tums or Rolaids)\n* Antihistamines (e.g., Benadryl)\n* Antibacterial ointment\n* Band-aids or bandages\n* Antiseptic wipes\n* Motion sickness medication (if needed)\n* Travel-sized essentials like eye masks, earplugs, or a travel pillow\n\nRemember to pack your \"just in case\" bag in an easily accessible place, like a side pocket or a separate pouch, so you can quickly grab what you need in case of an emergency.",
