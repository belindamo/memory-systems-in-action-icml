I've been getting back into it for a few months now, and I've learned a lot since then. I'm still deciding between Sony and Fujifilm, but I'm leaning towards Fujifilm because of its film simulation modes. Do you know if there are any good online resources for learning more about these modes and how to use them effectively?",
