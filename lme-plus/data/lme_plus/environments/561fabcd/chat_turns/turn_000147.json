That's a huge accomplishment, and you must be thrilled to be ready for new outdoor adventures.\n\nSpring is an excellent time to explore various activities, and I've got some fantastic recommendations for you:\n\n1. **Hiking**: As the snow melts, trails become more accessible, and the scenery is breathtaking. You can start with shorter, easier trails and gradually move to more challenging ones. Make sure to check trail conditions and difficulty levels before heading out.\n2. **Kayaking or Canoeing**: As the weather warms up, rivers and lakes become perfect for paddling. Rent a kayak or canoe and explore nearby waterways, enjoying the scenery and spotting wildlife.\n3. **Cycling**: Dust off your bike and hit the trails or local bike paths. Spring is an ideal time to get back on two wheels, and you can start with easy rides and gradually increase your distance and intensity.\n4. **Rock Climbing**: If you enjoyed the thrill of skiing, you might love rock climbing! Find an outdoor climbing spot or a local climbing gym to get started.

Find a local disc golf course and enjoy the scenery while playing with friends or solo.\n9. **Star Gazing**: As the nights get warmer, grab a blanket and head to a dark spot away from city lights. Identify constellations, and enjoy the peacefulness of the night sky.\n10. **Gardening**: If you have a green thumb or want to try something new, spring is an excellent time to start a small garden or tend to a community garden plot. Get your hands dirty, and enjoy the satisfaction of watching your plants grow.\n\nRemember to always check the weather forecast, dress appropriately, and follow safety guidelines for each activity.
