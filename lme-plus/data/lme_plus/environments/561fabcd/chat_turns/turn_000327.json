I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your personal information or any external systems.\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with your flight bookings or haven't received confirmation, I recommend contacting Sakura Travel Agency directly to resolve the issue. They should be able to assist you with your booking and provide an update on the status.\n\nHowever, if you're considering booking your flights separately, it's essential to ensure that you're not duplicating your booking or creating any conflicts with your existing booking. Before making any changes, I recommend:\n\n1. Clarifying the status of your existing booking with Sakura Travel Agency.\n2. Understanding their cancellation or modification policies.\n3. Researching and comparing prices for flights to ensure you're getting a good deal.\n\nRemember to always prioritize booking through authorized travel agencies or airlines to avoid any potential scams or issues.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns about traveling to Japan or need general advice, feel free to ask!",
