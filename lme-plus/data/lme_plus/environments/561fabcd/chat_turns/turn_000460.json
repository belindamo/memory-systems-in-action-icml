It could have glowing green eyes, an emaciated body with patches of fur falling out, and possibly even some kind of glowing aura around it.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the Radiation Amplified could emit a toxic aura that damages players over time if they get too close, similar to the Nova Gas zombies from Black Ops. Additionally, its attacks could have a chance to inflict radiation poisoning on the player, causing their screen to distort and blur similar to Cosmic Cleanse, but in a way that's more disorienting and harder to see through.\n\nAs for a name, how about \"Radialisk\"? It's a play on words between \"radial\" (as in radiation) and \"hydralisk\" (a creature from the Starcraft game series), which could give the zombie a sci-fi feel to fit with the radiation theme.",
