They are, without a doubt, one of the top sports teams in Houston and have had considerable success in recent years. The Dash won the NWSL Challenge Cup in 2020 and reached the playoffs in the 2020 NWSL season. Thank you for bringing them up, and I apologize for the omission. As an AI language model, I strive to be inclusive and provide accurate information regardless of gender or variables that may influence sports representation.",
