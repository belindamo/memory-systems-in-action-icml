  "content": "No, not all types of lichen grow at the same rate within their growth form. Even within the same growth form, the growth rate varies depending on the species and the environmental conditions. Different species of lichen may have different rates of growth within the same growth form.\n\nAdditionally, factors such as substrate type, moisture levels, and climate can all affect the growth rate of lichen, even within the same species. For example, two of the same lichen species growing on different substrates may grow at different rates. The same species growing in areas with different levels of moisture may also grow at different rates.\n\nTherefore, it is difficult to provide a generalized growth rate for each growth form of lichen, and it is important to consider the various environmental factors that may impact lichen growth rates.",
