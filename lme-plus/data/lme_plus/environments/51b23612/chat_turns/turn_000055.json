  "content": "Lichen growth rates vary between different growth forms. The growth rate of lichen depends on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light. The different types of lichen growth forms are listed below along with their growth rates.\n\n1. Crustose lichens: Crustose lichens are flat and closely adherent to the substrate. They grow very slowly at a rate of about 0.5 to 1.0 mm per year.\n\n2. Foliose lichens: Foliose lichens have leaf-like structures and are loosely attached to the substrate. They grow faster than crustose lichens at a rate of about 1.0 to 3.0 mm per year.\n\n3. Fruticose lichens: Fruticose lichens are shrubby and branch out in different directions. They grow the fastest among the lichen growth forms at a rate of about 3.0 to 10.0 mm per year.\n\nIn general, lichen growth rates are slower than those of other organisms, and they can take decades or even centuries to reach maturity.",
