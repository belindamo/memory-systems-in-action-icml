To get started, could you please provide me with some more information about your goals and current fitness level?\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n* What are your specific goals for your cycling event? Are you looking to improve your overall endurance, increase your speed, or enhance your power output?\n* What is your current fitness level? Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced athlete?\n* How many days per week can you dedicate to training, and what is your available time per session?\n* Do you have any physical limitations or injuries that may impact your ability to perform certain exercises?\n* What equipment do you have access to? Do you have a gym membership, or will you be working out at home with minimal equipment?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your needs and goals, I can provide you with a sample workout plan that incorporates strength training, plyometric exercises, and cycling",
