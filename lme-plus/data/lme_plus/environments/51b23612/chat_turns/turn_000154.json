  "content": "Apologies for the confusion earlier. Here's a high-level overview of the project scope for connecting a Next.js 13 app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to an existing WordPress website using WordPress Headless CMS:\n\n1. Data storage: The data for the Next.js app will be stored in WordPress, which will act as a headless CMS. You can create custom post types, taxonomies, and fields in WordPress to store your app's data. Alternatively, you can use a separate database for your app's data and sync it with WordPress using a plugin or API.\n2. User accounts: User accounts can be managed in WordPress as usual. You can create new user accounts or use existing accounts for authentication in your Next.js app.\n3. Authentication: Authentication can be implemented in your Next.js app by making API requests to WordPress. You can use the REST API plugin in WordPress to enable authentication endpoints, and then make requests to these endpoints from your app to authenticate users.\n4. Payment system: The payment system can be implemented using a third-party payment gateway service such as Stripe or PayPal. You can integrate these services into your Next.js app using their APIs and SDKs, and then use WordPress to store payment-related data such as orders and transactions.\n5. Deployment: You can deploy your Next.js app and WordPress site separately on different servers or platforms, or deploy them together using a service like Vercel or Netlify. You will need to configure your app and site accordingly to ensure they can communicate with each other over the web.",
