  "content": "The Greek word translated as \"creation\" in Romans 8:19 is \"\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\" (ktisis). According to Strong's Concordance, \"ktisis\" means \"original formation, i.e. a product (created thing), specifically, a creature, the world (in a wide or narrow sense, including its inhabitants, literally or figuratively)\".\n\nIn this verse, the word \"creation\" refers to the entirety of God's creation, including both animate and inanimate beings, as well as the natural world. The verse is suggesting that all of creation is eagerly waiting for the revealing of the sons of God, indicating that the redemption of humanity will have a positive impact on the entire creation.",
