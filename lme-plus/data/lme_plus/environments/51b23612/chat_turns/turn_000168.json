Here are some tips to help you stay on track:\n\n1. **Set specific and achievable goals**: Define why you want to stick to your new schedule and what benefits you hope to achieve (e.g., better sleep, more energy, improved mood). Write down your goals and post them somewhere visible to remind yourself.\n2. **Create an accountability system**: Share your goals with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can be as simple as sending each other daily check-ins or scheduling weekly progress updates.\n3. **Track your progress**: Use a habit tracker, journal, or mobile app to monitor your progress. Seeing your accomplishments can motivate you to continue.\n4. **Plan for flexibility**: Life can be unpredictable, and it's essential to be kind to yourself when you miss a day or two. Don't give up! Instead, focus on getting back on track as soon as possible.\n5. **Find a yoga buddy or accountability partner**: Having someone to practice yoga with can make it more enjoyable and increase your motivation. You can also encourage and support each other on days when you're struggling.\n6. **Reward yourself**: Set small rewards for yourself when you reach certain milestones (e.g., completing a week of consistent yoga practice). Choose something that brings you joy, like a relaxing bath, a favorite meal, or a fun activity.\n7. **Make it convenient**: Prepare everything you need for your yoga practice in advance, such as laying out your mat, gathering props, and having a water bottle ready. This will make it easier to stick to your schedule.\n8. **Focus on how you feel**: Remember why you started practicing yoga in the first place. Focus on the benefits you experience, such as increased energy, improved flexibility, or reduced stress. This will help you stay motivated and committed.\n9. **Be gentle with yourself**: It's okay to have off days or miss a practice occasionally. Don't beat yourself up over it. Instead, acknowledge the setback and gently get back on track.\n10. **Celebrate milestones**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress along the way. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue your new routine.\n\nRegarding your concern about Tuesdays and Thursdays, try to find a compromise that works for you. You could:\n\n* Practice yoga at 7:30 PM and then watch TV for a shorter period, or\n* Alternate between yoga and TV on these days, or\n* Find a way to incorporate yoga into your TV time, like doing some gentle stretches or yoga poses during commercial breaks.\n\nRemember, consistency is key, but it's also essential to be flexible and adapt to your unique circumstances.\n\nYou got this! Stay committed, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance or support.",
