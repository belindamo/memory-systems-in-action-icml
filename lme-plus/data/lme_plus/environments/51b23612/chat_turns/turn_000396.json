Start with a lower CFU count (5-10 billion) and adjust as needed.\n* **Delayed-release or slow-release formula**: This ensures the probiotics survive stomach acid and reach the gut where they can be most effective.\n* **Vegetarian or vegan-friendly**: If you have dietary restrictions, choose a supplement that fits your needs.\n* **Manufacturer reputation**: Opt for a reputable brand with good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and third-party testing.\n\nRemember to always consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially if you have a compromised immune system or are taking medications.",
