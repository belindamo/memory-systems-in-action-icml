Menus can change over time, and it's always best to check with the restaurant directly for the most up-to-date options.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some classic Italian dishes that are commonly found on Italian restaurant menus:\n\n1. **Pasta dishes**: Spaghetti Bolognese, Fettuccine Alfredo, Lasagna, Penne alla Vodka, and more.\n2. **Pizza**: Margherita, Quattro Formaggi, Prosciutto e Funghi, and various meat-lovers options.\n3. **Risotto**: Risotto alla Milanese (with ossobuco), Risotto con Funghi, and Risotto alla Pescatora (with seafood).\n4. **Meat and seafood dishes**: Chicken or Veal Parmesan, Branzino, Shrimp Scampi, and Osso Buco.\n5. **Appetizers and sides**: Bruschetta, Caprese salad, Insalata Italiana, Garlic bread, and Grilled Vegetables.\n6. **Desserts**: Tiramis\u00f9, Cannoli, Gelato, and Panna Cotta.\n\nYou can always check Bella Vita's website, call them, or ask your server for their menu options and recommendations.
