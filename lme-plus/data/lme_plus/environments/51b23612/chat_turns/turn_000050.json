  "content": "I'm really excited to take the Studio Tour and learn more about the filmmaking process. Since I have an annual pass, I can take the tour multiple times and explore different parts of the studio each time. Speaking of annual passes, I'm also planning to visit other theme parks in the area, like Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland. Do you have any tips or recommendations for those parks as well?",
