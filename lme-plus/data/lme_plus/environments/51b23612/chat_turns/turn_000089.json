But I can suggest a few options to help you find out if those items are on sale this week:\n\n1. **Walmart's Website:** You can check Walmart's website ([www.walmart.com](http://www.walmart.com)) and look for the \"Weekly Ad\" or \"Savings\" section. They usually post their weekly ads online, which include sales and promotions for the current week. You can enter your location to see the ad for your local store.\n2. **Walmart App:** Download the Walmart app on your mobile device and check the \"Savings\" or \"Deals\" section. The app often features digital coupons, rollbacks, and other offers.\n3. **Walmart's Social Media:** Follow Walmart on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. They sometimes post about weekly deals and promotions.\n4. **Check Online Coupons:** Websites like Coupons.com, RetailMeNot, or CouponCabin often have a list of current coupons and promo codes for Walmart. You can search for the specific products you need and see if there are any available coupons.\n5. **Visit Your Local Store:** If you're planning to visit your local Walmart store this weekend, you can always check the sales flyers or ask a store associate about any promotions on the items you need.\n\nRemember to always check the prices and sales dates before making a purchase, as they may vary by location and time.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy shopping!",
