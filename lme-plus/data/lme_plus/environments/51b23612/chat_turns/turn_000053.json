  "content": "That's great to hear! The Studio Tour is a fantastic experience, and I'm sure you'll love it. It's a unique opportunity to go behind the scenes of a working film studio and learn about the filmmaking process. With your annual pass, you'll be able to take the tour multiple times and explore different parts of the studio each time.\n\nIt's also great that you're planning to visit other theme parks in the area, like Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland. Knott's Berry Farm is a fantastic park with a lot of history and charm, and there's always something new to discover. Disneyland, of course, is a classic theme park experience that's not to be missed.\n\nAs you plan your visits to these parks, I recommend taking advantage of the annual passholder benefits, such as discounts on food and merchandise, and special perks like early access to new attractions. You can also consider visiting during off-peak times, like weekdays during the school year, to avoid crowds and long lines.\n\nAdditionally, be sure to check the parks' websites and social media accounts for special events and promotions, such as seasonal festivals, character meet-and-greets, and behind-the-scenes tours. These can add an extra layer of fun to your visits and make them even more memorable.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you have a great year of theme park adventures ahead of you! Enjoy your visits to Universal Studios Hollywood, Knott's Berry Farm, and Disneyland, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further recommendations.",
