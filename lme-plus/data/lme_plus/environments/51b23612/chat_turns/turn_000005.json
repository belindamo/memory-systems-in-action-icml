  "content": "The Fitbit Inspire HR does track sleep, but it's not as detailed as the sleep tracking feature on your Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2. While it does provide some valuable insights, it's more focused on overall sleep quality and duration rather than breaking down specific stages like REM sleep.\n\nHere's what you can expect from the sleep tracking feature on the Fitbit Inspire HR:\n\n1. **Sleep duration**: The Inspire HR tracks the total time you spend sleeping, including naps.\n2. **Sleep stages**: It tracks two stages of sleep: Light Sleep and Deep Sleep. While it doesn't specifically track REM sleep, Deep Sleep is often associated with REM sleep.\n3. **Sleep quality**: The Inspire HR provides a Sleep Score, which is a score out of 100 that indicates the quality of your sleep. This score is based on factors like sleep duration, sleep stages, and sleep disruptions.\n4. **Sleep disruptions**: The Inspire HR detects when you wake up during the night and records these disruptions.\n5. **Sleep schedule**: It tracks your sleep schedule, including your bedtime, wake-up time, and sleep consistency.\n\nWhile the Inspire HR doesn't provide as detailed sleep insights as your Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2, it still offers a solid foundation for understanding your sleep patterns and making improvements. Additionally, Fitbit's sleep tracking features are often praised for their accuracy and ease of use.\n\nIf sleep tracking is a top priority for your friend, you might want to consider other options like the **Fitbit Ionic** or **Fitbit Versa**, which offer more advanced sleep features, including REM sleep tracking. However, these devices are pricier than the Inspire HR.\n\nDo you think the Inspire HR's sleep tracking features will still meet your friend's needs, or would you like to explore other options?",
