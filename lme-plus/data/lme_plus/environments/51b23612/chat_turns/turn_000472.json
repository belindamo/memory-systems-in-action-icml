Here's a simple recipe for mini quiches that yields delicious results:\n\n**Basic Mini Quiche Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n* 1/2 cup grated cheese (Cheddar, Swiss, or a mix)\n* 1/2 cup heavy cream or whole milk\n* 2 large eggs\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Fillings of your choice (e.g., diced ham, bacon, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, etc.)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Preheat**: Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. **Make the crust**: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Add the cold butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n3. **Add cream and mix**: Gradually add the heavy cream or whole milk, mixing until the dough comes together in a ball.\n4. **Chill**: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n5. **Roll out**: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thickness.\n6. **Cut out circles**: Use a cookie cutter or the rim of a glass to cut out circles of dough. You should be able to get about 12-15 circles.\n7. **Prepare fillings**: Chop your chosen fillings into small pieces.\n8. **Assemble**: Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Sprinkle a pinch of grated cheese over the filling.\n9. **Fold and press**: Fold the dough in half over the filling, pressing the edges to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges.\n10. **Brush with egg wash**: Beat an egg with a little water, and brush the tops of the quiches with the egg wash.\n11. **Bake**: Place the quiches on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each quiche. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the quiches are golden brown.\n\n**Tips and Variations**:\n\n* Use a muffin tin to shape the quiches, if you prefer a more uniform shape.\n* Add some diced herbs (e.g., thyme, rosemary) to the dough for extra flavor.\n* Experiment with different cheeses, such as Goat Cheese, Feta, or Parmesan.\n* Add some diced ham or bacon to the filling for a savory twist.\n* Make ahead: Prepare the dough and fillings, then assemble and bake the quiches just before the movie night.\n\nThat's it! These mini quiches are perfect for a movie night snack, and you can customize them to fit your friends' tastes. Enjoy!",
