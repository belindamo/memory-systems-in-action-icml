I've also heard great things about the theming of the Wizarding World, so I'm looking forward to immersing myself in the experience. Since I have an annual pass, I'm planning to visit at least once a month to try out new attractions and explore different parts of the park. Do you have any recommendations for must-see attractions or experiences that I shouldn't miss?",
