As a large language model, I don't have information about TasteBuddy or its features, and I'm not aware of Bella Vita's menu or sides. I'm a general-knowledge AI, I don't have specific information about individual restaurants or their offerings.\n\nIf you've used TasteBuddy before, you might want to try checking Bella Vita's menu on the app as you mentioned. However, I would recommend verifying the accuracy of the menu and information on the app to ensure it's up-to-date and correct.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need general information about Italian cuisine or pasta dishes, I'd be happy to help!",
