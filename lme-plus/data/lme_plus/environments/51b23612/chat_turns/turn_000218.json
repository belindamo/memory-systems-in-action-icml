  "content": "Spektr-RG was launched in July 2019, and so far it has made some exciting discoveries. In December 2019, the first eROSITA all-sky survey was completed, revealing more than one million new X-ray sources. This was a significant improvement compared to the previous survey conducted by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which detected only a few hundred thousand X-ray sources.\n\nOne of the notable discoveries was the detection of a previously unknown supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy located about 700 million light-years away. Spektr-RG also detected a massive bubble of plasma, which extends over hundreds of thousands of light-years, surrounding the giant black hole at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster.\n\nSpektr-RG has also been used to study galaxy clusters, which are the most massive structures in the universe. One of the findings was the detection of X-rays coming from the hot gas located between the galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, which had previously been undetected.\n\nOverall, the data obtained by Spektr-RG has the potential to advance our understanding of the universe significantly.",
