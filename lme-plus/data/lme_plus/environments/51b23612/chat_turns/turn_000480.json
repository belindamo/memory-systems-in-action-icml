I'm just here to help answer your questions and provide information!\n\nBut, oh, what a fantastic idea you had! Having movie-themed snacks or decorations can really add to the fun and atmosphere of your movie night! A \"Sleepless in Seattle\"-themed coffee bar or a \"When Harry Met Sally\"-inspired New York City theme would be amazing ideas to tie in with your movie choice.\n\nFor \"When Harry Met Sally\", you could also consider having a \"deli\"-themed snack bar with classic New York-style sandwiches, bagels, and knishes. Or, decorate the room with iconic NYC landmarks, like the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, or the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nFor \"Sleepless in Seattle\", you could have a \"Seattle\"-themed snack bar with coffee, tea, and pastries, or decorate the room with elements that evoke the Pacific Northwest, like evergreen trees, mountains, or a replica of the Space Needle.\n\nThese are just a few ideas, but I'm sure you could come up with even more creative and fun ways to tie in your movie choice with your snacks and decorations!\n\nWhat do you think? Will you consider adding some movie-themed elements to your movie night?",
