Both \"When Harry Met Sally\" and \"Sleepless in Seattle\" are classic rom-coms that have stood the test of time, and they're both widely loved.\n\n\"When Harry Met Sally\" is a great choice because it's a beautifully written film with witty dialogue, relatable characters, and a will-they-won't-they tension that keeps you invested until the very end. The chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is undeniable, and the movie's exploration of whether men and women can ever truly be just friends is still a topic of debate today.\n\n\"Sleepless in Seattle\", on the other hand, is a romantic fairy tale that combines comedy, drama, and romance in a way that's both sweeping and intimate. The movie's central premise \u2013 a widower's son calls in to a radio talk show in an attempt to find his father a new partner \u2013 is both poignant and hilarious, and Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (again!) have amazing chemistry.\n\nEither way, you can't go wrong! Both movies are guaranteed to leave your friends feeling warm, fuzzy, and maybe even a little bit hopeful about love.\n\nSo, which one do you think you'll choose?",
