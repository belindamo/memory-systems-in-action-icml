  "content": "Yes! The Spektr-RG mission is expected to last for about 7 years, during which time it will conduct eight all-sky surveys. The mission has been designed to study the entire sky in X-rays, covering energies from 0.2 to 30 keV, with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution.\n\nDuring each survey, the spacecraft will observe the sky for about six months, and each survey will cover different regions of the sky. This will allow scientists to create a map of the entire sky in X-rays with the highest sensitivity and resolution possible.\n\nAfter the completion of Spektr-RG's primary mission, the spacecraft will continue to operate but with a reduced data transmission rate, allowing it to continue making observations in X-rays for several more years.\n\nOverall, the Spektr-RG mission is a significant step forward in our understanding of the high-energy universe, and it is expected to produce a vast amount of data that will keep scientists busy for many years to come.",
