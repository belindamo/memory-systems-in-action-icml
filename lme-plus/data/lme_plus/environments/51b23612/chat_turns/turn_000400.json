This will allow your body to adjust to the introduction of new bacteria and minimize the risk of side effects.\n\nBy starting slow, you're giving your body a chance to adapt and respond to the probiotics. You can always increase the CFU count later if needed, but it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nRemember, it's also important to:\n\n* Choose a high-quality probiotic supplement from a reputable manufacturer\n* Follow the recommended dosage and instructions\n* Monitor your body's response and adjust as needed\n* Be patient, as it may take some time to notice the benefits of probiotics\n\nBy taking a gradual and gentle approach, you'll be more likely to experience positive results and minimize the risk of side effects.\n\nHow do you plan to monitor your body's response to the probiotics? Will you be tracking any specific symptoms or changes in your digestive health?",
