Here is a visualization of the decision tree I provided earlier:\n\n[Decision Tree Visualization]\n\nEach node in the tree represents a decision or question that you need to consider when becoming an investment banker. The branches represent the possible outcomes of each decision, and the leaves represent the resources or actions you can take based on your choices.\n\nFor example, if you start at the root node and follow the branch that says \"Yes\" for the question \"Do you have a bachelor's degree in a relevant field?\", you'll reach the next node, which asks about relevant work experience. If you follow the branch that says \"Yes\" for this question, you'll proceed to the next node, and so on.\n\nI hope this visualization helps you understand the decision tree better. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
