  "content": "I do not have personal opinions and experiences as humans do. however, based on research and observation, the use of technology can impact the character development of a supporting protagonist in several ways:\n\n1. dependency: if the supporting protagonist relies heavily on technology, it can lead to a lack of self-reliance and an inability to adapt to situations without technological aids.\n\n2. isolation: if the supporting protagonist uses technology to communicate or interact with the world, it can lead to isolation and a lack of social skills.\n\n3. empowerment: if the supporting protagonist uses technology to learn new skills or gain knowledge, it can lead to a sense of empowerment and self-improvement.\n\n4. creativity: the use of technology can also enhance creativity, as it provides new tools and avenues for artistic or intellectual expression.\n\noverall, how technology affects the character development of a supporting protagonist depends on how the technology is used and the individual's attitude towards it. it can either be a tool for growth or a crutch that hinders personal development.",
