  "content": "Certainly! Here's a synopsis of what we've discussed so far:\n\n* The story takes place in a world where half of it has been destroyed by a sudden, cataclysmic event, leaving behind isolated formations called Isles that have become the only habitable areas.\n* The people living on the Isles have adapted to life in these harsh conditions and have developed unique technologies and ways of life to make it sustainable.\n* The main characters could be a group of explorers or adventurers who are seeking to uncover the secrets of the cataclysmic event and find a way to save the rest of the world, or members of one of the societies living on the Isles, struggling to survive in the harsh conditions and facing challenges from other societies and outside threats.\n* Magic could play a significant role in the story, either as a vital tool for the people living on the Isles or as an unpredictable and dangerous force that caused the cataclysmic event.\n* The World Stones could be ancient artifacts that hold great power and significance in the world and could be scattered throughout the world, hidden away in remote locations, or guarded by powerful beings or societies.\n* We've also discussed using terms analogous to oceans and seas when referring to the rifts between the Isles and the untouched lands of the surrounding regions, including the Isles themselves, the Aire Sea, and the Dawn Coast.\n* The story could begin with a sudden collapse of one of the Isles, creating a sense of urgency and danger right from the beginning, and leading the characters on a journey to uncover larger conspiracies and conflicts that threaten the stability of the world.\n\nI hope that helps as you continue to develop the story! Let me know if there's anything else you need.",
