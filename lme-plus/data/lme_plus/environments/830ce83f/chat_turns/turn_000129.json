  "content": "Fermat's Last Theorem had a significant impact on number theory by leading to the development of new mathematical techniques and concepts. The problem itself stimulated a great deal of research in number theory as it was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics for over three centuries.\n\nThe difficulty of the problem also motivated the development of algebraic number theory, which allowed mathematicians to study number fields in a more sophisticated way. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem required many new tools from number theory, including elliptic curves, modular forms, and Galois representations.\n\nFurthermore, the rigorous proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994 served to validate the importance of mathematical proof and the continuity of mathematical research. The work of Wiles and his collaborators demonstrated the power and beauty of mathematics and inspired a new generation of researchers in the field.\n\nOverall, Fermat's Last Theorem is seen as one of the most significant problems in number theory and its eventual resolution had a profound impact on the development of the field.",
