  "content": "We definitely had a lively discussion about the themes of systemic racism and police brutality, and how they're still relevant today. We also talked about the importance of activism and using one's voice to create change. What really stood out to me was how the novel made us reflect on our own biases and privileges. It was a great reminder that we all need to be more aware of our surroundings and do our part in creating a more just society.",
