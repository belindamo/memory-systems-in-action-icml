Could you please tell me the city and state (or country) where Rachel resides? That way, I can provide you with more accurate information about the weather conditions in that area during your planned visit.\n\nOnce I know the city, I can give you an idea of what to expect in terms of temperature, precipitation, and any other relevant weather-related factors that might impact your visit.",
