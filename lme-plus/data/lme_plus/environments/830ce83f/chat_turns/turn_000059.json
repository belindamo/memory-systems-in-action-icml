Let's start with Scout Finch from \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and Jay Gatsby from \"The Great Gatsby\".\n\nScout Finch, the protagonist in \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" is a young girl who possesses a strong sense of justice and empathy. She is intelligent, inquisitive, and doesn't shy away from asking tough questions. Despite growing up in a prejudiced society, Scout remains open-minded and observant. Through her interactions with her father, Atticus, and observing the trial of Tom Robinson, Scout learns valuable life lessons about human nature and societal values.\n\nOn the other hand, Jay Gatsby from \"The Great Gatsby\" is a mysterious and enigmatic character. He is a wealthy man who is known for throwing extravagant parties, but very few people actually know him. Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy, a woman from his past who is now married to someone else. His character is a symbol of the American Dream, as he symbolizes the idea that anyone can achieve success and wealth through hard work and determination. However, Gatsby is also flawed as he lies about his past and becomes entangled in illegal activities to achieve his goals.\n\nIn summary, Scout Finch and Jay Gatsby have very different personalities and serve different purposes in their respective novels. Scout is a character who embodies the innocence and moral truth of \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" while Gatsby represents the ambition and corruption of the \"The Great Gatsby.\"",
