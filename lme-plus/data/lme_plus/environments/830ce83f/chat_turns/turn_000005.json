Capturing the likeness and personality of a beloved pet is a wonderful project.\n\nProportions and facial expressions are crucial aspects of creating a realistic and endearing sculpture of Luna. Here are some tips to help you improve:\n\n**Proportions:**\n\n1. **Measure and reference**: Take measurements of Luna's face and head to get an accurate sense of proportion. Use a photo or observe her in person to note the size and shape of her features.\n2. **Use a grid**: Divide your sculpture into a grid to help you proportionally scale up or down from your reference images.\n3. **Focus on the eyes**: The eyes are the most important feature in capturing a pet's likeness. Ensure they're proportionate to the rest of the face and positioned correctly.\n\n**Facial Expressions:**\n\n1. **Study Luna's expressions**: Observe and photograph Luna's different facial expressions, such as when she's happy, curious, or relaxed.
