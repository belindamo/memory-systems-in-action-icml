  "content": "The Outrigger Beach Resort is a fantastic choice! Yes, they do have rooms with beach views, and they're highly recommended. Here's what you can expect:\n\n* **Beachfront Rooms**: These rooms offer direct views of the Gulf of Mexico and the beach. You can wake up to the sound of the waves and enjoy the sunset from your private balcony.\n* **Beachview Rooms**: These rooms have partial views of the beach and the Gulf, but may also include views of the pool or surrounding landscape. They're still great options if you want to be close to the beach and enjoy the ocean breeze.\n\nWhen booking your room, make sure to specify that you want a beach view or beachfront room. You can do this by:\n\n1. Checking the room description and amenities on the hotel's website or a hotel booking website like Expedia or Booking.com.\n2. Contacting the hotel directly via phone or email to request a beach view or beachfront room.\n3. Using the \"Special Requests\" section when booking online to request a beach view or beachfront room.\n\nKeep in mind that beach view and beachfront rooms may come with a higher price tag, but they're definitely worth it for the stunning views and proximity to the beach.\n\nAdditionally, The Outrigger Beach Resort offers other great amenities, such as:\n\n* Private beach access\n* Heated pool and hot tub\n* Beachside bar and grill\n* Fitness center\n* Water sports rentals (including paddleboards and kayaks)\n* Complimentary breakfast buffet\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll love your stay at The Outrigger Beach Resort!",
