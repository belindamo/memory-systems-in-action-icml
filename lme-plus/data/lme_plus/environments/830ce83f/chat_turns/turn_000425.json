However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or real-time information about specific cities or locations. But I can give you some general tips on how to find a great breakfast spot!\n\n1. **Check online review sites**: Websites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google Reviews can give you an idea of popular breakfast spots in your area. Look for places with high ratings and read the reviews to get a sense of what to expect.\n2. **Ask locals or colleagues**: Ask your friends, colleagues, or neighbors for recommendations. They can give you insider tips on the best breakfast spots in the city.\n3. **Social media**: Follow food bloggers or influencers in your area to see what they're raving about.
