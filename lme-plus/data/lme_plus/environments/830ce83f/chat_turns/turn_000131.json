  "content": "Fermat's Last Theorem may not have a direct impact on your everyday life, but its proof and the work that went into solving it demonstrate the importance of inquiry, problem-solving, and perseverance in any field of study. \n\nThe development of new mathematical concepts and techniques to solve the problem may have practical applications in various fields such as cryptography, computer science, and physics. In fact, elliptic curve cryptography, which relies on many of the same mathematical concepts used to solve Fermat's Last Theorem, has widespread use in secure communication protocols such as online banking and e-commerce.\n\nFurthermore, the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, as exemplified in the study of mathematics and the solution of problems such as Fermat's Last Theorem, can have immeasurable societal and cultural value beyond any direct practical applications. It has been said that \"pure\" mathematics is the foundation of all other forms of mathematical knowledge and that the pursuit of solutions to long-standing mathematical problems can spur innovation and progress in fields far beyond mathematics.",
