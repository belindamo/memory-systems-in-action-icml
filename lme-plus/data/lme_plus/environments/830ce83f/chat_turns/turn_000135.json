  "content": "It is certainly important to devote resources and effort to solving real-world problems that have a tangible impact on society. However, it is equally important to recognize the value and importance of pure research, like the study of mathematics, for several reasons:\n\n1. It can lead to the development of new technologies and innovations that may have practical applications.\n\n2. It encourages creative and lateral thinking, which can be beneficial in problem-solving in various fields.\n\n3. It promotes intellectual curiosity and leads to a better understanding of ourselves and the world around us.\n\n4. It enriches our cultural heritage and contributes to the advancement of human knowledge as a whole.\n\nPure research is not simply a luxury or self-indulgence, but an essential part of scientific and intellectual progress. The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is a fundamental part of human nature, and the exploration of the unknown and the seemingly impossible has led to some of the most significant and transformational discoveries in history. As such, we should not dismiss the value of pure research but rather strive for a balance between practical problem-solving and theoretical exploration, both of which are essential for the progress and advancement of society.",
