It's important to recognize that technology is not inherently good or bad, but it's how it's used that determines the impact on the supporting protagonist's character development.\n\nSome tips for striking a balance between technology use and maintaining social skills and self-reliance include:\n\n1. Limit technology use: Set boundaries for technology use, such as limiting screen time or unplugging during certain hours of the day.\n\n2. Connect with people in person: Make an effort to connect with people in person, rather than relying solely on technology for communication and social interaction.\n\n3. Engage in offline activities: Spend time engaging in activities that don't involve technology, such as reading a book, going for a walk, or playing a sport.\n\n4. Seek out new experiences: Try new things that push you out of your comfort zone and require self-reliance, such as traveling, volunteering, or learning a new skill.\n\nBy balancing technology use with other activities and experiences, a supporting protagonist can continue to learn and grow while also maintaining social skills and self-reliance.",
