This will create a comfortable seating area and define the space.\n2. **Add a coffee table**: Position a coffee table in front of the sofa, about 12-18 inches away from the sofa. This will create a comfortable distance for conversation and provide a surface for placing drinks or snacks.\n3. **Consider a floating furniture arrangement**: Since you have a rectangular room, you can create a floating furniture arrangement by placing a console table or a storage unit behind the sofa, parallel to the longer wall. This will help to break up the room and create a sense of flow.\n\n**Neutral Color Scheme with Pops of Blue:**\n\n1. **Sofa color**: Since you've already chosen a neutral-colored sofa, you can build upon that with complementary colors. Consider a light gray, beige, or cream-colored wall paint to create a calming atmosphere.\n2. **Accent wall**: Paint one wall in a soft blue shade (e.g., sky blue, light navy, or powder blue) to add a pop of color and create visual interest.\n3. **Blue accents**: Incorporate blue throw pillows, blankets, or a blue-toned area rug to tie in with the accent wall and add cohesion to the space.\n\n**Additional Design Elements:**\n\n1. **Add a statement light fixture**: A modern chandelier or pendant light above the coffee table can add a touch of sophistication and create a focal point in the room.\n2. **Bring in plants**: Greenery can add a pop of color and freshness to the space. Choose low-maintenance plants like succulents or air plants that fit with a modern aesthetic.\n3. **Use wall decor**: Hang a large piece of modern art or a collection of framed prints above the sofa to create visual interest and add to the room's modern feel.\n\n**Budget-Friendly Tips:**\n\n1. **Shop second-hand**: Thrift stores, online marketplaces, or garage sales can be great sources for affordable, gently-used decorative items that fit your modern style.\n2. **DIY projects**: Consider upcycling old furniture or creating your own decorative items, like throw pillow covers or wall art, to add personal touches without breaking the bank.\n\nHere's a rough layout to get you started:\n```\n  +---------------+\n  |               |\n  |  TV (mounted)  |\n  |               |\n  +---------------+\n  |               |\n  |  Sectional Sofa  |\n  |  (10 ft x 4 ft)  |\n  |               |\n  +---------------+\n  |               |\n  |  Coffee Table  |\n  |               |\n  +---------------+\n  |               |\n  |  Console Table  |\n  |  (behind sofa)  |\n  |               |\n  +---------------+\n```\nFeel free to experiment with different layouts and arrangements until you find a configuration that works best for you!\n\nHow do these ideas sound? Do you have any specific questions or areas you'd like me to elaborate on?",
