And don't worry, it's easy to get overwhelmed with plant care, but with a few tips, you can get your peace lily back on track.\n\n**Peace Lily Care Tips:**\n\n1. **Watering:** Peace lilies prefer well-draining soil and should be watered when the top 1-2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch. Avoid getting water on the leaves or crown (where the leaves meet the stem) to prevent root rot. Water at the soil level instead.\n2. **Lighting:** Peace lilies thrive in bright, indirect light, but can tolerate low light conditions. However, direct sunlight can cause leaf scorch.\n3. **Humidity:** Peace lilies prefer a humid environment, typically above 50%. You can increase humidity around the plant by placing it on a tray with pebbles and water or using a humidifier.\n4. **Temperature:** Keep your peace lily in an area with a consistent temperature between 65\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C). Avoid placing it near heating or cooling vents, fireplaces, or drafty windows.\n5. **Fertilization:** Feed your peace lily with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength to avoid burning the roots.\n6. **Potting Mix:** Use a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for tropical plants like peace lilies. Avoid using regular potting soil, as it can retain too much water.\n7. **Pruning:** Remove dead or dying leaves and flowers to maintain the plant's appearance and promote healthy growth.\n8. **Repotting:** Peace lilies typically need to be repotted every 2-3 years as the plant outgrows its container. Choose a pot that is only slightly larger than the previous one, and use fresh potting mix.\n9. **Pest Control:** Check your peace lily regularly for pests like mealybugs, spider mites, or scale. Isolate infested plants, and treat them with insecticidal soap or neem oil according to the product's instructions.\n\n**Common Issues with Peace Lilies:**\n\n* **Yellowing Leaves:** Overwatering, underwatering, or extreme temperatures can cause yellowing leaves. Adjust your watering schedule and ensure the plant is in a stable environment.\n* **Brown Tips:** Brown tips can be caused by dry air, overfertilization, or fluoride toxicity (from tap water). Increase humidity, reduce fertilization, and use filtered water to mitigate these issues.\n* **No Blooms:** Peace lilies may not produce flowers if they're not receiving enough light or are too pot-bound. Prune the plant to encourage new growth, and consider repotting it into a slightly larger container.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to nurse your peace lily back to health and enjoy its beautiful white blooms and elegant foliage.",
