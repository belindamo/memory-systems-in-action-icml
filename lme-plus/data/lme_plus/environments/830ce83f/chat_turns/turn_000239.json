  "content": "You suggest that Guts use the holy water as a weapon against the demons. Guts pulls out the vial of holy water and throws it at the demons. The holy water makes contact and the demons scream in agony as it burns their flesh.\n\nWith the demons momentarily stunned, Guts takes the opportunity to strike them down one by one. After a fierce battle, Guts emerges victorious and the demons are defeated.\n\nAs a reward, Puck finds the cursed mirror in the possession of the demons. This mirror is said to have the power to grant wishes, but at a terrible cost.\n\nNext turn:\n\nGuts and Puck are making their way through a ruined city, the buildings shattered and the streets littered with debris. Suddenly, they come across a powerful sorceress, her eyes glowing with magic. She is fiercely guarding a powerful spellbook, said to contain spells of immense power.\n\nA) Suggest that Guts use the Dragon Slayer to cut through the sorceress.\nB) Urge Guts to use the cursed mirror to grant a wish for victory.\nC) Tell Guts to use his agility to dodge the sorceress's spells and reach the spellbook.\n\nWhat is your choice, player?",
