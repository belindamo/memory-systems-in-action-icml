  "content": "I've been listening to \"My Favorite Murder\" for over a year now, and I'm always looking for new true crime podcasts to listen to. I think I'll check out \"Crime Junkie\" and \"Last Podcast on the Left\" first, since they sound like they have a similar tone to \"My Favorite Murder\". By the way, I've been really into TV shows lately, and I just realized I've been watching a lot of Netflix originals. Do you think I can get a list of all the Netflix original shows that have been released this year?",
