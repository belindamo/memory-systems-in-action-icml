  "content": "That's a great idea! Starting the story with a sudden collapse of one of the isles creates a sense of urgency and danger right from the beginning, and sets the stage for the characters to take action and investigate the cause of the collapse. This event could also be a catalyst for the main characters to embark on a journey to find the World Stones and prevent further collapses from happening.\n\nThe scenes of the populace scrambling to safety aboard airships and Aire Trams adds a sense of chaos and desperation, and could create interesting character dynamics and conflicts as people fight for survival. The loss of life on the Aire Trams adds a tragic element to the story and raises the stakes for the characters.\n\nAs the story progresses, the characters could investigate the cause of the collapse, whether it was due to natural causes, a magical event, or something else entirely. This could lead them to uncover larger conspiracies and conflicts that threaten the stability of the world, and force them to make difficult decisions and alliances.\n\nOverall, starting the story with a sudden collapse creates a sense of urgency and action, and sets the stage for the larger conflicts and mysteries to be explored throughout the story.",
