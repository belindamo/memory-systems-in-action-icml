  "content": "I understand your concerns, and it is true that resources and efforts should be focused on solving real-world problems that affect people's lives. However, it's also important to understand that the pursuit of pure research, like mathematics, can have significant positive impacts on society in the long run.\n\nFirstly, knowledge gained from pure research can lead to practical applications down the line. For instance, research in pure mathematics in the past might have seemed pointless at the time, but has now led to important advancements in fields like cryptography, computer sciences, and physics. \n\nSecondly, pure research promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are vital in addressing real-world issues. Theoretical studies often push the limits of current knowledge and force us to think beyond our current understanding. The skills developed in this process can then be applied towards solving practical issues.\n\nLastly, the pursuit of pure knowledge and intellectual curiosity in itself is a valuable human endeavor. It is a testament to the human spirit of exploration and innovation to better comprehend the universe around us. It is this very pursuit of knowledge that propels us forward and has led to some of the most significant discoveries in history.\n\nTherefore, while it's important to prioritize solving real-world problems and allocate resources accordingly, we should not discount or neglect the value of pure research. It is often through these so-called \"pointless endeavors\" that we can unlock new frontiers and create a better future for us all.",
