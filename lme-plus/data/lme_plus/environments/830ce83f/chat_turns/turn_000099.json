The glass top will also help to reflect light and make the room feel more spacious.\n\nThe wall-mounted soundbar with wireless connectivity is a fantastic option for a clutter-free and convenient setup. It's perfect for a modern living room, and the wireless connectivity will make it easy to connect your devices and stream your favorite music or games.\n\nNow, about the throw pillows and blankets in blue... I think that's an excellent idea! Adding more blue accents to the room will help to tie in the accent wall and create a cohesive look. The throw pillows and blankets will also add a cozy touch to the room, making it feel more inviting and comfortable.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider when choosing the throw pillows and blankets:\n\n1. **Choose a blue shade that complements the accent wall**: Select a blue shade that's similar to the accent wall or slightly lighter/darker to create a harmonious look.\n2. **Mix and match textures**: Combine smooth, velvety pillows with soft, chunky blankets to add depth and visual interest to the room.\n3. **Don't overdo it**: Start with a few throw pillows and blankets and add more as needed. You want to avoid overwhelming the room with too many blue accents.\n4. **Consider adding a few neutral pillows and blankets**: Mixing in some neutral-colored throw pillows and blankets will help to balance out the blue accents and prevent the room from feeling too blue-heavy.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, you'll create a cohesive and inviting living room that's perfect for gaming, socializing, and relaxing.\n\nHow do you feel about adding some plants to the room? Greenery can add a touch of natural beauty and freshness to the space.",
