Here are some tips to help you achieve perfectly roasted Brussels sprouts:\n\n**Ideal Temperature and Cooking Time:**\n\n* Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n* Cut the Brussels sprouts in half or quarter them, depending on their size.\n* Toss the sprouts with olive oil, salt, and pepper on a baking sheet.\n* Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and caramelized, stirring occasionally.\n\n**Tips for Perfect Roasting:**\n\n1. **Cutting:** Cut the Brussels sprouts in a way that exposes their inner layers. This will help them roast more evenly and caramelize better.\n2. **Dry them:** Pat the sprouts dry with a paper towel before roasting to help them brown more efficiently.\n3. **Don't overcrowd:** Spread the sprouts out in a single layer on the baking sheet to ensure even roasting. You might need to use multiple sheets depending on the quantity.\n4. **Stir occasionally:** Stir the sprouts halfway through the cooking time to promote even browning.\n5. **Check for doneness:** Check the sprouts after 20 minutes. They should be tender, caramelized, and slightly charred. If not, continue roasting in 5-minute increments until they reach your desired level of doneness.\n\n**Adding Flavor:**\n\n* **Garlic:** Mince 1-2 cloves of garlic and toss it with the sprouts before roasting for an added depth of flavor.\n* **Lemon:** Zest a lemon over the sprouts before roasting for a bright, citrusy flavor. You can also squeeze some lemon juice over the sprouts during the last 5 minutes of roasting.\n* **Herbs:** Toss the sprouts with chopped fresh herbs like thyme, rosemary, or parsley for added flavor.\n* **Bacon or Pancetta:** Crumble some cooked bacon or pancetta over the sprouts for a smoky, savory flavor.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll achieve deliciously roasted Brussels sprouts that will beautifully complement your braised short ribs. Enjoy!",
