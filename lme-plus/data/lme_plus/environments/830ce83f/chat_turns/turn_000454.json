  "content": "Great idea! Using ocean and sea terminology for the rifts and formations adds a sense of continuity and familiarity to the world we've created, while also emphasizing the isolation and distance between the different societies and landmasses. Here are a few more terms that could be used in this world:\n\n* The formations: Isles\n* The rifts: Aire Sea\n* The golden side of the chasm: Dawn Coast\n* Dangerous or turbulent areas of the Aire Sea: Storm Seas\n* Small formations within the Aire Sea: Coral Isles\n* Societies on the Isles: Island Nations\n* Leaders of the Island Nations: Sea Kings/Queens\n* Traveling between the Isles: Sailing the Aire\n* Dangerous sea creatures in the Aire Sea: Leviathans\n* A society that thrives near the Aire Sea and trades with the Islanders: Coastal Dwellers\n\nBy using these terms consistently throughout the story, you can create a sense of familiarity and shared culture among the characters and societies, even as they come from different areas and have different beliefs and customs. These terms can also be used to create metaphors and symbolism, highlighting the themes of isolation, distance, and connection in the story.",
