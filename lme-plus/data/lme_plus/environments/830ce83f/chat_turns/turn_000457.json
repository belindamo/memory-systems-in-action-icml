  "content": "One idea I had was that a specific event might kick off the story with action. I think that since shortly after the initial collapse of the lands, none of the isles have fallen. They've stood strong and sturdy. But our story opens with a moderate sized isles, perhaps a few miles across, sudden collapses. The first scenes are of the populace scrambling to safety aboard airships and others trying to escape across Aire Trams which are a system of suspended gondolas that act as the heavy lift transport for goods and materials and as a slower, lower cost form of transport for passengers. Of course, those who try to escape on the Trams are lost when the Isle collapses since the Tram lines attached to them collapse as well.",
