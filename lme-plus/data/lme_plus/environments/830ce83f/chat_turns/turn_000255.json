Set goals for diversity and inclusion: Companies can set specific goals for hiring diverse talent, promoting inclusion, eliminating bias, and developing inclusive leadership practices.\n\n2. Revise job descriptions and requirements: Companies should remove any requirements which could exclude people due to their gender, age, race or other factors. For example, focus on skills and experience that are most important to the job and avoid specifying advanced degrees or years of experience that may be unnecessary.\n\n3. Use diverse and inclusive recruiting practices: Companies can promote job openings on diverse job boards and in groups, and evaluate resumes using objective criteria. They can also use blind resumes or \u2018alternatives to resumes\u2019 (e.g., skills tests or job simulations) to reduce unconscious bias in hiring.\n\n4. Train employees on bias and inclusion: Companies can provide training to employees on how to recognize and eliminate their own biases, and create a culture of inclusion that respects diverse perspectives.\n\n5. Implement diversity initiatives: Companies can support their employees with initiatives that help break down any barriers to their success. For example, mentorship programs, employee resource groups, and internal networks create a sense of belonging and empowerment.\n\n6. Promote diversity in leadership: Companies can promote diversity in leadership by identifying employees who have the potential to be leaders and providing them with opportunities to showcase their skills.\n\n7. Conduct regular diversity audits: Companies can track diversity and inclusion metrics, identify roadblocks and create ongoing opportunities to improve.\n\nBy taking these steps, businesses can create a more diverse and inclusive workplace, which in turn has numerous benefits, including greater innovation, improved employee engagement, better decision making, and stronger business outcomes.",
