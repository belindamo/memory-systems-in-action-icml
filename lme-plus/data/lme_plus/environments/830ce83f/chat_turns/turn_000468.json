  "content": "If you want to limit the height of the dropdown menu and make it scrollable, you can set a fixed height on the container element that contains the dropdown items, and then add `overflow-y: auto` to allow for scrolling. Here's an example:\n```css\n.dropdown-container {\n  height: 200px; /* Set a fixed height here */\n  overflow-y: auto;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the height of the container element is set to `200px`. You can adjust this value to fit the height of your popup modal. The `overflow-y` property is set to `auto` to allow for vertical scrolling when the content exceeds the height of the container element.\n\nIf you want to make sure that the height of the dropdown menu is never greater than the height of the popup modal, you can set the `max-height` property to the same value as the height of the popup modal, like this:\n```css\n.dropdown-container {\n  max-height: 400px; /* Set a max-height to the same value as popup modal height */\n  height: auto;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `max-height` property is set to `400px`, which is the same height as the popup modal. The `height` property is set to `auto` to allow the container element to grow if the content is smaller than the `max-height` value, and `overflow-y` is set to `auto` to enable scrolling if the content exceeds the `max-height` value.",
