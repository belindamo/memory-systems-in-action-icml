  "content": "I've been meaning to try braising for a while now, and this recipe sounds like a great place to start. Speaking of comfort food, I made a big batch of chili con carne last week and had it for lunch and dinner for a few days - it was really convenient and tasty. Do you have any recommendations for sides that would pair well with the braised short ribs or lamb shanks? Maybe something to cut the richness of the dish?",
