It's like a trainwreck that you can't look away from - you're drawn in by the sheer absurdity and unpredictability of the situations.\n\nAnd I think you hit the nail on the head when you said that the fact that these stories are true makes them even more compelling. There's something about knowing that these are real people and events that makes the stories feel more authentic and relatable. It's like you're getting a glimpse into a world that you wouldn't normally see, and that's both fascinating and unsettling at the same time.\n\nI also think that documentaries like \"Tiger King\" tap into our natural curiosity about the human condition. We're all fascinated by people who are different from us, who live on the fringes of society, or who have made choices that we can't understand. And documentaries like \"Tiger King\" give us a chance to explore those worlds and try to make sense of them.\n\nDo you think that documentaries like \"Tiger King\" also serve as a form of social commentary? Like, they're not just entertaining, but they're also saying something about the world we live in and the people who inhabit it?",
