Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Sanibel Island**: Only about 30 minutes from Fort Myers Beach, Sanibel Island is famous for its shell-filled beaches, wildlife refuges, and picturesque lighthouse. We could spend a day exploring the island, visiting the J.N. Ding Darling National Wildlife Refuge, and searching for seashells.\n2. **Fort Myers River District**: If we want to explore a more urban area, the Fort Myers River District is about 20 minutes from Fort Myers Beach. We could visit the Edison and Ford Winter Estates, take a stroll along the Caloosahatchee River, and enjoy the local restaurants and shops.\n3. **Cayo Costa State Park**: For a more adventurous day trip, we could head to Cayo Costa State Park, about an hour from Fort Myers Beach. The park offers hiking, biking, and kayaking opportunities, as well as a beautiful beach and historic lighthouse.\n4. **Shelling and Dolphin-Watching Tours**: If we want to stay on the water, we could book a shelling or dolphin-watching tour. These tours usually depart from Fort Myers Beach or nearby Captiva Island.\n5. **Local Events and Festivals**: Depending on the time of year we visit, there might be local events or festivals happening in Fort Myers Beach or nearby areas. We could check the local calendar to see what's happening during our trip.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you interested in exploring Fort Myers Beach and its surroundings, or do you have other ideas for our trip?\n\nLet me know, and we can start planning the rest of our adventure!",
