Here's a poem about soup:\n\nSoup, oh soup, the food of the gods,\nWarming and nourishing, fit for a king.\nFrom a simple broth to a hearty stew,\nThere's a soup for every mood.\n\nA bowl of steamy soup on a cold winter's night,\nFills the belly and warms the soul.\nWith chunks of vegetables and tender bits of meat,\nIt's a meal that can't be beat.\n\nWhether it's creamy or clear,\nSpicy or mild, hot or cold,\nSoup is a food that's always dear,\nTo young and old.\n\nSo here's to soup, the ultimate comfort food,\nMay it always bring us cheer,\nFor in a bowl of soup, we find the ultimate mood,\nOf love, warmth and cheer."
