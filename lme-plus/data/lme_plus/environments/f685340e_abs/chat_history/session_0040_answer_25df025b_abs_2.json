Here are some tips to help you enhance your swimming technique:\n\n1. **Body Position**: Maintain a horizontal body position with your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned. This will help you cut through the water with minimal resistance.\n2. **Kicking Technique**: Focus on a flutter kick, keeping your legs relaxed and moving your feet in a small, quick motion. Avoid bending your knees or ankles.\n3. **Arm Stroke**: Use a high elbow catch, entering the water with your fingertips and pulling back with your palms facing downwards. Keep your arms relaxed and avoid crossing the midline of your body.\n4. **Hand Entry**: Enter the water with your hands entering thumb-first, keeping your wrists relaxed and your fingers together.\n5. **Breathing**: Practice bilateral breathing (breathing on both sides) to improve your body rotation and balance. Exhale slowly underwater, and inhale quickly when you turn your head to the side.\n6. **Rotation**: Rotate your body with each stroke, keeping your shoulders and hips aligned. This will help you maintain a streamlined position and reduce drag.\n7. **Streamline**: Focus on maintaining a streamlined position, especially during the glide phase of your stroke. This will help you conserve energy and move more efficiently through the water.\n8. **Drills**: Incorporate drills into your swim practice to improve specific skills, such as flip turns, dives, or stroke technique.\n9. **Video Analysis**: Record yourself swimming and analyze your technique. This will help you identify areas for improvement and track your progress over time.\n10. **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key when it comes to improving your swimming technique. Aim to practice regularly, even if it's just for a short session.\n\nRemember to always warm up before your swim sessions and stretch afterwards to prevent injuries.\n\nIt's great that you're enjoying your swim lessons! Take advantage of your instructor's feedback and guidance to help you improve your technique.\n\nNow, go crush your swim sessions and get ready to serve up some aces on the tennis court on Sunday!",
