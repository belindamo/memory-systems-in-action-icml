      "content": "As an AI language model, I have access to up-to-date information. As of 2021, a total of 1,357 Victoria Crosses have been awarded since its inception in 1856. The vast majority of recipients have been British or Commonwealth servicemen, though a small number of honorary awards have also been made to non-British individuals who have performed acts of courage in action with British or Commonwealth forces. The award is extremely rare, with only a handful of recipients being awarded each year, and only a small fraction of recipients survive to wear the medal in later life."

      "content": "Yes, the bravery and courage displayed by Victoria Cross recipients are truly remarkable feats of human behavior. It's true that not everyone has the same level of courage or bravery, and that's understandable as everyone has their own fears and limitations. However, it's important to remember that courage is not the absence of fear but rather the ability to act despite being afraid. Each individual has their own unique strengths and abilities, and it's important to recognize and appreciate that. It's also worth noting that while not everyone can perform heroic feats, there are many other ways for individuals to make a positive impact in their communities and in the lives of those around them."

      "content": "Yes, that's absolutely correct! Courage and bravery manifest in many different ways, and while the Victoria Cross is a prestigious award for acts of bravery in the military, there are several other awards recognizing acts of courage and heroism outside of the military. Some examples of non-military awards include:\n\n1. The Carnegie Medal for Heroism, which is awarded to individuals who risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others.\n\n2. The Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest civilian award for individuals who have made significant contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\n\n3. The George Cross, which is awarded for acts of extreme courage and valor in circumstances other than those of military conflict.\n\n4. The Param Vir Chakra, which is India's highest military honor awarded for acts of valor in the presence of the enemy.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many non-military awards that recognize acts of courage and bravery."
