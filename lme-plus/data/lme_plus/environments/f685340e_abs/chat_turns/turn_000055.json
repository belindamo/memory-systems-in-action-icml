  "content": "There have been a few doping scandals in synchronized swimming, which is a sport that, like many other Olympic events, is subject to rigorous anti-doping protocols.\n\nThe use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in synchronized swimming is prohibited and monitored by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The agency conducts drug tests on athletes, both in-competition and out-of-competition, to ensure that they are not using prohibited substances. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also conducts additional tests during the Olympic Games.\n\nOne of the most high-profile doping cases in synchronized swimming involved Chinese swimmer Huang Xiaoxuan, who tested positive for the diuretic furosemide during the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in Russia. She was suspended for two years and banned from competition, including the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nTo ensure fair competition, synchronized swimming athletes must adhere to strict rules regarding drug use, and there are severe consequences for those who violate the rules. Athletes are also required to submit to regular drug testing and must follow strict protocols for any medications or supplements they take.\n\nAdditionally, the sport follows strict rules and regulations to ensure fairness in competition. Judges use objective criteria to evaluate synchronized swimming routines, and the scoring system rewards technical and artistic excellence equally. Furthermore, athletes cannot qualify for the Olympics unless they meet strict qualification requirements, ensuring that only the best and most qualified athletes compete at the highest level.",
