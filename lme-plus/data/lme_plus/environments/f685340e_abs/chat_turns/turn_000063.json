  "content": "Congratulations on maintaining regular water changes!\n\nA 25% weekly water change is a good starting point, but it's essential to monitor your tank's specific needs and adjust accordingly. With the addition of new fish, it's a good idea to reassess your water change schedule.\n\nHere are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Bioload**: With the addition of Corydoras catfish, your bioload will increase. More fish means more waste production, which can lead to higher ammonia and nitrite levels.\n2. **Water parameters**: Monitor your water parameters, including ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH, to ensure they remain stable and within safe ranges for your fish.\n3. **Water quality**: Consider the overall water quality, including the level of dissolved organic compounds (DOCs), which can affect the health and well-being of your fish.\n\nTo maintain optimal water quality, you may want to consider:\n\n1. **Increasing the frequency**: Instead of doing a 25% water change once a week, you could do a 10-15% water change every 3-4 days. This will help maintain more stable water parameters and reduce the risk of water quality issues.\n2. **Increasing the amount**: If you prefer to stick to a weekly water change schedule, you could consider increasing the amount to 30-35%. However, be cautious not to remove too much of the beneficial bacteria colony, which can lead to a mini-cycle.\n3. **Monitoring and adjusting**: Regularly test your water parameters and adjust your water change schedule accordingly. If you notice any fluctuations or issues, you may need to increase the frequency or amount of water changes.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and make gradual changes to your water change schedule. Sudden changes can stress your fish and disrupt the balance of your tank's ecosystem.\n\nBy monitoring your water parameters and adjusting your water change schedule as needed, you'll be able to maintain a healthy and thriving environment for your fish.",
