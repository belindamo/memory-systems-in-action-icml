Here are some tips to help you create an eye-catching display:\n\n1. **Create a Visual Hierarchy**: Organize your products in a way that creates a visual flow. Use risers, pedestals, or crates to create different levels, and group similar products together. This will guide the customer's eye through your display.\n2. **Use Attractive Containers**: Use decorative baskets, wooden crates, or vintage containers to add a rustic or homespun touch to your display.
