  "content": "Using spare energy-efficient bulbs from Home Depot is a great idea!\n\n**Energy-efficient bulbs:**\n\n1. **Check the packaging:** Before replacing the bulb, double-check the packaging to ensure the spare bulbs are compatible with your table lamp. Look for the following:\n\t* Voltage: Make sure the voltage rating on the bulb matches the voltage of your lamp (usually 120V in the US).\n\t* Wattage: Check if the wattage of the spare bulb is suitable for your lamp. If your lamp has a maximum wattage rating, don't exceed it.\n\t* Base type: Ensure the spare bulb has the same base type as the current bulb (e.g., E26, E12, or GU10).\n2. **Bulb type:** Since you mentioned energy-efficient bulbs, I'm assuming they're either LED or CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) bulbs. Both are great options for energy efficiency, but they have different characteristics:\n\t* LED bulbs: Provide instant-on, are dimmable, and have a longer lifespan (up to 25,000 hours).\n\t* CFL bulbs: Take a little time to warm up, are not always dimmable, and have a shorter lifespan (around 8,000-10,000 hours) compared to LEDs.\n\n**Replacing the bulb:**\n\n1. **Turn off the lamp:** Make sure the lamp is switched off before replacing the bulb to avoid electrical shock or injury.\n2. **Remove the shade:** Take off the shade to access the bulb. This will also give you a chance to dust the lamp and shade.\n3. **Replace the bulb:** Gently remove the old bulb and discard it. Insert the new energy-efficient bulb, making sure it's seated properly.\n4. **Replace the shade:** Put the shade back on, and you're done!\n\n**What to expect:**\n\nAfter replacing the bulb, you should notice an improvement in the lighting. If the new bulb is an LED, it might be brighter and whiter than the old one. CFL bulbs might take a little time to reach their full brightness.\n\nIf the lamp still doesn't provide enough light, we can explore additional options, such as:\n\n* Adjusting the lamp's position or direction\n* Adding a second lamp or a floor lamp to supplement the light\n* Considering a lamp with a higher wattage or a more focused beam\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any other questions before replacing the bulb?",
