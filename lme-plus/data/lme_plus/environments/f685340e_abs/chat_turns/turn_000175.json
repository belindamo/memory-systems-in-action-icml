  "content": "The Geneva Conventions are a set of international treaties, signed by most countries in the world, that establish the standards of basic humanitarian treatment for victims of war. The agreements are designed to protect people who do not participate in hostilities, such as civilians, medical personnel, and aid workers, as well as those who do, such as soldiers who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked. They also specify certain rules for the conduct of hostilities, including the prohibition of torture and other cruel treatment, the protection of civilians and non-combatants, and the humane treatment of prisoners of war. The Geneva Conventions are widely regarded as an important cornerstone of international humanitarian law, and have helped to establish a set of principles that provide a framework for the conduct of wars and the treatment of their victims.",
