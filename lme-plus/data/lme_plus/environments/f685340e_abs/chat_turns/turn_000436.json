Could you please provide me with the following details:\n\n1. Your city or zip code?\n2. How far would you like your jogging route to be (e.g., 3 miles, 5 miles, etc.)?\n3. Are there any specific landmarks, parks, or areas you'd like to include or avoid in your jogging route?\n\nRegarding your tennis game on Sunday, that sounds like a great way to stay active and social! You might want to double-check the weather forecast beforehand to ensure it doesn't interfere with your plans.\n\nOnce I have more information about your location and preferences, I can suggest some jogging routes for you to explore.",
