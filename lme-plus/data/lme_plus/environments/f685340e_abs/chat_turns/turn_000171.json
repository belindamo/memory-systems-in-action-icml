Courage and bravery manifest in many different ways, and while the Victoria Cross is a prestigious award for acts of bravery in the military, there are several other awards recognizing acts of courage and heroism outside of the military. Some examples of non-military awards include:\n\n1. The Carnegie Medal for Heroism, which is awarded to individuals who risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others.\n\n2. The Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest civilian award for individuals who have made significant contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\n\n3. The George Cross, which is awarded for acts of extreme courage and valor in circumstances other than those of military conflict.\n\n4.
