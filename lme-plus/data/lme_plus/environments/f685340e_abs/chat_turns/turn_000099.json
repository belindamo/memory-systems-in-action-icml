  "content": "Yes, that is true. The ancient Egyptians were remarkably resourceful and innovative with the limited resources they had. They were able to accomplish so much through their impressive engineering skills, such as building the pyramids and other structures, and their advancements in medicine, math, and science. They could engineer great structures even without modern technologies like cranes, bulldozers, hydraulic tools or computers. They relied mainly on simple tools, such as copper chisels and stone hammers, and lever systems, with many workers and a well-organized system of cooperation. Their creativity and innovation continue to inspire people today.",
