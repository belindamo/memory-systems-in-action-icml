Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Booking through a travel agency:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Convenience: Travel agencies often have established relationships with hotels and can offer a one-stop solution for your entire trip.\n* Package deals: Agencies might offer discounts or promotions when booking accommodations as part of a package deal with flights, transportation, or activities.\n* Local expertise: Agencies can provide valuable insights and recommendations for accommodations that might not be easily found online.\n* Support: If any issues arise during your trip, the agency can help resolve them.\n\nCons:\n\n* Limited options: Agencies might have limited options or partnerships with specific hotels, which could limit your choices.\n* Markups: Agencies might charge a markup on accommodations, which could increase the overall cost.\n\n**Booking through Booking.com or similar websites:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Wider selection: Online travel agencies (OTAs) like Booking.com offer a vast selection of accommodations, including smaller, local options that might not be available through travel agencies.\n* Competitive pricing: OTAs often have competitive pricing, and you can easily compare prices across multiple websites.\n* Flexibility: You can book and cancel or modify your accommodations more easily through OTAs.\n* Reviews: OTAs provide user reviews and ratings, which can help you make a more informed decision.\n\nCons:\n\n* No personalized support: If you encounter issues, you'll need to contact the hotel or OTA's customer support, which might not be as personalized as a travel agency.\n* No package deals: You'll need to book each component of your trip separately, which might not be as convenient.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n* If you're looking for a hassle-free experience and want to book a package deal, a travel agency might be a good choice.\n* If you're comfortable with booking each component separately and want more flexibility and options, Booking.com or similar websites could be the way to go.\n* If you're looking for a specific type of accommodation, such as a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) or a boutique hotel, a travel agency might have more expertise and options.\n\nFor your Japan trip, you might consider a hybrid approach:\n\n* Book your main accommodations through a travel agency, especially if you're looking for a package deal or want their expertise in finding a specific type of accommodation.\n* Use Booking.com or similar websites to book additional nights or alternative accommodations, such as a hostel or Airbnb, if you want more flexibility or options.\n\nRemember to always research and read reviews before making a booking, regardless of whether you choose a travel agency or an OTA.",
