Here are some of the steps that can be taken to promote Telugu films internationally:\n\n1. Screenings at International Film Festivals: Telugu filmmakers can showcase their movies at various international film festivals, which can generate interest and create visibility in the international market. It also provides an opportunity for filmmakers to network and collaborate with international filmmakers and explore new avenues for funding and distribution.\n\n2. Digital Platforms: Digital platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other streaming platforms have created a space for regional cinema to showcase their films to international audiences. Telugu filmmakers can utilize these platforms to showcase their films to a broader audience.\n\n3. Subtitling in International Languages: Subtitling Telugu films in popular international languages such as English, Spanish, or French can attract international viewership. The Telangana government can support the production of subtitles or dubbing Telugu films to reach a broader global audience.\n\n4. Collaborations with International Filmmakers: The Telugu film industry can collaborate with international studios or filmmakers to bring international talent and expertise to their movies. This can help raise the production value of Telugu films and make them more appealing to international viewers.\n\nOverall, promoting regional cinema is a challenging but necessary task that requires sustained efforts at both the state and national level. The Telangana government, along with Telugu filmmakers, can take steps to improve its international presence and reach and compete with the Bollywood film industry.",
