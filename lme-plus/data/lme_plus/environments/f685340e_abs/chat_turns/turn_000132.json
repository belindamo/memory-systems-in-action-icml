  "content": "I've been really enjoying \"Daring Greatly\" so far. One thing that's really resonated with me is the idea of embracing vulnerability and imperfection. It's made me realize that I don't have to be perfect and that it's okay to take risks and make mistakes. I've also been thinking a lot about how I can apply the concept of \"wholeheartedness\" to my own life, especially when it comes to my reading habits. I've been trying to be more intentional about choosing books that truly interest me, rather than just following what's popular or trendy.",
