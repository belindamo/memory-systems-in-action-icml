The state government has established a government-owned production house, Telangana State Film Development Corporation (TSFDC), to support film production and provide essential facilities such as theaters, studios, and post-production facilities. The government has also launched the Telangana State Film Awards to encourage and recognize the best work in the film industry.\n\nThe Telangana government has also sought to promote Telugu language and culture through its film industry by introducing Telugu language as a compulsory subject in all schools in the state. The government has also decided to host the International Telugu Film Festival every year to promote the Telugu film industry globally.\n\nThe Telangana government has also been supportive of popular Telugu film actors who have entered politics. For example, K. Chiranjeevi, one of the most successful actors in the Telugu film industry, merged his political party with the Congress party in 2011 and was later appointed as the Union Minister of State for Tourism in the UPA government.\n\nOverall, the Telangana government has navigated the politics of the film industry by providing infrastructure, support, and recognition to the Telugu film industry while simultaneously promoting the state's language and culture.",
