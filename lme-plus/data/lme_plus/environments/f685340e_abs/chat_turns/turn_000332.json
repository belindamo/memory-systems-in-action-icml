  "content": "Thanks for the example! It looks like the Lollipop JSON representation for a workflow includes a unique identifier, properties, type, id, and actions.\n\nThe properties seem to include some metadata about the workflow, such as the element\\_id that represents the initial trigger.\n\nThe actions seem to include a set of actions that should be executed when the workflow is triggered. Each action seems to include properties that represent the element involved in the action, the type of action, and the id of the action.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that when a workflow refers to other elements, it uses those elements' reference ids, such as \"bTGzi\" in this example.\n\nOverall, it seems like Lollipop JSON has a specific structure and set of rules for representing elements and workflows. Do you have any more examples or questions for me?",
