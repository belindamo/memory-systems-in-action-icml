Could you please share the following details:\n\n1. What is your workplace location (city, state/province, or zip/postal code)?\n2. Are there any specific features you'd like to include in your route, such as:\n\t* Scenic views (e.g., parks, waterfront, trails)?\n\t* Low-traffic roads or bike paths?\n\t* Hills or flat terrain?\n\t* Shaded areas or sun exposure?\n3. Are you open to exploring new neighborhoods or would you prefer routes that stick to familiar areas?\n4. Do you have any specific route preferences, such as:\n\t* Out-and-back routes or loops?\n\t* One-way routes with a designated start and end point?\n5. Are there any safety concerns or restrictions you'd like me to consider (e.g., avoiding busy roads, construction areas, or areas with limited lighting)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with some personalized 5K and 10K route suggestions near your workplace.",
