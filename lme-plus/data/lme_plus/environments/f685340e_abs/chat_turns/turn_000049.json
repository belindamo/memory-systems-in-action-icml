The music used featured a wide variety of genres ranging from classical to pop music. \n\nThe United States team, which won gold in both the duet and team events, used music by American composer George Gershwin for their routines. The music included excerpts from Gershwins\u2019 \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" \u201cPorgy and Bess,\u201d and \u201cAn American in Paris.\u201d The Canadian team, which also won gold medals in both categories, used music from Beethoven, Sibelius, and Rachmaninoff for their routines.\n\nOther teams also featured a mix of classical and contemporary music, including Spanish team's performance to Carmen Suite and Russian team's medley of Beatles tunes among other songs.\n\nThe inclusion of music in synchronized swimming performances added a new level of creativity and complexity to the sport, allowing athletes to elevate their routines into artistic and technical masterpieces. Since then, musical accompaniment has become a standard feature of synchronized swimming events, with teams carefully selecting music that complements their routine's theme and mood.",
