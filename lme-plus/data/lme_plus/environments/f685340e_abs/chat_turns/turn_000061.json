  "content": "Corydoras catfish are an excellent addition to a community tank like yours. They're small, peaceful, and great for cleaning up food debris from the substrate.\n\nWhen it comes to stocking Corydoras catfish, it's essential to consider their social behavior and space requirements. Corydoras are schooling fish and prefer to be in groups, so it's best to add a small school of them to your tank.\n\nFor a 55-gallon tank with a moderate bioload and new rock caves and formations, I'd recommend adding 6-8 Corydoras catfish. This will provide them with a comfortable group size and give them plenty of space to roam and forage.\n\nHere's a rough guideline to consider:\n\n* 1-2 Corydoras catfish per 10 gallons of water (so 5-6 for a 55-gallon tank)\n* Since you're adding them to a moderately stocked tank, I'd recommend the higher end of that range (6-8) to ensure they have enough space and can establish a stable social hierarchy\n\nSome popular Corydoras species for community tanks include:\n\n* Corydoras paleatus (Peppered Cory)\n* Corydoras aeneus (Bronze Cory)\n* Corydoras trilineatus (Three-lined Cory)\n* Corydoras hastatus (Dwarf Cory)\n\nRemember to introduce them slowly and in a group, as Corydoras can be sensitive to changes in water parameters and may stress if introduced individually.\n\nBefore adding the Corydoras, make sure to:\n\n* Acclimate them slowly and carefully to your tank's water parameters\n* Provide plenty of hiding places and visual barriers to help them feel secure\n* Maintain good water circulation and oxygenation\n* Monitor your tank's water parameters and make adjustments as needed\n\nWith proper care and attention, your Corydoras catfish will thrive and become a great addition to your community tank!",
