  "content": "Netscape's market share declined significantly as a result of the \"browser wars\". In the mid-to-late 1990s, Netscape Navigator was the dominant web browser with a market share of over 90%. However, when Microsoft released Internet Explorer with its Windows operating system in 1995, it quickly gained popularity and began to chip away at Netscape's market share. Microsoft's anti-competitive behavior, such as bundling Internet Explorer with Windows and making it difficult for users to uninstall, further hurt Netscape's market share. By 1999, Netscape's market share had dropped below 50%, and it ultimately led to the company's acquisition by AOL.",
