However, synchronized swimming has been constantly evolving since its inception in the Olympic Games, and the performances have become more complex and ambitious over time.\n\nIn the 1988 Olympics, the synchronized swimming routines were relatively simple and focused on basic movements and choreography. However, since then, the sport has grown and developed significantly, with athletes incorporating more technical elements, lifts, acrobatics, and innovative choreography.\n\nIn recent years, synchronized swimming has been renamed as artistic swimming, and changes have been made to the scoring system to reflect the sport's evolution towards artistic and technical excellence. The use of props, creative costuming, high-level lifts, and complex movements has become increasingly popular, and the routines now demand a high level of athleticism, coordination, and creativity.\n\nIn conclusion, synchronized swimming has evolved since its inception, and the routines have become more complex and ambitious over time. The sport now emphasizes artistic and athletic excellence, requiring athletes to push the boundaries of what is possible in this highly technical and rigorous sport.",
