  "content": "That's great to hear! 3Blue1Brown's animations are an excellent resource for learning complex math concepts in an engaging and intuitive way. His animations have a way of making complex ideas seem simple and accessible, which is perfect for building a strong foundation in math.\n\n**Tips for reviewing calculus and linear algebra:**\n\n1. **Start with the basics:** Make sure you understand the fundamental concepts of calculus and linear algebra, such as limits, derivatives, integrals, vector operations, and matrix multiplication.\n2. **Focus on intuition:** Don't just memorize formulas and equations. Instead, focus on understanding the intuition behind them. Ask yourself why certain formulas work and how they can be applied to real-world problems.\n3. **Practice, practice, practice:** Practice solving problems and exercises to reinforce your understanding of the concepts. You can use online resources like Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare, or Wolfram Alpha to find practice problems.\n4. **Use visual aids:** Visual aids like 3Blue1Brown's animations, graphs, and diagrams can help you understand complex concepts more easily.\n5. **Review regularly:** Review calculus and linear algebra regularly, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. Consistency is key to building a strong foundation in math.\n\n**Deep learning resources:**\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with calculus and linear algebra, you can start exploring deep learning resources. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course:** This course is a great introduction to machine learning and deep learning. Andrew Ng is a renowned expert in the field, and his course is highly regarded.\n2. **Deep Learning Specialization:** This specialization, also by Andrew Ng, dives deeper into deep learning and covers topics like neural networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks.\n3. **Keras and TensorFlow tutorials:** Keras and TensorFlow are popular deep learning frameworks. You can find tutorials and guides online to help you get started with these frameworks.\n\nRemember, learning deep learning takes time and practice. Don't be discouraged if you don't understand something at first. Keep practicing, and you'll get there eventually!",
