The vast majority of recipients have been British or Commonwealth servicemen, though a small number of honorary awards have also been made to non-British individuals who have performed acts of courage in action with British or Commonwealth forces. The award is extremely rare, with only a handful of recipients being awarded each year, and only a small fraction of recipients survive to wear the medal in later life.",
