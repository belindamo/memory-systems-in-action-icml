  "content": "Yes, there have been several controversies and rule changes in synchronized swimming since the 1988 Olympics. The most significant changes to the sport have been in the areas of scoring, judging, and technical requirements.\n\nOne notable change was the implementation of a new scoring system for the 2005 World Championships and the 2008 Beijing Olympics. This system was designed to better reward the technical elements of synchronized swimming, such as lifts and acrobatics, and to make the judging more consistent and objective.\n\nAnother significant controversy in synchronized swimming has been the use of underwater speakers to help swimmers synchronize their routines to music. In recent years, there have been concerns about the impact of the music's loudness on the athletes' hearing and about how the use of underwater speakers could create an unfair advantage for certain teams.\n\nIn 2020, World Athletics, the international governing body of the sport, changed the name of the sport from synchronized swimming to artistic swimming. The name change was intended to better reflect the sport's focus on artistic expression and creativity, as well as its growing popularity among athletes and fans.\n\nIn conclusion, synchronized swimming has undergone several rule changes and controversies since the 1988 Olympics, with changes made to the scoring system and judging criteria, and the implementation of new technical requirements. The name of the sport was also changed to reflect its artistic nature.",
