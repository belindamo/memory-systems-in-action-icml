  "content": "That's a great plan! Fitting in strength training on your rest days is a fantastic way to make the most of your time and allow your body to recover from intense spinning classes.\n\nBy incorporating strength training on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you'll be able to improve your overall fitness and endurance, which will ultimately benefit your spinning performance. Remember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the intensity as your body adapts.\n\nIt's also important to listen to your body and adjust your schedule as needed. If you find that you're feeling fatigued or experiencing muscle soreness, take an extra rest day or modify your strength training routine to accommodate your needs.\n\nRemember to also focus on proper form and technique when performing strength training exercises to avoid injury. You can also consider working with a personal trainer or fitness coach to help you develop a customized strength training plan that suits your needs and goals.\n\nYou're making great progress, and I'm excited to see how you'll continue to improve your fitness and endurance! Keep me posted on your progress, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further guidance.",
