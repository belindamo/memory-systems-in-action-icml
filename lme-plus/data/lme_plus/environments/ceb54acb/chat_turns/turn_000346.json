  "content": "Thanks for the example. I think I'll try to apply this scripture to my life by showing love to my sister, who's been going through a tough time with her health. I'll make it a point to call her more often and offer to help with errands or chores. I'll also try to listen to her more and be a supportive sibling. By doing so, I hope to demonstrate the kind of love that Jesus showed us.",
