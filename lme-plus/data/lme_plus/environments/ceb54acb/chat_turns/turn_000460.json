  "content": "Designating a specific area and using storage containers are great steps towards organizing your cleaning supplies.\n\nWhen it comes to storage containers, there are many options available, and the best one for you will depend on your personal preferences, the size of your cleaning station, and the types of supplies you need to store. Here are some popular options:\n\n**1. Plastic bins:** Plastic bins are a popular choice for storing cleaning supplies because they're:\n\t* Affordable\n\t* Water-resistant\n\t* Easy to clean\n\t* Available in various sizes and shapes\n\nLook for bins with lids to keep contents dust-free and prevent spills. You can also label them for easy identification.\n\n**2. Clear storage bins:** Clear storage bins are similar to plastic bins but offer the added benefit of being able to see the contents without having to open the bin. This can be helpful if you have a lot of similar-looking supplies.\n\n**3. Stackable containers:** Stackable containers are great for maximizing vertical space and keeping your cleaning station organized. Look for containers with lids and handles for easy access.\n\n**4. Baskets and wicker containers:** Baskets and wicker containers can add a decorative touch to your cleaning station while storing supplies. They're often made from natural materials like wicker, rattan, or seagrass, which can add a cozy feel to your space.\n\n**5. Shelf dividers:** If you have a shelf or cabinet dedicated to your cleaning supplies, consider using shelf dividers to separate categories of supplies. This can help keep similar items together and prevent clutter.\n\n**6. Adjustable storage systems:** Adjustable storage systems, like modular shelving or storage units, can be customized to fit your specific needs. These systems often include bins, baskets, and shelves that can be arranged to accommodate different sizes and types of supplies.\n\n**7. Repurposed containers:** Think outside the box (or bin!) and consider repurposing containers you already have at home, such as:\n\t* Old laundry baskets\n\t* Plastic totes\n\t* Cardboard boxes\n\t* Wooden crates\n\nWhen choosing storage containers, consider the following factors:\n\n* Durability: Will the container withstand daily use and cleaning products?\n* Size: Choose containers that fit the size and shape of your supplies.\n* Material: Consider the material's resistance to moisture, chemicals, and scratches.\n* Labeling: Look for containers with built-in labeling options or add your own labels for easy identification.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a system that works for you and your cleaning style. Experiment with different containers and arrangements until you find one that keeps your cleaning supplies organized and easily accessible.",
