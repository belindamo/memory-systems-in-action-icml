It's great to hear that you're working on your master's in social work. I apologize for any confusion. At the moment, we only have LCSW and psychiatry positions available at Televero Health. However, I'll keep your profile in mind for future opportunities that align with your experience and qualifications.\n\nBest of luck with your studies, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBailey Baker",
