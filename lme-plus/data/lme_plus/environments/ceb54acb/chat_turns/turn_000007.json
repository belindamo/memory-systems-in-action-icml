This way, you'll be more likely to grab them when you need them.\n2. **Set reminders on your phone:** Set reminders on your phone to use your loyalty apps or cards when you're near a specific store or at a certain time of day. You can use built-in reminder apps or third-party apps like AnyList or Habitica.\n3. **Create a routine:** Make using your loyalty cards or apps a habit by incorporating them into your daily routine. For example, make it a point to open your loyalty app every time you walk into a store or before you make a purchase.\n4. **Visual cues:** Place sticky notes or reminders on your fridge, car dashboard, or near your wallet to remind you to use your loyalty cards or apps.\n5. **Link loyalty cards to your credit/debit cards:** If possible, link your loyalty cards to your credit or debit cards. This way, you'll earn points or rewards automatically when you make a purchase.\n6. **Use a loyalty card aggregator:** Consider using an app like Stocard or AwardWallet, which allows you to store and manage multiple loyalty cards in one place.\n7. **Make it a habit with a buddy:** Share your loyalty goals with a friend or family member and challenge each other to use your loyalty cards or apps regularly.\n8. **Leave notes on your phone's lock screen:** Set a note on your phone's lock screen to remind you to use your loyalty app or card when you're out shopping or grabbing coffee.\n9. **Use a habit-tracking app:** Apps like Habitica, HabitBull, or Loop Habit Tracker can help you track your daily habits, including using your loyalty cards or apps.\n10. **Reward yourself:** Set small rewards for yourself when you reach certain milestones or use your loyalty cards or apps consistently.
