  "content": "The Federal Reserve adjusts interest rates through its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, which occur eight times per year. At each meeting, the FOMC considers a wide range of economic data, including GDP, inflation, unemployment, and consumer spending, to determine whether a change in interest rates is necessary to achieve its goals of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates.\n\nTo make its decision, the FOMC looks at current economic conditions and considers future economic conditions. If the Committee believes that the economy is growing too rapidly, or that inflation is becoming a concern, it may decide to raise interest rates to slow down borrowing and spending. Alternatively, if the Committee believes that the economy is slowing or that inflation is not a concern, it may decide to lower interest rates to make credit more affordable and encourage spending.\n\nUltimately, the decision to adjust interest rates is based on the Fed's mandate to promote a stable and growing economy. The Fed's goal is to keep inflation low and stable, while also creating conditions that encourage job creation and wage growth. The decision to adjust interest rates is a reflection of the Fed's assessment of where the economy is in relation to these goals, and its assessment of the likely impact of changes in interest rates on the economy.",
