Local charity organizations often accept gently used clothing, and your white linen shirt from Zara could be a great addition to their collection.\n\nBefore donating, it's always a good idea to call the organization ahead of time to confirm their acceptance of your item. They may have specific guidelines or restrictions, so it's better to check.\n\nIn general, most charity organizations accept clothing that is:\n\n* Gently used (not stained, torn, or excessively worn)\n* Clean and odor-free\n* In good condition (no missing buttons, broken zippers, etc.)\n\nIf your white linen shirt meets these criteria, it's likely to be accepted. However, if it's heavily stained or damaged, it might not be suitable for donation.\n\n**Cleaning a Coffee-Stained Grey Sweater:**\n\nI'm happy to help you with that! Removing coffee stains can be a challenge, but it's not impossible. Since the stain is a month old, it might require some extra effort, but it's worth a try.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you clean your grey sweater:\n\n1. **Act quickly:** Even though the stain is old, it's still important to act quickly to prevent it from setting further.\n2. **Blot, don't rub:** Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb as much of the coffee as possible. Avoid rubbing, as this can push the stain deeper into the fabric.\n3. **Pre-treat with a stain remover:** Apply a stain remover like Shout or OxiClean directly to the coffee stain. Follow the product instructions and make sure to test a small, inconspicuous area of the sweater first.\n4. **Soak in cold water:** Soak the sweater in cold water for several hours or overnight. This can help loosen the stain and make it easier to remove.\n5. ** Laundry detergent:** Wash the sweater in cold water using a mild laundry detergent. Do not use hot water, as this can set the stain or damage the fabric.\n6. **Hydrogen peroxide:** If the stain is still visible after washing, try applying hydrogen peroxide directly to the area. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes, then rinse with cold water and wash the sweater again.\n7. **Enzyme-based cleaner:** If the stain persists, you can try using an enzyme-based cleaner like Biz or OxiClean. These products contain enzymes that break down protein-based stains like coffee.\n8. **Repeat if necessary:** If the stain is still visible after these steps, you may need to repeat the process a few times until the stain is removed.\n\nRemember to always check the care label of your sweater before attempting to clean it, and test any cleaning products or methods on an inconspicuous area first.\n\nI hope these tips help you remove the coffee stain from your grey sweater!",
