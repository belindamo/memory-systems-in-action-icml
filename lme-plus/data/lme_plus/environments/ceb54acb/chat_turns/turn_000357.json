Try a Minty Fresh Martini or a Cucumber Lime Refresher.\n2. **Basil:** A classic combination is Basil and Lime in a Vodka Basil Martini or a Basil Gimlet.\n3. **Dill:** Dill and cucumber are a natural pair. Try a Dill-icious Vodka Spritz or a Cucumber Dill Martini.\n4. **Lemon Balm:** This herb adds a light, citrusy flavor to cocktails like a Lemon Balm Vodka Sparkler or a Vodka Lemon Balm Collins.\n\n**Triple Sec:**\n\n1. **Rosemary:** The piney flavor of rosemary complements the orange notes in triple sec.
