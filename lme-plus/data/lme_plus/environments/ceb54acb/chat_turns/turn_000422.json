Here are some tips to help you craft a great LinkedIn message:\n\n1. **Start with a personalized greeting**: Address Rachel Lee by her first name, and make sure to spell it correctly.\n2. **Reference your conversation**: Briefly mention the conference, the topic you discussed, or something specific you talked about. This will help her remember you and the context of your conversation.\n3. **Keep it concise**: LinkedIn messages should be short and to the point. Aim for 1-2 paragraphs at most.\n4. **Be clear about your purpose**: State the reason for your follow-up message.
