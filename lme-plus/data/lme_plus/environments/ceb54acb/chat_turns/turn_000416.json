However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about a particular conference or Rachel Lee, and I don't have the ability to know your personal experiences or business cards.\n\nBut I can suggest some general advice on finding a convenient coffee shop near the Marriott Hotel. You can try searching online for \"coffee shops near Marriott Hotel [insert location]\" or use a mapping app like Google Maps to find nearby options. You can also ask the hotel concierge or front desk for recommendations.\n\nAdditionally, you can consider reaching out to Rachel Lee directly to ask for her preferences or suggestions for a meeting location. You could say something like, \"Hi Rachel, I really enjoyed your keynote speech at the digital marketing conference last Thursday. I was wondering if you'd be available to catch up over coffee sometime. Are there any coffee shops near the Marriott Hotel that you'd recommend for a meeting?\"\n\nAs for your new business cards, that's great! Having an updated title can definitely make a good impression. Just make sure to double-check the spelling and accuracy of the information on your cards before handing them out.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck with your follow-up meeting with Rachel Lee!",
