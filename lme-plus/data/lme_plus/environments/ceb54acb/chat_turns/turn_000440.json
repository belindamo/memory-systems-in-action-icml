The `author` property is a required string property that specifies the name of the user who created the comment. The `content` property is a required string property that contains the text of the comment. The `created` property is a DateTimeProperty that automatically sets the time that the comment was created to the current time when the entity is created.\n\nYou could add additional properties to the `Comment` entity as needed, depending on the requirements of your application.",
