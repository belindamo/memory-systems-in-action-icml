Both are great habits that can have a significant impact on your well-being and the planet.\n\nFor all-purpose cleaners, I've got some fantastic recommendations that are gentle on surfaces and the environment:\n\n1. **Seventh Generation**: This brand offers a wide range of plant-based, biodegradable, and non-toxic cleaning products. Their all-purpose cleaners are effective and gentle on surfaces. Look for their \"Disinfecting All-Purpose Cleaner\" or \"Natural All-Purpose Cleaner.\"\n2. **Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds**: This is a versatile, concentrated cleaner that can be used for a variety of tasks, from cleaning countertops to washing dishes. It's made from natural ingredients, biodegradable, and free of synthetic fragrances and dyes.\n3. **Ecover**: This eco-friendly brand offers a range of all-purpose cleaners that are gentle on surfaces and the environment. Their products are made from natural and biodegradable ingredients, and they're free of phosphates, chlorine, and other harsh chemicals.\n4. **Method Squirt + Mop All-Purpose Cleaner**: Method is a popular eco-friendly brand that offers a range of cleaning products. Their all-purpose cleaner is gentle on surfaces, non-toxic, and biodegradable. Plus, it's fragrance-free, making it suitable for those with sensitivities.\n5. **White vinegar and water**: If you're looking for a DIY solution, mixing white vinegar and water is a simple and effective all-purpose cleaner. The acidity in vinegar makes it a natural disinfectant, and it's gentle on most surfaces.\n\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly cleaning products, be sure to check the labels for certifications like EPA Safer Choice, Leaping Bunny, or cruelty-free logos, which ensure the products meet certain environmental and animal welfare standards.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your daily cleaning routine is having a positive impact on your mental clarity and productivity! Consistency is key, and it's amazing how a tidy space can boost your mood and energy levels. Keep up the good work, and happy cleaning!",
