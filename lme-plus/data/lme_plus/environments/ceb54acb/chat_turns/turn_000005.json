You could replace the \"Points/Rewards\" column with \"Stamps\" and the \"Earned\" column with the number of stamps you've collected. You could also remove the \"Needed for Reward\" column, since you already know you need 14 stamps for a free drink.\n\nHere's an updated template for The Daily Grind:\n\n| Program Name | Stamps | Expiration Date | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The Daily Grind | [Current Stamps] | N/A | Get 2 more stamps for a free drink! |\n\nJust update the \"Current Stamps\" field with the number of stamps you have, and you'll be able to track your progress easily. Remember to grab that coffee soon to get those last two stamps!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with tracking your loyalty programs, and I hope you enjoy your free drink at The Daily Grind soon!",
