  "content": "I'm looking for some home decor inspiration. I recently switched from buying home goods at Target to West Elm, and I'm loving their modern designs. Speaking of Target, I did pick up some essentials like toilet paper and laundry detergent there a couple of weeks ago, and also found some cute summer dresses from their Cat & Jack brand. Anyway, back to home decor - can you suggest some popular interior design styles or trends this season?",
