  "content": "I'm thinking of checking out World Market this weekend. I've been wanting to get some unique gifts for my friends' birthdays, and I've heard their handmade jewelry and artisanal home decor are amazing. Plus, I'm curious to explore their international food section \u2013 I've been craving some authentic Indian spices lately. Since I'll be out shopping, I might as well stop by Target too and pick up some more of those cute summer dresses from Cat & Jack. Do you think they'll have any new designs or sales going on?",
