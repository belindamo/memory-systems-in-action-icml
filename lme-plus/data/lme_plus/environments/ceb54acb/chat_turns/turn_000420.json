As a conversational AI, I don't have the ability to know about your personal experiences, conversations, or interactions with individuals. I'm starting from a blank slate with each new conversation.\n\nSince I'm not aware of your conversation with Rachel Lee, I can't provide guidance on sending a summary of a conversation that didn't occur in my knowledge.\n\nHowever, if you did have a conversation with Rachel Lee, it's possible that sending a brief summary or follow-up note can be a good idea. This can help refresh her memory and show that you're interested in continuing the conversation.\n\nAs for the best way to send the summary, it depends on how you initially connected with Rachel Lee and her preferred method of communication. If you exchanged business cards, you may want to send an email to the address on her card. If you connected on LinkedIn, a LinkedIn message could be a good option. Alternatively, you could try sending a brief message on both platforms to cover your bases.\n\nRemember to keep your message concise, professional, and relevant to your conversation. Good luck with your follow-up!",
