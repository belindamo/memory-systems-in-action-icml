  "content": "TF-IDF is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to represent text documents as numerical vectors. It is often used as a preprocessing step before applying a machine learning algorithm or other NLP techniques such as topic modeling or clustering.\n\nWhile both TF-IDF and bag of words are used to represent text documents as numerical vectors, they are different techniques. The bag of words approach simply counts the occurrence of each word in a document, whereas TF-IDF takes into account both the frequency of a term in a document (term frequency, or TF) and the frequency of the term in the entire corpus of documents (inverse document frequency, or IDF). This allows TF-IDF to assign higher weight to terms that are more important in a particular document, while downgrading terms that are common across all documents.",
