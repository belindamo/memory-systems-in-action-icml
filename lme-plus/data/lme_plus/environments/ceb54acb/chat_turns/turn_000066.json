  "content": "The proposed system includes a novel and non-obvious method of scanning submitted documents and verifying their authenticity. The system uses advanced optical character recognition (OCR) technology to scan the documents and extract relevant information, such as the business name, tax identification number, and income tax return details.\n\nThe extracted information is then cross-referenced with the verifiable credentials stored on the blockchain to verify the authenticity and validity of the documents. This is done through the use of a digital signature and encryption to ensure that the information cannot be tampered with or falsified.\n\nThe system also includes machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in the documents that may indicate fraud or errors. If any discrepancies are found, the system alerts the appropriate government agency for further investigation.\n\nOnce the documents have been verified, they are stored on the blockchain for future reference. This ensures that the documents are secure and tamper-proof, minimizing the risk of fraud and errors in the issuance process.\n\nThe algorithm for scanning and verifying the authenticity of submitted documents is as follows:\n\n1. Scan the submitted documents using advanced OCR technology to extract relevant information.\n2. Cross-reference the extracted information with the verifiable credentials stored on the blockchain to verify the authenticity and validity of the documents.\n3. Use digital signature and encryption to ensure that the information cannot be tampered with or falsified.\n4. Use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in the documents that may indicate fraud or errors.\n5. If any discrepancies are found, alert the appropriate government agency for further investigation.\n6. Store the verified documents on the blockchain for future reference.\n\nThis method of scanning and verifying the authenticity of submitted documents is novel and non-obvious as it uses advanced technology and machine learning to ensure the security and accuracy of the issuance process. By storing the documents on the blockchain, the system provides a tamper-proof and secure method of storing and accessing documents, which is not currently available in the traditional paper-based system.",
