Here are some effective methods:\n\n1. **Baking Soda and Water:** Make a paste by mixing 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water. Apply the paste to the stained area and let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour. Then, rinse with cold water and let air dry.\n2. **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Apply hydrogen peroxide directly to the stained area using a soft-bristled toothbrush. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse with cold water and let air dry.\n3. **White Vinegar and Water:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the stained area and let it sit for 10-15 minutes.

Here are some methods to remove coffee stains from your grey sweater:\n\n1. **Blot, Don't Rub:** Gently blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb as much of the coffee as possible.
