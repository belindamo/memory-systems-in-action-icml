  "content": "I'm glad you're excited about Hadestown!\n\nAs for The Ferryman, I'm happy to report that it has already opened on Broadway! The play began previews on October 2, 2019, and officially opened on October 20, 2019, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. It's been receiving rave reviews from critics and audiences alike, with many praising the powerful performances, direction, and writing.\n\nThe Ferryman is a three-hour play, including two intermissions, and the runtime may vary depending on the performance. The play is written by Jez Butterworth and directed by Sam Mendes, with a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Paddy Considine as Quinn Carney\n* Dean Ashton as Diarmaid Corcoran\n* Justin Edwards as Oisin Carney\n* Conor MacNeill as Seamus Carney\n* Rob Malone as Oisin's father\n* Dearbhla Molloy as Aunt Maggie Far Away\n* and more\n\nThe play takes place in Northern Ireland during the Troubles and explores themes of family, politics, and identity. It's a complex, thought-provoking drama that has been praised for its nuanced characters, clever dialogue, and emotional resonance.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing The Ferryman, I recommend checking the show's website or a ticketing website like Telecharge or Ticketmaster for availability and to purchase tickets. Be aware that the play deals with mature themes, strong language, and some violence, so it may not be suitable for all audiences.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll have a powerful and thought-provoking experience watching The Ferryman on Broadway!",
