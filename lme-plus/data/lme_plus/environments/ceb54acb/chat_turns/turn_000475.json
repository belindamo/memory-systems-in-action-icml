To answer your original question, Fuji-Q Highland's coaster-themed merchandise is definitely a great option for roller coaster enthusiasts. The park offers a range of items, from T-shirts to keychains, that feature the iconic Fujiyama or other coasters. If you think your friends would appreciate something more unique, you could consider combining a coaster-themed item with a Japanese snack or drink, like a packet of wasabi peas or a can of Pocari Sweat. This way, you'll give them a taste of Japan's roller coaster culture and a fun souvenir to boot!",
