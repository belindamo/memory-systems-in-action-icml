IKEA is a great place to start, but there are many other options to consider as well.\n\nHere are some recommendations for game shelves that might fit your needs:\n\n**IKEA Options:**\n\n1. **KALLAX**: A popular and affordable shelving unit that's easy to assemble and customize. You can choose from various sizes and configurations to fit your space.\n2. **Billy Bookcase**: A classic and versatile bookcase that can be used for games, books, or other display items. It's a great option if you have a larger collection or want a more traditional bookshelf look.\n3. **LACK**: A simple and compact shelving unit that's perfect for smaller spaces or starter collections.\n\n**Other Options:**\n\n1. **The Broken Token**: A company that specializes in game storage and display solutions.

You want a shelf that fits comfortably in the room and can hold your games without overcrowding.\n2. **Style:** Think about the aesthetic you want to achieve. Do you prefer modern and sleek, or traditional and rustic?

Game shelves can range from affordable to very expensive, so it's essential to find one that fits your budget.\n\nBefore making a final decision, I recommend checking out reviews, watching assembly videos, and reading customer feedback to get a better sense of the product. You might also consider visiting a local game store or IKEA to see the shelves in person before making a purchase.\n\nWhat do you think?
