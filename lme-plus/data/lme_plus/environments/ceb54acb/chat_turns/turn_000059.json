  "content": "To remove output from a cell in a Jupyter notebook, you can use the \"Clear Output\" option from the \"Cell\" menu. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Select the cell for which you want to remove the output.\n2. Click on the \"Cell\" menu in the Jupyter notebook menu bar.\n3. Click on the \"Current Outputs\" submenu.\n4. Click on \"Clear\" or \"Clear All Outputs\", depending on whether you want to remove the output for the selected cell only or for all cells in the notebook.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + O` to toggle the output display for the selected cell on or off. This will hide the output without removing it, so you can still view it later if needed.\n\nNote that removing the output from a cell does not affect the code or variables in that cell, it simply hides the output that was generated when the cell was executed.",
