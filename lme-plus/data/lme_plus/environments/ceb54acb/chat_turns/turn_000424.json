As a conversational AI, I don't have any knowledge of your personal experiences, conversations, or interactions with individuals, including Alex at a speed networking event in Santa Monica last month.\n\nI'm starting from a blank slate with each new conversation, so I didn't know about your conversation with Alex or the language learning apps you discussed. If you'd like, I can suggest some popular language learning apps that you might find useful, but it wouldn't be based on your previous conversation with Alex.\n\nLet me know if you'd like some language learning app recommendations, and I'd be happy to help!",
