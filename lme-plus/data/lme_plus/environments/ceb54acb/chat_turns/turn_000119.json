Here's a revised response:\n\nYes, you can definitely set up a schedule that blocks social media during certain times of the day but still allows you to access other websites and apps. With Freedom's Scheduled blocks, you can create a custom block list for social media platforms and schedule blocks during specific times of the day or week, while allowing access to other websites and apps.\n\nFor example, you could block social media from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, but still allow access to email, news, and productivity tools during that time. You can customize the block list and schedule to fit your needs and goals.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
