However, many French restaurants offer vegetarian and vegan options, so it's likely that Le Bistrot des Halles does too. You can always call the restaurant to inquire about their vegetarian options or ask for recommendations when you visit. A popular vegetarian dish in Provence is ratatouille, a delicious vegetable stew made with bell peppers, eggplant, zucchini, onions, and tomato sauce.
