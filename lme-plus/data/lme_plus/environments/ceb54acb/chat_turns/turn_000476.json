Fuji-Q Highland's coaster-themed merchandise is a fantastic option for roller coaster enthusiasts, and combining it with a Japanese snack or drink is a great way to add a unique touch. It's a thoughtful way to share your experience with your friends and give them a taste of Japan's roller coaster culture.\n\nI think it's great that you're considering your friends' interests and wanting to get them a souvenir that they'll truly appreciate. Your idea of combining a coaster-themed item with a Japanese snack or drink is a wonderful way to show your friends that you care about their passions and interests.\n\nWasabi peas and Pocari Sweat are both great choices, by the way! Wasabi peas are a popular Japanese snack that adds a spicy kick, while Pocari Sweat is a refreshing drink that's perfect for hot days at the theme park. Your friends will surely appreciate the thought and effort you put into selecting a unique and meaningful souvenir.\n\nThanks for chatting with me about souvenir ideas!
