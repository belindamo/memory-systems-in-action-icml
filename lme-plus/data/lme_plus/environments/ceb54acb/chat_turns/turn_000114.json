Here's how it works:\n\n**What is Locked mode?**\n\nLocked mode is a feature in Freedom that allows you to lock yourself out of blocked websites and apps for a set period. Once you enable Locked mode, you won't be able to access the blocked content until the lock period expires. This helps you avoid distractions and stay on track with your goals.\n\n**How does Locked mode work?**\n\nHere's how Locked mode works:\n\n1. **Enable Locked mode**: You can enable Locked mode from the Freedom app or website. You'll be prompted to set a lock duration, which can range from 1 hour to 24 hours.\n2. **Choose your blocks**: Select the websites and apps you want to block during the lock period. You can choose from your existing block lists or create a new one.\n3. **Confirm and lock**: Confirm your selection, and Freedom will lock the chosen websites and apps across all your devices.\n4. **Locked period**: During the lock period, you won't be able to access the blocked content. If you try to access a blocked website or app, you'll see a Freedom block page reminding you that you're in Locked mode.\n5. **Lock expiration**: Once the lock period expires, the blocks will be automatically lifted, and you'll regain access to the previously blocked content.\n\n**Customization options**\n\nFreedom's Locked mode offers some customization options to help you tailor it to your needs:\n\n* **Lock duration**: Choose the length of your lock period, from 1 hour to 24 hours.\n* **Block selection**: Select specific websites and apps to block during the lock period. You can choose from your existing block lists or create a new one.\n* **Scheduled locks**: Schedule Locked mode in advance to help you stay on track during specific times of the day or week.\n* **Custom lock messages**: Personalize the lock screen message to remind yourself why you're in Locked mode and what you're working towards.\n* **Emergency access**: If you need to access a blocked website or app during a lock period, you can use Freedom's emergency access feature. This will temporarily disable the block, but it will also send you an email reminder to help you stay accountable.\n\n**Tips and variations**\n\nHere are some tips and variations to help you get the most out of Locked mode:\n\n* **Use Locked mode for focused work sessions**: Enable Locked mode during your most productive hours to help you stay focused on your tasks.\n* **Schedule Locked mode for breaks**: Use Locked mode to take breaks from your devices and reduce screen time.\n* **Combine with other Freedom features**: Use Locked mode in conjunction with other Freedom features, such as custom blocks and scheduling, to create a tailored productivity system.\n* **Use Locked mode for accountability**: Share your Locked mode goals with a friend or accountability partner to increase your motivation and commitment.\n\nOverall, Freedom's Locked mode is a powerful tool to help you stay focused and avoid distractions. By customizing it to your needs, you can create a productivity system that helps you achieve your goals.",
