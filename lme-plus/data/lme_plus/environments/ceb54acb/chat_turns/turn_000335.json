Use public transportation like buses or trams to get around the city. You can purchase tickets at most bus stops or from the driver.\n\n2. If you plan to visit multiple attractions, consider purchasing a city pass that offers discounted admission to popular sights.\n\n3. Avoid tourist traps by doing some research in advance and sticking to unique, lesser-known spots. Ask locals for recommendations.\n\n4. Toulon can be quite hilly, so be prepared for steep inclines and stairs. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing.\n\n5. Don't miss the stunning harbor and enjoy the local cuisine at traditional markets offering fresh produce, seafood, and cheese.\n\n6. Toulon has a rich naval history, so make sure to visit the naval museum or take a boat tour to learn more about the city's maritime past.\n\n7. Finally, immerse yourself in the Proven\u00e7al culture and lifestyle by attending local festivals or events, such as the Saint-Pierre Fishermen's Festival or the F\u00eate de la Musique.",
