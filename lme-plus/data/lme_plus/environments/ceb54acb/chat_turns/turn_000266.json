Avoid rubbing, as this can push the stain deeper into the fabric.\n* Pre-treat with a stain remover: Apply a stain remover directly to the coffee stain and let it sit for a few minutes before washing.\n* Soak in cold water: Soaking the garment in cold water can help loosen the stain and make it easier to remove.\n* Avoid hot water: Hot water can set the stain or damage the fabric, so it's best to use cold water when washing and soaking.\n\nI hope these tips and product recommendations help you remove the coffee stain from your grey sweater!",
