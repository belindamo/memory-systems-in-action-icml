  "content": "There are some circumstances where you may be able to withdraw money from both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA before age 59 \u00bd without incurring a penalty (though taxes may still apply). These circumstances include:\n\n1. Qualified higher education expenses: You can withdraw money from both a traditional IRA and Roth IRA penalty-free to pay for qualified higher education expenses for yourself, your spouse, your children, or your grandchildren.\n\n2. First-time home purchase: You can withdraw up to $10,000 from both traditional and Roth IRAs penalty-free for a first-time home purchase. This applies only to expenses incurred within 120 days of the withdrawal.\n\n3. Unreimbursed medical expenses: If you have unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income, you can withdraw money from both a traditional IRA and Roth IRA penalty-free to pay for these expenses.\n\n4. Substantially equal periodic payments (SEPPs): You can set up a series of substantially equal periodic payments (SEPPs) from your traditional IRA or Roth IRA that will allow you to withdraw money penalty-free.\n\n5. Disability: If you become totally and permanently disabled, you can withdraw money from your traditional IRA or Roth IRA penalty-free.\n\nIt's important to note that Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn at any time without penalty, but the earnings on those contributions may be subject to penalty and taxes if withdrawn before age 59 \u00bd and don't meet the exceptions listed above. For traditional IRAs, there are different rules surrounding withdrawals of contributions versus earnings, so it's important to understand your account's specific rules and regulations.",
