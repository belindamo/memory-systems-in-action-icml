  "content": "While wolves are known for their cooperative pack hunting behavior, they are also opportunistic hunters and will hunt alone if necessary. However, solo hunting is generally less successful for wolves as they are not as efficient at bringing down large prey on their own as they are in packs. Studies have shown that when wolves hunt alone, they mostly target smaller and weaker prey. Also, solitary hunting is riskier for wolves because it can lead to them being injured or killed by large prey or other predators. Therefore, while wolves are capable of hunting alone, their social behavior is centered around hunting in packs, which allows them to better utilize their strengths and minimize the risks.",
