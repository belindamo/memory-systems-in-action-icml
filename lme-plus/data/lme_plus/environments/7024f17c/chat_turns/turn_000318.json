Remember to taste and adjust as you go, and don't be afraid to experiment with different amounts of hummus and lemon juice until you find the perfect balance of flavors.\n\nAdding hummus to Sweet Potato Curry can be a game-changer, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the creamy, savory flavor it adds.

Otherwise, happy cooking, and I hope you enjoy your delicious Sweet Potato Curry with a twist!\n\nP.S.
