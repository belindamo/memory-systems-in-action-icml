The lyrics are full of clever wordplay, rhythmic complexity, and cultural references.\n2. **Freestyle Love Supreme**: This improvisational hip-hop musical, created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Thomas Kail, and Anthony Veneziale, features complex, freestyle rap lyrics that tackle themes of identity, community, and social justice.\n3. **Passing Strange**: This rock musical, written by Stew and Heidi Rodewald, tells the story of a young black man's journey of self-discovery in 1970s Europe. The lyrics are a poetic blend of rock, R&B, and punk, with complex rhymes and wordplay.\n4. **Spring Awakening**: Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's rock musical explores themes of teenage angst, identity, and rebellion in 19th-century Germany. The lyrics are poetic, introspective, and often provocative.\n5. **Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson**: This musical, written by Alex Timbers and Michael Friedman, reimagines the life of America's seventh president as an emo-rock musical.

The lyrics are often raunchy, witty, and clever, with a nod to Sesame Street's style.\n8. **Urinetown**: This musical, written by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis, is a satire of the musical theater genre, with clever, witty lyrics that poke fun at corporate greed, politics, and social commentary.\n9. **The Last Five Years**: Jason Robert Brown's musical tells the story of a couple's relationship, with the woman's story unfolding in reverse chronological order. The lyrics are poetic, introspective, and often complex, with a focus on character development.\n10. **Dear Evan Hansen**: This musical, written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, explores themes of social media, mental health, and human connection.
