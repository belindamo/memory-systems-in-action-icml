I'd like to prioritize Twitter for real-time engagement and news, Instagram for visual storytelling and behind-the-scenes content, and Facebook for in-depth content and educational resources. I'll make sure to leave room for spontaneity and adapt to changes in the industry or audience. Do you think this is a good approach, and are there any other considerations I should keep in mind?",
