My tweets are usually about social media campaigns I'm interested in or participating in, like the #BreakTheSilence campaign I was part of recently. I have around 500 followers, and I usually get around 1-2 likes or retweets per tweet. My target audience is people interested in social media marketing and campaigns, and I usually post 2-3 times a week in the morning.",
