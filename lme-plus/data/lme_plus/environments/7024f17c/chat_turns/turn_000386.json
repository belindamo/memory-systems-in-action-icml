Here are some options for purchasing a SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hotspot for data and calls in the UK:\n\n**SIM Card Options:**\n\n1. **Local SIM Cards:** You can purchase a local SIM card from a UK mobile network operator, such as:\n\t* EE (Everything Everywhere)\n\t* O2\n\t* Vodafone\n\t* Three\n\t* Giffgaff (a low-cost, online-only provider)\n\t* Lebara (a provider catering to international students)\n\nThese SIM cards can be purchased at mobile phone stores, supermarkets, or online. You'll need to provide your passport and proof of address to register the SIM.\n\n2. **International Student SIM Cards:** Some providers offer special plans and SIM cards designed specifically for international students. These plans often include:\n\t* Lebara Student: Offers discounted rates for international calls and data.\n\t* Giffgaff Student: Provides a free SIM card and discounted rates for students.\n\t* O2 International Student: Offers a special plan with international calls and data.\n\n**Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot Options:**\n\n1. **Local Mobile Hotspots:** You can purchase a portable Wi-Fi hotspot from a UK mobile network operator, such as:\n\t* EE Mobile Wi-Fi\n\t* O2 Mobile Wi-Fi\n\t* Vodafone Mobile Wi-Fi\n\nThese devices allow you to connect multiple devices to the internet using a mobile network.\n\n2. **International Mobile Hotspots:** Some providers offer international mobile hotspots that work in multiple countries, including the UK. These devices often have a daily or monthly fee, and data speeds may vary. Examples include:\n\t* Skyroam\n\t* Keepgo\n\t* Google Fi (only works with specific devices)\n\n**Tips and Recommendations:**\n\n* Research and compare prices and plans before making a purchase.\n* Consider a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) plan or a contract with a low monthly fee to avoid unexpected charges.\n* Check the coverage and speed of the network in your area (Marchmont) before committing to a provider.\n* If you plan to make frequent international calls, look for providers that offer discounted rates or inclusive minutes.\n* If you're unsure about which option to choose, you can ask your university's student union or international student office for recommendations.\n\nFor international students, I'd recommend considering Lebara or Giffgaff, as they offer student-specific plans and competitive pricing. However, it's essential to research and compare options to find the best fit for your needs and budget.",
