  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to the current plans of Messerschmitt or any other companies, as my database only contains information up until October 2021. However, I can suggest that Messerschmitt, like many other aviation companies, is likely exploring alternative fuel sources such as biofuels and electric propulsion systems as a means of reducing carbon emissions and improving the sustainability of their operations. It's worth noting that the aviation industry is actively seeking innovative solutions to reduce emissions and meet sustainability targets, so it's possible that Messerschmitt is involved in research and development in this area.",
