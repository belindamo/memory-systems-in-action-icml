  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to Parisian's specific styling advice, but I can give you some general tips on how to style oversize blazers and shoulder pads for different body types. \n\n- Hourglass Figure: If you have an hourglass shape, you can show off your curves by cinching your waist with a belt over the blazer. This will accentuate your figure and prevent the blazer from looking too bulky.\n\n- Pear Figure: If you have a pear-shaped body, opt for an oversized blazer that ends at your mid-thigh. This will draw attention to your upper body and balance out your proportions.\n\n- Rectangle Figure: If you have a straight or rectangle body type, create some definition by choosing a blazer with structured shoulders, which will add shape to your upper body.\n\n- Apple Figure: If you have an apple-shaped body, it's essential to choose a blazer that is long enough to cover your hips and buttocks. This style will help elongate your torso and provide balance.\n\n- Petite Figure: If you're petite, avoid blazers that are too long or bulky as they can overwhelm your frame. Instead, choose a cropped or fitted blazer that sits at your natural waist.\n\nRemember to also consider the fit of the blazer so it doesn't look too big or too small for your body type, and you can experiment with different styling options to find what works best for you.",
