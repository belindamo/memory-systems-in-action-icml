In recent years, we've seen a significant increase in consumer awareness around environmental issues, and people are becoming more conscious of their impact on the environment. Many consumers are now actively looking for sustainable products and are making purchasing decisions based on a company's environmental track record. According to a recent global survey, about 75% of consumers said that they would change their consumption habits to reduce their environmental impact. \n\nMoreover, consumers are increasingly using their voice to push for systemic change and hold companies accountable for their environmental impact. Social media has provided a platform for consumers to share information about environmental issues, connect with like-minded individuals, and collectively demand change from companies and policymakers.\n\nIn summary, consumer awareness about the environment is growing, and consumers are becoming more mindful of their impact on the planet. This shift in consumer behavior is an important driver of change, and it's likely to encourage more companies to prioritize sustainability in their operations.",
