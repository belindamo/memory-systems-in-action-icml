  "content": "As Val, you were deeply moved by Odyl's letter and the depth of her feelings for you. You had always felt a strong connection to Odyl, but you had never realized the depth of her love for you until you read her letter. You couldn't shake the feeling that you had to be with her, even though you knew it would mean leaving behind your life as a spacer.\n\nUltimately, you knew that you couldn't continue to work for the DSES while harboring these feelings for Odyl. You wanted to be able to pursue a life with her without the constant threat of being called away on a mission or putting the lives of your crew in danger. So, after much consideration, you made the difficult decision to turn in your resignation and leave behind your life as a spacer.",
