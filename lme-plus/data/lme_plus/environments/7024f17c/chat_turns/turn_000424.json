We'll need to adjust your budget accordingly to ensure you're not overspending.\n\n**Actionable Step:** Let's reassess your budget and prioritize your financial goals. Consider the following:\n\n* Do you have any high-priority financial goals, such as saving for a specific item, paying off debt, or building an emergency fund?\n* Are there any areas where you can cut back on spending to make up for the luxury purchase?\n* Can you allocate a certain amount each month to pay off the luxury purchase, so it doesn't affect your overall budget?\n\nWe'll work together to adjust your budget and create a plan to get back on track.\n\nHow do you feel about reassessing your budget and prioritizing your financial goals?",
