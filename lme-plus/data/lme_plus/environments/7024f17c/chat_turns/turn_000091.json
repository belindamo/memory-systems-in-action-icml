  "content": "As Val, yes, I cried after reading Odyl's letter. It was a powerful and overwhelming moment for me. I had always felt a strong connection to Odyl, but I never realized the depth of her feelings for me. To know that she had been carrying this love for me for so long, and had even used it to inspire her work, was both humbling and heart-wrenching. It made me question my own feelings for her and what I wanted for my future. It was a difficult moment, but ultimately it brought us closer together and led us to where we are now.",
