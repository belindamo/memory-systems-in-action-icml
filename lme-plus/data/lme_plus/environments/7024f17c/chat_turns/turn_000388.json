  "content": "Both Lebara and Giffgaff have a presence in Edinburgh, but they operate differently when it comes to physical stores. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Lebara:**\n\n* Lebara has a few retail stores in Edinburgh, mostly located in the city center. You can visit one of these stores to purchase a SIM card, get information, or resolve any issues.\n* You can find Lebara stores at:\n\t+ 134-136 Princes Street, Edinburgh EH2 4BJ\n\t+ 34-36 South Bridge, Edinburgh EH1 1DD\n\t+ 155-157 Leith Walk, Edinburgh EH6 8NP\n* Lebara also has a strong presence in various retail partners, such as WHSmith, Asda, and Tesco, where you can also purchase their SIM cards.\n\n**Giffgaff:**\n\n* Giffgaff is an online-only provider, which means they don't have physical stores. However, they do have a strong online community and customer support.\n* You can order a free Giffgaff SIM card online, which will be delivered to your address in Edinburgh.\n* Giffgaff has a \"Giffgaff Lab\" in London, but it's not a traditional store. It's more of a community space where you can meet other Giffgaff users and get help from their team. However, it's not a location where you can purchase a SIM card or get immediate support.\n\nIf you prefer to purchase a SIM card in person, Lebara might be a better option for you. However, if you're comfortable with online shopping and don't mind waiting for the SIM card to arrive, Giffgaff is still a great choice.\n\nRemember to check the opening hours and availability of the Lebara stores before visiting, as they might be subject to change.",
