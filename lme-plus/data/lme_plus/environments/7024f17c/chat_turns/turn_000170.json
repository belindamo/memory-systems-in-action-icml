Both Ecco and Clarks are known for using high-quality materials, but let's dive deeper into their sole materials and construction:\n\n**Ecco:**\n\n* Ecco is famous for their **Direct Injection** technology, which involves injecting a soft, flexible material called Polyurethane (PU) into the sole mold. This creates a lightweight, shock-absorbing, and flexible sole that provides excellent comfort and durability.\n* Ecco also uses **Rubber** outsoles, which provide traction, durability, and resistance to abrasion. The rubber is often mixed with other materials, like PU, to enhance its flexibility and grip.\n* Some Ecco sandals feature **leather or suede** upper materials, which are durable and can develop a beautiful patina over time.\n* Ecco's soles are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for a natural rolling motion of the foot during walking.\n\n**Clarks:**\n\n* Clarks uses a variety of sole materials, including **Rubber**, **PU**, and **EVA (Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate)**. EVA is a lightweight, flexible material that provides cushioning and shock absorption.\n* Clarks' **CloudSteppers** collection features soles made from a combination of EVA and PU, which provides exceptional comfort and flexibility.\n* Some Clarks sandals have **leather or suede** upper materials, which are durable and can be maintained with proper care.\n* Clarks' soles are designed to provide good arch support and cushioning, making them comfortable for daily wear.\n\nBoth Ecco and Clarks use high-quality materials that are designed to provide comfort, durability, and flexibility. However, the specific materials and construction may vary depending on the style and collection.\n\nIf you're looking for a more durable and long-lasting sole, you might want to consider Ecco's Direct Injection technology. However, Clarks' CloudSteppers collection is also known for its exceptional comfort and flexibility.\n\nWhen shopping for sandals, make sure to read reviews, check the product descriptions, and inspect the soles in person (if possible) to get a better sense of the materials and construction.",
