I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about individual loyalty programs or accounts.\n\nHowever, I can provide general advice on loyalty programs.\n\nIf you're looking to maximize your rewards earnings, it's essential to understand your shopping habits and the loyalty programs that align with them. Here are some general tips:\n\n1. **Focus on programs that align with your shopping habits**: If you frequently shop at a particular store or category of stores, focus on earning points or rewards in those programs.\n2. **Diversify your loyalty program portfolio**: Joining multiple programs can help you earn rewards across different categories or retailers, but be sure you can manage your accounts and track your points effectively.\n3. **Understand the earning and redemption structures**: Know how you earn points, how to redeem them, and the rewards available in each program.\n4. **Take advantage of promotions and bonuses**: Look out for limited-time offers, bonus points, or double/triple points days to accelerate your earnings.\n5. **Monitor your points and rewards**: Regularly check your account balances and expiration dates to avoid losing rewards.\n\nIf you're unsure about your ShopSmart loyalty card or account, I recommend contacting ShopSmart's customer service directly for assistance.
