However, I can give some general tips on how to style chunky platform sandals:\n\n- Wear with cropped wide-leg pants or culottes for a chic and trendy look.\n- Pair with a flowing midi dress or skirt to add some height and balance to your silhouette.\n- Try them with high-waisted shorts or jean cut-offs for a casual yet stylish summer look.\n- Chunky platform sandals can even work with ankle-length pants or jeans for a playful twist on a classic outfit.\n\nWhen it comes to color, black or nude platforms are versatile and can be worn with most outfits. However, if you're feeling daring and want to make a statement, metallic, pastel or bright colored platform sandals can add an unexpected pop of color to your outfit.\n\nKeep in mind that chunky platform sandals can be quite the statement piece, so you may want to keep the rest of your outfit more minimal and let the shoes do the talking.",
