While it's great that you're treating yourself to new clothes, it's essential to ensure that you're not overspending in this category.\n\n**Budgeting for Clothing:** Let's set a realistic budget for your clothing purchases. Consider the following:\n\n* How much do you want to allocate for clothing per month?\n* Are there any specific clothing items you need to purchase in the near future (e.g., a wedding, job interview, etc.)?\n* Can you reduce your clothing spending by shopping during sales, using coupons, or exploring more affordable options?\n\n**Actionable Step:** For the next 4 weeks, try to limit your clothing spending to $100 per month. This will help you stay within your budget and make more intentional purchasing decisions.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you comfortable with the clothing budget we've set?",
