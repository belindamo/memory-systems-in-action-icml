To help you avoid making impulsive purchases, we can work on implementing some strategies:\n\n1. **30-Day Rule:** When you see something you want to buy, wait 30 days before making the purchase. This allows you to assess whether the item is something you truly need or if the desire was just an impulsive want.\n2. **Wishlist:** Create a wishlist on your preferred platforms (e.g., Amazon, ASOS, etc.) and add items you want to purchase. Review your wishlist regularly to see if the items are still something you need or want.\n3. **Budgeting Apps:** Consider using budgeting apps like Mint, You Need a Budget (YNAB), or Personal Capital to track your spending and stay within your budget.\n\n**Shopping Frequency:** Shopping online 2-3 times a week can add up quickly. Let's try to reduce the frequency of your online shopping trips. Here's a challenge:\n\n**Challenge:** Try to limit your online shopping to once a week for the next 4 weeks. This will help you become more mindful of your spending and reduce the likelihood of making impulsive purchases.\n\n**Tracking Your Spending:** To get a better understanding of your spending, I'd like you to track your online purchases for the next 4 weeks. You can use a spreadsheet, a budgeting app, or even just a note-taking app on your phone. Please log the following information for each purchase:\n\n* Date\n* Platform\n* Category (Clothing, Electronics, Miscellaneous, etc.)\n* Item description\n* Amount spent\n\nBy tracking your spending, we can identify areas where you can cut back and make adjustments to your budget.\n\nHow do these strategies sound? Are you up for the challenge?",
