Over the last 10 months, my partner and I have taken our real estate company, Cortado, from launch to generating more than $350,000 in revenue. How did we achieve this? By leveraging new AI tools to target an undersupplied niche housing market worth $71 trillion \u2013 international student housing.\n\nSlide 2: Market Size\n--------------------\n\nLet me give you a brief overview of this niche market. International student housing is a subset of the growing MTR market, and it's massively undersupplied. More than 6 million students per year seek housing abroad, and that number is expected to reach 8 million by 2025. Over the last 20 years, this market has experienced a 5.5% growth rate, even through the COVID-19 pandemic. With an average rental cost of $214 per week, the total available market (TAM) for international student housing is a staggering $71 trillion.\n\nSlide 3: The Problem\n--------------------\n\nWhy target this niche market? Well, international student housing may not sound glamorous, but it's a market that has been largely overlooked by VCs, angel investors, and other startups. These students often face unique challenges when seeking housing. They need move-in ready accommodations for short stays, but they can't afford hotels and might not have the necessary credit scores or guarantors to sign traditional leases. Furthermore, they may not know which neighborhoods are safe or desirable. As a result, they're often left with subpar options like sketchy sublets or overcrowded hostels.\n\nSlide 4: The Solution\n---------------------\n\nCortado provides the solution this market desperately needs: affordable, flexible, move-in ready housing conveniently located near students' work or study locations. Our aim is to offer these students a comfortable, community-centered living experience, while also providing peace of mind to their parents and universities.\n\nSlide 5: Cortado's Model\n------------------------\n\nOur business model is built on three key steps:\n\n1. We partner with local homeowners to quickly source new inventory.\n2. We furnish and photograph the home in under 48 hours.\n3. We market the home by-the-room using tiered \"smart pricing,\" ensuring affordability for our guests while maintaining a target revenue occupancy of 90-95%.\n\nSlide 6: Traction\n-----------------\n\nSo, how has this model performed? To date, Cortado has generated over $350,000 in gross revenue across 9 rental properties in Washington, DC. Our success has led to an influx of homeowner referrals, which demonstrates strong supply-side traction for our master lease model. On the demand side, we've been able to book all rooms for the spring 2023 semester with zero ad spend. Additionally, our summer 2022 bookings were filled within just 10 days. Prestigious programs like Stanford and Atlantis regularly reach out to us, but we often can't accommodate their needs due to limited inventory.",
