  "content": "I attended a mix of lectures, workshops, and conferences, mostly related to tech and science. Let me think for a sec... I'd say around 5-6 events over the past few months. The earliest one was a lecture on personal finance in January, and then there was a conference on AI in February. I also attended a series of webinars on cybersecurity in March, and a lecture on sustainable development on the 10th of April. Oh, and I just got back from a 2-day workshop on machine learning last weekend, which was really helpful in clarifying some concepts I was struggling with.",
