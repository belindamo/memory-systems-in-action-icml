  "content": "Songkick doesn't currently offer a feature to display a map of the festival grounds or provide personalized day planning tools. However, I can suggest some alternative ways to get that information:\n\n1. **Festival website or app**: Check the official festival website or mobile app (if they have one) for a map of the festival grounds, stage layouts, and schedule. Many festivals provide interactive maps that allow you to plan your day and navigate the festival site.\n2. **Festival social media**: Follow the festival's social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) for updates on the festival map, schedule, and other important information.\n3. **Festival guide or program**: When you arrive at the festival, grab a physical copy of the festival guide or program, which usually includes a map of the grounds, stage schedules, and other useful information.\n4. **Third-party festival apps**: There are several third-party festival apps, like Festival Finder or Festicket, that provide festival maps, schedules, and personalized planning tools. These apps might not be available for every festival, but they're worth checking out.\n\nWhile Songkick is an excellent resource for discovering and tracking festivals, it's not a comprehensive festival planning platform. However, by combining Songkick with the above resources, you'll be well-equipped to plan an amazing day at the festival!",
