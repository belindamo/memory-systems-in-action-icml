One notable movement is the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights, including legal protections against discrimination, access to healthcare, and equal treatment under the law. There are also many grassroots organizations and community-led initiatives around the world that work towards creating safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals and promoting education and acceptance around the issues of gender and sexuality. Additionally, many universities and other institutions have formed student groups and affinity groups that seek to create supportive communities for LGBTQ+ individuals.
