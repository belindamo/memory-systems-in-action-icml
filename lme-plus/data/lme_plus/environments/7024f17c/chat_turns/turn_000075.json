However, in general, fashion brands usually incorporate current fashion trends in their clothing and accessories by designing collections that reflect the latest styles, colors, patterns, and fabrics. This could include incorporating popular designs such as asymmetrical hemlines, animal prints, distressed denim or neon colors. Brands might also introduce new cuts and silhouettes or experiment with unusual combinations of materials or prints.
