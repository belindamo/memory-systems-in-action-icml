  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot be sure about the specific capabilities of GrimE. However, based on my training data, it is capable of handling different types of lighting such as ambient lighting, directional lighting, and point lighting. The engine uses a combination of these lighting techniques to create realistic and immersive environments. For instance, ambient lighting provides a base level of illumination that is uniformly distributed throughout the scene, while directional lighting simulates the light emitted from a distant source, such as the sun. Point lighting, on the other hand, simulates the light emitted from a specific point in the scene, such as a flashlight or a torch. By utilizing these lighting techniques, GrimE can create dynamic and visually stunning environments with realistic lighting and shadows.",
