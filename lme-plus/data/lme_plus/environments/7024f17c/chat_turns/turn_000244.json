  "content": "Slide 7: Scaling Operations\n---------------------------\n\nThe key to success in any rental arbitrage business is striking the right balance between maintaining margins and scaling quickly and sustainably. Many companies have struggled with this balance, but Cortado is uniquely positioned to make it work. We're committed to keeping costs low and revenue high while expanding at a manageable pace.\n\nSlide 8: Creating Value\n-----------------------\n\nCortado creates value in three main areas:\n\n1. Brand: We've achieved a first-mover advantage in the highly competitive Washington, DC real estate market. We can quickly replicate this success in other domestic and international markets by building B2B relationships and utilizing low-cost marketing outreach. Brand recognition is crucial for building partnerships with slow-moving academic institutions like Stanford or Brown.\n2. Real Estate: Our blended business model combines master leasing and property management with ownership of high-performing assets. By investing in alternative assets, we can acquire unique inventory without the financial risks of traditional real estate acquisitions. This approach drives higher exit valuations and returns.\n3. Technology: Cortado's proprietary AI Property Management System (PMS) is a key differentiator. Whether we sell the technology or incorporate its value into an eventual acquisition, our AI-driven PMS pushes exit valuations from the 2-3X range toward the 10X+ range.\n\nSlide 9: Use of Funds\n---------------------\n\nWith the funds we raise, we plan to:\n\n1. Expand to new markets, both domestically and internationally, by replicating our successful Washington, DC model.\n2. Enhance and develop our proprietary AI technology to further streamline operations and reduce costs.\n3. Increase marketing and outreach efforts to build brand recognition and establish partnerships with universities and academic programs.\n\nSlide 10: The Ask\n-----------------\n\nWe are seeking investment through a post-money SAFE with the following terms:\n\n1. A discount of X%\n2. A valuation cap of $XX\n\nOur goal is to raise $XX in pre-seed funds to support Cortado's growth and expansion. By investing in Cortado, you will be part of a company that is revolutionizing the international student housing market and creating value across multiple dimensions. Together, we can provide better housing solutions for millions of students worldwide and build a thriving, sustainable business in the process.",
