  "content": "I actually just got back from Lyon last weekend, and I had a great time exploring the city. I tried some delicious Lyonnaise cuisine, including salade lyonnaise and quenelles. I stayed in a small studio apartment in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, but I'm thinking of finding a new place for the summer. Do you have any tips on how to find a good apartment in Paris?",
