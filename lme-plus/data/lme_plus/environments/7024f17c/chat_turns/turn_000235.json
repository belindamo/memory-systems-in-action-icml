Here are a few ways to set reminders:\n\n1. **Phone Reminders**: Set reminders on your phone using the built-in Reminders app (for iOS) or Google Keep (for Android). You can set recurring reminders for every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6:50 am (10 minutes before your practice) to give yourself time to get ready.\n2. **Calendar Events**: Create recurring events on your calendar (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any other calendar app) for your yoga practice. Set the event to repeat every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 7:00 am, and add a reminder 10-15 minutes before the event.\n3. **Down Dog App**: If you're using the Down Dog app, you can set reminders for your yoga practice within the app. Go to the \"Settings\" tab, then \"Reminders,\" and set your preferred reminder time and frequency.\n4. **Alarm Clock**: Set an alarm clock for 6:50 am on the days you plan to practice yoga. This will ensure you wake up on time and have enough time to get ready.\n5. **Habit-Tracking Apps**: If you're using a habit-tracking app like Habitica, HabitBull, or Loop Habit Tracker, you can set reminders for your yoga practice and track your progress.\n\n**Tips for Effective Reminders:**\n\n1. **Set reminders at the right time**: Set reminders 10-15 minutes before your practice to give yourself time to get ready and prepare.\n2. **Make reminders specific**: Instead of a generic \"Yoga\" reminder, try something like \"7:00 am Yoga Practice - Monday\" to make it more specific and relevant.\n3. **Use a consistent tone**: Choose a consistent tone or phrase for your reminders to make them more recognizable and effective.\n4. **Don't overdo it**: Avoid setting too many reminders, as this can become overwhelming and annoying. Stick to one or two reminders per practice.\n\nBy setting reminders, you'll be more likely to stick to your yoga practice and make it a consistent habit. Good luck, and enjoy your morning yoga sessions!",
