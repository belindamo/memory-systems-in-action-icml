Short stories are an excellent choice for busy schedules, as they can be easily devoured in a single sitting.\n\nSince you've been enjoying Zadie Smith's short stories, I think you'll appreciate George Saunders' style, which often blends humor, satire, and poignancy. His stories can be both entertaining and thought-provoking, making them perfect for a daily commute.\n\nTo make the most of your commute reading time, you might consider audiobooks or e-books, which can be easily accessed on your phone or e-reader. Many of George Saunders' short stories are available in audio format, and you can even find some of them online for free.\n\nIf you prefer physical books, consider carrying a slim volume of short stories, like \"CivilWarLand in Bad Decline\" or \"Tenth of December\", which are easy to carry and can be read in short bursts.\n\nRemember, the goal is to enjoy your daily commute reading time, so feel free to experiment with different formats and styles until you find what works best for you.\n\nHappy reading, and I hope you enjoy exploring George Saunders' works!",
