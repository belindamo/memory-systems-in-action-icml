      "content": "Slide 1: Intro / Hook\n---------------------\n\nHello everyone, my name is [FNAME]. Over the last 10 months, my partner and I have taken our real estate company, Cortado, from launch to generating more than $350,000 in revenue. How did we achieve this? By leveraging new AI tools to target an undersupplied niche housing market worth $71 trillion \u2013 international student housing.\n\nSlide 2: Market Size\n--------------------\n\nLet me give you a brief overview of this niche market. International student housing is a subset of the growing MTR market, and it's massively undersupplied. More than 6 million students per year seek housing abroad, and that number is expected to reach 8 million by 2025. Over the last 20 years, this market has experienced a 5.5% growth rate, even through the COVID-19 pandemic. With an average rental cost of $214 per week, the total available market (TAM) for international student housing is a staggering $71 trillion.\n\nSlide 3: The Problem\n--------------------\n\nWhy target this niche market? Well, international student housing may not sound glamorous, but it's a market that has been largely overlooked by VCs, angel investors, and other startups. These students often face unique challenges when seeking housing. They need move-in ready accommodations for short stays, but they can't afford hotels and might not have the necessary credit scores or guarantors to sign traditional leases. Furthermore, they may not know which neighborhoods are safe or desirable. As a result, they're often left with subpar options like sketchy sublets or overcrowded hostels.\n\nSlide 4: The Solution\n---------------------\n\nCortado provides the solution this market desperately needs: affordable, flexible, move-in ready housing conveniently located near students' work or study locations. Our aim is to offer these students a comfortable, community-centered living experience, while also providing peace of mind to their parents and universities.\n\nSlide 5: Cortado's Model\n------------------------\n\nOur business model is built on three key steps:\n\n1. We partner with local homeowners to quickly source new inventory.\n2. We furnish and photograph the home in under 48 hours.\n3. We market the home by-the-room using tiered \"smart pricing,\" ensuring affordability for our guests while maintaining a target revenue occupancy of 90-95%.\n\nSlide 6: Traction\n-----------------\n\nSo, how has this model performed? To date, Cortado has generated over $350,000 in gross revenue across 9 rental properties in Washington, DC. Our success has led to an influx of homeowner referrals, which demonstrates strong supply-side traction for our master lease model. On the demand side, we've been able to book all rooms for the spring 2023 semester with zero ad spend. Additionally, our summer 2022 bookings were filled within just 10 days. Prestigious programs like Stanford and Atlantis regularly reach out to us, but we often can't accommodate their needs due to limited inventory."

      "content": "Slide 7: Scaling Operations\n---------------------------\n\nThe key to success in any rental arbitrage business is striking the right balance between maintaining margins and scaling quickly and sustainably. Many companies have struggled with this balance, but Cortado is uniquely positioned to make it work. We're committed to keeping costs low and revenue high while expanding at a manageable pace.\n\nSlide 8: Creating Value\n-----------------------\n\nCortado creates value in three main areas:\n\n1. Brand: We've achieved a first-mover advantage in the highly competitive Washington, DC real estate market. We can quickly replicate this success in other domestic and international markets by building B2B relationships and utilizing low-cost marketing outreach. Brand recognition is crucial for building partnerships with slow-moving academic institutions like Stanford or Brown.\n2. Real Estate: Our blended business model combines master leasing and property management with ownership of high-performing assets. By investing in alternative assets, we can acquire unique inventory without the financial risks of traditional real estate acquisitions. This approach drives higher exit valuations and returns.\n3. Technology: Cortado's proprietary AI Property Management System (PMS) is a key differentiator. Whether we sell the technology or incorporate its value into an eventual acquisition, our AI-driven PMS pushes exit valuations from the 2-3X range toward the 10X+ range.\n\nSlide 9: Use of Funds\n---------------------\n\nWith the funds we raise, we plan to:\n\n1. Expand to new markets, both domestically and internationally, by replicating our successful Washington, DC model.\n2. Enhance and develop our proprietary AI technology to further streamline operations and reduce costs.\n3. Increase marketing and outreach efforts to build brand recognition and establish partnerships with universities and academic programs.\n\nSlide 10: The Ask\n-----------------\n\nWe are seeking investment through a post-money SAFE with the following terms:\n\n1. A discount of X%\n2. A valuation cap of $XX\n\nOur goal is to raise $XX in pre-seed funds to support Cortado's growth and expansion. By investing in Cortado, you will be part of a company that is revolutionizing the international student housing market and creating value across multiple dimensions. Together, we can provide better housing solutions for millions of students worldwide and build a thriving, sustainable business in the process."
