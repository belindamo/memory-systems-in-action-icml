I'd be happy to help you with a simple recipe to refresh your memory.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the dough:\n\n* 2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n* 1/4 cup ghee or oil\n* 1/2 cup lukewarm water\n\nFor the filling:\n\n* 1 cup cooked and mashed potatoes\n* 1/2 cup peas\n* 1/2 cup onions, finely chopped\n* 1/4 cup cauliflower, grated\n* 1/4 cup carrots, grated\n* 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds\n* 1/2 teaspoon coriander powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon amchur powder (dried mango powder)\n* Salt, to taste\n* Lemon juice, to taste\n* Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Make the dough:** Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Add ghee or oil and mix until the dough comes together. Gradually add lukewarm water and knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and pliable. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.\n2. **Prepare the filling:** Heat oil in a pan and saut\u00e9 cumin seeds until fragrant. Add chopped onions, peas, cauliflower, and carrots. Cook until the vegetables are tender. Add mashed potatoes, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, amchur powder, salt, and lemon juice. Mix well.\n3. **Assemble the samosas:** Divide the dough into 8-10 equal portions. Roll out each portion into a thin circle, about 3-4 inches in diameter. Place a tablespoon or two of the filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling to form a triangle or a cone shape, and press the edges to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges.\n4. **Fry the samosas:** Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add a few samosas (do not overcrowd) and fry until they are golden brown, about 3-4 minutes on each side. Drain the samosas on paper towels.\n5. **Serve:** Serve the samosas hot with a dollop of tamarind chutney or a side of mint chutney. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and enjoy!\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a variety of fillings, such as spiced potatoes, peas, and onions, or experiment with other ingredients like cauliflower, carrots, or lentils.\n* To bake the samosas instead of frying, preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Brush the samosas with oil and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.\n* You can make the dough and filling ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to a day. Assemble and fry the samosas just before serving.\n\nI hope this refresher helps you create delicious samosas for your family gathering!"
