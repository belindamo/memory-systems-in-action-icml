      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to Parisian's specific styling advice, but I can give you some general tips on how to style oversize blazers and shoulder pads for different body types. \n\n- Hourglass Figure: If you have an hourglass shape, you can show off your curves by cinching your waist with a belt over the blazer. This will accentuate your figure and prevent the blazer from looking too bulky.\n\n- Pear Figure: If you have a pear-shaped body, opt for an oversized blazer that ends at your mid-thigh. This will draw attention to your upper body and balance out your proportions.\n\n- Rectangle Figure: If you have a straight or rectangle body type, create some definition by choosing a blazer with structured shoulders, which will add shape to your upper body.\n\n- Apple Figure: If you have an apple-shaped body, it's essential to choose a blazer that is long enough to cover your hips and buttocks. This style will help elongate your torso and provide balance.\n\n- Petite Figure: If you're petite, avoid blazers that are too long or bulky as they can overwhelm your frame. Instead, choose a cropped or fitted blazer that sits at your natural waist.\n\nRemember to also consider the fit of the blazer so it doesn't look too big or too small for your body type, and you can experiment with different styling options to find what works best for you."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have access to Parisian's specific product offerings and cannot recommend any specific options. However, I can give some general tips on how to style chunky platform sandals:\n\n- Wear with cropped wide-leg pants or culottes for a chic and trendy look.\n- Pair with a flowing midi dress or skirt to add some height and balance to your silhouette.\n- Try them with high-waisted shorts or jean cut-offs for a casual yet stylish summer look.\n- Chunky platform sandals can even work with ankle-length pants or jeans for a playful twist on a classic outfit.\n\nWhen it comes to color, black or nude platforms are versatile and can be worn with most outfits. However, if you're feeling daring and want to make a statement, metallic, pastel or bright colored platform sandals can add an unexpected pop of color to your outfit.\n\nKeep in mind that chunky platform sandals can be quite the statement piece, so you may want to keep the rest of your outfit more minimal and let the shoes do the talking."
