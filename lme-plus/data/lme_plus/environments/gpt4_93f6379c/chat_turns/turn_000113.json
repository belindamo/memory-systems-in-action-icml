As a beginner, I'd recommend starting with a beginner-friendly mandolin that meets the following criteria:\n\n1. **Affordability**: Look for mandolins in the $200-$500 range. This will get you a decent instrument that's easy on the wallet.\n2. **Playability**: A beginner-friendly mandolin should have a comfortable neck, easy-to-press strings, and a well-adjusted bridge.\n3. **Tone**: While you might not get the same tone as a high-end mandolin, a good beginner instrument should still produce a clear, resonant sound.\n\nSome popular beginner-friendly mandolin brands and models include:\n\n* **Kentucky KM-150**: A well-regarded, affordable mandolin with a great tone.\n* **Eastman MD304**: A versatile, easy-to-play mandolin with a rich, warm sound.\n* **The Loar LM-110**: A great value for the price, with a comfortable neck and good tone.\n\nInvesting in a higher-end mandolin (>$1000) can be tempting, but it might not be the best choice for a beginner. Here's why:\n\n1. **Cost**: High-end mandolins are a significant investment, and you might not be sure if you'll stick with the instrument long-term.\n2. **Complexity**: Higher-end mandolins often have more complex features, such as intricate inlays or custom setups, which might be overwhelming for a beginner.\n3. **Tone**: While high-end mandolins do sound amazing, the difference in tone might not be dramatic enough to justify the cost for a beginner.\n\nThat being said, if you're willing to invest in a higher-end mandolin, it can be a great choice if you're serious about playing long-term. Just keep in mind that you might need to adjust your playing style and technique to get the most out of the instrument.\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to find a mandolin that feels comfortable to play, sounds good to your ears, and inspires you to practice and improve.\n\nDo you have any experience with stringed instruments, or is the mandolin your first foray into the world of strings?",
