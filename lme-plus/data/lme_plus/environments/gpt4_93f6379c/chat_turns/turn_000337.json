  "content": "Overall, the literature suggests that SDGH run with BBS has significant potential to meet the needs of modern agriculture while reducing environmental impact and increasing profitability for farmers. The design and dimensions of the SDGH can have a significant impact on the growth rates and quality of halophytic biomass, and the use of high-emissive polymers as radiative cooling materials can increase the effectiveness and resilience of the system. There are still some fundamental research gaps in the field, particularly in the area of halophytic evaporative cooling effects and energy-efficient condensation methods, which need to be addressed in future experiments. Nevertheless, the advantages of operating a SDGH with BBS are numerous, including the potential for long-term sustainable agriculture, new market opportunities, extra water supply, land restoration, and environmental projects.",
