  "content": "My living room is about 15 by 12 feet, rectangular in shape. I have a sectional sofa, two armchairs, a coffee table, a TV stand, and a bookshelf. The windows are on one of the longer sides, and the door is on one of the shorter sides. I don't have a specific design style in mind, but I do want to create a cozy atmosphere. I have two side tables, each about 20 inches wide and 24 inches tall.",
