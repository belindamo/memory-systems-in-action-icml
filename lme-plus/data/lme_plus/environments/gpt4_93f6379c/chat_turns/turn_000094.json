  "content": "I loved the magic system in \"The Night Circus\"! It was so unique and intriguing. I think what I liked most about it was how it was tied to the circus itself, and how the magic was woven into the fabric of the environment. I'm actually thinking of incorporating a similar concept into my own story, where the magic is tied to the natural world and the ruins of an ancient city. Do you have any tips on how to create a magic system that feels organic and tied to the world itself?",
