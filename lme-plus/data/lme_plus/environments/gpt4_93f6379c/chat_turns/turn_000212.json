  "content": "That's great to hear about the charity 5K run! I'm excited to learn more about pancreatic cancer and how I can contribute to the cause. It's interesting to know that May is National Cancer Research Month, and I'll make sure to spread awareness about it.\n\nRegarding pancreatic cancer, I had no idea it was such a deadly disease. The symptoms seem quite vague, and I can see why it's often diagnosed at an advanced stage. It's good to know that researchers are making progress in developing new treatments, especially immunotherapy and targeted therapies.\n\nI'm curious to know more about the current research on pancreatic cancer. Are there any promising clinical trials or breakthroughs that I should know about?",
