  "content": "Yes, there are typically multiple layers of protection implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the World Bank headquarters in addition to biometric recognition technology.\n\nOne of the most common measures is the use of access control systems, which use physical barriers such as gates or turnstiles to control entry and exit from the premises. Only individuals with authorized access credentials, such as ID cards or biometric data, will be granted access.\n\nIn addition to physical barriers, security personnel are typically present to monitor the entrance and exit points, as well as move throughout the premises to watch for any suspicious activity.\n\nSurveillance cameras are also used throughout the premises to monitor activity, record footage, and allow security personnel to quickly identify any security breaches.\n\nFire alarm and suppression systems are installed to detect and respond to potentially dangerous conditions, such as smoke and fire.\n\nOverall, multiple security layers are put into place to prevent unauthorized access to the World Bank headquarters, with each layer working together to create a robust security system.",
