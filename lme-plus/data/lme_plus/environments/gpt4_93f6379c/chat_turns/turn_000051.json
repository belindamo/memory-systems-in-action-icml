  "content": "As an AI language model I don't have access to your hair type and the current condition of your hair, so it is difficult to provide a specific recommendation. But, as a general rule, using a hair mask once a week or every two weeks can be beneficial for color-treated hair. However, If you have extremely dry or damaged hair, then you might benefit from using a hair mask more frequently, such as twice a week. It's important to pay attention to your hair and adjust your routine based on its needs. Also, make sure to follow the instructions on the mask as well as the manufacturer's guidance on frequency of use.",
