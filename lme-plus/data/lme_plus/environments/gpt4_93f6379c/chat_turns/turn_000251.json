  "content": "Dear Tyra,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to ask for your assistance with the weekly catering for our group meeting. I understand that O's campus cafe requires a faculty/staff member as the contact for orders, and I was wondering if it would be possible for me to use your contact information for this purpose.\n\nIf you are able to help, the process would involve O's sending you a proposal after I submit the catering inquiry. You would then forward it to me for review, and if everything is correct, you would need to reply with your approval. Following the catering, O's would send you the receipt, and we could proceed with reimbursement.\n\nI would be very grateful if you could serve as the contact for our group, but please let me know if this would be inconvenient for you. Thank you so much for your time and assistance.\n\nBest regards,\nZhenyu",
