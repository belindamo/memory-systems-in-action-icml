Here are some additional suggestions to help you stay active throughout the day:\n\n1. **Take the stairs**: If you work or live in a building with stairs, opt for taking the stairs instead of the elevator. This can add up to a great workout throughout the day.\n2. **Desk exercises**: Try doing chair squats, desk push-ups, or leg lifts while sitting at your desk. You can also do wrist extensions and finger spreads to reduce the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.\n3. **Walk to a coworker's desk**: Instead of sending an email or instant message, walk to a coworker's desk to chat with them. This can help you get up and move around more often.\n4. **Park farther away**: When you're out and about, try parking your car in a spot that's farther away from your destination. This will give you more opportunities to walk and get some extra steps in.\n5. **Take a walk during phone calls**: If you have a phone call that doesn't require your full attention, try taking a walk while you chat. This can help you stay active and focused.\n6. **Do household chores**: Turn housework into a workout by putting on some music and increasing your intensity. You can also try doing squats or lunges while you vacuum or mop.\n7. **Take a walking meeting**: If possible, suggest a walking meeting with your colleagues or friends.

This can help motivate you to move more throughout the day.\n9. **Take breaks to stretch**: Take short breaks throughout the day to stretch your muscles. This can help reduce the risk of injury and improve your overall flexibility.\n10. **Try active commuting**: If possible, try commuting to work or school by bike, bus, or train. This can help you get some exercise while also reducing your carbon footprint.\n11. **Play with your kids**: If you have kids, play active games with them, such as tag, hide-and-seek, or soccer.
