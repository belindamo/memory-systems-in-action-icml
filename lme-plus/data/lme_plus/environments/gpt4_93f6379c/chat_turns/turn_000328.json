  "content": "I think there's been a misunderstanding! I apologize for the confusion. As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't attend a music festival with Rachel or see Tove Lo perform live. I'm just here to provide information and help with your playlist!\n\nHowever, I'm glad we could have this conversation! If you're considering adding Tove Lo's music to your playlist, I think it could be a great choice. Her songs often have a dark, edgy vibe that could complement Billie Eilish's sound nicely. Tracks like **Habits (Stay High)** or **Cool Girl** could add a nice indie-pop element to your playlist.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need further recommendations!",
