  "content": "Project Overview: Dis the Dis Information Website\n\nDis the Dis aimed to challenge negative perceptions associated with being disabled and promote empathy towards those with disabilities. In their first year, Dis the Dis planned to launch Pirate Days in schools to spread empathic awareness about disability in children. The goal of the Dis the Dis information website was to communicate what the startup was about and convey its future goals. The website provided information and resources for schools to run the Pirate Days and included feedback forms for users to provide input. The website was designed to be a central hub for all information related to the Dis the Dis mission.",
