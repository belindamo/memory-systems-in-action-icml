I'd be happy to help you with some layout suggestions.\n\nBefore we dive in, could you please provide me with some details about your living room? This will help me give you more tailored advice:\n\n1. What is the approximate size of your living room?\n2. What shape is the room? (e.g., rectangular, square, L-shaped)\n3. What type of furniture do you have in the room (e.g., sofa, armchairs, coffee table, TV stand, bookshelves)?\n4. Where are the windows and doors located in the room?\n5. Do you have any specific design style or layout preferences (e.g., conversational circle, focal point, traffic path)?\n6. How many side tables do you have, and what's their size?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your space, I can offer you some personalized layout suggestions that incorporate your new side tables and table lamps.\n\n(And congratulations on the new side tables, by the way!)",
