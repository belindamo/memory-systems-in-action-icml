My usernames are @lifestyleblogger on Instagram and Facebook, @lifestyle_tweets on Twitter, and @lifestyletiktok on TikTok. On Instagram, I have around 3,500 followers and post 3 times a week, mostly photos and stories about lifestyle and wellness. My top-performing posts are usually my morning routine and skincare tips. My goal is to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to my blog. Oh, and by the way, I've noticed that I've been gaining around 15 new followers a day on Instagram over the past two weeks, which is a big jump for me.",
