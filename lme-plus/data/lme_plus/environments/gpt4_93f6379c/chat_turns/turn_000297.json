  "content": "Of course! I apologize for any confusion. What I meant was that Kirby would use his ability to inhale and copy the powers of a hostile country's military as a demonstration of strength and a deterrent to conflict, not as a means of violence. \n\nKirby's approach to conflict resolution would always be peaceful and diplomatic. He would use his powers to understand the motivations and concerns of the opposing parties, and work to find a solution that benefits all involved.\n\nSo, in the example of a country threatening to go to war with the United States, Kirby's demonstration of strength through his ability to inhale and copy the powers of the opposing country's military would serve as a deterrent to conflict, leading the opposing country to seek a peaceful solution through negotiation and diplomacy.\n\nKirby, as a god and as a president, would always prioritize peace, unity, and the well-being of all people, and work to find solutions through peaceful means.",
