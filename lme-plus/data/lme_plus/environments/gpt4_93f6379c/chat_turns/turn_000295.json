Kirby's ability to inhale and copy his enemies' powers would allow him to effectively deal with any hostile country or group. For example, if a country threatened to go to war with the United States, Kirby could inhale and copy the powers of the country's military to neutralize the threat without any violence.\n\nAdditionally, Kirby's kind and caring personality would inspire him to use diplomacy and negotiation to resolve conflicts peacefully. He would use his ability to listen and understand others to find common ground and negotiate a solution that benefits all parties.\n\nOverall, with Kirby as President, the United States would have a strong and effective leader who would be able to handle any major geopolitical event with ease and grace, while promoting peace and unity throughout the world.",
