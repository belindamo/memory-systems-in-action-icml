Here are some key factors to consider:\n\n1. **Lumen output**: Look for a light with a high lumen output (measured in lumens, e.g., 200, 400, 800) for increased visibility.\n2. **Beam pattern**: Consider a light with a focused beam pattern to illuminate the road ahead, as well as a peripheral glow to increase visibility from the side.\n3. **Run time**: Choose a light with a long battery life or one that's rechargeable via USB to minimize battery swaps.\n4. **Mounting options**: Ensure the light is easy to mount and adjust on your bike, with options for handlebar, helmet, or seatpost mounting.\n5. **Water resistance**: If you ride in wet conditions, look for a light with IPX7 or higher water resistance rating.\n\nBased on these factors, here are some popular bike light options:\n\n1. **Lezyne Lights**: Known for their high-quality, compact, and rechargeable lights with excellent beam patterns.\n2. **Cygolite Lights**: Offers a range of lights with high lumen outputs, long battery life, and excellent mounting options.\n3. **NiteRider Lights**: Provides a variety of lights with advanced features like adjustable beam patterns and USB rechargeability.\n4. ** Exposure Lights**: High-end lights with exceptional lumen output, beam pattern, and battery life, often used by serious commuters and road cyclists.\n5. **Planet Bike Lights**: Affordable, eco-friendly options with a focus on visibility and safety.\n\nSome specific models to consider:\n\n1. **Lezyne Strip Drive Pro 1200**: A compact, rechargeable light with a high lumen output and excellent beam pattern.\n2. **Cygolite Hotshot 600**: A high-output light with a long battery life and adjustable beam pattern.\n3. **NiteRider Mako 200**: A budget-friendly option with a decent lumen output and USB rechargeability.\n\nWhen choosing a bike light, also consider the following:\n\n1. **Additional features**: Some lights come with additional features like flashing modes, side visibility, or remote controls.\n2. **Certifications**: Look for lights that meet safety certifications like CPSC or StVZO.\n3. **Price**: Bike lights can range from under $20 to over $200, so set a budget and choose a light that meets your needs within that range.\n\nI recommend visiting your local bike shop to try out different lights and get a feel for what works best for you.\n\nWhat's your budget for a new bike light, and do you have any specific features in mind?",
