  "content": "As President, Kirby would use his kind and caring personality to approach the Soviet Union with a message of peace and a desire to find a solution that benefits both parties. He would use his powers to understand the motivations and concerns of the Soviet Union, and work to address those concerns in a peaceful and diplomatic manner. \n\nKirby would also use his demonstration of strength through his ability to inhale and copy the powers of the Soviet Union's military as a deterrent to conflict, not as a declaration of war. He would make it clear that his use of his powers is not meant to be aggressive, but rather a demonstration of his commitment to finding a peaceful solution and avoiding conflict.\n\nThe Soviet Union would recognize Kirby's commitment to peace and his demonstration of strength as a deterrent to conflict, rather than as a declaration of war. With Kirby's ability to listen, understand and negotiate, both the United States and Soviet Union would work together to find a peaceful solution to the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIn the end, the peaceful and diplomatic approach taken by Kirby as President would lead to a peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and would set an example for future leaders to follow in their pursuit of peace and conflict resolution.",
