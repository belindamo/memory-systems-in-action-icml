It's great that drivers and pedestrians are more aware of you and giving you the space you need.\n\nRegarding additional accessories, I think reflective gear is an excellent idea. Ankle straps or arm bands can provide extra visibility, especially when you're moving or turning, which can help catch the attention of drivers or pedestrians who might not have seen you otherwise. It's a simple and affordable way to increase your visibility and safety.\n\nAs for mirrors or rear-view cameras, they can be very useful in helping you stay aware of your surroundings. A mirror can give you a clear view of what's behind you, allowing you to anticipate potential hazards or make more informed decisions when changing lanes or turning. A rear-view camera can provide an even wider field of view and can be especially useful if you ride in heavy traffic or have limited visibility.\n\nWhether or not these accessories are worth the investment depends on your personal preferences and riding habits. If you feel that you're often checking over your shoulder or worrying about what's behind you, a mirror or rear-view camera could provide peace of mind and improve your overall riding experience. Additionally, if you ride in low-light conditions or in areas with heavy traffic, these accessories could be especially valuable.\n\nIt's also worth considering other accessories that can enhance your safety and visibility, such as:\n\n1. Reflective stickers or decals for your bike or helmet\n2. A bell or horn to alert pedestrians or other cyclists\n3. A safety flag or pennant to increase your visibility from the side\n4. A bike computer or GPS device with built-in safety features, such as crash detection or incident alert\n\nUltimately, the key is to identify areas where you feel vulnerable or concerned about your safety, and then explore accessories that can help address those concerns.\n\nWhat do you think about these suggestions? Are there any other safety concerns or areas where you'd like to improve your visibility or awareness?",
