  "content": "I've definitely noticed that drivers are more aware of me when I'm riding with the light. They seem to give me more space and are more cautious when passing me, which is great. I've also noticed that pedestrians are more likely to see me coming and yield to me at crosswalks.\n\nAs for additional accessories, I've been thinking about getting some reflective gear, like ankle straps or arm bands, to increase my visibility even more. I've also been considering getting a mirror or a rear-view camera to help me stay aware of my surroundings. What do you think about those types of accessories? Are they worth the investment?",
