  "content": "That's a great idea about featuring lesser-known languages and cultures. I think it would be really interesting to explore languages like Welsh or Mongolian, or cultures like the Sami people. It would definitely make my project stand out and provide a unique perspective. I like the idea of a \"Language Learner of the Month\" or \"Native Speaker of the Month\" feature, and using social media to share snippets or teasers from the interviews. I'll definitely consider creating a podcast or video series focused on the interviews.",
