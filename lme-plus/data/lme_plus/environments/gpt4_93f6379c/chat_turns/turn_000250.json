O's requires a faculty/staff as the contact.\nIf you can be the\u00a0contact, the procedures are as follows:1. They will send you a proposal after I submit the catering inquiry.\u00a02. You'll need to forward it to me so I can check if it's correct or not.\u00a03. You need to reply with approval.\u00a04. They will send you the receipt after the catering, and we can continue to reimbursement.\nIs it OK for you to be the contact? Thank you!\nBest,Zhenyu\"",
