This can help to:\n\n* Create a sense of separation between the seating area and the TV area\n* Make the room feel cozier by creating a defined space for TV viewing\n* Take advantage of the natural light from the windows during the day\n\nJust make sure to consider the viewing angle and distance from the seating area to the TV. You want to ensure that the TV is at a comfortable viewing distance and angle for everyone in the room.\n\n**Table Lamps**\n\nYour new table lamps will fit in perfectly with the conversational circle layout! With the side tables placed between the armchairs and the sofa, the lamps will provide warm and cozy lighting, creating a inviting atmosphere. The lamps will also help to:\n\n* Create a sense of balance and harmony with the symmetrical placement of the side tables and lamps\n* Add a warm glow to the room, making it feel cozier and more intimate\n* Provide task lighting for reading, conversation, or other activities\n\nWhen placing the lamps, consider the following:\n\n* Place the lamps at a comfortable height, so the light source is not directly in anyone's eyes\n* Experiment with different lamp shades to find the one that provides the right amount of light and ambiance for your room\n* Consider adding a dimmer switch or using a lamp with a dimmer feature to adjust the light level to your liking\n\n**Revised Layout**\n\nHere's a revised layout incorporating your suggestions:\n\n* Sectional sofa along the longer wall with the windows, leaving about 12-18 inches between the sofa and the wall\n* Two armchairs on either side of the coffee table, facing the sofa\n* One side table between the armchairs and the sofa, and the other side table on the other side of the sofa, near the window\n* TV stand in the corner of the longer wall with the windows, creating a cozy TV nook\n* Table lamps on the side tables, providing warm and cozy lighting\n* Bookshelf on the shorter wall near the door\n\nHow does this revised layout sound?",
