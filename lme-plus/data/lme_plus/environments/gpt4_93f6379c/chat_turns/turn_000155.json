Featuring lesser-known languages and cultures will not only make your project unique but also contribute to a more inclusive and diverse language learning community.\n\nThe \"Language Learner of the Month\" or \"Native Speaker of the Month\" feature is a great way to create a recurring theme that your audience can look forward to. It'll also help you to establish a consistent content schedule and keep your audience engaged.\n\nUsing social media to share snippets or teasers from the interviews is an excellent way to generate buzz and encourage people to tune in to the full interview. You could share a quote, a fun fact, or a brief summary of the interview, and use relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience.\n\nA podcast or video series focused on the interviews would be an amazing way to delve deeper into the stories and experiences of language learners and native speakers. You could also use this format to explore specific topics or themes, such as language learning challenges, cultural differences, or the benefits of language exchange.\n\nTo take it to the next level, you could consider collaborating with language learners, native speakers, or cultural experts to co-create content, moderate discussions, or provide additional insights. This would not only add diversity to your content but also help to build a community around your project.\n\nRemember, the key to success lies in being consistent, engaging, and authentic. Share your passion for language learning and cultural exchange, and your audience will respond positively.\n\nNow that we have a solid foundation for your content calendar, let's talk about the logistics.
