  "content": "Coffee tables are a great addition to any living room!\n\nChoosing the right size and shape of a coffee table can be a bit tricky, but here are some tips to help you get it just right:\n\n1. **Measure the space**: Measure the space between the sectional sofa and the TV stand or any other furniture in the room. This will give you an idea of the maximum size of the coffee table.\n2. **Consider the scale**: Make sure the coffee table is proportional to the sectional sofa and the room. A large coffee table in a small room can make the space feel cramped, while a small table in a large room can look lost.\n3. **Think about the shape**: The shape of the coffee table should complement the shape of the sectional sofa and the room. For example, a rectangular coffee table works well with a rectangular sectional sofa, while a round coffee table can add a cozy touch to a square-shaped room.\n4. **Leave enough clearance**: Leave enough clearance between the coffee table and the sectional sofa for comfortable movement. A good rule of thumb is to leave at least 12-18 inches of space between the two.\n5. **Consider the height**: The height of the coffee table should be comfortable for those sitting on the sectional sofa. Aim for a height that's around 1-2 inches lower than the seat height of the sofa.\n6. **Think about functionality**: Think about how you'll be using the coffee table. If you'll be using it to place drinks, snacks, and remotes, a table with storage or a lift-top can be a great option.\n7. **Material and style**: Choose a material and style that complements the sectional sofa and the room's decor. For example, a glass coffee table can add a sleek, modern touch, while a wooden table can add warmth and coziness.\n\nSome popular coffee table shapes and sizes include:\n\n* Rectangular: 40-50 inches long, 20-30 inches wide, 15-20 inches high\n* Round: 36-48 inches in diameter, 15-20 inches high\n* Oval: 40-50 inches long, 25-35 inches wide, 15-20 inches high\n* Square: 30-40 inches square, 15-20 inches high\n\nWhen shopping for a coffee table at Target, be sure to:\n\n* Check the product description for measurements and material information.\n* Read reviews to see how the table performs in real-life settings.\n* Consider purchasing a coffee table with adjustable legs or a storage compartment for added functionality.\n\nBy considering these factors, you'll be able to find a coffee table that's the perfect size and shape for your living room.\n\nDo you have any other questions about choosing the right coffee table for your space?",
