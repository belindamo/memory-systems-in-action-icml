This path is perfect for a leisurely ride or a commute.\n* The **Diagonal Bike Lane** (Carrer de la Diagonal) is a 11 km long, dedicated bike lane that runs diagonally across the city, connecting the seafront to the hills. This lane is a major cycling artery and is often used by locals and tourists alike.\n* The **Ciclopeatonal** is a network of bike paths and pedestrianized streets that connect the city's parks and green areas, creating a green corridor for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\n**Tips and guidelines:**\n\n* Barcelona has a bike-sharing system called **Bicing**, which is available to residents and visitors alike. You can purchase a day pass or a subscription to use the service.\n* Helmets are not mandatory in Barcelona, but they are highly recommended.\n* Cyclists are required to follow traffic rules and signs, and to yield to pedestrians in pedestrianized areas.\n* Be mindful of pedestrians, especially in tourist areas, and always keep an eye out for other cyclists, buses, and cars.\n\nDuring your bike tour, your guide will provide you with more information on the city's bike infrastructure and help you navigate the streets safely. They'll also share interesting facts and anecdotes about the city's history, architecture, and culture.\n\nGet ready to enjoy the freedom and flexibility of exploring Barcelona on two wheels!",
