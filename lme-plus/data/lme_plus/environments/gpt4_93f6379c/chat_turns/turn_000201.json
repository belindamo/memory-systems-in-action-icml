  "content": "The response time for the scholarship committee to review applications and notify winners can vary depending on several factors, such as the volume of applications, the complexity of the review process, and the availability of the committee members.\n\nHowever, based on the Digital Wellness Institute's (DWI) general guidelines, here are some general response timeframes to expect:\n\n**Application Review Period:**\n\n* The DWI's scholarship committee typically reviews applications within 4-6 weeks after the application deadline.\n* During this period, the committee reviews each application carefully, evaluates the candidates' qualifications, and selects the top candidates.\n\n**Notification of Winners:**\n\n* Winners are usually notified via email within 2-4 weeks after the application review period.\n* The notification email will include details about the scholarship award, including the amount, terms, and conditions.\n\n**Notification of Non-Winners:**\n\n* Applicants who are not selected for the scholarship will typically receive a notification email within 2-4 weeks after the application review period.\n* The notification email will thank them for their interest in the scholarship and encourage them to apply again in the future.\n\n**Total Response Time:**\n\n* From the application deadline to the notification of winners, the total response time can range from 6-12 weeks (1.5-3 months).\n\nPlease note that these are general response timeframes, and the actual time may vary depending on the specific circumstances. It's essential to be patient and allow the scholarship committee sufficient time to review applications thoroughly.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the scholarship application process or response time, I recommend reaching out to the DWI's scholarship team directly. They'll be happy to provide more information and guidance.",
