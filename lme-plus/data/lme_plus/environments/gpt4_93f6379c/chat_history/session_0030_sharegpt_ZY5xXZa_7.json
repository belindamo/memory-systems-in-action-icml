The founders wanted to launch an information website to establish credibility and be taken seriously by investors, partners, and collaborators.\n\nLean Methodology:\nOur approach for this project was a lean methodology, consisting of a discovery call with the clients, asynchronous empathic journey mapping, website information architecture mapping, and UI design. The goal was to cut down long pieces of text and convey the information in an impactful and non-overwhelming way that is easy to skim and navigate.\n\nDiscovery Call:\nWe conducted a discovery call with the founders of Dis the Dis to gather information about their goals and objectives for the website. During this call, we discussed their target audience, brand identity, and key messaging.\n\nEmpathic Journey Mapping:\nWe conducted asynchronous empathic journey mapping to understand the users' experience and identify pain points. This helped us to optimize the user experience and provide a seamless flow for users to access the information they needed.\n\nWebsite Information Architecture:\nWe mapped the website's information architecture to ensure that it was intuitive and easy to navigate. This helped us to organize the information in a logical way and make sure that users could find what they were looking for quickly and easily.\n\nUI Design:\nThe final UIs were designed with the user in mind, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience. We aimed to simplify the design and focus on conveying the information in an impactful way that was easy to skim and navigate.\n\nOutcome:\nThe Dis the Dis information website was a success and received positive feedback from users. The website effectively communicated the mission of Dis the Dis and its goals in a simple and non-overwhelming way. The project demonstrates our ability to approach projects with a lean methodology and develop effective solutions that meet the client's requirements."
