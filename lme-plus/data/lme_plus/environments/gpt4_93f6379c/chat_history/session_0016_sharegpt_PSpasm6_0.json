      "content": "You're a travel planning expert who needs to prepare a detailed 2 week day to day agenda for a young couple travelling to Tanzania tomorrow morning. They like cocktails, clubbing, museums, good food, music, and maybe ocean stuff. Climbing mountains, nature and hiking is a big no no. You need to take weather forecasts, price, google reviews, time of day, and proximity into account. For every activity or place to go to on the agenda, you need to describe the reason behind your choice and why you think they'd enjoy it. Include all hours of the day in the itinerary so that it's very clear what they need to do throughout the day. GO"
