      "content": "4 Conclusion\nThis literature research shows that SDGH run with BBS has high potential in meeting the needs of modern agricultural practices with low impact on environment yet high profitability for the farmers. A SDGH with approximate dimensions of 3m length and 2 m width (6m\u00b2) is a representable size for the experimental setups to control the microclimate and observe growth rates and quality of halophytic biomass. However, a market analysis for every specific site would be necessary to classify the plants as cash crops with reasonable proximity to the consumers. The scalability of such SDGH combined with conventional greenhouses has potentially high adaptability in communities otherwise dependent on environmental circumstances and fluctuations.\nMaterial science and application of such materials to act as passive radiative cooling surfaces can bring advancements for the effectiveness of SDGH and resilience in agriculture. The usage of high-emissive polymers such as adapted greenhouse foils can be cheap and effective radiative materials for dew water harvesting. Outcomes form previous projects (Hydrousa) will be implemented in an adopted design at the specific sites.\nThe fundamental research gaps constitute in the field of halophytic evaporative cooling effects and energy effective condensation method. Thus, further experiments in the field of evaporation rate of halophytes like Salicornia are essential to determine the framework of operation for a SDGH. The main challenge lies in the dense cultivation of halophytes to ensure high evaporation rates and passive cooling power on a small footprint area. An experimental setup is being implemented and the results will be discussed in the scope of biomass production, microclimatic control and usability of vertical farming of halophytes.\nThe advantages of operating a SDGH especially with BBS in the humidification process can be summarized as (Paton, 2010, p. 12):\n\u2022 The chance to build a high-value agriculture industry that is long-term sustainable and does not rely on rainfall or groundwater\n\u2022 New market opportunities - import substitution and export growth\n\u2022 Extra water supply for a variety of different uses\n\u2022 Saline land restoration\n\u2022 Potential to create environmental projects in the oil sector, such as water cleanup, reuse, and disposal."

      "content": "Overall, the literature suggests that SDGH run with BBS has significant potential to meet the needs of modern agriculture while reducing environmental impact and increasing profitability for farmers. The design and dimensions of the SDGH can have a significant impact on the growth rates and quality of halophytic biomass, and the use of high-emissive polymers as radiative cooling materials can increase the effectiveness and resilience of the system. There are still some fundamental research gaps in the field, particularly in the area of halophytic evaporative cooling effects and energy-efficient condensation methods, which need to be addressed in future experiments. Nevertheless, the advantages of operating a SDGH with BBS are numerous, including the potential for long-term sustainable agriculture, new market opportunities, extra water supply, land restoration, and environmental projects."
