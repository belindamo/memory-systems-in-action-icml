They prepare a query letter, synopsis, and sample chapters to submit to agents.\n3. **Agent Submissions**: The author submits their query letter and manuscript to selected agents. This can be a nerve-wracking process, as agents receive many submissions and may take weeks or months to respond.\n4. **Agent Offer**: If an agent offers representation, the author reviews and signs a contract.
