Le Train Bleu - this stunning restaurant inside the Gare de Lyon is a true hidden gem. It's been around since 1901 and feels like stepping back in time with its ornate decor, high ceilings and classic French cuisine.\n\n3. L'Avant Comptoir - this standing-only tapas bar in the Saint-Germain neighborhood is always buzzing with locals and visitors alike. They serve an extensive array of small plates and wines, and it's a great spot to soak up the atmosphere of the city."
