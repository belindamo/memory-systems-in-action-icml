However, in general, local governments and authorities are responsible for maintaining and improving the infrastructure in their respective areas. They may develop plans for flood prevention and mitigation, such as building or improving drainage systems, levees, or retaining walls. Some communities may also implement land-use planning and zoning regulations to prevent development in flood-prone areas. It is best to check with the local authorities for more information on any plans or measures being taken to prevent future flooding."
