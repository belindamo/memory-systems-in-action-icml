Shoulder press: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Raise your arms until your elbow joints make a 90-degree angle. Push the weights up, then lower them down slowly. Repeat 3 sets of 10 reps.\n\n2. Push-ups: Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your chest towards the ground, then push back up. Repeat for 3 sets of 10 reps.\n\n3. Plank rotations: Start in a plank position, then rotate your body to one side, extending your arm towards the ceiling. Hold for a few seconds, then return to the starting position and repeat on the other side. Repeat for 3 sets of 10 reps.\n\n4. Shoulder raises: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Raise your arms to shoulder height, then lower them back down slowly. Repeat for 3 sets of 10 reps.\n\n5. Neck bridges: Lie down flat on your back, then raise your head and shoulders off the ground. Hold for a few seconds, then return to the starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10 reps. It's important to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you get stronger. It's also important to make sure you have proper form and technique to avoid injury.",
