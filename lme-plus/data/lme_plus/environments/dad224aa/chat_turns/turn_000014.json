  "content": "We're planning to do a guided float trip on the Arkansas River, targeting brown trout. I'm pretty familiar with fly fishing, but this will be my first time on the Arkansas River. I've been doing some research on the best flies and techniques for that time of year, but I'm not sure what kind of gear is specifically recommended for that river. By the way, my buddy Alex and I launched our kayaks from the public ramp in Kenosha on Lake Michigan and paddled out to the rocky shoreline, which was really productive for us.",
