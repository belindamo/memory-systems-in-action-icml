  "content": "I'd be happy to help you find some new shows to watch. Here are a few questions to help me narrow down some recommendations:\n\n1. What type of genre are you in the mood for? (e.g. drama, comedy, sci-fi, fantasy, horror, etc.)\n2. Do you have a preferred streaming platform or do you watch TV through a traditional cable/satellite provider?\n3. How much time do you have to commit to a show? Are you looking for something quick to binge or a longer series to follow?\n4. Are you open to watching a show that's already completed, or do you prefer something that's currently airing?\n5. Is there a particular tone or atmosphere you're looking for in a show? (e.g. light-hearted, serious, suspenseful, etc.)\n\nFeel free to answer any or all of these questions, and I'll do my best to suggest some shows that fit your preferences!\n\n(If you're open to general recommendations, I can also provide some popular and highly-rated shows across various genres.)",
