Place the transistor on the breadboard with the flat side facing towards you. Connect the left leg of the transistor to the positive rail of the breadboard and the right leg to the negative rail of the breadboard.\n2. Insert the diode into the breadboard with the cathode (the side with a stripe) connected to the negative rail of the breadboard.\n3. Connect the anode of the diode to the base of the transistor (the middle leg).\n4. Place the 10k\u03a9 resistor on the breadboard and connect one end to the positive rail of the breadboard and the other end to the base of the transistor.\n5. Insert the 22pF capacitor into the breadboard with one leg connected to the base of the transistor and the other leg connected to the negative rail of the breadboard.\n6. Place the 100nF capacitor on the breadboard and connect one end to the collector of the transistor (the left leg) and the other end to the negative rail of the breadboard.\n7. Connect the 10mm ferrite coil to the collector of the transistor.\n8. Place the potentiometer on the breadboard and connect one end to the negative rail of the breadboard and the other end to the positive rail of the breadboard.\n9. Connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to the emitter of the transistor (the right leg).\n10. Connect the positive wire of the battery clip to the positive rail of the breadboard and the negative wire to the negative rail of the breadboard.\n11. Connect the mono 3.5mm jack to the positive rail and negative rail of the breadboard.\n12. Connect one wire of the speaker to the positive pin of the 3.5mm jack and the other wire to the collector of the transistor.\n13. Connect the ferrite coil to the input of the 3.5mm jack.\n14. Power on the circuit by connecting the battery to the battery clip.\n15. Tune in to an FM radio station on the circuit by adjusting the potentiometer.\n16. You should hear the radio station through the speaker.\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully built a simple FM radio with basic components.",
