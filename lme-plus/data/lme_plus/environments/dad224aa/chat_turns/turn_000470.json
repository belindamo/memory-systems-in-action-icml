That's a great strategy! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nYour proposed tweet is a good start, but I'd suggest a few tweaks to make it more engaging and concise:\n\n* **Make it more conversational**: Start with a question or a statement that encourages engagement, rather than simply stating your plan.\n* **Highlight the connection between your tweets**: Emphasize how your coffee polls are a natural follow-up to your Apple event tweet, rather than just mentioning the likes.\n* **Use a more attention-grabbing opening**: Instead of \"I'm thinking of running another poll,\" try something like \"Next up in our series of polls...\" or \"Get ready for our latest poll...\"\n\nHere's a rewritten tweet that incorporates these suggestions:\n\n\"Who's ready for a caffeine kick? \ud83c\udf89 After sparking a buzz with my Apple event tweet (15 likes!) and brewing up a coffee creamer poll that got 20 votes, I'm wondering... what's the perfect roast level? Should I whip up a poll to find out? Let me know! \u2615\ufe0f\"\n\nThis tweet aims to:\n\n1. Grab attention with a playful opening and emojis.\n2. Provide context by referencing your previous tweets and polls.\n3. Ask for feedback and engagement by posing a question.\n4. Encourage responses by using a conversational tone.\n\nFeel free to modify it to fit your style, and good luck with your tweet! \ud83d\ude0a",
