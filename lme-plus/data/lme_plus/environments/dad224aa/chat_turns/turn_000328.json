  "content": "Fresh onions can be a great addition to your marinade, but you might want to approach with caution. Here's why:\n\n1. **Flavor overload**: Onions can be quite pungent, and using fresh onions in the marinade might overpower the other flavors. You want to balance the flavors, not overwhelm the dish.\n2. **Texture issues**: Fresh onions can become a bit slimy and unappetizing when marinated for too long. This might affect the overall texture of your fajitas.\n3. **Raw onion flavor**: Raw onions can retain a strong, pungent flavor that might not cook out completely during the grilling or saut\u00e9ing process. This could result in an unpleasantly strong onion flavor in your fajitas.\n\nInstead, consider the following options:\n\n1. **Use cooked onions**: Saut\u00e9 or caramelize the onions before adding them to the marinade. This will mellow out their flavor and texture, making them a great addition to your fajitas.\n2. **Use onion powder or flakes**: Dehydrated onions can add a nice, subtle onion flavor to your marinade without the texture and flavor issues associated with fresh onions.\n3. **Use a small amount of fresh onion**: If you still want to use fresh onions, mince them very finely and use a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons) in the marinade. This will help distribute the flavor without overpowering the dish.\n\nRemember, when working with onions, a little goes a long way. Start with a small amount and taste as you go, adjusting the seasoning to your liking.\n\nFor your fajitas, you can try using a combination of saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic in the marinade to add depth and flavor. This will help create a rich, savory flavor profile without overwhelming the dish.",
