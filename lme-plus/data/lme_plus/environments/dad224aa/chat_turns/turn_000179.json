  "content": "Sure, here are a few more studies that provide evidence on how technology use in classrooms can impact academic performance:\n\n1. A study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that students who used laptops in class had lower grades than those who did not use laptops. The authors suggested that the use of laptops in class may lead to a \"false sense of security\" that can negatively impact student learning.\n\n2. Another study published in the Journal of Computing in Higher Education found that technology use in the classroom can be distracting and can lead to lower levels of student engagement. The authors suggested that instructors should be aware of the potential negative effects of technology use in their classrooms.\n\n3. A meta-analysis conducted by researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found that students who used laptops in class had lower grades than those who did not. The authors noted that the use of laptops in class may lead to distractions and a lack of engagement, which can negatively impact student learning.\n\nThese studies suggest that technology use in classrooms can have a negative impact on academic performance. While technology can be a useful tool in the learning process, it is important to use it responsibly and in a way that enhances student learning, rather than detracts from it. Limiting technology usage can help ensure that students are fully engaged in their learning and are able to achieve their full potential.",
