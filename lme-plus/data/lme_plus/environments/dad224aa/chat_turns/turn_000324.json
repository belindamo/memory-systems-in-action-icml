  "content": "Marinating chicken can make all the difference in the flavor and tenderness of your dish. Here are some general tips for marinating chicken:\n\n1. **Acidity is key**: Acidic ingredients like citrus juice, vinegar, or yogurt help break down the proteins in the meat, making it more tender and flavorful. Common acidic ingredients include lemon juice, lime juice, apple cider vinegar, and plain yogurt.\n2. **Oil is essential**: As you've already discovered, oil helps to add flavor and moisture to the chicken. Olive oil, avocado oil, or grapeseed oil are all good choices. Just be sure to use a mild oil that won't overpower the other flavors in your marinade.\n3. **Keep it balanced**: A good marinade should have a balance of acidity, oil, and seasonings. Aim for a ratio of 1 part acid to 2 parts oil to 1 part seasonings.\n4. **Don't overdo it**: Marinating time can vary depending on the strength of the acid and the type of chicken you're using. As a general rule, marinate chicken breasts for 30 minutes to 2 hours, and chicken thighs for 2-4 hours. Over-marinating can lead to mushy or tough meat.\n5. **Refrigerate, don't leave at room temperature**: Always marinate chicken in the refrigerator, not at room temperature. This will prevent bacterial growth and foodborne illness.\n6. **Turn and massage**: Every 30 minutes or so, turn and massage the chicken to ensure even distribution of the marinade.\n7. **Don't cross-contaminate**: Always use a clean container and utensils when handling marinated chicken to prevent cross-contamination with other foods.\n8. **Consider the type of chicken**: Boneless, skinless chicken breasts tend to absorb marinades quickly, while chicken thighs and drumsticks may need more time.\n9. **Add aromatics**: Onions, garlic, and herbs like thyme, rosemary, or oregano can add depth and complexity to your marinade.\n10. **Taste and adjust**: Before cooking, taste the chicken and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n\nFor your chicken fajitas, you can stick with a simple marinade like:\n\n* 1/2 cup olive oil\n* 1/4 cup lime juice\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n\nFeel free to adjust the proportions and add your favorite spices or herbs to suit your taste. Enjoy your delicious chicken fajitas!",
