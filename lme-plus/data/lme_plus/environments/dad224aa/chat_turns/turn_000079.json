It's great that you've been doing that on weekends, and it's definitely worth experimenting with on weekdays as well.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that waking up naturally during the week might require some adjustments to your sleep schedule and daily routine. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n* If you want to wake up naturally, you'll need to make sure you're getting enough sleep. Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night. If you're aiming to wake up at 7:15 am, you might need to go to bed earlier, around 10:00 pm or 10:15 pm.\n* Waking up naturally can be tricky if you have a lot of responsibilities or commitments early in the morning. If you need to be at work or school by a certain time, you might need to set an alarm as a backup to ensure you wake up on time.\n* It's also important to establish a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. While it's okay to sleep in a bit later on weekends, try to maintain a consistent wake-up time within an hour or so of your weekday wake-up time. This will help regulate your body's internal clock and improve the quality of your sleep.\n\nIf you're willing to experiment, you could try setting your bedtime a bit earlier and see how your body responds. You might need to adjust your morning routine accordingly, but it could be worth it if you feel more rested and refreshed.\n\nLet's try an experiment: for the next two weekdays, try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier than usual and see if you can wake up naturally around 7:15 am. If you need to, you can set an alarm as a backup, but try to resist the urge to hit the snooze button.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you up for the challenge?",
