However, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before adding these supplements, especially if you're taking antibiotics:\n\n1. **Garlic:** Has antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties.\n2. **Echinacea:** May help boost immune system function and reduce severity of infections.\n3. **Selenium:** Antioxidant properties help reduce oxidative stress and support immune function.\n\nRemember, supplements should not replace medical treatment, but rather complement it.
