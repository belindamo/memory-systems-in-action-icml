Connect the positive terminal of the battery to one of the switch terminals.\n2. Connect the other switch terminal to the anode (positive leg) of the LED.\n3. Connect one end of the 220 ohm resistor to the cathode (negative leg) of the LED.\n4. Connect the other end of the resistor to the negative terminal of the battery.\n5. Use electrical tape to hold everything in place and prevent any shorts.\n6. Turn on the switch and you should see the LED light up.\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully built a simple flashlight using a battery, LED, resistor, and switch.",
