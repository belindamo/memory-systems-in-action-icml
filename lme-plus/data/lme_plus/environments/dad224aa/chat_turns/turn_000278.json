  "content": "Yes, I agree with you on this point! By addressing real-world issues, comic books can engage with new readers who may not have previously shown an interest in the medium. This is because the issues that affect our society today are relevant and important to people from different walks of life. People who might not have been interested in superheroes, fantasy and science fiction can be drawn into these stories because of the connection that they feel towards the characters and the issues addressed in the storylines.\n\nFurthermore, incorporating real-world issues into comics is not a new concept. As you mentioned, comics have always reflected the social and cultural context in which they were created. From the Golden Age to the present day, writers and artists have tackled some of the challenging subjects through their comics, such as patriotism, racism, war, nuclear threats, and others. Therefore, keeping up with this tradition by continuing to use comics to address real-world issues is a sensible and fitting trend that would keep the medium relevant to a wider audience.",
