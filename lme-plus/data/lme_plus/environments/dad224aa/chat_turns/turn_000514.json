Here are some tips to help you find a route that meets your preferences:\n\n1. Look for parks or green spaces: Downtown areas often have parks or green spaces that can provide a flat and shaded route for jogging. Check if there are any local parks, riverside paths, or bike trails nearby.\n2. Explore side streets and alleys: Downtown areas often have quieter side streets and alleys that can provide a more peaceful jogging experience. These routes might not be as scenic, but they can be a good option if you're looking for a flat and relatively traffic-free route.\n3. Check online route-finding tools: Websites like MapMyRun, Runkeeper, or Strava allow you to search for user-created routes in your area. You can filter by distance, elevation gain, and route type to find a route that suits your preferences.\n4. Ask locals or fellow joggers: Reach out to friends, coworkers, or fellow joggers who live in your area and ask for route recommendations. They might have some insider knowledge on the best routes to take.\n\nIn terms of finding a shaded route, you can look for routes that run along:\n\n* Tree-lined streets\n* Park or river borders\n* Bike paths or trails with canopy cover\n* Alleys or side streets with building shade\n\nFor a 30-minute jog, you can aim to start around 8:15-8:30 am, as I mentioned earlier. This should give you enough time to wake up, have a cup of coffee, and get ready to head out.\n\nRemember to stay hydrated, wear comfortable shoes, and enjoy your jog!",
