  "content": "What a great idea! Bell peppers can add a sweet, crunchy texture and a pop of color to your fajitas. Marinating them along with the chicken can help to:\n\n1. **Flavor the peppers**: The acidic and savory flavors in the marinade will infuse into the bell peppers, making them more flavorful and tender.\n2. **Tenderize the peppers**: The acid in the marinade will help break down the cell walls of the peppers, making them slightly softer and more palatable.\n3. **Create a cohesive flavor profile**: By marinating the chicken and bell peppers together, you'll create a harmonious flavor profile throughout the dish.\n\nHowever, keep in mind a few things:\n\n1. **Bell peppers are more delicate**: Bell peppers have a higher water content than chicken, so they might become too soft or mushy if marinated for too long. Limit the marinating time to 30 minutes to 1 hour for the peppers.\n2. **Use a gentle marinade**: Avoid using very acidic or strong-flavored marinades, as they might overpower the delicate flavor of the bell peppers. Stick to a balanced marinade with a mix of acid, oil, and seasonings.\n3. **Adjust cooking time**: Since the bell peppers will be marinated, they might cook more quickly than the chicken. Adjust the cooking time accordingly to ensure the peppers are tender but still crisp.\n\nTo incorporate bell peppers into your marinade, you can slice them into strips or chunks and add them to the marinade along with the chicken. Just be sure to adjust the marinade quantity and time according to the amount of peppers you're using.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful and colorful chicken fajitas with bell peppers!",
