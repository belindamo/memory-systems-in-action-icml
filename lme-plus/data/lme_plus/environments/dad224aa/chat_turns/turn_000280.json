However, I have to break it to you that your \"rare\" 1962 Peanuts comic strip signed by Charles Schulz might not be as authentic as you think.\n\nFirstly, Charles Schulz was known to be a prolific signer, and he often signed strips for fans. While a signed Peanuts strip can be valuable, it's not uncommon to find authenticated signed strips selling for a few hundred dollars, not $800.\n\nSecondly, eBay is a platform where anyone can list an item for sale, and it's not uncommon for sellers to misrepresent or exaggerate the authenticity or value of an item. Without proper authentication and documentation, it's difficult to verify the authenticity of your strip.\n\nThat being said, assuming your strip is genuine, here are some general tips on how to store and preserve your rare collectibles:\n\n1. **Handle with care**: Always handle your collectibles with clean, dry hands or gloves to prevent oils from your skin from damaging the item.\n2. **Store in a cool, dry place**: Avoid storing your collectibles in areas with high humidity, direct sunlight, or extreme temperatures. A cool, dry room with a stable temperature between 60-70\u00b0F (15-21\u00b0C) is ideal.\n3. **Use acid-free materials**: Store your collectibles in acid-free folders, boxes, or mats to prevent damage from acidic materials.\n4. **Avoid direct sunlight**: Direct sunlight can cause fading, discoloration, or damage to your collectibles. If you must display your item, use UV-filtering glass or acrylic to minimize damage.\n5. **Keep it away from pests**: Insects, rodents, and other pests can damage your collectibles. Store them in airtight containers or bags to prevent infestations.\n6. **Consider professional grading and encapsulation**: If you're unsure about the authenticity or condition of your collectible, consider hiring a professional grading service to verify and encapsulate your item.\n7. **Get it appraised**: Consult with a reputable appraiser or expert in the field to get your collectible appraised and learn more about its value and condition.\n8. **Keep records**: Document your collectible, including its provenance, condition, and any restoration or conservation work. Keep these records with the item to maintain its value and authenticity.\n\nFor your specific Peanuts strip, I recommend seeking out a reputable comic book dealer, appraiser, or the Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center to verify its authenticity and get a professional appraisal.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be cautious when buying collectibles online, and it's essential to do your due diligence to ensure you're getting a genuine item.",
