  "content": "I'm going to follow the treatment plan recommended by my dentist and healthcare provider to clear up the wisdom tooth infection and ear infection. I'll make sure to complete the full course of antibiotics and follow their guidance on managing pain and discomfort. Additionally, I'll maintain good oral hygiene practices to promote healing. Once the infection is under control, I'll consider adding supplements to help with fatigue and muscle weakness. I'll consult with my healthcare provider before adding any supplements, especially since I'm taking antibiotics. I'm interested in learning more about vitamin C, vitamin D, probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, and CoQ10, as they seem to have beneficial effects on energy production and immune system function.",
