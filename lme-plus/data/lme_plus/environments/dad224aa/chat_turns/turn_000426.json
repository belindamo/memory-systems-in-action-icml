However, I have to clarify that there are multiple films titled \"The Present\", so could you please provide more information about the film you watched at the Austin Film Festival? Was it a short film or a feature film? Was it a recent release or an older film? Any details you can provide will help me give you more accurate recommendations.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for comedy films with a similar tone or style, here are a few suggestions:\n\n* The Death of Stalin (2017) - a dark comedy that follows the power struggle that ensues after Stalin's death, featuring a talented ensemble cast.\n* The Square (2017) - a satirical comedy that follows the curator of a contemporary art museum in Stockholm, exploring the absurdities of modern art and society.\n* The Lobster (2015) - a dark romantic comedy set in a dystopian world where single people are turned into animals if they don't find a mate within 45 days.\n* The Big Sick (2017) - a romantic comedy based on the real-life story of a comedian who falls in love with a graduate student, but their relationship is put to the test when she falls into a coma.\n* The Trip (2010) - a comedy that follows two friends on a road trip through the English countryside, featuring hilarious impressions and witty banter.\n\nIf you provide more information about the film you watched, I can give you more tailored recommendations!",
