It's great to hear that you're enjoying it and seeing an improvement in your photography.\n\nCapturing great indoor portraits with natural light can be a bit challenging, but with some tips and techniques, you can achieve stunning results. Here are some tips to help you improve your indoor portrait photography with natural light:\n\n1. **Understand the direction of light**: Pay attention to the direction of the natural light in the room. Is it coming from the side, front, or back? This will help you position your subject and adjust your camera settings accordingly.\n2. **Use soft, indirect light**: Soft, indirect light is often more flattering than harsh direct light. Look for windows with sheer curtains or blinds that can diffuse the light. This will help reduce harsh shadows and create a more even, soft light on your subject's face.\n3. **Position your subject near a window**: Place your subject near a window, but not directly in front of it. This will help create a beautiful, soft light on their face. Experiment with different distances from the window to achieve the desired effect.\n4. **Time it right**: The golden hour (the hour just before sunset) is often the best time for indoor natural light portraits. The soft, warm light creates a beautiful ambiance and can add depth to your images.\n5. **Use reflectors**: If you have a reflector or a piece of white cardboard, use it to bounce light onto your subject's face or body. This can help fill in shadows and add depth to your image.\n6. **Experiment with angles**: Don't be afraid to experiment with different angles and perspectives. Shooting from slightly above or below your subject can add interest to your portraits.\n7. **Pay attention to white balance**: Indoor lighting can often have a warm or cool tone. Adjust your white balance accordingly to capture the most natural-looking skin tones.\n8. **Use a slower shutter speed**: A slower shutter speed (around 1/125s or slower) can help create a sense of movement and blur in the background, which can add depth to your image.\n9. **Keep it simple**: Avoid cluttered backgrounds and distracting elements. Use a simple, neutral background to focus attention on your subject.\n10. **Practice and experiment**: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with working with natural light indoors. Experiment with different techniques, and you'll soon develop your own style.\n\nI hope these tips help you improve your indoor portrait photography with natural light!
