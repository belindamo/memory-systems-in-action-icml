  "content": "LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are designed to operate at a specific voltage and current. If the voltage applied to an LED is too high, it can cause the LED to overheat and burn out.\n\nA resistor is used to limit the current that flows through the LED, which prevents it from burning out due to excessive current. The resistor acts as a current limiter and reduces the voltage across the LED to its required operating voltage.\n\nThe value of the resistor is determined by the forward voltage drop of the LED and the desired current through the LED. By using the appropriate resistor value, you can ensure that the LED operates within its safe operating limits and has a longer lifespan.\n\nIn summary, a resistor is necessary to limit the current that flows through an LED and to ensure that it operates within its safe operating limits.",
