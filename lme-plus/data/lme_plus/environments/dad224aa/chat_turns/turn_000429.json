The film \"The Present\" I watched was indeed a comedy feature film that won the Audience Award for Narrative Feature at the Austin Film Festival, but it's not the one directed by Farah Nabulsi. What I do remember is that the film had a really strong ensemble cast, and the Q&A session with them was hilarious. The film's tone was light-hearted and witty, with a lot of clever dialogue and relatable characters. Can you try to help me find something similar?",
