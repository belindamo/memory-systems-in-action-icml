It sounds like you're already doing some excellent morning habits to help you start your day positively.\n\nDrinking a glass of water is an excellent way to rehydrate after a night of sleep, and light stretching can help increase blood flow and energy levels. Reading the news for 15-20 minutes is also a great way to stay informed and mentally stimulated.\n\nTo build upon your existing routine, let's incorporate some relaxing activities into your bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. Here are a few ideas:\n\n* Try reading a book or magazine that's not too stimulating or exciting, such as a novel or a self-help book.\n* Listen to calming music or nature sounds, like rain or ocean waves, to create a soothing atmosphere.\n* Practice gentle stretches or yoga poses to relax your muscles and calm your mind.\n* Write in a journal to reflect on your day, gratitudes, or goals.\n* Enjoy a warm cup of herbal tea, such as chamomile or lavender, to promote relaxation.\n\nRemember, the key is to find activities that help you unwind and relax, so feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.\n\nNow, let's set some specific goals for the next few days:\n\n* For the next three weekdays, aim to go to bed at 10:45 pm and wake up at 7:15 am.\n* For this Saturday, aim to wake up at 7:45 am, and for Sunday, aim to wake up at 8:00 am.\n* Continue your morning routine, and try to incorporate one or two relaxing activities into your bedtime routine.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to give it a try?",
