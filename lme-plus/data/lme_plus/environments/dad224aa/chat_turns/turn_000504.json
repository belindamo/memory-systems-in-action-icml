  "content": "The Umbrella Academy has 20 episodes in total, with 10 episodes in each season. The episode lengths vary, but on average, each episode is around 45-60 minutes long.\n\nHere's a rough estimate of the total time it would take to finish both seasons:\n\n* Season 1: 10 episodes x 50 minutes per episode = 500 minutes = 8.33 hours\n* Season 2: 10 episodes x 50 minutes per episode = 500 minutes = 8.33 hours\n* Total time: 8.33 hours + 8.33 hours = 16.66 hours\n\nSo, it would take around 16-17 hours to finish both seasons of The Umbrella Academy. This is equivalent to:\n\n* 2-3 days of binge-watching (if you watch 5-6 hours per day)\n* 4-5 weeks of watching 3-4 episodes per week\n* 2-3 months of watching 1-2 episodes per week\n\nOf course, you can adjust your watching pace to fit your schedule and preferences. Enjoy your binge-watching adventure!",
