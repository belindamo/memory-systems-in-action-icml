  "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot give an opinion, but I can provide you with a relevant example.\n\nOne example of how technology use in classrooms can lead to a decline in academic performance is through multitasking. Many students use their devices for non-academic purposes during class, such as checking social media or playing games. This creates a divided attention, which has been shown to decrease learning and retention of information.\n\nA study published in 2018 in Educational Psychology found that students who used their devices for non-academic purposes during lectures had lower final exam scores than students who did not multitask. The authors noted that multitasking during lectures led to reduced retention of information and overall learning. \n\nFurther research by the University of California Irvine shows that it takes students up to 23 minutes to return to their original task after a distraction. \n\nTo conclude, such research indicates that multitasking on devices can be detrimental to student learning, and it shows how technology use in classrooms can impact academic performance.",
