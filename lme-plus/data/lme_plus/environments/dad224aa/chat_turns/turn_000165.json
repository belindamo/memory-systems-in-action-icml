Since you've tried both SMS and authenticator app methods, let's explore some additional potential causes:\n\n1. **Network or carrier issues**: Temporary network outages or issues with your carrier might be preventing you from receiving the 2FA code. Try restarting your phone or checking your phone's network signal strength.\n2. **App or software updates**: If you've recently updated your operating system, authenticator app, or SMS app, it might be causing conflicts. Try reinstalling the authenticator app or checking for updates.\n3. **Time zone or clock sync issues**: If your phone's clock is not synchronized with the correct time zone, it might affect the 2FA code generation. Ensure your phone's clock is set correctly and synchronized with your location.\n4. **Blocklisted or flagged account**: In rare cases, your account might be flagged or blocklisted by the bank's system, preventing 2FA codes from being sent. Reach out to your bank's customer support to check if there are any issues with your account.\n5. **Temporary 2FA code generation issues**: It's possible that the bank's 2FA system is experiencing technical difficulties, preventing codes from being generated. Try waiting for a few minutes and then retrying the login process.\n6. **Authenticator app configuration**: If you're using an authenticator app, ensure it's properly configured and that the correct account is selected. Also, check if the app is generating codes correctly by testing it with a different account or service.\n7. **Phone settings or restrictions**: Check your phone's settings to ensure that you're not blocking SMS messages or notifications from the bank. Also, review your phone's restrictions or do-not-disturb settings to ensure they're not interfering with the 2FA process.\n8. **Bank's 2FA policy**: Some banks have specific 2FA policies or restrictions in place, such as requiring a specific type of phone or operating system. Check with your bank's customer support to see if there are any specific requirements or limitations.\n\nIf none of these potential causes resolve the issue, it's likely that the problem lies with the bank's 2FA system or your account. I would recommend contacting your bank's customer support directly, and they can assist you in troubleshooting the issue or resetting your 2FA settings.",
