Washed-out or overly bright photos can be frustrating, but don't worry, we can troubleshoot this together.\n\nIt's unlikely that the lens itself is the main culprit, as a good lens should be able to capture a wide range of tones and details. However, it's possible that the lens might be contributing to the issue in some way. Let's consider a few factors:\n\n**Lens-related factors:**\n\n1. **Lens flare:** If you're shooting directly towards the light source, you might be getting lens flare, which can cause washed-out areas in your image. Try adjusting your angle or using a lens hood to minimize flare.\n2. **Lens contrast:** Some lenses are designed to produce high-contrast images, which can lead to lost details in the shadows or blown-out highlights. If you're using a lens with high contrast, you might need to adjust your exposure or use exposure bracketing to capture more detail.\n\nHowever, it's more likely that the issue is related to the lighting in your setup. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Lighting-related factors:**\n\n1. **Overpowering light:** If the natural light is too strong, it can cause your images to become overexposed and washed out. Try moving your subject away from the window or using a sheer curtain to diffuse the light.\n2. **Incorrect exposure:** Make sure you're not overexposing your images. Check your camera's histogram to ensure you're capturing the full range of tones. Adjust your exposure settings accordingly.\n3. **Insufficient shading:** If your subject is positioned near a window, but there's no shade or diffusion, the light can be too harsh, leading to washed-out areas. Consider using a reflector or a scrim to soften the light.\n4. **Mixed lighting:** If you have multiple light sources with different color temperatures (e.g., natural light and artificial light), it can cause unflattering, washed-out colors. Try to use a single light source or balance the lighting to achieve a more natural look.\n\nTo troubleshoot, try the following:\n\n1. Check your camera settings: Review your exposure settings, ISO, and white balance to ensure they're appropriate for the scene.\n2. Adjust your lighting: Experiment with different lighting setups, such as moving your subject away from the window or using a reflector to soften the light.\n3. Use exposure bracketing: Capture multiple shots at different exposures to merge later, which can help recover details in both shadows and highlights.\n4. Shoot in RAW: If you're not already doing so, shoot in RAW format, which gives you more flexibility when editing the image.\n\nIf you're still struggling, feel free to share some of your images, and I can provide more specific feedback and guidance!",
