  "content": "I'm actually building a few different models to see which one performs best. I've tried decision trees, random forests, and clustering, and I'm also experimenting with some neural networks. The data is transactional, so I have info on customer purchases, including what they bought, when, and how much they spent. I've had to deal with some missing values and outliers, but I've been using Python's Pandas and NumPy to clean and prep the data.\n\nVisualization is definitely on my radar, and I've been using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create some plots and heatmaps. I'm hoping to identify some customer segments and see if I can predict which ones are most likely to make repeat purchases. I'd also love to explore how different product categories affect customer behavior.\n\nSpeaking of which, I was wondering if you could recommend any resources on customer segmentation? I've read a bit about RFM analysis, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach for this project",
