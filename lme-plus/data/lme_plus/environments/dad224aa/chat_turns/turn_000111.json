I've been experiencing a lot of fatigue lately, and I'm hoping to find something that can give me more energy. I've also been dealing with a recurring ear infection, and I recently had a dentist appointment on March 22nd where they found a small wisdom tooth infection related to my ear infection. Do you think any of the supplements you mentioned could help with my ear infection as well?",
