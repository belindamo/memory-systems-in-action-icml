By the way, I remembered that last semester I worked on a group project for my Marketing Research class, where we had to conduct a comprehensive market analysis for a new product launch. It was a great experience, and I was responsible for leading the data analysis team. We spent countless hours collecting and analyzing data from online surveys, focus groups, and competitor research. We presented our findings to the class and received an A- grade, which was a huge accomplishment for me considering it was my first time leading a team.",
