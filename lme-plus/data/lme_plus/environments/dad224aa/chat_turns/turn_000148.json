Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Meal monitoring**: You can monitor Whiskers' eating habits, ensuring she's eating regularly and not overeating or undereating.\n2. **Hydration monitoring**: You can check if Whiskers is drinking enough water, which is essential for her health.\n3. **Reduced anxiety**: If Whiskers is prone to anxiety or stress, having a camera near her food and water bowls can help you identify any changes in her behavior.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Invasion of privacy**: Cats value their personal space, and placing a camera near their food and water bowls might make Whiskers feel uneasy or self-conscious.\n2. **Stress or anxiety**: If Whiskers is already anxious or stressed, having a camera watching her while she eats or drinks might exacerbate the issue.\n3. **Over-monitoring**: You might become too focused on monitoring Whiskers' every move, which could lead to unnecessary worry or stress for both you and your cat.\n\nConsider the following alternatives or compromises:\n\n1. **Place the camera nearby, but not directly above the bowls**: This way, you can still monitor Whiskers' activity in the area without making her feel like she's being watched while eating or drinking.\n2. **Use a camera with a wide-angle lens**: This can provide a broader view of the room, allowing you to monitor Whiskers' overall activity without focusing too much on her food and water bowls.\n3. **Position the camera to capture Whiskers' favorite spots**: If Whiskers has a favorite sleeping spot or play area, consider placing the camera there instead. This can give you a better understanding of her daily routine and habits.\n\nRemember to respect Whiskers' boundaries and adjust the camera's position based on her comfort level. You know your cat best, so trust your instincts and make adjustments as needed.",
