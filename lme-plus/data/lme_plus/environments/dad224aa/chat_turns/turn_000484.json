The product is a smart home security system, and Christine wants to understand how customers perceive the product's features, pricing, and overall value proposition.\n\nThe data she's collected includes customer feedback from various sources, such as:\n\n1. Online reviews from e-commerce websites and social media platforms.\n2. Customer surveys and feedback forms from the company's website and customer support channels.\n3. Social media conversations and mentions about the product.\n\nChristine wants to analyze this data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help the company improve the product and marketing strategies. She's interested in understanding the following aspects:\n\n1. Overall sentiment towards the product: Is it positive, negative, or neutral?\n2. Key drivers of sentiment: Are customers praising or criticizing specific features, such as the camera quality, motion detection, or mobile app functionality?\n3. Pain points and areas for improvement: What are the most common complaints or issues customers are facing?\n4. Competitive landscape: How does the product compare to competitors in terms of customer satisfaction and perceived value?\n\nBy analyzing customer opinions and attitudes, Christine hopes to provide actionable insights that can inform product development, marketing strategies, and customer support initiatives.\n\nNow that you know more about the project, you can help Christine set up a sentiment analysis visualization in Tableau that addresses these specific questions and objectives.",
