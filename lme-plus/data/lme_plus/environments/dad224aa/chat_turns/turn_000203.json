His martyrdom inspired marches and protests across the country and led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Similarly, Malcolm X\u2019s assassination in 1965 made him a symbol of radical resistance to white supremacy and inspired the growth of the Black Power Movement.\n\n2. Indian Independence Movement: Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s hunger strikes and nonviolent resistance tactics led to his imprisonment multiple times. When he was assassinated in 1948, it sparked widespread mourning and outrage. His martyrdom became a symbol of the power of nonviolent resistance and continues to inspire activists worldwide.\n\n3. Feminist Movement: The symbol of martyrdom has been used in the feminist movement to draw attention to the violence and oppression that women face. For instance, the \u201cTake Back the Night\u201d rallies that began in the 1970s were often held in memory of women who had been sexually assaulted or murdered. Furthermore, the #MeToo movement was started in response to the numerous women who had been harassed and abused by powerful men in the entertainment industry.\n\n4. LGBTQ+ Rights Movement: The AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s led to many LGBT activists becoming martyr figures, as they worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the disease and protest the government\u2019s lack of action. The United States\u2019 first National Coming Out Day, held on October 11, 1988, was created in honor of those who had come out and those who had died from AIDS. Additionally, the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, brought nationwide attention to hate crimes against LGBT people and inspired many to become activists.",
