Here are some tips to help you pick the perfect avocados:\n\n1. **Look for ripeness**: A ripe avocado will be slightly soft to the touch, but still firm enough to hold its shape. Avoid avocados that are too soft or mushy, as they may be overripe.\n2. **Check the color**: A ripe avocado will typically turn from a bright green to a more muted green or yellow-green color, depending on the variety. Some avocados may also develop a slight reddish or purplish tint.\n3. **Check the weight**: Ripe avocados are typically heavy for their size.\n4. **Squeeze gently**: Gently squeeze the avocado around the stem. A ripe avocado will yield to pressure, but should still feel slightly firm. If it's too soft, it's overripe.\n5. **Choose the right variety**: For guacamole, you want to use a variety that's high in fat, like Hass or Fuerte. These avocados have a creamy, buttery texture that's perfect for guacamole.\n6. **Avoid avocados with brown spots**: Brown spots or streaks on the avocado can indicate that it's overripe or damaged. Choose avocados with smooth, unblemished skin.\n\nWhen you're at the store, try to find avocados that are slightly underripe. They'll ripen at home, and you can speed up the process by placing them in a paper bag with an apple or banana. The ethylene gas produced by these fruits will help ripen the avocados.\n\nFor guacamole, you'll want to use 3-4 ripe avocados, depending on their size. Make sure to handle them gently to avoid bruising, and use them within a day or two of ripening.\n\nNow, go forth and create some amazing guacamole to accompany your fajitas!",
