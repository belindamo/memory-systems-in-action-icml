  "content": "I appreciate the tips on storing and preserving my collectibles. Speaking of my vintage 1985 Nike Air Jordan 1 sneakers, I actually sold them on StockX a month ago for $1,200. I had them stored in a box in my closet for years, and I finally decided to let them go. The buyer was from California, and I remember wrapping them carefully in bubble wrap and shipping them out on a Tuesday morning.",
