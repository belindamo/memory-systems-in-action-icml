Examine your entire body, including areas that are often exposed to the sun, such as your face, neck, arms, and legs.\n\n2. Use a mirror to examine hard-to-see areas, such as your back, scalp, and the backs of your legs.\n\n3. Look for any moles or growths that are new or have changed in size, shape, color, texture, or sensation.\n\n4. Pay attention to any moles or growths that bleed, itch, or are painful.\n\n5.
