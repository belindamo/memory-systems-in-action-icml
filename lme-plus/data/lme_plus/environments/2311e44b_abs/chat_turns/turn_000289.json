  "content": "If you have a family history of skin cancer and are at a higher risk of developing it, there are a few additional measures you can take to reduce your risk:\n\n1. Regular skin checks: Schedule regular appointments with a dermatologist to have your skin checked for any suspicious moles or growths.\n\n2. Early detection: If you notice any changes in your skin, such as new moles or changes in the shape or color of existing moles, get them checked out by a dermatologist as soon as possible. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes for skin cancer.\n\n3. Avoid tanning beds: Tanning beds use UV radiation just like the sun, so they can increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Avoiding tanning beds altogether can help reduce your risk.\n\n4. Protect your skin: In addition to wearing sunscreen, protect your skin by wearing protective clothing such as hats, long-sleeved shirts, and pants.\n\n5. Stay out of the sun during peak hours: Try to avoid prolonged sun exposure during peak hours (between 10am-4pm), when the sun's rays are the strongest.\n\nBy taking these measures, you can help reduce your risk of developing skin cancer and catch it early if it does occur.",
