I've been talking to my aunt, who's 55 and really financially savvy, and she's been giving me some great tips. I've also met some really cool people in their 40s and 50s in the painting class at the local community center, and they've shared some interesting perspectives on investing and saving for retirement. Do you have any specific resources or websites that can help me learn more about diversifying my investments?",
