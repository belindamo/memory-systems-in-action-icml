  "content": "While self-examinations can certainly be helpful in detecting early signs of skin cancer, they are not a substitute for seeing a dermatologist. Self-examinations are not a replacement for a thorough exam by a dermatologist, who has the expertise to identify subtle changes in the skin that may not be apparent to an untrained eye.\n\nAdditionally, a dermatologist can use specialized equipment and techniques to perform a more thorough exam of the skin, which can help detect skin cancers that may not be visible with the naked eye. For example, dermatologists may use a dermatoscope, a specialized handheld tool that magnifies skin lesions and allows for a closer examination.\n\nSkipping appointments with a dermatologist can potentially result in missed or delayed diagnosis of skin cancer. Early detection and treatment of skin cancer can be critical in achieving successful outcomes, so it is important to make the effort to see a dermatologist for a full skin examination at least once a year, or more frequently if recommended by your healthcare provider.",
