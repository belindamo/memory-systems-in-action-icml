  "content": "There are many wildlife species in San Fernando Valley that are affected by the seasonal changes in different ways. Some species include:\n\n1. Birds - Many migratory bird species travel through San Fernando Valley during the winter months to avoid harsher weather in other parts of the country. Other species, such as the Western Bluebird, are more active and visible during the spring and summer months when they are breeding.\n\n2. Reptiles - Many reptile species in the area, such as snakes and lizards, are more active during the summer months when the weather is warmer. They may also hibernate or be less active during the winter.\n\n3. Mammals - Some mammals, such as bats and ground squirrels, go into hibernation during the winter months when food is less abundant. Other species, such as coyotes and bobcats, may be more active during the cooler, wetter months of the year.\n\n4. Insects - Many insect species, such as bees and butterflies, are most active during the spring and summer months when flowers are in bloom and there is an abundance of nectar and pollen available.\n\nOverall, each species in San Fernando Valley has unique characteristics and needs that are impacted by the seasonal changes.",
