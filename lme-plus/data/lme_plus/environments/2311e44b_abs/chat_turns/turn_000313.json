Here's a brief rundown:\n\n1. **Wildberry Cafe**: They have a wide variety of options, including omelets, pancakes, waffles, and fresh fruit platters. They also offer a breakfast buffet on weekends, which includes a made-to-order omelet station.\n2. **The Breakfast Club**: They have a smaller selection compared to a hotel buffet, but they do offer omelets, pancakes, waffles, and sandwiches. They also have a fresh fruit cup option, but it's not a full platter like what you might find at a hotel buffet.\n3. **Yolk**: They have a wide variety of omelets, pancakes, waffles, and sandwiches, as well as a fresh fruit cup option. They also offer a breakfast buffet on weekdays, which includes a made-to-order omelet station.\n4. **Lou Mitchell's**: They have a vast menu with many options, including omelets, pancakes, waffles, and fresh fruit platters. They're known for their signature omelets, so you might find something similar to what you had at the Marriott Hotel.\n\nIf you're looking for a similar selection to a hotel buffet, Wildberry Cafe or Lou Mitchell's might be your best bet. However, keep in mind that they might not have the exact same options as the Marriott Hotel's buffet.\n\nIf you're craving something specific, like a signature omelette or fresh fruit platter, you could always ask your server or the chef at one of these breakfast spots if they can accommodate your request. They might be happy to whip something up for you!\n\nI hope that helps, and enjoy your breakfast adventures in Chicago!",
