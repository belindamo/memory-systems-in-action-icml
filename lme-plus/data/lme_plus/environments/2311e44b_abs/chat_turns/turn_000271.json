  "content": "I do not have access to current decision-making processes regarding the world athletics championships. however, historically, the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) was responsible for selecting the host cities for the world athletics championships.\n\nthe iaaf would typically solicit bids from interested cities or countries, and a bidding process would take place. it would involve submitting formal proposals that included details on the proposed venues, accommodation options, transportation infrastructure, security plans, and economic benefits for hosting the event.\n\na bid evaluation committee would then review the submitted proposals and assess the suitability of the proposed venues and infrastructure. the committee would also consider factors such as the financial and logistical feasibility of hosting the event, the capacity of the proposed venues to accommodate audiences, the local cultural context, and the potential to generate revenue from the event.\n\nfinally, the iaaf council would vote and select the host city based on the recommendations of the bid evaluation committee. the selection process typically takes place four to six years before the event, allowing the host city time to prepare and build the required infrastructure.",
