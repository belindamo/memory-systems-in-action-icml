  "content": "Having a left-handed batsman in the top 6 of the batting order can be beneficial as it can create problems for the opposing team's bowlers, as they are not used to bowling to a left-handed batsman. One option would be to include a left-handed batsman in the top 6, such as Shikhar Dhawan, who is a left-handed opening batsman, and has a good experience in the Indian cricket team.\nAnother option would be to include a left-handed all-rounder like Washington Sundar, who can provide stability in the middle order and can also bowl some overs and help in the balance of the team.\nIt is ultimately up to the team management and the selectors to decide, but including a left-handed batsman in the top 6 can be beneficial.",
