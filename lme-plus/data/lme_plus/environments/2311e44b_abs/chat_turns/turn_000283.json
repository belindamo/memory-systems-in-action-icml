  "content": "Yes, one example of a project that was funded by the NEA's Our Town Program is the \"Pulitzer Remix\" project, which took place in 2014. \n\nThe project was organized by the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities and involved 85 Washington D.C.-based poets who each selected a Pulitzer Prize-winning poem and created a new poem in response. \n\nUsing local venues such as galleries, bookstores, parks, and libraries, the poets then performed their responses in public spaces around the city. The response poems were also compiled into a book, which was distributed for free throughout the community.\n\nThe NEA's Our Town Program provided a grant of $100,000 to support the project, which aimed to foster civic engagement and appreciation for poetry while highlighting the voices and concerns of Washington D.C.'s diverse residents.\n\nOverall, the \"Pulitzer Remix\" project was successful in bringing residents together through the arts while showcasing the city's creativity and diversity. It is just one example of the types of innovative community-based projects that the NEA's Our Town Program seeks to support.",
