  "content": "To monitor a JMX port in a Docker infrastructure with Zabbix Proxy, you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new Zabbix proxy container and make sure it can communicate with the Zabbix server.\n2. Install the Zabbix Java Gateway on the same host as the Zabbix proxy container.\n3. Update the Zabbix proxy configuration file to include the location of the Zabbix Java Gateway and the JMX port to be monitored.\n4. Configure the Zabbix server to use the Zabbix proxy for monitoring the JMX port.\n5. Create a new JMX template on the Zabbix server and link it to the host being monitored.\n6. Add the necessary JMX items to the template and configure the triggers as needed.\n7. Restart the Zabbix proxy container and verify that data is being collected from the JMX port.\n\nIt's a good idea to also test the communication between Zabbix server and Zabbix proxy, and also test the connection from Zabbix Java Gateway to the target JMX port before starting the monitoring.",
