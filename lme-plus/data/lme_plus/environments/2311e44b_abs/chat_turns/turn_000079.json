Here are some tips and recommendations for image editing software and techniques to help you get the most out of your metal prints:\n\n**Software:**\n\n1. **Lightroom:** You're already using Lightroom, which is an excellent choice for editing your landscape shots. Its non-destructive editing approach and powerful tools make it ideal for enhancing your images.\n2. **Photoshop:** You're also using Photoshop, which is a great tool for fine-tuning your images and making local adjustments.\n\n**Techniques:**\n\n1. **Color Grading:** Metal prints can accentuate colors, so it's essential to get your color grading right. Use the Color Grading tool in Lightroom or the Gradient Map in Photoshop to create a balanced and natural-looking color palette.\n2. **Contrast and Exposure:** Metal prints can make contrasty images look even more dramatic. Adjust your contrast and exposure settings to create a balanced look, but don't be afraid to add a bit of punch to make your image pop.\n3. **Sharpening:** Metal prints can reveal even the slightest softness, so make sure to sharpen your image carefully. Use the Detail panel in Lightroom or the Unsharp Mask in Photoshop to add subtle sharpening.\n4. **Noise Reduction:** If you've shot in low light or used a high ISO, you may need to reduce noise in your image. Use the Noise Reduction tool in Lightroom or the Noise Reduction filter in Photoshop to minimize noise without sacrificing detail.\n5. **Local Adjustments:** Metal prints can accentuate local contrast, so make sure to use local adjustment tools like the Adjustment Brush in Lightroom or the Spot Healing Brush in Photoshop to fine-tune your image.\n\n**Specific Settings for Metal Prints:**\n\n1. **Color Space:** Use the Adobe RGB (1998) color space, which is the recommended color space for metal prints.\n2. **Bit Depth:** Save your files in 16-bit or 8-bit mode, as metal prints can handle the increased color depth.\n3. **Resolution:** Ensure your image is at a high enough resolution for the print size you're ordering. A minimum of 300 dpi is recommended.\n4. **File Format:** Save your files as TIFF or PSD, as these formats are compatible with Mpix's metal print process.\n\n**Plugins and Presets:**\n\n1. **Nik Collection:** The Nik Collection is a suite of plugins that can help you enhance your landscape shots. The Color Efex Pro and Viveza plugins are particularly useful for adding depth and contrast to your images.\n2. **Luminar:** Luminar is a plugin that offers a range of tools for editing your images, including filters and presets specifically designed for landscape photography.\n3. **Presets:** You can also use presets in Lightroom or Photoshop to give your images a consistent look. There are many free and paid presets available online, or you can create your own custom presets.\n\nBy following these tips and techniques, you'll be well on your way to creating stunning metal prints that showcase your landscape photography skills.",
