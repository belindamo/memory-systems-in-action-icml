It's great that you enjoyed the Facebook Live discussion with the popular book blogger - online book communities can be such a wonderful way to connect with fellow readers and discover new titles.\n\nI think \"The Royal We\" is a fantastic choice for a lighthearted, engaging read. The authors' witty banter and relatable characters will likely make for a delightful reading experience. Let me know what you think of it once you've started!\n\nBy the way, if you don't mind me asking, what was the Facebook Live discussion like? Was it a Q&A session, or did you discuss specific themes and plot points from \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\"? I'm curious!",
