Hardik Pandya (Right-handed all-rounder)\n6. KL Rahul (Right-handed middle order batsman)\n7. Ravindra Jadeja (Left-handed all-rounder)\n8. Mohammed Shami (Right-arm fast bowler)\n9. Jasprit Bumrah (Right-arm fast bowler)\n10. Kuldeep Yadav (Left-arm Chinaman bowler)\n11. T Natarajan (Left-arm fast bowler)\n\nI've made the required adjustments to the team. Shubman Gill is a very promising young opener, he could be a good replacement for KL Rahul as an opener. KL Rahul can play in the middle order and be the best option to balance the team. Left-handed batsman Suryakumar Yadav can also be considered as a replacement for Kedar Jadhav in the middle order. Kuldeep Yadav and T Natarajan are both left-arm bowlers and can provide variety in the bowling attack. With this team, the team will have a good balance of right and left handed batsmen, and good variety in the bowling attack, with both pace and spin options.",
