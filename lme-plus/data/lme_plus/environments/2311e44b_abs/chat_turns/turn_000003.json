  "content": "To configure the Zabbix proxy to communicate with the Zabbix Java Gateway (ZJG), you will need to do the following:\n\n1. Update the Zabbix proxy configuration file (zabbix\\_proxy.conf) to include the location of the ZJG. This is typically done by adding the following line:\n```\nJavaGateway=<IP or hostname of the ZJG host>\n```\n2. Configure the number of Java pollers to start. This can be done by adding the following line:\n```\nStartJavaPollers=<number of pollers>\n```\n3. Update the Zabbix proxy configuration file to include the JMX port to be monitored. This can be done by adding the following line:\n```\nJavaGatewayPort=<JMX port number>\n```\n4. Restart the Zabbix proxy for the changes to take effect.\n\nIt's also important to verify that the Zabbix proxy and ZJG can communicate with each other. This can be done by using the `telnet` or `nc` command to test the connection between the Zabbix proxy and ZJG.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that if you are running the Zabbix proxy and Zabbix Java Gateway in different containers, you need to make sure that they are in the same network or have a proper routing between them, so they can communicate.",
