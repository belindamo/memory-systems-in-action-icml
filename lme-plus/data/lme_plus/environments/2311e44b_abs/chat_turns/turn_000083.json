Here are some tips to help revive your peace lily:\n\n1. **Stop fertilizing for now**: Give your peace lily a break from fertilizers for a while. This will allow the plant to recover from any potential fertilizer burn.\n2. **Check the soil moisture**: Make sure the soil isn't waterlogged, as this can exacerbate the problem. Stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle, and if the soil feels dry, it's time to water. If it's already moist, wait a few days before watering again.\n3. **Flush the soil**: Water your peace lily thoroughly to help leach out any excess fertilizer salts. Water the plant until you see water draining out of the pot's drainage holes. Repeat this process a few times to ensure the soil is flushed clean.\n4. **Provide good air circulation**: Peace lilies prefer well-circulating air to prevent fungal diseases that can develop in humid environments. Move your plant to a spot with good air circulation, or consider using a fan to improve air movement.\n5. **Prune damaged leaves**: Remove any yellow or droopy leaves to prevent the spread of disease and encourage new growth. Cut the leaves off at the base, making a clean cut with a pair of scissors or pruning shears.\n6. **Monitor temperature and humidity**: Peace lilies prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 27\u00b0C) and moderate humidity. If your home is particularly dry, consider using a humidifier to maintain a humid environment.\n7. **Repot (optional)**: If you suspect the soil is heavily contaminated with fertilizer salts, consider repotting your peace lily in fresh, well-draining potting soil.\n\nRegarding Felix, your fiddle leaf fig, it's great that you have a regular watering schedule! Fiddle leaf figs prefer consistent moisture, but make sure not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot. Check the soil moisture before watering, and adjust your schedule according to the season. In the winter months, you may need to water less frequently.\n\nRemember, every plant is different, so keep an eye on your peace lily's response to these tips. If you notice any further decline or no improvement, consider consulting with a local nursery or gardening expert for more personalized guidance.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy planting!",
