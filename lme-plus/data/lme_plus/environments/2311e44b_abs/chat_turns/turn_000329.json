  "content": "Sure, here is an updated version of the paragraph that includes Metamask:\n\nThe development of a reliable and secure electronic health record (EHR) management system is crucial to ensure efficient healthcare delivery. In this context, an approach involving the use of Solidity, Ethereum, web3, IPFS, React.js, Next.js, and Metamask has been proposed. This methodology entails designing the user interface with React.js and Next.js, writing smart contracts using Solidity to govern the EHR system's behavior, and deploying these contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and immutability. To protect patient privacy and security, the EHR data is stored on IPFS, a decentralized storage platform. To enable seamless interaction between the user interface and smart contracts, web3 is utilized along with Metamask, a browser extension that allows users to interact with Ethereum dApps securely. This approach offers a secure and decentralized EHR management system, prioritizing the privacy and security of patient data, which is essential for the effective delivery of healthcare services.",
