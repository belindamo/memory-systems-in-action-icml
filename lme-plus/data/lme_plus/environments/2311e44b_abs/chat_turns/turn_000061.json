For example, the song \"96,000\" combines hip-hop, salsa, and R&B elements to create an infectious, energetic number that showcases the community's diversity.\n\n**Eclecticism and Authenticity:**\n\nThe eclecticism of the score is not just about showcasing different styles; it's also about capturing the authenticity of the community.
