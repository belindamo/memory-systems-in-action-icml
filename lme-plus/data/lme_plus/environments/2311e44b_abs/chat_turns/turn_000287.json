  "content": "Exposure to excessive UV radiation is linked to skin cancer because UV radiation damages the DNA in skin cells, which can lead to the development of cancerous cells. UV radiation causes mutations in the DNA, which can result in the uncontrolled growth of skin cells, leading to the development of skin cancer over time.\n\nThe use of sunscreen alone cannot fully protect against skin cancer, as it only provides partial protection from UV radiation. Sunscreen can reduce the amount of UV radiation that reaches the skin, but it cannot completely prevent it. Therefore, it's important to take multiple preventative measures and avoid overexposure to UV radiation from different sources, including the sun and tanning beds. Protective clothing, such as hats and long-sleeved shirts, should also be worn in addition to sunscreen.",
