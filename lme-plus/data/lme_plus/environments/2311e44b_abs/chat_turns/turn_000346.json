  "content": "I think I'll start by setting up a work area with a sturdy table and a pottery wheel. Then, I'll designate a zone for storing my clay, glazes, and tools. I'll also make sure to create a kiln and firing area, as well as a glaze and slip station. I'll try to position everything in a way that minimizes walking distances and maximizes workflow. And, of course, I'll make sure to have good lighting and ventilation throughout the studio. Thanks for the tips!",
