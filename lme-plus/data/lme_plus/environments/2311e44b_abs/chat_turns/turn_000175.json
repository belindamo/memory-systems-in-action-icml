Here's how:\n\n**Step 1: Select the entire data range**\n\n* Select the entire range of cells containing your data, including the headers (Date, Store, Total, Notes).\n\n**Step 2: Sort by Date**\n\n* Go to the \"Data\" menu in Google Sheets and select \"Sort range\" or use the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+S (Windows) or Command+Shift+S (Mac).\n* In the \"Sort range\" window, select \"Date\" as the column to sort by, and choose \"Oldest to newest\" (or \"A to Z\" since dates are in a format that can be sorted alphabetically).\n* Click \"Sort\" to apply the sort.\n\n**Your Organized Data**\n\nHere's how your data should look now:\n\n| Date | Store | Total | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023-01-05 | FarmFresh | -$?? | Cancelled subscription |\n| 2023-01-28 | FreshMarket | $?? |  |\n| 2023-02-15 | Costco | $120 | Bulk items, stocked up on non-perishables |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**Adding More Trips**\n\nNow that your data is organized, you can add more trips in the correct order. Just insert a new row above or below the existing rows, depending on the date of the trip.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* If you don't remember the exact total for a trip, you can leave the \"Total\" column blank or enter an estimate.\n* You can also add more columns to track additional information, such as the categories of items purchased or any coupons used.\n* Consider setting up a recurring reminder to update your spreadsheet regularly to keep track of your expenses.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",
