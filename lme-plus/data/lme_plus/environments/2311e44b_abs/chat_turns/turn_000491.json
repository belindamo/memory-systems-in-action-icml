This might be a more sustainable approach, especially if you have a busy schedule.\n\nAssuming you currently read 2.14 pages per day, 3-4 days a week (as you mentioned with \"Sapiens\"), let's calculate the number of days you'd need to dedicate to reading to reach your goal:\n\n15,200 pages \u00f7 2.14 pages/day \u2248 7,099 days (as calculated earlier)\nTo reach your goal within 154 days, you'd need to read:\n7,099 days \u00f7 154 days \u2248 46 days' worth of reading per day (initial calculation)\nSince you can't read 46 days' worth in one day, let's aim to increase the number of days you dedicate to reading. To make up for the remaining days, you could try to read:\n154 days - 46 days (initial goal) = 108 additional days\n\nYou could aim to add 2-3 more days of reading per week, which would give you a total of 5-6 days of reading per week. This might be more manageable and allow you to make steady progress towards your goal.\n\n**Option 2: Find ways to speed up your reading**\n\nIf you'd rather not increase the number of days you dedicate to reading, you could focus on improving your reading speed. Here are a few strategies to help you do so:\n\n1. **Improve your reading comprehension**: Focus on understanding the main ideas and key concepts instead of getting bogged down in details. This will help you move through texts more efficiently.\n2. **Practice active reading**: As you read, ask yourself questions, make connections to your own experiences, and summarize the main points in your own words. This will help you stay engaged and retain more information.\n3. **Use your commute or breaks**: Take advantage of small chunks of time to squeeze in some reading. Even 10-15 minutes of reading per day can add up.\n4. **Experiment with different formats**: Try audiobooks, e-books, or graphic novels, which might be more engaging and help you read faster.\n5. **Set a timer and challenge yourself**: Set a timer for a specific amount of time (e.g., 25 minutes) and challenge yourself to read a certain number of pages during that time. Take breaks, and then repeat the process.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you might be able to increase your daily reading speed to 3-4 pages per day, which would put you on track to reach your goal.\n\n**Hybrid approach**\n\nYou could also combine both options: increase the number of days you dedicate to reading and work on improving your reading speed. This might be the most effective way to reach your goal.\n\nWhich option resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas for reaching your goal?",
