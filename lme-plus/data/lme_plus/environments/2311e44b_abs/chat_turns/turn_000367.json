Here are some more suggestions for fun activities that are suitable for a large group of kids:\n\n1. **Nature Crafts**: Set up a craft station with natural materials like leaves, twigs, rocks, and feathers, and let the kids create their own nature-inspired crafts.\n2. **Campfire Cooking**: Let the kids help with campfire cooking, like making s'mores, campfire skillet meals, or even a campfire pizza! They'll love the process and the yummy results.\n3. **Outdoor Games**: Organize outdoor games like Capture the Flag, Flashlight Tag, or Glow-in-the-Dark Frisbee. You can also set up a badminton or cornhole game station.\n4. **Wildlife Exploration**: Take the kids on a nature walk or scavenger hunt to spot local wildlife, like birds, squirrels, or deer.\n5. **Campfire Science**: Host a campfire science session where you can make s'mores while learning about the science behind them (e.g., how heat affects marshmallows). You can also make DIY lava lamps using vegetable oil, water, and food coloring.\n6. **Kids' Olympics**: Organize a fun Olympics-style competition with events like a nature-themed obstacle course, a water balloon toss, or a camping-themed relay race.\n7. **Stargazing**: Set up a stargazing session at night, and let the kids identify constellations using a star chart or a phone app.\n8. **Campfire Karaoke**: Host a campfire karaoke session where kids can sing their favorite songs while roasting marshmallows or making s'mores.\n9. **Nature Journaling**: Provide each child with a nature journal and encourage them to record their observations, drawings, and writings about the natural world around them.\n10. **Group Challenges**: Plan group challenges like building a shelter using natural materials, creating a group mural using natural paints, or solving a nature-themed puzzle.\n\nRemember to tailor the activities to the age and interests of the kids in your group, and make sure to include some downtime for relaxation and free play.\n\nYour scavenger hunt and campfire story session ideas are already a great start! You could also consider having a \"camping awards\" ceremony at the end of the trip, where you recognize the kids' achievements and efforts during the trip.\n\nI hope these ideas help, and I'm sure the kids will have an absolute blast!",
