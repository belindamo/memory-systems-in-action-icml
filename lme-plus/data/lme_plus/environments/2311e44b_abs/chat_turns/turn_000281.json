  "content": "The amount of funding that the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) allocates to each initiative varies from year to year and is subject to the budget approved by Congress. However, the NEA has committed a significant portion of its budget to support underserved and diverse communities in the arts.\n\nFor example, in fiscal year 2021, the NEA allocated 36% of its grant-making funds to organizations serving rural and low-income areas, as well as to projects that promote racial and ethnic diversity and equity in the arts.\n\nIn addition, the NEA has specific programs and initiatives that prioritize underserved communities. For example, the NEA's Challenge America program awards grants of $10,000 to organizations that serve populations that are geographically isolated or economically disadvantaged.\n\nOverall, the NEA recognizes the importance of supporting underserved and diverse communities in the arts, and it strives to allocate a significant portion of its resources to these initiatives.",
