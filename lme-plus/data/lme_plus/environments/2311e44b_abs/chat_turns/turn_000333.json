  "content": "Certainly, here's another paragraph on the methodology:\n\nTo ensure the security and privacy of patient data, the proposed EHR management system uses advanced encryption techniques. The user's private key is used to sign transactions and interact with the smart contracts, while the data stored on IPFS is encrypted using a symmetric key that is derived from the user's password. This ensures that the data is accessible only to authorized parties and is protected from unauthorized access or manipulation. Moreover, to enable seamless sharing of patient data between healthcare providers, the EHR system uses a permissioned blockchain architecture, where only authorized parties can access and update the records. The permissioned architecture also allows for the establishment of a trust network between healthcare providers, enhancing collaboration and coordination in patient care.",
