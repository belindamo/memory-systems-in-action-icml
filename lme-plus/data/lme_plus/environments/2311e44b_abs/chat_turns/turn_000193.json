  "content": "If the drums sound good in the auditorium but are not coming through loud enough in the live stream or recording, the issue is likely related to the way you're capturing or sending the drum mix to the live stream or recording. Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Mix Balance: Check the balance of your overall mix, making sure that the drums are not getting buried by other instruments in the mix. Consider lowering the levels of other instruments or raising the level of the drums to help them come through more prominently in the live stream or recording.\n2. Individual Track Levels: Check the individual track levels for the drum channels, and make sure they are set to an appropriate level for the live stream or recording. If the levels are too low, consider raising them to help the drums come through more prominently.\n3. Bus Levels: Check the levels of the buses that are sending the drum mix to the live stream or recording. Make sure that the levels are set appropriately, and consider raising the level of the drum bus to help them come through more prominently.\n4. Compressor Settings: Consider adjusting the compressor settings on the drum channels or drum bus to help the drums come through more prominently in the mix. Be careful not to overdo it, as excessive compression can result in a squashed or unnatural sound.\n5. Audio Interface Settings: Make sure that your audio interface is set up correctly and that you're sending a full mix to your live stream or recording. If you're using a USB connection to record, check that the levels are set correctly and that you're recording at an appropriate resolution.\n6. Re-Amping: Consider re-amping the drum mix to help it come through more prominently in the live stream or recording. You can do this by sending the mix through a separate amplifier or speaker, and then capturing that sound with a microphone to use in your live stream or recording. This can help you achieve a more prominent drum sound in your mix.",
