Suryakumar Yadav is right handed batsman, my apologies for the error. T Natarajan is not available for the tournament, so I have replaced him with Shardul Thakur, who is a right-arm fast bowler and have a good experience in the Indian cricket team. This team will have a good balance of right and left handed batsmen, and good variety in the bowling attack, with both pace and spin options.",
