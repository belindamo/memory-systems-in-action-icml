      "content": "Taylor Jenkins Reid's other books are definitely worth exploring if you enjoyed \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" and are looking for more complex characters and relationships.\n\n\"Maybe in Another Life\" is a great example of Reid's ability to craft relatable, flawed characters and explore the consequences of choice and chance. The book follows Hannah Martin, who, on a night out, makes a split-second decision that alters the course of her life. The story then splits into two parallel narratives, exploring the different paths Hannah's life could take based on that one decision. It's a thought-provoking exploration of love, friendship, and the what-ifs of life.\n\n\"After I Do\" is another character-driven novel that delves into the complexities of relationships, particularly marriage. The story centers around Lauren and Ryan, a couple who, after a decade of marriage, decide to take a year-long break from each other. The book examines the ups and downs of their relationship, as well as their individual struggles and growth. It's a nuanced, emotional exploration of love, commitment, and personal identity.\n\nBoth books share similarities with \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" in their focus on character development, relationships, and the human experience. However, they each have their own unique tone and style. \"Maybe in Another Life\" has a more speculative, philosophical bent, while \"After I Do\" is a more introspective, emotional exploration of marriage and identity.\n\nIf you enjoyed the character-driven storytelling and complex relationships in \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\", you'll likely find \"Maybe in Another Life\" and \"After I Do\" to be compelling and thought-provoking reads."
