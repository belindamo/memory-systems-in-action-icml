      "content": "The amount of funding that the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) allocates to each initiative varies from year to year and is subject to the budget approved by Congress. However, the NEA has committed a significant portion of its budget to support underserved and diverse communities in the arts.\n\nFor example, in fiscal year 2021, the NEA allocated 36% of its grant-making funds to organizations serving rural and low-income areas, as well as to projects that promote racial and ethnic diversity and equity in the arts.\n\nIn addition, the NEA has specific programs and initiatives that prioritize underserved communities. For example, the NEA's Challenge America program awards grants of $10,000 to organizations that serve populations that are geographically isolated or economically disadvantaged.\n\nOverall, the NEA recognizes the importance of supporting underserved and diverse communities in the arts, and it strives to allocate a significant portion of its resources to these initiatives."

      "content": "Yes, one example of a project that was funded by the NEA's Our Town Program is the \"Pulitzer Remix\" project, which took place in 2014. \n\nThe project was organized by the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities and involved 85 Washington D.C.-based poets who each selected a Pulitzer Prize-winning poem and created a new poem in response. \n\nUsing local venues such as galleries, bookstores, parks, and libraries, the poets then performed their responses in public spaces around the city. The response poems were also compiled into a book, which was distributed for free throughout the community.\n\nThe NEA's Our Town Program provided a grant of $100,000 to support the project, which aimed to foster civic engagement and appreciation for poetry while highlighting the voices and concerns of Washington D.C.'s diverse residents.\n\nOverall, the \"Pulitzer Remix\" project was successful in bringing residents together through the arts while showcasing the city's creativity and diversity. It is just one example of the types of innovative community-based projects that the NEA's Our Town Program seeks to support."
