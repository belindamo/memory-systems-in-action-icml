      "content": "Come up with the best playing 11 for Indian cricket team for the cricket world cup going to be held in 2023 in India. It is the ODI format that is 50 overs format. Keep in mind that the pitches in India are generally conducive to spin bowling and are also typically high scoring grounds where a brisk start in the beginning of the innings is going to be crucial. Also keep in mind that the team needs to have a good balance of right handed and left handed batsman. Exclude Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Rishab Pant from the playing 11."

Hardik Pandya (Right-handed all-rounder)\n6. Kedar Jadhav (Right-handed middle order batsman)\n7. Ravindra Jadeja (Left-handed all-rounder)\n8. Mohammed Shami (Right-arm fast bowler)\n9. Jasprit Bumrah (Right-arm fast bowler)\n10. Yuzvendra Chahal (Right-arm leg-spinner)\n11. Navdeep Saini (Right-arm fast bowler)\n\nThe team is a balance of right and left handed batsmen and also has a good balance of all rounders, fast bowlers and spinners. The openers Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul are in good form and Virat Kohli is the best middle order batsman in the world. Shreyas Iyer and Kedar Jadhav provide the stability to the middle order. Hardik Pandya is a key all-rounder who can bat, bowl and field well. Ravindra Jadeja is a solid all-rounder and a key spin bowler. Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah and Navdeep Saini are a good pace attack, and Yuzvendra Chahal is a key spin bowler in the team."

We also do not have any left handed batsman in the top 6 which could be a disadvantage. KL Rahul will need to play in the middle order instead of opening the innings. Make the required adjustments please."

Mohammed Shami (Right-arm fast bowler)\n9. Jasprit Bumrah (Right-arm fast bowler)\n10. Kuldeep Yadav (Left-arm Chinaman bowler)\n11. T Natarajan (Left-arm fast bowler)\n\nI've made the required adjustments to the team. Shubman Gill is a very promising young opener, he could be a good replacement for KL Rahul as an opener. KL Rahul can play in the middle order and be the best option to balance the team. Left-handed batsman Suryakumar Yadav can also be considered as a replacement for Kedar Jadhav in the middle order. Kuldeep Yadav and T Natarajan are both left-arm bowlers and can provide variety in the bowling attack. With this team, the team will have a good balance of right and left handed batsmen, and good variety in the bowling attack, with both pace and spin options."

T Natarajan is not available for the tournament, so I have replaced him with Shardul Thakur, who is a right-arm fast bowler and have a good experience in the Indian cricket team. This team will have a good balance of right and left handed batsmen, and good variety in the bowling attack, with both pace and spin options."

      "content": "Having a left-handed batsman in the top 6 of the batting order can be beneficial as it can create problems for the opposing team's bowlers, as they are not used to bowling to a left-handed batsman. One option would be to include a left-handed batsman in the top 6, such as Shikhar Dhawan, who is a left-handed opening batsman, and has a good experience in the Indian cricket team.\nAnother option would be to include a left-handed all-rounder like Washington Sundar, who can provide stability in the middle order and can also bowl some overs and help in the balance of the team.\nIt is ultimately up to the team management and the selectors to decide, but including a left-handed batsman in the top 6 can be beneficial."
