      "content": "I do not have access to current decision-making processes regarding the world athletics championships. however, historically, the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) was responsible for selecting the host cities for the world athletics championships.\n\nthe iaaf would typically solicit bids from interested cities or countries, and a bidding process would take place. it would involve submitting formal proposals that included details on the proposed venues, accommodation options, transportation infrastructure, security plans, and economic benefits for hosting the event.\n\na bid evaluation committee would then review the submitted proposals and assess the suitability of the proposed venues and infrastructure. the committee would also consider factors such as the financial and logistical feasibility of hosting the event, the capacity of the proposed venues to accommodate audiences, the local cultural context, and the potential to generate revenue from the event.\n\nfinally, the iaaf council would vote and select the host city based on the recommendations of the bid evaluation committee. the selection process typically takes place four to six years before the event, allowing the host city time to prepare and build the required infrastructure."

      "content": "I can suggest some potential reasons why certain cities are repeatedly chosen to host the world athletics championships:\n\n1) infrastructure: certain cities have already built or invested in the required infrastructure to host an international sporting event. this includes having a stadium, transportation, and accommodation options that meet international standards;\n\n2) experience: some cities have a history of successfully hosting major international events and have the experience to handle the logistics of hosting such an event as the world athletics championships;\n\n3) location: cities in regions with a strong interest and investment in athletics, or that are geographically located in a favorable position for international travel, may have an advantage in being chosen to host the event;\n\n4) reputation: cities with a positive reputation for their hospitality, safety, and accessibility may be more appealing to the evaluators and decision-makers. \n\nit is essential to note that these are potential reasons, and various factors influence the decision-making process for choosing host cities for the world athletics championships. the process of selecting a host city can be complex and involve negotiation, incentives, and politics."
