Leninism emerged as a specific form of Marxism in Russia, which aimed to apply Marxist principles to the unique conditions of a largely agrarian and underdeveloped country.\n\nHowever, the application of Marxism and Leninism in different countries has resulted in various interpretations and adaptations of these ideologies. For example, Maoism, which emerged in China, is a variant of Marxism-Leninism that emphasizes the importance of revolutionary peasants and guerrilla warfare. Similarly, Hoxhaism, named after the Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, is a form of Stalinism that stresses the importance of self-reliance and isolation"

The famine was caused by a combination of factors, including forced collectivization, the Great Sparrow Campaign (which aimed to eradicate sparrows, seen as pests, leading to an increase in insect populations and crop damage), and the diversion of resources from agriculture to industry.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Mao encouraged a mass movement of Chinese citizens to root out \"counter-revolutionary\" elements within society. This led to the persecution, torture, and execution of millions of people, including intellectuals, artists, and other \"bourgeois\" elements. Violence was also carried out by Red Guards, groups of young people who were mobilized to enforce Mao's ideology and often carried out violent attacks on individuals and institutions perceived as counter-revolutionary.\n\nOverall, Maoist policies and actions resulted in the deaths of an estimated 40 to 70 million people in China."

They were also subjected to harsh interrogations and physical abuse, including beatings and electric shocks.\n\nDespite the torture and mistreatment, Mandela remained committed to his cause and emerged from prison as a symbol of resistance against the apartheid regime. After his release, he played a key role in negotiating an end to apartheid and became the first black president of South Africa in 1994."

Mandela was arrested in 1962 and charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964.\n\nOver time, international opinion shifted in favor of the ANC's struggle against apartheid, and Mandela was eventually released from prison in 1990. He became the first black president of South Africa in 1994, following the country's first democratic elections.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no record of the ANC removing Mandela from a \"terrorist list\" because such a list does not exist."
