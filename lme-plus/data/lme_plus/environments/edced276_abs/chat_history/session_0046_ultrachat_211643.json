      "content": "That's impressive! How did Maria Theresa finance all these infrastructural projects and reforms? Did she raise taxes for that purpose?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, Maria Theresa had to raise taxes to finance the various infrastructural projects and reforms that she initiated in Austria. However, she was careful to do so in a way that did not excessively burden the peasantry and other lower social classes. To this end, she abolished some feudal taxes that disproportionately affected the lower classes and replaced them with more equitable and efficient taxes. Additionally, she introduced administrative and financial reforms that improved the collection of taxes, reduced corruption, and increased revenue to the state. These measures, combined with her encouragement of trade and industry, helped to generate additional revenue for the government.\n\nMaria Theresa also resorted to other tactics to finance her reforms. For example, she mortgaged some of the state's assets, such as its silver mines and salt mines, to obtain loans. She also sought loans from foreign governments and international financial institutions. Additionally, she encouraged private investment in the economy through public-private partnerships that would contribute to economic development."
