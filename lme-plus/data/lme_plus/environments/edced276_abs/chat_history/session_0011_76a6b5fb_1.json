      "content": "A cross-country flight is a great opportunity to get some work done!\n\nYes, American Airlines has made significant progress in outfitting their aircraft with power outlets and USB ports. The availability of these amenities varies by aircraft type, but I can give you an idea of what you can expect on your New York to Los Angeles flight.\n\n**Power Outlets:**\n\n* Most American Airlines aircraft have power outlets in First Class and Business Class, but the availability in Economy Class is limited.\n* On some Boeing 777-200 and 787-8 aircraft, power outlets are available in all seats, including Economy Class.\n* However, on other aircraft, such as the Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A321T, power outlets are only available in First Class and Business Class.\n\n**USB Ports:**\n\n* USB ports are more widely available than power outlets on American Airlines flights.\n* Most aircraft, including the Boeing 737-800, Airbus A321T, and some Boeing 777-200, have USB ports in all seats, including Economy Class.\n* The USB ports are usually located on the seatback screen or on the armrest.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a seat with a power outlet or USB port, consider the following:\n\n* Choose a seat in First Class or Business Class, if possible.\n* Opt for a seat on a Boeing 777-200 or 787-8 aircraft, which are more likely to have power outlets in Economy Class.\n* Select a seat near the front of the Economy Class cabin, as these seats are more likely to have USB ports.\n\nKeep in mind that even if your seat doesn't have a power outlet, you can still use a portable power bank to keep your devices charged.\n\nGet ready to stay productive during your flight, and safe travels to LA!"

You should have a USB port available at your seat, so you can keep your devices charged.\n\nNow, about Wi-Fi...\n\nYes, American Airlines offers Wi-Fi on most of their flights, including domestic and international routes. They've partnered with Gogo Inflight Internet to provide internet access on their aircraft.\n\nHere are some details to help you stay connected during your flight:\n\n* **Availability:** Wi-Fi is available on most American Airlines flights, but it's not available on some short-haul flights or on certain aircraft types (like the Embraer ERJ-145).\n* **Cost:** The cost of Wi-Fi varies depending on the flight duration and your AAdvantage loyalty program status.
