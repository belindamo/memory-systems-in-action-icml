  "content": "Eternity refers to a state of existence that is timeless and unending. It is a concept that is often associated with God and the afterlife.\n\nWhen applied to Jesus, it refers to his eternal nature as the Son of God. According to Christian theology, Jesus is believed to be both fully human and fully divine, and his divinity means that he has always existed and will continue to exist for all eternity. This is reflected in the opening lines of the Gospel of John, which states, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\" (John 1:1).\n\nThis eternal nature of Jesus is also emphasized in his resurrection, which is seen as a victory over death and a testament to his divine nature. As the Apostle Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15:55-57, \"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n\nThus, the concept of eternity is central to Christian theology and is closely tied to the nature of Jesus as the Son of God.",
