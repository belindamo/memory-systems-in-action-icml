And using cashback apps like Ibotta and Fetch Rewards is a fantastic way to earn some extra money back on your purchases.\n\nHere are a few more ideas to consider to help you save even more:\n\n* **Plan your meals around what's on sale**: Check the weekly ads for your local stores and plan your meals around the items that are on sale. This can help you save even more money on the items you need.\n* **Use coupons strategically**: Make sure you're using your coupons on the items you need, and try to stack them with sales and cashback offers to maximize your savings.\n* **Buy in bulk**: If you have the storage space and the items won't go bad, consider buying in bulk to save money in the long run.\n* **Shop at discount stores**: Consider shopping at discount stores or Aldi for some items, as they can often be cheaper than traditional grocery stores.\n* **Use cashback apps for other purchases too**: Don't just use cashback apps for groceries - many of them offer cashback on other purchases like gas, restaurants, and online shopping too!\n* **Keep track of your savings**: Keep a running total of how much you're saving each week, and use that money to treat yourself or put it towards a bigger goal.\n\nRemember, saving money on groceries is all about making small changes to your habits and being intentional with your shopping. You're already doing a great job, and with a few more tweaks, you can save even more!",
