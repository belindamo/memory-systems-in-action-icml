Here are some pros and cons of each method:\n\n**Group Message (e.g., WhatsApp, GroupMe, or SMS):**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Quick and easy to send out to multiple people at once.\n* Encourages group conversation and discussion.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Can be overwhelming or spammy if you have a large group.\n* Some people might not receive or see the message.\n* Limited details can be shared, and it's harder to keep track of RSVPs.\n\n**Individual Texts:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* More personal and direct approach.\n* Allows for individualized conversations and questions.\n* Easier to keep track of RSVPs.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Time-consuming to send out multiple messages.\n* Can be repetitive and boring.\n\n**Facebook Event:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Easy to create and share event details, including date, time, location, and description.\n* Guests can RSVP and see who else is attending.\n* You can share updates, photos, and discussions leading up to the event.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Not everyone may be on Facebook or check their events regularly.\n* Can feel less personal than a direct message.\n\nHere's a suggestion:\n\n* Create a Facebook event for the game night, including all the necessary details.\n* Invite your close friends and acquaintances who are on Facebook.\n* For those who aren't on Facebook or prefer direct invites, send them individual texts or messages.\n* If you have a smaller group, a group message can work, but be mindful of the potential drawbacks.\n\nRemember to include essential details in your invitation, such as:\n\n* Date, time, and location\n* Brief description of the event (e.g., \"Game Night with friends\")\n* What to expect (e.g., types of games, snacks, drinks)\n* RSVP deadline or instructions\n* Any specific requests or reminders (e.g., bring a favorite game or snack to share)\n\nBy using a combination of these methods, you can ensure that everyone receives an invitation and has a clear understanding of the event details.",
