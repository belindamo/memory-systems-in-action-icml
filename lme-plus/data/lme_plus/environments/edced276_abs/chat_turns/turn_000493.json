I'm happy to help you with that.\n\nHaving a mix of acquaintances and close friends can be a great idea for a game night, as it can create a fun and dynamic atmosphere. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* A diverse group can bring different perspectives and playing styles to the games, making it more engaging and entertaining.\n* It's a great opportunity to catch up with acquaintances and strengthen those relationships.\n* Close friends can help to break the ice and make the acquaintances feel more comfortable.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* With a mix of groups, there might be some initial awkwardness or cliques forming.\n* You'll need to consider the different personalities and interests of the guests and make sure there's something for everyone.\n* Some guests might not know each other, which could lead to a slower start or some initial discomfort.\n\nTo make it work, you could consider a few things:\n\n* Keep the games light-hearted and easy to learn, so everyone can participate and have fun.\n* Plan some icebreaker activities or games that encourage mingling and socializing.\n* Make sure to introduce everyone to each other and facilitate conversations.\n* Consider having some snacks and drinks available to help people relax and socialize.\n\nAs for sticking to one group, it ultimately depends on your goals for the game night. If you want a more intimate setting with people you're close to, that's perfectly fine. However, if you're looking to expand your social circle and create a fun, eclectic atmosphere, a mix of acquaintances and close friends can be a great way to go.\n\nRegarding Rachel, it's great that you're thinking of reaching out to her! It's always wonderful to reconnect with old friends and catch up on each other's lives. Consider sending her an invitation to the game night, or plan a separate get-together just for the two of you.",
