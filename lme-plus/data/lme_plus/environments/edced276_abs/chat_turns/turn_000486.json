I'm also considering taking some good photos of the guitar and writing a detailed description to post on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. By the way, I've been meaning to get my piano tuned, which I haven't done in about 6 months. Do you have any recommendations for finding a reliable piano tuner in my area?",
