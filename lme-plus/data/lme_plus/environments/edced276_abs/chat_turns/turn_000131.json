However, I recommend checking reviews, prices, and availability on hotel websites or booking platforms like Expedia, Booking.com, or Hotels.com to find the best fit for your specific needs.\n\nIf you're looking for alternative accommodations, consider booking a serviced apartment or a boutique hotel in neighborhoods like Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, or West Hollywood. These areas offer a more local experience and are still accessible to the city center.\n\nSafe travels, and I hope you have a productive and comfortable stay in LA!",
