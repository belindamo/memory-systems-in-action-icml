  "content": "Nelson Mandela was a prominent anti-apartheid activist and politician in South Africa who was imprisoned for 27 years. During his imprisonment, Mandela was subjected to various forms of torture and mistreatment, including being forced to do hard labor, being placed in solitary confinement for long periods of time, and being denied access to medical treatment.\n\nMandela and his fellow prisoners were also subject to psychological torture, such as being denied access to newspapers, books, and radios, and being prohibited from speaking to each other for long periods of time. They were also subjected to harsh interrogations and physical abuse, including beatings and electric shocks.\n\nDespite the torture and mistreatment, Mandela remained committed to his cause and emerged from prison as a symbol of resistance against the apartheid regime. After his release, he played a key role in negotiating an end to apartheid and became the first black president of South Africa in 1994.",
