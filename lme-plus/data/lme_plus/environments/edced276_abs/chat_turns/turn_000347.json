However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about a particular exhibit at a specific museum on a specific date. But I can provide you with some general information and resources related to Impressionist art and Monet's \"Water Lilies\" series.\n\nThe Impressionist Masters exhibit might have been a traveling exhibit, and it's possible that it was not a permanent exhibit at the City Art Museum. If you could provide me with more information about the museum, such as its location, I might be able to help you find more information about the exhibit.\n\nThat being said, Monet's \"Water Lilies\" series is a famous and iconic collection of paintings that depict his garden pond at Giverny, which was full of water lilies. The series consists of approximately 250 paintings, created between 1916 and 1926.\n\nHere are some online resources that might be of interest to you:\n\n1. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History has an excellent section on Monet's \"Water Lilies\" series, including high-quality images and detailed descriptions of the paintings.\n2. The Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet in Paris has an impressive collection of Monet's works, including many from the \"Water Lilies\" series. Their website has a virtual tour of the museum and high-quality images of the paintings.\n3. The Google Arts & Culture platform has a virtual exhibit on Monet's \"Water Lilies\" series, featuring high-resolution images and interactive features.\n4. The Claude Monet Foundation in Giverny has a website that offers a virtual tour of Monet's garden and house, as well as information about his life and work.\n\nI hope these resources help you learn more about Monet's \"Water Lilies\" series and Impressionist art in general!",
