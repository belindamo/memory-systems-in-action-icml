The app should integrate the main e-commerce platforms available in the market (woocommerce, shopify, prestashop and so on) and retrieve all data related to orders, customers and products. The app is planed to have many features, but to start it will only focus on managing order status and update them in the website database, send automated emails, allow the user to print a sheet with all the order information, present statistics, print shipping labels, and some other.\n\nWith this knowledge, tell me which of the following tech stacks is more suited, which will be faster to develop and which will need more resources during development.
