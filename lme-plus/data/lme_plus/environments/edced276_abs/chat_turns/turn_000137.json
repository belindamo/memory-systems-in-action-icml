  "content": "This article, \"Punishment and Deterrence: Evidence from Drunk Driving\" was published in the American Economic Review in 2015. The authors use data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to study the effectiveness of punishment (specifically, fines and prison sentences) in deterring drunk driving. They find that increasing fines for drunk driving is a more effective deterrent than increasing prison sentences. They also find that the deterrent effect of fines is stronger for repeat offenders than for first-time offenders. Overall, the study suggests that harsher penalties for drunk driving can be an effective way to reduce the number of drunk driving incidents.",
