As I mentioned earlier, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal relationships or interactions, so I didn't have a conversation with Emily, and you didn't make plans with her to go on a hike.\n\nHowever, if you do have a friend named Emily and you've made plans to go on a hike together, it's best to bring it up with her separately, rather than mentioning it in the Facebook event. You can send her a personal message or give her a call to discuss the details of your hike plans. This will help you avoid confusing other guests who might not be aware of your personal plans with Emily.\n\nRemember to keep the Facebook event focused on the game night, and save personal conversations for individual messages or calls.",
