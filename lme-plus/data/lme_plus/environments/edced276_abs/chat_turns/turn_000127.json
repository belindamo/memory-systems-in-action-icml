The availability of these amenities varies by aircraft type, but I can give you an idea of what you can expect on your New York to Los Angeles flight.\n\n**Power Outlets:**\n\n* Most American Airlines aircraft have power outlets in First Class and Business Class, but the availability in Economy Class is limited.\n* On some Boeing 777-200 and 787-8 aircraft, power outlets are available in all seats, including Economy Class.\n* However, on other aircraft, such as the Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A321T, power outlets are only available in First Class and Business Class.\n\n**USB Ports:**\n\n* USB ports are more widely available than power outlets on American Airlines flights.\n* Most aircraft, including the Boeing 737-800, Airbus A321T, and some Boeing 777-200, have USB ports in all seats, including Economy Class.\n* The USB ports are usually located on the seatback screen or on the armrest.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a seat with a power outlet or USB port, consider the following:\n\n* Choose a seat in First Class or Business Class, if possible.\n* Opt for a seat on a Boeing 777-200 or 787-8 aircraft, which are more likely to have power outlets in Economy Class.\n* Select a seat near the front of the Economy Class cabin, as these seats are more likely to have USB ports.\n\nKeep in mind that even if your seat doesn't have a power outlet, you can still use a portable power bank to keep your devices charged.\n\nGet ready to stay productive during your flight, and safe travels to LA!",
