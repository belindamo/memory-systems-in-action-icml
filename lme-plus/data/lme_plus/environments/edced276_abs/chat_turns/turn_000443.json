It's indeed a must-visit attraction, especially during cherry blossom season (late March to early April). The garden is a peaceful oasis in the heart of Tokyo, with a mix of Japanese, French, and English landscaping.\n\n**About Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden:**\n\n* The garden covers an area of 58.3 hectares, making it one of the largest parks in Tokyo.\n* It features over 20,000 trees, including cherry blossoms, maple, and ginkgo trees.\n* The garden has several walking paths, picnic areas, and tranquil ponds.\n* There are also several teahouses and restaurants within the garden.\n\n**Getting to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden from Shinjuku Station:**\n\n1. From Shinjuku Station, take the South Exit () and walk straight onto Koshu Kaido Street () for about 10 minutes.\n2. Turn left onto Shinjuku Gyoen Street () and continue for another 5 minutes.\n3. The garden's main entrance will be on your right.\n\nAlternatively, you can take the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line from Shinjuku Station to Shinjuku-gyoenmae Station (), which is a 2-minute walk from the garden's main entrance.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* The garden is open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (entry until 4:00 PM).\n* Admission fees: \u00a5500 (\u2248 $4.50 USD) for adults, \u00a5250 (\u2248 $2.25 USD) for children.\n* During peak cherry blossom season, the garden can get very crowded. Try to visit early in the morning or later in the evening for a more peaceful experience.\n* There are food and drink vendors within the garden, but you can also bring your own picnic.\n\nIf you're interested in visiting other parks or gardens in Tokyo, I can recommend some alternatives.
