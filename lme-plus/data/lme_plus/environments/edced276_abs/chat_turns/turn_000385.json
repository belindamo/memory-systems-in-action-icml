  "content": "Maoist regime in China is responsible for a large number of deaths during its rule, particularly during the Great Leap Forward campaign (1958-1962) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).\n\nDuring the Great Leap Forward campaign, Maoist policies led to a massive famine that caused the deaths of an estimated 15 to 45 million people. The famine was caused by a combination of factors, including forced collectivization, the Great Sparrow Campaign (which aimed to eradicate sparrows, seen as pests, leading to an increase in insect populations and crop damage), and the diversion of resources from agriculture to industry.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Mao encouraged a mass movement of Chinese citizens to root out \"counter-revolutionary\" elements within society. This led to the persecution, torture, and execution of millions of people, including intellectuals, artists, and other \"bourgeois\" elements. Violence was also carried out by Red Guards, groups of young people who were mobilized to enforce Mao's ideology and often carried out violent attacks on individuals and institutions perceived as counter-revolutionary.\n\nOverall, Maoist policies and actions resulted in the deaths of an estimated 40 to 70 million people in China.",
