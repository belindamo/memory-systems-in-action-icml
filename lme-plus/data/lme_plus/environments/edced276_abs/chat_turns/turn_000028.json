I don't have any other commitments outside of the play, so my schedule is pretty flexible. As for rehearsals, we have them three times a week, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. Next week, we'll have dress rehearsals on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Performances are scheduled for the following Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.",
