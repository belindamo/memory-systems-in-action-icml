It's exciting to see how your ideas are taking shape.\n\nNow, regarding your question, I'd recommend focusing on developing the alien species further before diving into world-building. Here's why:\n\n1. ** Species-centric story**: Since your alien species is a central aspect of your narrative, it's essential to flesh out their characteristics, culture, and society. This will help you understand how they interact with their environment and each other, which will, in turn, inform your world-building.\n2. **Consistency and coherence**: By developing your alien species further, you'll ensure that their biology, behavior, and culture are consistent and coherent. This will help you avoid contradictions and inconsistencies that might arise if you start building the world without a clear understanding of its inhabitants.\n3. **World-building foundation**: Your alien species will ultimately shape the world they inhabit. By understanding their needs, desires, and limitations, you'll be able to create a world that is tailored to their unique characteristics. This will make your world-building more intentional and immersive.\n\nSome questions to consider when developing your alien species further:\n\n* How do their shape-shifting abilities impact their daily lives, social structures, and technology?\n* What are the limitations and drawbacks of their distributed brain and flexible bodies?\n* How do they perceive and interact with their environment, and what kind of relationships do they form with other species?\n* What kind of culture, art, and entertainment do they develop, given their unique biology and abilities?\n* How do they resolve conflicts, make decisions, and govern themselves?\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of your alien species, you can start building their world. You can ask yourself questions like:\n\n* What kind of planet or environment would support their unique biology and abilities?\n* How do they adapt to different environments, and what kind of technologies do they develop to aid in this process?\n* What kind of ecosystems and other species exist on their planet, and how do they interact with them?\n* What kind of history and mythology do they have, and how does it shape their society and culture?\n\nBy focusing on your alien species first, you'll create a solid foundation for your world-building. This will allow you to build a rich, immersive, and believable environment that is tailored to your unique and fascinating alien species.\n\nKeep writing, and have fun exploring the depths of your alien species!",
