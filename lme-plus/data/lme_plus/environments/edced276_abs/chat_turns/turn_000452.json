Please review the following and let me know if you understand the system.\n\nWeapon System\nIn our game, the weapon system allows players to arm themselves with a variety of tools for combat. These weapons each have their own unique move sets and abilities, which the player can use to attack enemies and defend themselves. As the player progresses through the game, they will unlock new weapons to add to their arsenal. In addition, players can enhance their weapons by socketing Manacite into them, giving them additional skills and passive effects. This allows players to adapt to different combat situations and use different Mana types in their attacks strategically.\n\nWeapon Types\nWeapon Unlock Method\nDaggers Tutorial\nSword & Shield Tutorial\nBows Tutorial\nSpears Tutorial\nManaball Tutorial\nTwinblades Story Progression\nFists Story Progression\nFlails Story Progression\nGunbrella Story Progression\nManamasher Story Progression\nWeapon Mechanics\nTo attack with their weapons, players press the primary attack key, which triggers a seamless animation of the weapon's move set. The player can also use a modifier key to modify an attack in progress, depending on the Manacite socketed into the weapon. To switch between different Mana types, players use the scroll key to cycle through their available options. This allows players to adapt to different combat situations and use their weapons in a variety of ways.\n\nWhen a player attacks with their weapon, they charge the Manacite bar associated with the Mana type they are currently using. For example, if a player is using a weapon with Blue Mana, attacking with that weapon will charge the Blue Manacite bar. If the player is using Neutral Mana, attacking with the weapon will charge all Manacite bars equally. When the Manacite bar is fully charged, the player can use the Modifier key to activate the most fully charged Manacite ability. The abilities are arranged on the bar in the same order they were socketed, and the player can activate them by pressing the Modifier key. This allows players to strategically use their Manacite abilities in combat to gain an advantage over their enemies.\n\nManacite\nManacite are consumable items that can be socketed into weapons to give them additional skills or passive effects, up to a maximum of 5. When socketed into a weapon, Manacite allows the weapon to make attacks in the Neutral Mana type and the Mana types of the Manacite socketed. For example, if a weapon has 2 Green and 3 Blue Manacite socketed, that weapon will be able to make attacks in Neutral, Green, and Blue mana types. To change Mana types, the player scrolls to cycle through their available types. Using the same example, if the player has their weapon set to Blue mana, they will have access to the Blue bonuses provided by the (3) blue Manacite. To use the (2) Green bonuses socketed, the player must cycle the weapon to the Green Mana type. Cycling Mana types on a weapon is intended to be completed both in-combat and out-of-combat as the player adapts to the situation.\n\nNPC Types\nNPC\nInnkeeper\nBlacksmith\nRanger\nFisher\nArtificer\nSummary\nOverall, the weapon system in the game offers players a range of options for combat, allowing them to tailor their playstyle and strategy to the situation at hand. The ability to unlock new weapons and enhance them with Manacite allows players to adapt and evolve their strategy as they progress through the game.",
