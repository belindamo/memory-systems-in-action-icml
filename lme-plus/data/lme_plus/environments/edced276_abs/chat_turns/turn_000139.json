However, in general, Figure 1 in an article is often used to present the main results or findings of the study. It is likely that Figure 1 in this article would present the relationship between the punishment (such as fines or prison sentences) and the number of drunk driving incidents. It could also show the relationship between the punishment and the number of repeat offenders, as well as the relationship between the punishment and the number of first-time offenders. The figure would be used to help the authors to demonstrate the effectiveness of punishment as a deterrent for drunk driving and to make their results more concrete.",
