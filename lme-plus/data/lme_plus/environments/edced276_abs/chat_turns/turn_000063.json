  "content": "Ellington's use of unconventional instruments allowed him to create a wide range of moods in his music. For instance, the bass clarinet adds a rich and dark sonority to the music, which can create a moody and introspective feel. The use of the French horn can create a sense of grandeur and drama, while the oboe can add a lyrical quality, particularly in ballads or slower pieces. Ellington often used these unconventional instruments in combination with more traditional jazz instruments, such as the piano, bass, and drums, which provided a foundation for the overall sound of his compositions. Ultimately, Ellington's use of unconventional instruments allowed him to create a unique and innovative sound that set him apart from his contemporaries and helped to define the sound of jazz during his time.",
