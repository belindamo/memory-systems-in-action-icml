  "content": "I am assuming that the interpretation table is stored in a 2D list where each row corresponds to a house and each column corresponds to a figure, and the intersection of a row and column gives the interpretation for that combination.\n\nHere is an example code in Python that takes the house number and figure number as input and returns the interpretation:\n```python\ninterpretation_table = [\n    [\"Stability, foundation, security\", \"Struggle, conflict, competition\", \"Birth, new beginnings, creativity\", \"Transformation, change, movement\"],\n    [\"Union, partnership, harmony\", \"Intelligence, communication, adaptability\", \"Love, beauty, pleasure\", \"Mystery, hidden things, secrets\"],\n    [\"Fertility, growth, abundance\", \"Confusion, chaos, illusions\", \"Travel, movement, exploration\", \"Solitude, introspection, retreat\"],\n    [\"Power, authority, success\", \"Justice, balance, fairness\", \"Luck, fortune, opportunity\", \"Deception, lies, false appearances\"],\n    [\"Challenges, obstacles, adversity\", \"Hope, faith, optimism\", \"Joy, celebration, happiness\", \"Pain, grief, mourning\"],\n    [\"Victory, triumph, achievement\", \"Defeat, failure, loss\", \"Responsibility, duty, obligation\", \"Restriction, limitation, boundaries\"],\n    [\"Opportunity, choices, decisions\", \"Patience, waiting, contemplation\", \"Wisdom, knowledge, understanding\", \"Ignorance, foolishness, naivety\"],\n    [\"Confidence, self-esteem, self-worth\", \"Doubt, fear, insecurity\", \"Health, healing, well-being\", \"Sickness, disease, imbalance\"],\n    [\"Creativity, inspiration, intuition\", \"Routine, habit, repetition\", \"Innovation, change, progress\", \"Stagnation, lack of growth, boredom\"],\n    [\"Abundance, prosperity, wealth\", \"Loss, reduction, decrease\", \"Charity, giving, generosity\", \"Selfishness, greed, hoarding\"],\n    [\"Excess, indulgence, extravagance\", \"Moderation, balance, temperance\", \"Pleasure, sensuality, sexuality\", \"Addiction, obsession, compulsion\"],\n    [\"Mystery, intuition, spirituality\", \"Logic, reason, analysis\", \"Invention, originality, uniqueness\", \"Convention, tradition, conformity\"],\n    [\"Transformation, renewal, rebirth\", \"Aging, decay, deterioration\", \"Revolution, upheaval, chaos\", \"Stability, order, predictability\"],\n    [\"Independence, freedom, liberation\", \"Confinement, restriction, limitation\", \"Change, evolution, progress\", \"Stasis, status quo, lack of change\"],\n    [\"Illumination, enlightenment, insight\", \"Darkness, ignorance, confusion\", \"Honesty, truth, integrity\", \"Dishonesty, lies, deceit\"],\n    [\"Completion, endings, fulfillment\", \"New beginnings, opportunities, potential\", \"Potential, possibilities, options\", \"Indecision, uncertainty, confusion\"]\n]\n\ndef get_interpretation(house_num, figure_num):\n    return interpretation_table[house_num - 1][figure_num - 1]\n```\nIn this code, `get_interpretation()` takes two arguments: `house_num` and `figure_num`. It returns the interpretation by accessing the corresponding row and column in the interpretation table, which is `interpretation_table[house_num - 1][figure_num - 1]`.\n\nNote that we subtract 1 from the input values since the list indices start from 0 but the house and figure numbers start from 1.",
