  "content": "There have been several clinical trials where statins were used in combination with either fenofibrate or ezetimibe. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. ACCORD Lipid Study (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes)\n\nCombination: Statin (simvastatin) + fenofibrate\nConclusion: The addition of fenofibrate to simvastatin did not significantly reduce the rate of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke compared to simvastatin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nDOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1001282\nURL: <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1001282>\n\n1. IMPROVE-IT (IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial)\n\nCombination: Statin (simvastatin) + ezetimibe\nConclusion: The combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe resulted in a significant reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes when compared to simvastatin alone.\nDOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1410489\nURL: <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1410489>\n\n1. FIELD study (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes)\n\nCombination: Statin (various) + fenofibrate\nConclusion: Fenofibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of the primary outcome of coronary events in patients with type 2 diabetes, but it did reduce the rate of total cardiovascular events, mainly due to fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions and revascularizations.\nDOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67667-2\nURL: <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67667-2/fulltext>\n\n1. SHARP trial (Study of Heart and Renal Protection)\n\nCombination: Statin (simvastatin) + ezetimibe\nConclusion: The combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe safely reduced the incidence of major atherosclerotic events in a wide range of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.\nDOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60739-3\nURL: <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60739-3/fulltext>\n\nThese trials highlight some of the varying outcomes when combining statins with either fenofibrate or ezetimibe. It is essential to consider the specific patient population and individual clinical context when interpreting these findings.",
