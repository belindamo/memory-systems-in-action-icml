  "content": "The information you provided is describing a graph that presents the average BAC levels of individuals who were arrested for drunk driving in the state of Washington between 1999 and 2007. The graph is likely a histogram, with the x-axis showing the BAC levels, and the y-axis showing the number of individuals who had that particular BAC level. The data points on the graph represent the averages of the BAC levels, and the fitted values (black lines) are likely based on local linear models, which can be used to estimate the underlying distribution of the data.\n\nThe graph also indicates that there are two legal thresholds for BAC levels, which are 0.08 and 0.15. These thresholds likely represent the legal limit for BAC while driving in the state of Washington. The bin width is 0.002, which means that each bar in the histogram represents a range of BAC levels that is 0.002 wide.\n\nThis graph illustrates the distribution of BAC levels among individuals who have been arrested for drunk driving in the state of Washington, which can be used to evaluate the prevalence of drunk driving and the effectiveness of different interventions and policies aimed at reducing drunk driving. It also allows to see how many people have BAC levels above the legal limit, which can help to understand the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities associated with different BAC levels.",
