However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal relationships or interactions, so I didn't have a conversation with Emily or know about your shared love of hiking.\n\nMoving on to the game night, I'd be delighted to recommend some popular board games that are perfect for a group of 6-8 people. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Ticket to Ride**: A train-themed game where players compete to build railroad routes across a map of North America. Easy to learn, but with enough strategy to keep it engaging. (30-60 minutes, 2-5 players)\n2. **Settlers of Catan**: A classic game of resource management and trading, where players build settlements, roads, and cities on an island. Great for groups of 6-8. (30-60 minutes, 3-4 players, but can be played with 5-6 players with expansions)\n3. **Codenames**: A word-guessing game where players try to identify words based on one-word clues given by their teammate. Hilarious and great for larger groups. (15-30 minutes, 4-8 players)\n4. **Mysterium**: A cooperative game where one player takes on the role of a ghost trying to communicate with the other players (psychic mediums) to solve a murder mystery. Spooky fun! (30-60 minutes, 2-7 players)\n5. **Taboo**: A fast-paced word-describing game where players take turns explaining a word without using certain \"taboo\" words or phrases. Great for large groups and lots of laughter. (15-30 minutes, 4-12 players)\n6. **Pictionary**: A classic drawing game where players guess what their teammates are drawing. Always a hit with larger groups. (30-60 minutes, 4-12 players)\n7. **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong**: A social deduction game where one player takes on the role of the investigator, and the others play as suspects. Great for groups of 6-8. (20-40 minutes, 4-12 players)\n8. **Wits & Wagers**: A trivia game where players bet on the answers given by their opponents, making it a fun and social experience. (30-60 minutes, 4-12 players)\n\nThese games are all highly rated and suitable for a group of 6-8 people. You can choose one or two games to play, depending on the time you have available and the interests of your group. Have a fantastic game night!",
