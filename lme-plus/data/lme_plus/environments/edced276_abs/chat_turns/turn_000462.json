  "content": "I really like the idea of a distributed brain and flexible, shape-shifting bodies. I'm thinking of a species that can change the shape of their arms to adapt to different tools or environments. They could also have a unique way of communicating through color changes or bioluminescence. I've written about 15,000 words so far, and I'm excited to see where this new direction takes me.
