  "content": "Creating a Facebook event and sending individual texts is a great way to cover all your bases.\n\nAs for the timeline, three weeks is a good amount of time to plan and prepare for a game night. Here's a rough outline to help you stay on track:\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n* Create the Facebook event and send out invitations to your friends on Facebook.\n* Send individual texts to those who aren't on Facebook.\n* Start thinking about the games you want to play and make a rough list.\n* Consider the snacks and drinks you'll provide.\n\n**Week 2:**\n\n* Finalize the game selection and make sure you have all the necessary materials (e.g., boards, cards, pieces).\n* Plan the snacks and drinks in more detail, considering any dietary restrictions.\n* Send out a reminder to your guests, and ask them to RSVP by a certain date.\n\n**Week 3:**\n\n* Confirm the final headcount and make any necessary adjustments to snacks and drinks.\n* Prepare your home for the game night (e.g., clean, set up tables, decorate).\n* Send out a final reminder to your guests, including any important details (e.g., parking, arrival time).\n\nWith this rough outline, you should be well-prepared for a fun and successful game night. Remember to relax and be flexible \u2013 things might not go exactly as planned, but that's all part of the fun!\n\nOne more thing to consider: you might want to have a backup plan in case some games don't work out or if you need to make last-minute changes. Having a few extra games or activities up your sleeve can help ensure that everyone has a great time.",
