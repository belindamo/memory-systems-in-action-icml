  "content": "It is not accurate to say that Nelson Mandela was on an \"African terrorist list\" and that his political party removed him from that list.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the apartheid government in South Africa, which was supported by the United States government, labeled Mandela and his African National Congress (ANC) party as terrorists. Mandela was arrested in 1962 and charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964.\n\nOver time, international opinion shifted in favor of the ANC's struggle against apartheid, and Mandela was eventually released from prison in 1990. He became the first black president of South Africa in 1994, following the country's first democratic elections.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no record of the ANC removing Mandela from a \"terrorist list\" because such a list does not exist.",
