I want you to analyse my content and find opportunities from the three contents in the previous conversation that we can use to further enhance my content. Remember that my goal is to enhance my existing service page and to outrank the three contents.\n\nWhat is Adjudication Process?\nAn adjudication process can be a helpful method for anyone involved in a Security of Payments dispute. With the help of a legal expert, the dispute can be resolved in no time.\nAdjudication is a procedure for resolving disputes without resorting to lengthy and expensive court procedure.\nAside from enforcing the rights of builders and contractors under the Act, one of the benefits of the Security of Payment Act is that it provides builders and contractors a quick and inexpensive process of obtaining theor rightful payment. An adjudication is, firstly, not a court process. Rather, it is a quicker method in resolving disputes than lengthly and costly court process where an adjudicator is appointed to settle the dispute.\n\nUpon the Security of Payment Act\u2019s legislation, its primary objective is to make sure that contractors and subcontractors get paid. If payment disputes or problems arise such as late payment, short payment or non-payment, the contractor\u2019s right to file for adjudication is enforced.\nContractors may file for adjudication if:\u200b\nThe amount given by the client is less than what is being claimed by the contractor.\nThe client did not pay any of the disputed amount.\nThe client failed to provide a payment schedule.\nIf an adjudication process isn\u2019t a court process,\nthen how are payment disputes settled?\u200b\nBy written submissions. However, there are turn of events that can eventually lead to a court trial.\nORDER OF ESCALATING DISPUTE\nnegotiations\nNegotiations between the two parties\u200b\nadjudication\nAdjudication\ncourt\nCourt\nStrict timeframes\nUnder NSW\u2019s Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999, non-conformity with the law may be deemed invalid. \nA certain of another party may no longer be available if the party conformed past their given time.\nprocedure of adjudication\nIf Payment Schedule is not served:\nThe respondent did not provide a payment schedule within the given number of days (10 business days).\nThe claimant may file for adjudication and is allowed to suspend work for two business days\u2019 notice.\nThe claimant shall serve and prepare Adjudication Notice within 20 business days since due date of the payment.\nThe respondent shall serve the payment schedule within five days since the receipt of the Adjudication Notice.\nIf the respondent did not issue a payment schedule within five business days, the claimant has 10 business days (after the expiry of the five-day deadline) to apply for adjudication.\nThe adjudicator shall come up with a decision within 10 business days since the receipt of the application.\nPrice on the contract icon \u2013 Adjudication Process | Contracts Specialist\nIf payment schedule is served, but the full amount or part of the payment was not paid:\nClaimant accepts the payment.\nRespondent did not pay the full amount or any part of the scheduled amount.\nClaimant has 20 business days from the due date of the payment to apply for adjudication or may suspend work for two business days\u2019 notice.\nRespondent must serve the Adjudication Response within 5 business days since the receipt of the Adjudication Application or within 2 business days after receiving the notice of the Adjudicator\u2019s acceptance of the application.\nThe adjudicator shall come up with a decision within 10 business days since the receipt of the application. \nResidential building contract icon \u2013 Adjudication Process | Contracts Specialist\nIf payment schedule is served, but the claimant disputes the\nPayment Schedule:\u200b\nThe claimant may apply for adjudication within 10 business days since the receipt of the payment schedule.\nHowever, if an Adjudication Notice was served, the claimant shall apply for adjudication within 10 business days after the expiry of the five-day deadline.\nRespondent must serve the Adjudication Response within 5 business days since the receipt of the Adjudication Application or within 2 business days after receiving the notice of the Adjudicator\u2019s acceptance of the application.\nThe adjudicator shall come up with a decision within 10 business days since the receipt of the application."
