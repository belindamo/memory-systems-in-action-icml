This will help draw the customer's eye to various products and add depth to your display.\n3. **Group similar products together**: Organize your soaps and candles by type, scent, or color to create a cohesive look. This makes it easy for customers to find what they're looking for and compare products.\n4. **Add some greenery**: Incorporate some fresh flowers, plants, or greenery to bring a pop of color and freshness to your display. This can also tie in with the summer theme.\n5. **Use decorative containers**: Display your soaps and candles in decorative containers, baskets, or jars that complement your products and theme. This adds a touch of elegance and can make your products stand out.\n6. **Highlight best-sellers**: Showcase your most popular products or new releases prominently to grab attention. Use signs or flags to draw attention to these products.\n7. **Add some texture**: Mix different textures, such as wood, fabric, or rattan, to add visual interest to your display.\n8. **Incorporate lighting**: Use string lights, lanterns, or spotlights to highlight specific products or create a warm ambiance. This can especially help draw attention to your candles!\n9. **Make it interactive**: Consider adding a \"smell station\" where customers can test different scents or a \"soap-making demo\" area to engage customers and create a memorable experience.\n10. **Branding and signage**: Don't forget to clearly display your brand name, logo, and contact information. Use signs to highlight promotions, prices, or special offers.\n\nSome specific ideas for your handmade soaps and candles could be:\n\n* Creating a \"Soap Bar\" with different soap flavors and scents arranged like a colorful rainbow\n* Building a \"Candle Pyramid\" with candles of varying sizes and colors\n* Designing a \"Summer Scent Garden\" with soaps and candles arranged to resemble a garden, complete with artificial flowers and greenery\n\nRemember to keep your display easy to navigate, well-organized, and visually appealing.
