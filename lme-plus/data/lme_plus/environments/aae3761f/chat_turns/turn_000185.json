  "content": "I think it's definitely a possibility that discovery could create a mobile app that incorporates interactive elements and personalization features. many streaming services have already developed mobile apps that allow viewers to customize and personalize their viewing experiences. the inclusion of interactive elements and personalization features in a mobile app could be a way for discovery to differentiate itself from other streaming services and attract more viewers, including younger audiences who are increasingly consuming content on mobile devices. it could also provide viewers with a more engaging and enjoyable viewing experience, which could lead to increased viewership and loyalty. however, launching a mobile app is a major undertaking, and requires a substantial investment in technology and marketing. therefore, if discovery decides to create a mobile app, they will need to ensure that it offers a unique and compelling experience that captures the attention of viewers and delivers long-term value for the company.",
