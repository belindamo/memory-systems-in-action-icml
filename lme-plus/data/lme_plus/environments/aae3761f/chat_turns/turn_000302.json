  "content": "I'm starting from my hometown, and I'm thinking of heading out west to visit some national parks. I'm not sure about the exact destination yet, but I'm open to suggestions. As for the trip length, I'd say around 7-10 days should be good. I prefer scenic routes, especially if they go through national parks or have nice views. I don't have any specific road conditions or restrictions to consider, and I'm open to any suggestions for stops or activities along the way.",
