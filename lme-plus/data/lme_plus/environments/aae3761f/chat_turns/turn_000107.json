  "content": "My account is a personal one, and I mostly post photos related to photography and my personal life. My target audience is people with similar interests, likely between 18-40 years old. Recently, my top-performing posts have been photos of my home garden and sunset shots, which have gotten a lot of engagement in terms of likes and comments. I don't have a specific hashtag strategy, but I do try to respond to comments and direct messages regularly. I post around 3-4 times a week, usually in the morning or evening. I haven't collaborated with anyone recently, but I have been more consistent with my posting schedule.",
