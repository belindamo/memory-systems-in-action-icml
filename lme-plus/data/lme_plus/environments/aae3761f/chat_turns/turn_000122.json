  "content": "Alcides Side Story:\n\nAlcides, also known as Hercules, was the son of Zeus and Alcmene. Hera, who was jealous of Alcmene, attempted to kill Hercules as a baby. Athena and Hera found Hercules and attempted to breastfeed him, but Hercules bit down on Hera's breast and she realized he was Zeus's son.\n\nHera wanted to kill Hercules after learning he was Zeus's son, so she convinced King Eurystheus to create the Twelve Labors, with the intent to kill, humiliate, and exhaust Hercules.\n\nAfter completing the Twelve Labors, Hercules was granted forgiveness for his past guilt. On his journey home to Thebes, he stopped at Thessaly and helped King Admetus save his wife, Alcestis.\n\nLater, Hercules was attacked by a centaur named Nessus while protecting Deianeria, and Hercules killed Nessus with a poison arrow. However, before he died, Nessus gave Deianeria a love potion that ultimately caused Hercules great pain when she thought he was unfaithful.",
