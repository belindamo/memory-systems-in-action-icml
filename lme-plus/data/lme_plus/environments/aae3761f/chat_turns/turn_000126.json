Let's build on that momentum!\n\nTo get started, can you tell me a bit more about your schedule and preferences? For example:\n\n1. What are your available work hours? Are you a morning person, afternoon person, or do you have a flexible schedule?\n2. How many focused work sessions do you want to aim for per day/week?\n3. What's the ideal duration for each focused work session? (e.g., 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 2 hours)\n4. Do you have any fixed commitments or meetings that you need to schedule around (e.g., team meetings, client calls, lunch breaks)?\n5. Are there any specific days or times when you feel more energized and focused?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your schedule and preferences, I can help you block out dedicated time for focused work sessions.",
