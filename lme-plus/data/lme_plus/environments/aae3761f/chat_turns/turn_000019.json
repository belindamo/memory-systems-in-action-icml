Some programs require proficiency in the host country's language, while others may offer language courses to help students learn the language.\n\nFor example, if you are interested in studying in countries where English is not the primary language, such as China, Japan, or Spain, you may be required to take a language proficiency test to demonstrate proficiency in the host country's language or complete language courses before participating in the program.\n\nHowever, not all study abroad programs require proficiency in the host country's language. There are many programs in countries where English is widely spoken, and language skills are not a requirement. Additionally, some programs may offer language courses as an option, but not a requirement.\n\nIt is important to research the language requirements for the specific program you are interested in before applying. The Rutgers Global advisors should be able to provide more information on language requirements for each program.\n\nIn summary, language requirements for study abroad programs at Rutgers University may vary depending on the program and the location. Some programs may require proficiency in the host country's language, while others may offer language courses as an option, but not a requirement.",
