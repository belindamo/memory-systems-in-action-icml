  "content": "Yes, there are ways in which secular society could integrate some of the principles of monasticism into our daily lives. For example, mindfulness and meditation practices have gained popularity in recent years, as people seek to cultivate inner peace and focus in the midst of modern stress and distraction. Additionally, the concept of minimalism has also gained traction, as people seek to simplify their lives and reduce clutter and excess.
