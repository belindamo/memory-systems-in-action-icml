As a large language model, I don't have access to specific information about a particular game that took place three weeks ago, including LeBron James' performance. I don't have the ability to retain information about past games or events.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some ways for you to find the information you're looking for. You can check the NBA website or other sports websites I mentioned earlier, and look for the game recap or box score from that specific game. They usually have archives of past games, including stats and highlights.\n\nYou can also try searching online for \"Lakers vs Celtics [date of the game]\" or \"LeBron James stats [date of the game]\" to find articles or news stories about the game. This should give you more information about LeBron's performance in that particular game.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",
