I have a lot of scarves, so I might get a few stackable bins to store them in. For hats, I might get a hat rack or a shelf to store them on. Belts, I'll probably store on a belt rack or a hook. And for jewelry, I might get a jewelry organizer or a jewelry box. I'm not sure yet, but I'll figure it out.",
