Treat these appointments with yourself as non-negotiable. Choose a consistent schedule that works for you, such as:\n\n* Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 7:00 am - 8:00 am (or any other time that fits your schedule)\n\n**Step 2: Create a reminder**\n\nSet reminders for each gym session to ensure you don't forget. You can set reminders on your phone, calendar, or even ask a friend to hold you accountable.\n\n**Step 3: Track your progress**\n\nKeep track of your gym sessions by:\n\n* Using a habit-tracking app (e.g., Habitica, HabitBull, or Strides)\n* Marking it on your calendar\n* Taking a post-workout selfie (optional, but fun!)\n\n**Step 4: Identify accountability**\n\nShare your goal with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can be as simple as sending them a weekly update on your progress.\n\n**Step 5: Reward yourself**\n\nSet small rewards for yourself when you reach your goal. This could be something as simple as:\n\n* A post-workout smoothie or coffee\n* A new workout outfit or accessory\n* A relaxing bath or spa day\n\n**Step 6: Be kind to yourself**\n\nRemember that it's okay to miss a session occasionally. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day, but instead, focus on getting back on track as soon as possible.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be more likely to stick to your goal of going to the gym at least three times a week.\n\nHow does this sound? Are you ready to commit to your gym goal?",
