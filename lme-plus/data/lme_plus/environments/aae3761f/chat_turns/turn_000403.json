Here's why:\n\n**What is an ISSN?**\nAn ISSN is a unique 8-digit number assigned to a serial publication, such as a journal, magazine, or newspaper. It's used to identify a specific publication and distinguish it from others with similar titles.\n\n**Why include the ISSN in APA references?**\nIncluding the ISSN in your references serves several purposes:\n\n1. **Unique identification**: The ISSN provides a unique identifier for the journal, making it easier to locate the publication.\n2. **Disambiguation**: In cases where multiple journals have similar titles, the ISSN helps to distinguish between them.\n3. **Verification**: The ISSN can be used to verify the accuracy of the journal title and other bibliographic information.\n4. **Interoperability**: ISSNs are used in various bibliographic databases and citation management tools, making it easier to import and export references.\n\n**When to include the ISSN**\nAPA style recommends including the ISSN in references for:\n\n* Journal articles\n* Magazine articles\n* Newspaper articles\n* Online publications with an ISSN\n\nYou can usually find the ISSN on the journal's website, in the print version of the journal, or through online databases like Ulrichsweb or the ISSN International Centre.\n\n**When to omit the ISSN**\nYou can omit the ISSN in references for:\n\n* Books (ISBN is used instead)\n* Book chapters\n* Conference proceedings\n* Online sources without an ISSN\n\nIn summary, including the ISSN in your APA references is not mandatory, but it's a good practice to include it when available, as it provides additional information and helps with accuracy and verification.",
