  "content": "That sounds like a blast! BBQ festivals are the best way to get inspired and try out new flavors. Korean chili flakes, also known as gochugaru, are a great addition to many dishes, and they'll definitely add a nice kick to your potato salad.\n\nFor your Korean-Style Potato Salad, you might want to consider adding some other Korean ingredients to complement the gochugaru. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n* **Gochujang**: This Korean chili paste has a thick, sticky texture and a sweet, savory, and spicy flavor. It pairs really well with potatoes and can add depth to your potato salad.\n* **Kimchi**: You mentioned you've used pickles in your previous potato salad, but kimchi can add a similar tanginess and a boost of umami flavor. You can chop it up and mix it in or use it as a topping.\n* **Toasted sesame seeds**: Sesame seeds are a common garnish in Korean cuisine, and they add a nice nutty flavor and crunch to the potato salad.\n* **Crispy garlic**: Koreans love their garlic, and crispy garlic is a popular garnish in many Korean dishes. Simply slice some garlic thinly, separate the slices into individual pieces, and fry them in oil until crispy.\n* **Scallions**: Thinly slice some scallions and use them as a garnish or mix them into the potato salad for added flavor and texture.\n\nRemember, the key to making a great potato salad is to taste and adjust as you go. Don't be afraid to add more gochugaru, gochujang, or other ingredients to taste.\n\nIf you're looking for more BBQ-inspired recipes, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions. What type of BBQ are you into? Are you looking for classic American-style BBQ, or do you want to explore other international BBQ styles?",
