  "content": "Pulenda is a traditional Corsican dish that is similar to polenta. It is made from coarsely ground cornmeal, water, and salt. The mixture is cooked in a pot over low heat for a long time until it becomes thick and pasty. \n\nThe texture of Pulenda is quite dense and heavy, similar to a cake or bread. It is often served in slices, which can be eaten plain or with a variety of toppings such as cheese, meat, or vegetables.\n\nOne traditional way to eat Pulenda is to pour a generous amount of olive oil on top, then add grated cheese or meat sauce. It is also sometimes served as a side dish with stews or soups.\n\nIf you're a fan of polenta or other hearty, grain-based dishes, then Pulenda is definitely worth trying. It's a great comfort food that is filling and satisfying.",
