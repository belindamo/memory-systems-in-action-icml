With the help of a legal expert, the dispute can be resolved in no time.\nAdjudication is a procedure for resolving disputes without resorting to lengthy and expensive court procedure.\nAside from enforcing the rights of builders and contractors under the Act, one of the benefits of the Security of Payment Act is that it provides builders and contractors a quick and inexpensive process of obtaining theor rightful payment. An adjudication is, firstly, not a court process. Rather, it is a quicker method in resolving disputes than lengthly and costly court process where an adjudicator is appointed to settle the dispute.\n\nUpon the Security of Payment Act\u2019s legislation, its primary objective is to make sure that contractors and subcontractors get paid. If payment disputes or problems arise such as late payment, short payment or non-payment, the contractor\u2019s right to file for adjudication is enforced.\nContractors may file for adjudication if:\u200b\nThe amount given by the client is less than what is being claimed by the contractor.\nThe client did not pay any of the disputed amount.\nThe client failed to provide a payment schedule.\nIf an adjudication process isn\u2019t a court process,\nthen how are payment disputes settled?\u200b\nBy written submissions.
