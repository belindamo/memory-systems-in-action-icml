Since you've already earned 700 points, you're eligible for a $7 discount on your next purchase. Remember to use those points before they expire!\n\nPlease feel free to add more loyalty programs to the list whenever you're ready. Just provide the same information for each program, and I'll help you keep track of them all.\n\nBy the way, since you signed up in-store, you might want to check your receipts or email for any confirmation emails from Safeway to see if they provided an account number or username for online access to your loyalty account. This might come in handy for tracking your points or redeeming rewards online.",
