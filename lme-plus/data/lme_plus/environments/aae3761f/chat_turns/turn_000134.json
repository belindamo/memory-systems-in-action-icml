However, I can guide you through the process of setting up a reminder on your calendar.\n\nHere are the steps to set up a reminder on your calendar:\n\n**Google Calendar:**\n\n1. Open Google Calendar on your computer or mobile device.\n2. Click on the \"+\" button to create a new event.\n3. Enter \"Wind-down time\" or a similar title for the event.\n4. Set the start time to 10:00 pm and the duration to 30 minutes (or any other duration you prefer).\n5. Click on the \"Repeat\" dropdown menu and select \"Daily\" to set the reminder to occur every day.\n6. Add a reminder notification by clicking on the \"Reminders\" dropdown menu and selecting \"Notification\". Choose a notification time that works for you, such as 10:00 pm.\n7. Click \"Save\" to save the event.\n\n**Apple Calendar (iCal):**\n\n1. Open Apple Calendar on your Mac or iOS device.\n2. Click on the \"+\" button to create a new event.\n3. Enter \"Wind-down time\" or a similar title for the event.\n4. Set the start time to 10:00 pm and the duration to 30 minutes (or any other duration you prefer).\n5. Click on the \"Repeat\" dropdown menu and select \"Every Day\" to set the reminder to occur every day.\n6. Click on the \"Alert\" dropdown menu and select \"Notification\". Choose a notification time that works for you, such as 10:00 pm.\n7. Click \"Add\" to save the event.\n\n**Other Calendars:**\n\nIf you use a different calendar app, the steps may vary slightly. However, the general process should be similar: create a new event, set the start time and duration, set the reminder to repeat daily, and add a notification.\n\nOnce you've set up the reminder, you'll receive a notification at 10:00 pm each night to start winding down and preparing for bed. Remember to adjust the reminder time or duration as needed to fit your personal preferences.\n\nHow's that? Do you have any questions about setting up the reminder?",
