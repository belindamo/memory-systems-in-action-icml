I'm a large language model, my knowledge cutoff is until my training data, and I don't receive updates on current events or schedules.\n\nBut I can suggest some ways for you to find the information you're looking for! You can check the NBA website, NBA app, or other sports websites I mentioned earlier for the latest schedule and matchups. They usually have a section for upcoming games, and you can filter by team, date, or time.\n\nYou can also follow your favorite teams or players on social media, or sign up for their newsletters to get updates on their schedules and games. Additionally, you can set reminders or notifications on your phone or calendar to keep track of upcoming games.\n\nAs for notable matchups, I can suggest some general tips to help you find exciting games:\n\n* Check out rivalry games between top teams in each conference\n* Look for games featuring top players or MVP candidates\n* Keep an eye on teams that are on a hot streak or making a playoff push\n* Check out games with playoff implications or seeding implications\n\nRemember to check the NBA website or other reliable sources for the most up-to-date information on schedules and matchups.
