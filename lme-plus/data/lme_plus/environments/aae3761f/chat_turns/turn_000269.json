Oat milk and cashew milk are both fantastic options for their creamy texture and neutral flavor.\n\nCutting down on sugary snacks is a wonderful goal, and opting for fruit is an excellent choice.

Here are some healthy vegan snack ideas that are easy to prepare:\n\n1. **Fresh Fruit Energy Balls**: Mix together rolled oats, nut butter (like peanut butter or almond butter), and honey or maple syrup to create bite-sized energy balls. You can also add in chia seeds, coconut flakes, or cinnamon for extra nutrition and flavor.\n2. **Roasted Chickpeas**: Rinse and dry a can of chickpeas, then toss with olive oil and your favorite spices (like paprika, garlic powder, or cumin).
