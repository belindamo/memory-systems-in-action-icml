  "content": "That's awesome that you've developed your own BBQ sauce recipe that you love! It's great that you've found a balance of flavors that works for you, and it's even more impressive that you're experimenting with it on different dishes.\n\nUsing your BBQ sauce as a finishing sauce is a fantastic idea, and it can really elevate the flavor and appearance of your smoked chicken. When it comes to applying the finishing sauce, you can definitely brush it on or use a mop sauce. Here are some tips:\n\n* **Brushing**: Use a clean brush to apply the BBQ sauce to the chicken during the last 15-30 minutes of smoking. This will help create a nice, even coat of sauce. Make sure to brush it on gently, as you don't want to disturb the meat.\n* **Mop sauce**: A mop sauce is a thinner, more watery version of your BBQ sauce. You can use it to baste the chicken during the last 30 minutes of smoking. This will help keep the meat moist and add even more flavor.\n\nAs for the BBQ festival, that sounds like an amazing experience! 20 different BBQ vendors is a lot, and I'm sure you had a blast trying all the different meats. What were some of your favorite dishes or vendors from the festival? Did you discover any new BBQ styles or flavors that you're excited to try out?\n\nBy the way, have you considered entering any BBQ competitions or cook-offs? With your passion for BBQ and your own BBQ sauce recipe, you might have a good shot at winning some awards!",
