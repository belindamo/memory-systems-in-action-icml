And making your own hummus is a great idea - it's really easy and you can customize the flavor to your liking.\n\nOh, and yay for vegan mac and cheese! It's always great to discover new vegan options, especially when they're delicious. Have you tried making your own vegan mac and cheese at home, or is that something you're interested in trying out?\n\nBy the way, I'm curious - what do you like most about the vegan mac and cheese from the new restaurant? Is it the creamy sauce, the type of pasta they use, or something else entirely?",
