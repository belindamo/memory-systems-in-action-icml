Learners will gain an understanding of how DEFI differs from traditional finance, the advantages and risks associated with DEFI, and how to create and trade digital assets using smart contracts. This project-based course will provide learners with hands-on experience in developing a DEFI project.\n\nCourse Outcome: Upon completion of the course, learners will be able to design, develop, and deploy a DEFI application on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nModule 1: Introduction to DEFI\n\nLesson Plan:\n\n* Learning Objectives: Define DEFI and compare it to traditional finance, identify the benefits and risks of DEFI, and describe the underlying technology.\n* Real-World Examples: Uniswap, Compound, and Aave.\n* Activities: Research and discuss the differences between traditional finance and DEFI, evaluate the benefits and risks of DEFI, and describe how smart contracts work in the context of DEFI.\n* Discussion Questions: What is the difference between traditional finance and DEFI? What are the benefits and risks associated with DEFI?\n\nEngaging Video Script:\n\"Welcome to Module 1 of the DEFI Study course. In this module, we'll explore the world of decentralized finance, also known as DEFI. We'll compare DEFI to traditional finance and examine the benefits and risks associated with it. We'll also take a closer look at the underlying technology that makes DEFI possible. By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of DEFI and be ready to dive deeper into the world of decentralized finance.\"\n\nModule 2: Smart Contracts and Solidity\n\nLesson Plan:\n\n* Learning Objectives: Define smart contracts and Solidity, describe the benefits of using smart contracts, and write a basic smart contract using Solidity.\n* Real-World Examples: CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, and Golem.\n* Activities: Research and discuss smart contracts and Solidity, analyze the benefits of using smart contracts in DEFI applications, and write a basic smart contract using Solidity.\n* Discussion Questions: What are smart contracts? What are the benefits of using smart contracts in DEFI applications?\n\nEngaging Video Script:\n\"Welcome to Module 2 of the DEFI Study course. In this module, we'll take a closer look at smart contracts and Solidity. We'll explore some real-world examples of smart contracts, including CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, and Golem. We'll also discuss the benefits of using smart contracts in DEFI applications and learn how to write a basic smart contract using Solidity. By the end of this module, you'll have a good understanding of smart contracts and be ready to start writing your own.\"\n\nModule 3: Decentralized Applications (DApps)\n\nLesson Plan:\n\n* Learning Objectives: Define decentralized applications (DApps), describe the components of a DApp, and create a simple DApp using Truffle and React.\n* Real-World Examples: Augur, Gnosis, and MyEtherWallet.\n* Activities: Research and discuss DApps, analyze the components of a DApp, and create a simple DApp using Truffle and React.\n* Discussion Questions: What are DApps? What are the benefits of using DApps in DEFI applications?\n\nEngaging Video Script:\n\"Welcome to Module 3 of the DEFI Study course. In this module, we'll explore decentralized applications, or DApps. We'll examine some real-world examples of DApps, including Augur, Gnosis, and MyEtherWallet. We'll also learn about the components of a",
