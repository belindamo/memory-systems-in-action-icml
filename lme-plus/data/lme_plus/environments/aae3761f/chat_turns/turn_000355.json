By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of DApps and be ready to start building your own.\"\n\nModule 4: DEFI Architecture\n\nLesson Plan:\n\n* Learning Objectives: Define DEFI architecture, describe the different layers of DEFI, and analyze the risks and vulnerabilities of DEFI applications.\n* Real-World Examples: Compound, MakerDAO, and dYdX.\n* Activities: Research and discuss DEFI architecture, analyze the different layers of DEFI, and evaluate the risks and vulnerabilities of DEFI applications.\n* Discussion Questions: What is DEFI architecture? What are the different layers of DEFI? What are the risks and vulnerabilities of DEFI applications?\n\nEngaging Video Script:\n\"Welcome to Module 4 of the DEFI Study course. In this module, we'll take a closer look at DEFI architecture. We'll examine some real-world examples of DEFI applications, including Compound, MakerDAO, and dYdX. We'll also explore the different layers of DEFI and evaluate the risks and vulnerabilities of DEFI applications. By the end of this module, you'll have a good understanding of DEFI architecture and be ready to start designing your own DEFI project.\"\n\nModule 5: DEFI Project Design\n\nLesson Plan:\n\n* Learning Objectives: Define DEFI project design, develop a DEFI project proposal, and create a project roadmap.\n* Real-World Examples: Uniswap, Compound, and Balancer.\n* Activities: Research and discuss DEFI project design, develop a DEFI project proposal, and create a project roadmap.\n* Discussion Questions: What is DEFI project design? What are the key components of a DEFI project proposal? How do you create a project roadmap?\n\nEngaging Video Script:\n\"Welcome to Module 5 of the DEFI Study course. In this module, we'll explore DEFI project design. We'll examine some real-world examples of DEFI projects, including Uniswap, Compound, and Balancer. We'll also learn how to develop a DEFI project proposal and create a project roadmap. By the end of this module, you'll have the skills you need to start designing your own DEFI project.\"\n\nModule 6: DEFI Project Development\n\nLesson Plan:\n\n* Learning Objectives: Develop a DEFI project using the skills and tools learned in the previous modules.\n* Real-World Examples: Your own project.\n* Activities: Develop a DEFI project using the skills and tools learned in the previous modules.\n* Discussion Questions: What challenges did you face while developing your DEFI project? What did you learn during the development process?\n\nEngaging Video Script:\n\"Welcome to Module 6, the final module of the DEFI Study course. In this module, you'll apply the skills and tools you've learned in the previous modules to develop your own DEFI project. You'll face challenges, but you'll be able to overcome them using the skills and knowledge you've gained. By the end of this module, you'll have a fully functional DEFI project that you can be proud of.\"\n\nProject Plan:\n\nLearners will be required to develop a DEFI project using the skills and tools learned in the course. The project should include the following components:\n\n* A DEFI application that utilizes smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain\n* A project proposal that outlines the project's purpose, functionality, and potential risks and vulnerabilities\n* A project roadmap that details the development process, including milestones and timelines\n* A presentation that demonstrates the project's functionality and the learner's understanding of DEFI\n\nExpansion:\n\nTo expand learning, learners can:\n\n* Analyze and compare different DEFI applications and projects",
