  "content": "I'm looking for some tips on improving my flexibility, especially in my hamstrings. I've noticed a significant improvement since I started practicing yoga regularly, but I want to take it to the next level. By the way, I attended a yoga workshop focused on restorative yoga last weekend, and it was amazing - we spent the entire class in relaxing poses using blocks, straps, and blankets, and I felt so rejuvenated afterwards. Do you have any advice on how to improve my hamstring flexibility?",
