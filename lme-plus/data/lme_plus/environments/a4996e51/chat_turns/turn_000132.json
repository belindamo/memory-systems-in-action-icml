I can still access them on my computer if I need to, and I can use other apps like Twitter or LinkedIn for staying connected with friends and colleagues. I'm not sure about deleting Twitter, though - I do enjoy staying up-to-date with news and current events through it. Do you think it's possible to use Twitter in a healthy way, or is it just as bad as the other social media platforms?",
