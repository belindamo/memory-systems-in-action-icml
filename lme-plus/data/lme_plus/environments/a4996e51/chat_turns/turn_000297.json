I've really enjoyed her classes, and I've heard great things about the studio's community and atmosphere. They offer an unlimited membership, which would allow me to attend as many classes as I want per month, including yin yoga classes. I'm thinking of taking advantage of their trial period to test it out before committing to a membership.",
