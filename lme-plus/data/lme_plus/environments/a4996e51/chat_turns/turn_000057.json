  "content": "King James II's life was marked by many interesting stories, but perhaps none more absurd than the tale of his attempted escape during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. As opposition to his rule grew, James made a desperate bid for freedom, attempting to flee to France in search of support from King Louis XIV. But his plan was foiled when he was recognized by fishermen while boarding a ship in disguise and arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. It is almost comical to think that a fisherman, of all people, was able to capture a king and bring an end to his reign. Despite his eventual release and escape to France, this incident marked the start of a new era in English history.",
