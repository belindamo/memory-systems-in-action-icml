  "content": "One interesting story from King James II's life occurred during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. As opposition to his rule grew, James attempted to flee to France in order to seek support from King Louis XIV. However, his escape was thwarted when he was recognized by fishermen while boarding a ship in disguise. He was subsequently arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Although he was eventually released and allowed to flee to France, this incident marked the end of his reign and the start of a new era in English history.",
