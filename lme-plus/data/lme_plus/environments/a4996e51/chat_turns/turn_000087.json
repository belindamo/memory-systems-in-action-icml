I've had the privilege of covering Coachella a few times, and I've learned a thing or two about the process.\n\nTo apply for a photo pass, you'll need to submit an application through Coachella's media portal, which usually opens a few months before the festival. You'll need to provide some basic info, like your name, contact details, and a brief description of your publication or media outlet. You'll also need to upload some samples of your work, so make sure you have a solid portfolio ready.\n\nAs for access to artist areas or backstage, it's a bit more complicated. Coachella has a very strict policy when it comes to backstage access, and only a select few get approved. In my experience, you'll need to have a strong portfolio and a legitimate reason for needing access to the artist areas. I've had access to backstage areas in the past, but it was always through a specific assignment from a publication or with a specific artist's team.\n\nMy tip for getting approved for artist area access is to build relationships with the festival organizers, publicists, and artist teams. Attend other festivals, networking events, and concerts, and try to make connections with people in the industry. You can also try reaching out to the festival's media team directly and pitching a specific story or feature that requires backstage access.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Coachella is very particular about who they give access to, and it's not just about having a camera and a press badge. They want to make sure that the people covering the festival are respectful of the artists, the festival grounds, and the attendees.\n\nLastly, be prepared to provide proof of assignment or a letter of assignment from a publication or media outlet. Coachella takes credentialing very seriously, and they'll want to verify that you're not just trying to sneak backstage for a selfie with your favorite artist.\n\nGood luck with your application, and I hope to see you at Coachella!\"\n\nJack's response provides some valuable insights into the process of applying for a photo pass and accessing restricted areas at Coachella. He emphasizes the importance of having a strong portfolio, building relationships with industry professionals, and being respectful of the festival and its attendees. He also highlights the need for proof of assignment or a letter of assignment from a publication or media outlet.",
