  "content": "For newly hatched fry, it's essential to provide a nutrient-rich food that's easy to digest. Here are some options:\n\n**Infusoria:** Infusoria is a type of microscopic food that's perfect for newly hatched fry. It's a live food that's rich in protein and can be cultured at home or purchased from a pet store. Infusoria is an excellent choice for the first few days, as it's easily digestible and provides essential nutrients for growth.\n\n**Commercial fry food:** Commercial fry foods are specifically formulated to meet the nutritional needs of newly hatched fry. They come in various forms, such as powder, flakes, or liquid. Look for a high-quality fry food that's designed for small fish like guppies and platies. Some popular brands include API, Tetra, and Hikari.\n\n**Other options:** You can also use other foods like egg yolk, rotifers, or vinegar eels. However, these may require more preparation and can be more expensive than infusoria or commercial fry food.\n\n**Feeding schedule:** For the first few days, feed the fry 3-5 times a day, as they have high metabolisms and need frequent meals. As they grow, you can gradually reduce the frequency of feedings.\n\n**Tips for feeding fry:**\n\n* Use a pipette or a small dropper to feed the fry, as they're tiny and need precise feeding.\n* Feed only what the fry can consume within 1-2 minutes to prevent overfeeding and water quality issues.\n* Monitor the fry's response to food and adjust the amount and frequency of feedings accordingly.\n\nRegarding your guppy that was separated due to fin nipping, I'm glad to hear it's doing well in quarantine! Fin nipping can be a challenging behavior to address, but it's great that you took proactive steps to separate the aggressive guppy and provide it with a safe environment.\n\nDo you have any other questions about feeding fry or caring for your guppies and platies?",
