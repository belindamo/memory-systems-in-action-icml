Here are a few tips to make the most of this strategy:\n\n1. **Set specific reminders**: Instead of setting a generic \"drink water\" reminder, try setting specific reminders like \"drink 1 glass of water\" or \"finish 1 bottle of water\" to help you stay on track.\n2. **Space out your reminders**: Set reminders at regular intervals throughout the day, such as every hour or every 2 hours, to encourage consistent hydration.\n3. **Make it a habit**: Choose a specific time of day to drink water, such as when you wake up, at lunchtime, or before bed, and make it a habit to drink water at those times.\n4. **Customize your reminders**: If you have a busy schedule, consider setting reminders that are specific to your daily routine, such as \"drink water before meeting\" or \"drink water during break\".\n5. **Track your progress**: In addition to setting reminders, continue to track your water intake to see how you're doing and make adjustments as needed.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make drinking water a habit, so try to find a routine that works for you and stick to it.\n\nAlso, don't be too hard on yourself about only having 5 glasses of water on Wednesday. It's all about progress, not perfection! You can use that as a learning experience to identify what went wrong and how you can improve next time.\n\nHow do you think you'll set up your reminders, and what frequency do you think will work best for you?",
