  "content": "The best time to visit Cronulla depends on your preferences and what you plan to do there. Generally, the most popular time to visit Cronulla is during the summer months of December to February when the weather is warm and conducive to outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, and sunbathing.\n\nIf you prefer milder weather and fewer crowds, then the best time to go is during the shoulder seasons of spring (September to November) and autumn (March to May). During these months, the weather is still pleasant and the beaches are less crowded.\n\nWinter (June to August) is the offseason for Cronulla, and while it may be too cold for swimming, it's still a great time to visit for those who enjoy the cooler weather and want to explore the nearby Royal National Park without the crowds.",
