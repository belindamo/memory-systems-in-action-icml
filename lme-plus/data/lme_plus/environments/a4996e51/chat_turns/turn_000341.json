I've been trying to establish a routine, going for runs three times a week, and I'm hoping to work up to doing a 5K soon. As for my favorite running route, I actually don't have one yet! I've been sticking to local roads and sidewalks near my neighborhood, but I'm looking to explore some new trails and routes. Do you have any suggestions or tips for finding good running routes?",
