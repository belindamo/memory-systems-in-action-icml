  "content": "I think I'll aim to attend at least 3-4 classes per week, including Rachel's classes and some yin yoga classes. I'm really looking forward to exploring the different classes and instructors during the trial period, and I'm excited to try out some new styles and techniques. I've heard great things about the studio's restorative yoga classes, so I might want to try one of those out as well. Additionally, I'm interested in seeing how the studio's community and atmosphere compare to what I've experienced so far.",
