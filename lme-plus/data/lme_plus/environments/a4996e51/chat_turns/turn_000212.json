  "content": "Reusing the 256 permutations of 8-bits can help to achieve a high level of data compression by reducing the number of unique values that need to be stored. This technique is often used in lossless data compression, where the original data must be exactly recoverable from the compressed data. One way to achieve this is by using a technique called Huffman coding, which assigns shorter bit codes to more frequently occurring values and longer codes to less frequently occurring values. By reusing the 256 permutations of 8-bits in this way, it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored while still maintaining the integrity of the original data.",
