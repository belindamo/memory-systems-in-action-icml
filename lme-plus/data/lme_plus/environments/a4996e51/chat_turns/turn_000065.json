  "content": "In some cases, leaders who have been overthrown in a revolution may interact with guards or soldiers who are tasked with keeping them in custody. However, they may also encounter members of the public, who may come to see them out of curiosity or to express their views. For example, after the French Revolution, former King Louis XVI was put on trial and ultimately executed by guillotine. During his trial, he reportedly engaged in conversations with members of the public, including some of his former subjects, who came to see him. Similarly, after the Russian Revolution, there are accounts of the former Tsar Nicholas II and his family interacting with members of the public who came to see them while they were imprisoned. These interactions provide a glimpse into the ways in which leaders who have been overthrown in a revolution may be forced to confront the reality of their changed circumstances and the views of the public.",
