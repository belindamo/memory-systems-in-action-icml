Making it a mindful experience can definitely help you develop a positive association with drinking water.\n\nSpeaking of habits, I've been thinking about my breakfast routine. As you know, I've been having oatmeal with banana and honey every weekday morning since the beginning of the month. I've been enjoying it, but I'm starting to feel like I need a change of pace.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for a healthy breakfast alternative that I could try? Maybe something that would provide a similar energy boost to oatmeal?",
