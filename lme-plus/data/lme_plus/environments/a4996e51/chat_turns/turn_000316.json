The country must satisfy certain eligibility requirements, including the ability to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, and be willing to abide by the principles of the UN Charter.\n\nThe benefits of membership in the United Nations are numerous. Members have a voice in the decision-making process of the United Nations and can participate in all its activities, including the General Assembly, various councils and committees, and peacekeeping missions. Members are also eligible for various forms of assistance and support from the UN and its affiliated agencies, including humanitarian aid, economic development, and technical assistance. Membership in the UN also confers certain privileges and immunities for diplomats and government officials, as well as recognition of their sovereignty and international standing. In short, membership in the United Nations provides a platform for countries to engage with other nations on issues of global concern, and to work together towards common goals and objectives that benefit all peoples and nations.",
