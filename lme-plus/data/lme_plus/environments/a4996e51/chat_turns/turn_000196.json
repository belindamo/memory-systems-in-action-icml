  "content": "Yes, there is data available on the impact of flooding on Venice's cultural and historical landmarks. Repeated flooding and exposure to saltwater have caused considerable damage to the city's buildings and infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a report by UNESCO, around 60% of Venice's historic buildings are at risk of damage from rising sea levels and flooding. This includes well-known landmarks such as St. Mark's Basilica, which has suffered significant damage over the years due to repeated flooding.\n\nSaltwater can also cause significant damage to the city's artwork and artifacts, including frescoes, paintings, and sculptures. Once exposed to saltwater, these items can begin to deteriorate rapidly, leading to permanent damage.\n\nThe report estimates that Venice loses around 3-4 million euros worth of cultural heritage assets each year. This number is expected to rise as sea levels continue to rise and the frequency of flooding increases.\n\nOverall, the impact of flooding on Venice's cultural and historical landmarks is a growing concern, and there is a need for continued investment and attention to preserve these unique treasures for future generations.",
