  "content": "Exactly! Mixing the vanilla powder into the creamer before brewing is a great way to allow the flavors to meld together and intensify. Starting with a small amount, like 1/8 teaspoon, is a good idea, as you can always add more but it's harder to remove excess vanilla flavor.\n\nRemember to mix the vanilla powder into the creamer thoroughly to avoid any lumps or uneven flavor distribution. And don't hesitate to experiment with the ratio of vanilla powder to creamer to find your perfect balance.\n\nI'm excited for you to try this out and experience the delicious combination of French roast coffee, coconut oil creamer, and vanilla powder! If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask.\n\nHappy brewing and enjoy your coffee!",
