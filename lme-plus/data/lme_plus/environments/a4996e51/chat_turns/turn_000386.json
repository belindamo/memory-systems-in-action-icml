Here's a suggested way to divide your kitchen into zones and create a schedule for zone cleaning:\n\n**Kitchen Zones:**\n\n1. **Zone 1: Cooking Station** - Stove, oven, cooktop, and surrounding countertops\n2. **Zone 2: Sink and Prep Area** - Sink, faucet, garbage disposal, and adjacent countertops\n3. **Zone 3: Refrigerator and Freezer** - Refrigerator, freezer, and surrounding countertops\n4. **Zone 4: Dishwashing and Storage** - Dishwasher, cabinets, and countertops near the sink\n5. **Zone 5: Breakfast and Coffee Station** - Coffee maker, toaster, and surrounding countertops\n6. **Zone 6: Pantry and Dry Goods** - Pantry, dry goods storage, and surrounding countertops\n\n**Zone Cleaning Schedule:**\n\n1. **Monday: Zone 1 - Cooking Station**\n\t* Clean the stove, oven, cooktop, and surrounding countertops\n\t* Wipe down appliances, knobs, and handles\n2. **Tuesday: Zone 2 - Sink and Prep Area**\n\t* Clean the sink, faucet, and garbage disposal\n\t* Wipe down countertops and tidy up the prep area\n3. **Wednesday: Zone 3 - Refrigerator and Freezer**\n\t* Wipe down the refrigerator, freezer, and surrounding countertops\n\t* Check expiration dates and tidy up contents\n4. **Thursday: Zone 4 - Dishwashing and Storage**\n\t* Clean the dishwasher and surrounding countertops\n\t* Organize cabinets and tidy up dish storage\n5. **Friday: Zone 5 - Breakfast and Coffee Station**\n\t* Clean the coffee maker, toaster, and surrounding countertops\n\t* Wipe down appliances and tidy up the breakfast area\n6. **Saturday: Zone 6 - Pantry and Dry Goods**\n\t* Organize the pantry and tidy up dry goods storage\n\t* Wipe down shelves and containers\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Set a timer for 10-15 minutes per zone to keep yourself on track and focused.\n* Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. For example, if you have a large pantry, divide it into smaller sections to clean each week.\n* Be flexible with your schedule. If you have a particularly busy day, adjust the zone cleaning schedule accordingly.\n* Remember to still wipe down your kitchen counters daily, as part of your daily cleaning routine.\n* Consider setting aside one day a week (e.g., Sunday) for a deeper clean or a \"catch-up\" day, where you can tackle any areas that need extra attention.\n\nBy dividing your kitchen into zones and creating a schedule, you'll be able to maintain a cleaner, more organized kitchen with minimal daily effort. Happy zone cleaning!",
