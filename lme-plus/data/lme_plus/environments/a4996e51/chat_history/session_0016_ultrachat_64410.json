      "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot give medical advice, but generally, experts recommend doing core-strengthening exercises 2-3 times per week, along with other forms of exercise such as cardio and strength training, in order to see results. It's important to listen to your body and not overdo it, especially if you're new to exercising. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of the exercises as you become stronger."

      "content": "Sure! Here are some suggestions for making these core exercises more challenging:\n\n1. Plank: Increase the duration of the hold, starting with 1 minute and working up to 2-3 minutes. You can also try adding a lift by raising one arm or leg off the ground at a time. 2. Bird Dog: Add a resistance band or ankle weights to increase resistance. You can also try lifting your arm and leg higher or holding the position for a longer period of time. 3. Superman: Hold for a longer period of time or add weight by holding a small weight in each hand. 4. Glute Bridge: Try lifting one leg off the ground while you're holding the bridge or adding a resistance band around your lower thighs. 5. Side Plank: Lift your top leg and hold it in the air for the duration of the exercise or try resting your forearm on a stability ball to challenge your balance. Remember, it's important to challenge yourself, but also listen to your body and don't push yourself too hard. Gradually increase the intensity and duration of the exercises as your muscles get stronger."
