      "content": "As a language model, I don't have an updated information about the cost, but here is some general advice:\n\nThe cost of a guided safari in the Serengeti can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including the time of year you're traveling, the type of accommodations you choose, the length of your safari, and the tour operator you choose. However, as a general rule, you should expect to budget at least $3,000 to $5,000 per person for a seven-day safari in the Serengeti.\n\nThis budget should cover the cost of your accommodations, food, transportation, park fees, and guide services. It's important to note that some aspects of your safari, such as flights to Tanzania and visa fees, may not be included in this budget and will need to be factored in separately.\n\nWhen comparing safari packages, make sure to read the fine print and understand exactly what is and isn't included in the price. Additionally, be sure to communicate with your tour operator any specific requirements or preferences you have to ensure you get the most value for your budget.\n\nOverall, while the cost of a safari in the Serengeti can seem high, it's important to keep in mind that the experience of seeing such incredible wildlife and natural beauty is truly priceless."
