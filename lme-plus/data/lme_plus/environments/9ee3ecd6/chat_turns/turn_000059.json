Now, about those flights to the beach...\n\nAs a digital AI assistant, I don't have have access to real-time flight deals or personal preferences. However, I can offer some general tips to help you find affordable flights:\n\n1. **Use flight comparison websites**: Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak, or Hipmunk can help you compare prices across different airlines and find the best deals.\n2. **Be flexible with your travel dates**: Prices can vary greatly depending on the day of the week and time of year. If you have flexibility, use tools like Google Flights' \"Explore\" feature to find the cheapest days to fly.\n3. **Book in advance**: The earlier you book, the better your chances of getting a good deal. Many airlines offer early-bird discounts or promotions for advance bookings.\n4. **Consider alternative airports**: If you have multiple airport options, check prices for each to find the best deal.\n5. **Look for error fares or sales**: Keep an eye on airline websites, social media, or flight deal alert services like Scott's Cheap Flights or The Flight Deal for error fares or limited-time sales.\n6. **Use budget airlines**: If you're willing to fly with a budget airline and don't mind sacrificing some amenities, you might find cheaper options.\n\nFor your specific trip, I recommend setting up price alerts on your preferred flight comparison website or following airlines on social media to stay informed about any deals that might become available.\n\nRemember, focus on completing your report first, and then you can reward yourself by booking those beach flights!",
