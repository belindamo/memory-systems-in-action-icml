Plus, they're both warm-season crops, so they can thrive together in the same growing season.\n\nHere are some tips for planting peas alongside tomatoes:\n\n**Supporting Peas:**\n\n1. **Trellis or Cage:** Provide a trellis or cage for the peas to climb. You can use a wooden or metal trellis, or even a tomato cage with the bars spaced closely enough for the peas to wrap around.\n2. **Netting:** Another option is to use a piece of netting, like a garden net or a section of chicken wire, to create a wall for the peas to climb. Simply attach the netting to stakes or a fence.\n3. **Tepee:** Create a tepee structure using bamboo stakes or wooden dowels. This will give the peas a fun, whimsical place to climb.\n\n**Tips for Planting Peas with Tomatoes:**\n\n1. **Plant peas on the north side:** Since peas are climbers, plant them on the north side of the tomato plants to avoid shading the tomatoes.\n2. **Use a low-growing tomato variety:** Choose a compact or dwarf tomato variety that won't grow too tall and overshadow the peas.\n3. **Plant peas at the same time:** Sow pea seeds at the same time as your tomato seedlings, or shortly after. This will give the peas a head start on climbing up the support.\n4. **Keep the soil moist:** Peas prefer well-draining, moist soil. Make sure to water them regularly, especially when they're producing flowers and pods.\n5. **Harvest peas regularly:** Regular harvesting will encourage the peas to produce more flowers and pods.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to enjoy a bountiful harvest of peas and tomatoes from your garden!",
