In response to the drug testing controversy, the organizers tightened their rules around the use of supplements, and set up a task force to investigate any positive drug tests. In response to the medal tally controversy, the organizers defended their method of calculating the table, but did agree to review it for future games. Regarding the black armband protest, the organizers acknowledged the athletes' right to express their views, but also emphasized the need for inclusivity and diversity during the Games. In response to the security concerns, the organizers worked closely with local law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of athletes and spectators.
