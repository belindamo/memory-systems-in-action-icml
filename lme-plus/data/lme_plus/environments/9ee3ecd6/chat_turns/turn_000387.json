You can speed up the cooling process by placing the container in an ice bath or by stirring in a small amount of cold water or ice.\n2. **Refrigerate promptly**: Once cooled, refrigerate the food at 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below within 2 hours of cooking. Use shallow containers to help the food cool faster and prevent moisture from accumulating.\n\n**Storage Containers**\n\n1. **Airtight containers**: Use airtight, shallow containers with tight-fitting lids to prevent moisture and other contaminants from entering.\n2. **Glass or BPA-free plastic**: Opt for glass or BPA-free plastic containers, as they're non-porous and won't absorb flavors or odors.\n3. **Label and date containers**: Label each container with the contents and date, so you can easily keep track of what you have and how long it's been stored.\n\n**Storage Times**\n\n1. **Cooked food**: Cooked food can be safely stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.\n2. **Soups and stews**: These can be stored for 5 to 7 days in the refrigerator or frozen for 2-3 months.\n3. **Grains and vegetables**: Cooked grains and vegetables can be stored for 3 to 5 days in the refrigerator.\n\n**Freezing**\n\n1. **Freezer-safe containers**: Use freezer-safe containers or freezer bags to prevent freezer burn and other damage.\n2. **Portion control**: Divide cooked food into individual portions before freezing to make it easier to thaw and reheat only what you need.\n3. **Label and date freezer bags**: Label and date freezer bags or containers with the contents and date, so you can easily keep track of what you have and how long it's been stored.\n4. **Freezer storage times**: Cooked food can be safely frozen for 3-4 months. When reheating, make sure the food reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n\n**Reheating**\n\n1. **Reheat to 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C)**: When reheating cooked food, make sure it reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n2. **Use a food thermometer**: Use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the food, especially when reheating meat, poultry, and dairy products.\n\nBy following these tips, you can enjoy your meal prep creations while ensuring food safety and freshness. Happy meal prepping!",
