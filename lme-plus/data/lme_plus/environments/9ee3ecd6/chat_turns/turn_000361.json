  "content": "VOOC is a proprietary fast charging technology, and the PowerCore 10,000 doesn't natively support it. However, as I mentioned earlier, the PowerIQ port on the PowerCore 10,000 can still charge your phone quickly, although it might not reach the same speeds as the VOOC charger. You can still try using the PowerCore 10,000 to charge your phone, and you might be surprised by its performance.\n\nRegarding your wireless charging pad and the built-in screen protector on your new case, it's unlikely to affect the charging speed or efficiency significantly. Most wireless charging pads use a technology called Qi (pronounced \"chee\"), which transmits power through a magnetic field. The built-in screen protector on your case is typically thin and won't interfere with this magnetic field.\n\nHowever, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Thickness**: If the built-in screen protector is very thick or raises the phone's surface significantly, it might reduce the efficiency of wireless charging. But in most cases, this shouldn't be a problem.\n2. **Material**: Some screen protectors might be made of materials that can interfere with wireless charging, such as metal or magnetic materials. But most screen protectors are designed to be compatible with wireless charging, so this is unlikely to be an issue.\n3. **Alignment**: Make sure to place your phone on the wireless charging pad correctly, with the coil in the phone aligned with the coil in the charging pad. This ensures efficient energy transfer.\n\nTo be safe, you can try removing the case and testing wireless charging without it to see if there's any difference. But in general, a built-in screen protector should not significantly affect wireless charging performance.\n\nIf you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
