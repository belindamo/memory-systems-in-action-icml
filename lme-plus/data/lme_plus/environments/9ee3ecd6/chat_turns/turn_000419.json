  "content": "Sure! Here are some ways to deal with disappointment and frustration after receiving negative feedback from an interview:\n\n1. Take a break - Give yourself some time to process your emotions and reset. Take a day or two off to relax, do something you enjoy, and take care of yourself. 2. Talk to someone - Talk to a trusted friend or family member about how you are feeling. Sharing your thoughts and emotions with someone you trust can help you feel better and gain a fresh perspective. 3. Reframe your thinking - Instead of thinking of the negative feedback as a failure, try to see it as an opportunity for growth and learning. Reframe your thinking to focus on what you can do differently next time. 4. Identify your strengths - Remember your strengths and what you bring to the table. Make a list of your strengths, accomplishments, and qualities, and remind yourself of them when you're feeling down. 5. Practice self-care - Take care of yourself by doing things that make you feel good. Exercise, eat healthy, and get enough rest. Doing things for yourself can help you feel better and more positive. 6. Keep things in perspective - Remember that one interview does not define your entire career or value as a person. Keep things in perspective and know that setbacks are a natural part of the process.",
