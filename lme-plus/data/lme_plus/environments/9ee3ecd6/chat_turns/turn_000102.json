Provide a detailed recap of each part of the sales call transcript to help the sales manager gain a complete detailed understanding of the deal. Use a sales framework. \n\nTranscript part 3 (10m28s-20m4s our of 29m02s):\n\n\"20m 15s Matt Brown though.\n20m 15s Matt Brown So like if we wanted to deploy Wall to Wall right away that's, where we'd hook into Okta and just have everybody set up.\n20m 22s Matt Brown That would mean they are a billable user.\n20m 24s Matt Brown If you are doing more of a partial rollout in stages, what we would want to do is we do have more of a a manual in the sense that you could provide the the CSV list of those users.\n20m 37s Matt Brown We can import that directly and have just those users be paid users while at the same time opening up access for there to be organic growth from those other teams as well.\n20m 50s Matt Brown So all that to say is we do have some options which include a full wall to wall deployment right at once.\n20m 57s Matt Brown Or if we do want to go organically, we would have more of like a quarterly true up system where it's like, hey, we start at 500 users.\n21m 5s Matt Brown The next quarter we've bumped up to 750 and so on and so forth. So we would work with you on a quarterly basis just to get that set\n21m 15s Nick Sarkesian up. So how does that true Upwork? Is it we have 500 licenses. All of them are on enterprise and then maybe we have 600 users on a free version.\n21m 30s Nick Sarkesian They want to get on enterprise. We can then add them another 100 licenses like mid-quarter.\n21m 36s Nick Sarkesian And then at the end of the quarter, we drew up and look at how much, how long those people will use those additional licenses, and then you charge us for it How. does that how does that operate?\n21m 46s Nick Sarkesian Yeah, that's a good question. So\n21m 48s Matt Brown what we would do is, first and foremost, we don't hear the the access. So we can't do say 500 enterprise 100 pro 53. It would be all or nothing from that perspective.\n22m 1s Matt Brown But once we were agree agreed upon a particular rollout. So initial rollout of let's say 500, I know that number has been thrown around.\n22m 9s Matt Brown We would build for those 500 users. But then what we would do is, is flat rate the plan.\n22m 15s Matt Brown So that means that any additional users that wanted to be added to Fellow, you wouldn't have to come and there wouldn't be that bottleneck of having to go to your account manager or to message support before those team members.\n22m 30s Matt Brown Got it. You could just add them the day of and then when that billing period comes up. So if we are doing that quarterly true up, we would go back in and see who's been active for that last period and just.\n22m 44s Matt Brown Adjust accordingly.\n22m 47s Nick Sarkesian So is going backwards then. So if we\n22m 50s Trina Berks start 600 people use it, but then they realize they don't really care to use it And. now we only have 500. Can we go backwards?\n22m 59s Trina Berks Yeah. I mean, theoretically\n23m 1s Matt Brown could I think that would be certainly a missed opportunity for for both parties, though, right. Like we don't want to we don't want to overbuild something right away and then have to claw it back.\n23m 11s Matt Brown I don't think that's the objective of of either side. What we would want to do is start with those users who are already committed to it right away.\n23m 20s Matt Brown And, you know, I realize getting that initial initial momentum might seem a little daunting. But we do have the methodology here at Fellow.\n23m 27s Matt Brown We do have the resources to help ramp that up. And then, as you've already experienced, it is pretty viral. Once you know, the team members who have it are showing it to the team members who might not.\n23m 40s Matt Brown They can, especially with ACTA.\n23m 42s Trina Berks So if we throw it an OCTA, then people see this new thing and like, Oh, what's this shiny new object? They click on it twice and then never\n23m 48s Matt Brown touch it again. We could see a big spike, I\n23m 52s Trina Berks feel like. And what we're going to do from our\n23m 54s Matt Brown side is we we can certainly tell who's like an active user versus who's signed in once Trina. So we're not going to be like, oh, you know, every because we opened it up to OCTA all, all 1500 team members added it.\n24m 7s Matt Brown We can go back and look and say, oh, you know what, it's actually just 500 users who are using it on a on an active basis.\n24m 14s Matt Brown So we don't okay.\n24m 16s Trina Berks We certainly don't want\n24m 19s Matt Brown to do that. That doesn't leave a really good taste in any of our clients mouth. Okay. So just 5 minutes left.\n24m 32s Matt Brown Just in terms of wrap up, what I will send over in terms of our recap packet is security compliance documentation a little bit more about our TA integration as well.\n24m 42s Matt Brown Get the SOC to Mbda sent over for DocuSign signature. I will also send over the JIRA integration too.\n24m 52s Matt Brown And then in terms of like initial pricing, is there like a scope or deployment that you'd like some initial pricing on first or is it all to premature to chat about that?\n25m 5s Matt Brown I'm just curious, like where the next steps would look like for the team internally? I would say I know Matthew and I talked\n25m 14s Eric Cameron briefly. We got like Lucas, for instance and, my team back on the system. I would say in the short term, let's activate pro\n25m 23s Nick Sarkesian licenses for those I know you're holding on billing\n25m 26s Eric Cameron and then because we are so kind of testing it out.\n25m 29s Eric Cameron But I do want Nic and team to feel good about all the documentation that you send over before we make any enterprise level decisions 100%.\n25m 39s Eric Cameron I'll also\n25m 40s Matt Brown provide a little bit more overview of like our onboarding methodology as well.\n25m 45s Matt Brown So once you would commit to the enterprise rollout plan and we do have a 30 day robust methodology to get everybody from that that paid license perspective up and running.\n25m 58s Matt Brown Yeah. Thank you. That's good.\n25m 59s Eric Cameron Yeah. Probably just from a. Timing perspective just so you have some awareness. We probably wouldn't look to fully kick this off at an enterprise level until the beginning of next year.\n26m 16s Matt Brown Sanders just. In the meantime, though, I think this is where we can really begin to build that momentum.\n26m 24s Matt Brown One out of all of the the already converted advocates of Fellow and then to being able to to collaborate with those team members who might not have seen it yet.\n26m 35s Matt Brown We can do that.\n26m 37s Eric Cameron Just lastly Eric,, sorry. Just\n26m 40s Matt Brown so to to shore up on billing because I know I had paused it. So we do have active for the past month we do have 20 users already going back.\n26m 54s Matt Brown So what I can do is just flip that over to our pro annual rate and then additional users depending on how you want to configure your your workspace settings can either be invited by other current paid users or alternatively we can restrict it.\n27m 11s Matt Brown So they have to come in through whether it's you or Nick, Trina or Coop or any of the other admins like which. How would you prefer in terms of workspace configuration?\n27m 23s Matt Brown Uh, next.\n27m 25s Eric Cameron Who would you rather that come in?\n27m 26s Eric Cameron It's fine to come in through me, but if you wanted to come in through your team, that's totally probably makes more sense over the long term.\n27m 34s Eric Cameron Yeah, we can do that.\n27m 36s Nick Sarkesian So, Nick. Katrina which,\n27m 38s Eric Cameron view makes sense?\n27m 43s Nick Sarkesian Yeah. Both. Just in case one\n27m 47s Eric Cameron of us is. Yeah. I'll take a little time\n27m 51s Nick Sarkesian off or something, right? Yeah, no problem. We can do that.\n27m 54s Matt Brown I know Tyler and Alex are the only two admins at this point in time, so I can make the three of you admins as well.\n28m 2s Matt Brown And then so my recommendation would be to keep that open only because that's going to encourage that organic growth, at least in the short term, be able to build that momentum.\n28m 13s Matt Brown So come next month or the month after, as we get a better estimate of what that first enterprise deployment stage would look like, we have a more accurate\n28m 24s Eric Cameron picture. Sounds good. Could you? Would you be able to remove Tyler and Alex's admins and just add me, Nick and Trina as admins?\n28m 34s Eric Cameron Absolutely. I know\n28m 35s Matt Brown Alex is fine with that. Him and I talked about that, so\n28m 38s Eric Cameron he's fine to be removed. Yeah. Not a problem So.\n28m 42s Matt Brown I will. I will get that ball rolling as well. And I'll send you an email confirmation after the recap, just to let you know that's been completed.\n28m 52s Matt Brown Sounds great. Anybody\n28m 53s Eric Cameron else have any other questions or are we good? No, I'm good here. Okay.\n29m 0s Nick Sarkesian All right. Thanks. I appreciate it. Thanks so\n29m 2s Eric Cameron much. Have a great day. Bye. Feel.\"",
