Here's an activity idea that you could consider:\n\nActivity: \"Escape Room Challenge\"\n\nBriefing (5 minutes):\nExplain to the group that they will be participating in an \"Escape Room Challenge.\" Their mission is to solve a series of clues and puzzles in order to escape the room before time runs out. Split the group into smaller teams (4-6 members per team) and assign each team a team name.\n\nIce-Break Game (10 minutes):\nBefore starting the escape room challenge, have the teams participate in a quick ice-breaker game called \"Two Truths and a Lie.\" Each team member will come up with three statements about themselves - two that are true and one that is a lie. The rest of the team will then try to guess which statement is the lie. This game will help the team members get to know each other better and work more effectively together during the challenge.\n\nEscape Room Challenge (15 minutes):\nSet up a series of clues and puzzles around the room that the teams will need to solve in order to escape. You can use a variety of puzzle types, such as cryptograms, jigsaw puzzles, word scrambles, riddles, etc. Make sure that the clues are challenging but not too difficult that the teams become discouraged.\n\nThe first team to solve all of the clues and escape the room wins. However, if none of the teams are able to escape within the 15 minutes time frame, you can declare the team that made the most progress as the winner.\n\nDebriefing (5 minutes):\nAfter the challenge, gather the teams together and ask them to reflect on their experience. Ask them to share what strategies they used to solve the clues and how they worked together as a team. You can also use this time to discuss any lessons learned or skills developed during the challenge that can be applied to real-life situations.\n\nOverall, the \"Escape Room Challenge\" is a fun and engaging activity that promotes teamwork and problem-solving skills. The ice-breaker game at the beginning will help the teams bond and work more effectively together during the challenge. The debriefing will allow the teams to reflect on their experience and identify key takeaways.",
