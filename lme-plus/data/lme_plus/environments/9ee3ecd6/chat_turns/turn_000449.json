  "content": "INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\nPutin and Trump sit across from each other at a small, intimate table. Trump fiddles with his tie, looking uncomfortable. Putin sips from his glass of vodka, eyeing Trump with interest.\n\nTRUMP: So, uh, how's it going?\n\nPUTIN: (smirks) It's going well. How about you, Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: (nervously) Yeah, good. Just, uh, trying to make small talk, you know.\n\nPUTIN: (raises an eyebrow) Is that so?\n\nTRUMP: (nervously laughs) Yeah, just trying to break the ice.\n\nPUTIN: (leans in) I think we can do better than that.\n\nTRUMP: (leans back) Oh? Like what?\n\nPUTIN: (smirks) Why don't we skip the small talk and get to know each other on a more... personal level?\n\nTRUMP: (looks surprised) Uh, I don't know if that's such a good idea.\n\nPUTIN: (smirks) Come on, Mr. Trump. Don't be shy. I promise you, it will be... enlightening.\n\nTRUMP: (hesitates, then leans in) Well, okay. But just for a little bit.\n\nPUTIN: (smirks) Of course, Mr. Trump. Just for a little bit.\n\nThey lean in closer to each other, their faces inches apart.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nTHE END.",
