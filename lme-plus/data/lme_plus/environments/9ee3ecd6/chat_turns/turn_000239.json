Community involvement: Community involvement is essential for sustainability, and initiatives should be developed with active involvement from local residents. This will help ensure that the initiatives are designed to meet the needs and expectations of the community, and to work within the cultural and social norms.\n\n3. Sustainable financing: Sustainable financing is crucial to the initiatives' sustainability in the long term. Funding models, including public-private partnerships or other revenue models, should be considered, and budgets should be allocated for maintenance and upkeep.\n\n4.
