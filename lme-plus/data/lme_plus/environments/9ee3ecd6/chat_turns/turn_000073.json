The objective of the activity is to help each participant understand what they are good at and how they can use those strengths to achieve their goals.\n\nIce-Break Game (5 minutes):\nBefore starting the activity, have the group play a quick ice-breaker game called \"Human Knot.\" Have everyone stand in a circle and put their hands in the center. Each person should grab the hand of someone across from them, making sure that no one is holding hands with someone next to them. Then, have the group work together to untangle themselves without letting go of each other's hands. This game will help the group bond and work together.\n\n\"My Strengths, My Goals\" Activity (10 minutes):\nProvide each participant with a worksheet that has two sections: \"My Strengths\" and \"My Goals.\" In the \"My Strengths\" section, ask them to write down 3-5 strengths they possess. Encourage them to think about skills they have developed, things they are passionate about, and any experiences that have helped them grow.\n\nIn the \"My Goals\" section, ask them to write down 2-3 short-term goals and 1-2 long-term goals that they would like to achieve. Encourage them to think about goals that are meaningful to them and align with their strengths.\n\nAfter everyone has completed their worksheets, have them pair up with someone they don't know well. Each participant should share their strengths and goals with their partner and discuss how they can use their strengths to achieve their goals.\n\nDebriefing (5 minutes):\nGather the group together and ask for volunteers to share what they learned about themselves during the activity. You can also ask if anyone discovered any surprising strengths or goals. This debriefing will help reinforce the idea that everyone has unique strengths and talents that they can use to achieve their goals.\n\nOverall, the \"My Strengths, My Goals\" activity is a fun and engaging way to help teenagers identify their strengths and set goals based on those strengths. The ice-breaker game will help the group bond and work together, and the debriefing will allow for reflection and sharing of insights.",
