  "content": "Applying Scott Boorman's insights from \"The Protracted Game\", Andy Marshall's insights from \"Long-Term Competition with the Soviets\", and James Carse's insights from \"Finite and Infinite Games\", characterize the contrasting strategic views of China and the United States in terms of great power competition and the likelihood of military conflict over Taiwan. Identify blind spots or areas of potential misunderstanding that US leaders may get wrong about China and the same where Chinese leaders may get wrong about the US. Based on this analysis what policy recommendations would you provide to the Secretary of Defense at the strategic level? What force design and concept recommendations would you provide to the INDO-PACOM Combatant Commander and the USSOCOM Combatant Commander at the operational level? What employment recommendations would you provide to a Special Operations element leader in the Pacific Area of Responsibility at the tactical level? Provide insights in each category that aim to deter Chinese aggression through cost imposition and build US capability to defeat an invasion of Taiwan, if necessary. Make sure your reply is smart, clear, and professional. Incorporate expert insights and intelligent perspectives.",
