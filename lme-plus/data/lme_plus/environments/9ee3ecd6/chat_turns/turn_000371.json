  "content": "LYNX light rail operates seven days a week with trains arriving every 10-20 minutes during peak hours and every 20-30 minutes during off-peak hours. The exact frequency can vary depending on the time of day and the day of the week. \n\nThe LYNX light rail covers a significant portion of Charlotte, with a total of 26 stations running from I-485 at South Boulevard to UNC Charlotte\u2019s main campus in the northeast. However, there are still some areas that are not covered by the LYNX such as South Charlotte and the suburbs. In these areas, bus services are often the primary means of public transportation.",
