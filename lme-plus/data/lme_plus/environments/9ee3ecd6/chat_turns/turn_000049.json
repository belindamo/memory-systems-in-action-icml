  "content": "Companion planting is a great approach to creating a healthy and balanced garden ecosystem.\n\nMarigolds are an excellent choice to plant with tomatoes, as they do help deter nematodes, which can be a significant problem for tomatoes. Nematodes are microscopic worms that attack the roots of plants, causing damage and reducing yields.\n\nWhen planting marigolds with tomatoes, the general rule of thumb is to plant them around 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away from the tomato plants. This distance allows the marigolds to spread their roots and release their nematode-deterring compounds without competing with the tomatoes for resources.\n\nHere are some additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n1. Plant marigolds around the perimeter of your tomato bed or intersperse them among the tomato plants. This will help create a barrier against nematodes and other pests.\n2. Use a mix of French marigold (Tagetes patula) and African marigold (Tagetes erecta) varieties, as they have different growth habits and will provide a more comprehensive defense against nematodes.\n3. Plant marigolds at the same time as your tomatoes or even a few weeks before to give them a head start in establishing themselves.\n4. Make sure to plant marigolds in well-draining soil with full sun to partial shade, as they prefer these conditions.\n5. Keep in mind that while marigolds can help deter nematodes, they may not completely eliminate the problem. Consider using other methods, such as crop rotation, solarization, or using nematode-resistant tomato varieties, to further manage nematode populations.\n\nBy planting marigolds with your tomatoes, you'll not only help deter nematodes but also attract beneficial insects, like bees and butterflies, to your garden. Happy planting!",
