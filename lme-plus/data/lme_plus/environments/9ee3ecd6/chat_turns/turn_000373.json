  "content": "The frequency and coverage of bus services in Charlotte vary depending on the route and time of day. During peak hours, buses often run every 10-15 minutes, while during off-peak hours they may run every 30 minutes to an hour. \n\nThe CATS (Charlotte Area Transit System) bus network covers a large area of Charlotte, including suburban areas. However, it is worth noting that some areas are better covered than others. Additionally, due to traffic congestion, buses can occasionally experience delays during peak hours, which can affect their reliability.\n\nOverall, while bus services in Charlotte may not be as frequent or reliable as the LYNX light rail, they are still a viable option for getting around the city, with over 70 local and express routes.",
