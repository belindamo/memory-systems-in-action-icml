  "content": "New gardening tools are always exciting! Congratulations on your new trowel and pruners, and I hope you enjoy using them in your garden.\n\nNow, about those tomatoes... Companion planting is a great way to create a harmonious and healthy garden ecosystem. Here are some excellent companion plants for tomatoes:\n\n1. **Basil**: A classic combination! Basil repels pests that target tomatoes, such as whiteflies and aphids, and adds flavor to many tomato dishes.\n2. **Marigold**: These bright flowers repel nematodes, which can harm tomatoes, and also deter aphids and other pests.\n3. **Borage**: Attracts beneficial insects, like bees, and improves tomato flavor and texture.\n4. **Chives**: Repel aphids and other pests, and their onion-like scent can help deter diseases that affect tomatoes.\n5. **Oregano**: A natural fungicide, oregano helps prevent diseases like early blight and septoria leaf spot.\n6. **Parsley**: Similar to basil, parsley repels pests that target tomatoes and adds fresh flavor to salads and sauces.\n7. **Carrots**: Tomatoes and carrots have different growth patterns, making them a great pair. Carrots also help to break up compacted soil.\n8. **Radish**: Radishes can help to repel cucumber beetles, which can spread bacterial wilt to tomatoes.\n9. **Beans**: The \"Three Sisters\" method pairs tomatoes with beans and corn. Beans provide shade, fix nitrogen, and create a trellis for the tomatoes.\n10. **Comfrey**: Acts as a fertilizer plant, adding nutrients to the soil that benefit tomatoes.\n\nRemember to plant companions according to their growing requirements and space needs. Also, keep in mind that some plants, like members of the Brassica family (broccoli, kale, etc.), can inhibit tomato growth, so it's best to keep them separate.\n\nEnjoy your new gardening tools and happy planting!",
