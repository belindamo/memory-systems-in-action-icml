  "content": "I like those make-ahead breakfast ideas, especially the overnight oats and breakfast burritos. I usually have scrambled eggs with whole wheat toast and a glass of orange juice during the week, but on Sundays, I like to indulge in a bigger breakfast like pancakes and bacon after sleeping in till 9 am. Do you have any suggestions on how to incorporate more fruits and veggies into my meals, especially during lunchtime?",
