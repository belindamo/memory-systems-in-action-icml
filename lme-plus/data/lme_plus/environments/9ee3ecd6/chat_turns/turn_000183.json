Compost can work wonders for improving soil structure, water retention, and fertility. Here are some benefits you can expect:\n\n**Improved Water Retention:** Compost helps to increase the soil's water-holding capacity, reducing the need for frequent watering and minimizing runoff.\n\n**Better Drainage:** Compost also improves soil drainage, preventing waterlogged soil and reducing the risk of root rot.\n\n**Increased Fertility:** Compost is rich in nutrients, which are released slowly as they break down, providing a steady supply of food for your plants.\n\n**Supports Beneficial Microbes:** Compost is a food source for beneficial microorganisms in the soil, which helps to create a balanced and healthy soil ecosystem.\n\n**Soil Structure:** Compost can help to break up clay soils, improve the structure of sandy soils, and increase the overall aeration of the soil.\n\nWhen to add compost:\n\n* If you're planting new tomatoes and peas, mix 2-4 inches of compost into the soil before planting.\n* If you're already growing plants, you can top-dress the soil with a 1-2 inch layer of compost around the base of the plants.\n\nTips for using compost:\n\n* Make sure the compost is fully broken down and has an earthy, humus-like aroma. Avoid using hot or unfinished compost, as it can burn your plants.\n* Mix the compost into the soil well, rather than leaving it in clumps.\n* Consider making your own compost using kitchen scraps, leaves, and other organic materials. This will help reduce waste and create a nutrient-rich soil amendment tailored to your garden's needs.\n\nBy adding compost to your soil, you'll be giving your tomatoes and peas the best possible start in life. Happy gardening!",
