  "content": "Yes, although the set of integers is infinite, it is still a subset of the set of rational numbers. This means that there are many more rational numbers than there are integers. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, so all integers are rational numbers, but not all rational numbers are integers. For example, the number 1.5 is a rational number, but it is not an integer. Because there are an infinite number of rational numbers that are not integers, the set of rational numbers is larger than the set of integers.",
