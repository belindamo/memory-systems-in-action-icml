For example, Macy's has installed smart mirrors that offer fashion tips and outfit suggestions for customers.\n\n3. Mobile apps: Many retailers have their own mobile apps that offer features such as exclusive promotions, personalized recommendations, and in-store maps. Target's app, for example, allows customers to scan product barcodes for more information and pricing.\n\n4. Virtual reality (VR): Retailers are also using VR technology to create immersive shopping experiences. For example, IKEA has a VR app that allows customers to design and explore different room styles.\n\n5.
