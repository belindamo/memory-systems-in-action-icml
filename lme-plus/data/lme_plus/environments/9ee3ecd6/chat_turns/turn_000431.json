  "content": "Of course, I'd be happy to help you find a great moisturizer at Sephora. To give you the best recommendations, could you please tell me a bit more about your skin type and concerns? For example:\n\n1. What is your skin type: normal, dry, oily, combination, acne-prone, sensitive, or mature?\n2. Do you have any specific skin concerns, such as acne, hyperpigmentation, fine lines, or dehydration?\n3. Are you looking for a lightweight, non-greasy moisturizer or something more rich and nourishing?\n4. Are there any specific ingredients you're looking for or avoiding (e.g. SPF, fragrance-free, natural ingredients)?\n5. Do you have a budget in mind for the moisturizer?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your skin needs, I can suggest some great options from Sephora that would suit you well!",
