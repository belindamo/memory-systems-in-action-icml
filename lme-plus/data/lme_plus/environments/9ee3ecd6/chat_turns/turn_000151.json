  "content": "Excellent choices! The Kong Wobbler and Tricky Treat Ball are both fantastic options for challenging and engaging Luna.\n\nYou can definitely fill them with Luna's favorite treats, like freeze-dried chicken or salmon. In fact, using high-value treats can make the puzzle toys even more appealing and motivating for her.\n\nHere are some tips for filling the puzzle toys with treats:\n\n* **Freeze-dried treats**: You can use freeze-dried chicken or salmon as is, or break them into smaller pieces to make them easier to dispense from the puzzle toy.\n* **Kibble**: You can also use Luna's regular kibble as a filler, but you may want to mix it with some higher-value treats to make it more appealing.\n* **Treat size**: Choose treats that are small enough to fit through the openings of the puzzle toy. You can also cut larger treats into smaller pieces to make them fit.\n* **Treat quantity**: Start with a small amount of treats and refill the puzzle toy as needed. You can adjust the amount based on Luna's skill level and interest.\n* **Mix it up**: Rotate the types of treats and puzzle toys regularly to keep things interesting and challenging for Luna.\n\nRemember to supervise Luna when introducing the puzzle toys, especially if she's new to interactive toys. Encourage her to play and problem-solve by sprinkling a few treats around the toy to entice her to figure it out.\n\nAs Luna becomes more confident and skilled, you can increase the difficulty level by adding more treats, changing the type of treats, or using multiple puzzle toys at once. The goal is to keep her engaged, challenged, and happy!\n\nHow do you think you'll introduce the puzzle toy to Luna? Will you start with a simple filling or try to challenge her right away?",
