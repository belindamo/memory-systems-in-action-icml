  "content": "Okay, let me explain it to you like you're 5 years old.\n\nIn a centralized system, there is one big boss who tells everyone what time it is. So, if you ask anyone in the system what time it is, they will all give you the same answer. It's like when you ask your teacher what time it is in class, and she tells everyone at the same time.\n\nThis makes it easy for everyone to agree on what time it is, because there is only one answer. It's like when you and your friends all agree to play a game at the same time. You all start playing together, because you all agreed on the same time to start.\n\nSo, in a centralized system, time is unambiguous, which means everyone knows what time it is and agrees on it. It's like when you and your family all eat dinner at the same time every night. You all know when it's time to eat, and you all eat together.",
