Using a combination of chronological and event-based organization can help you quickly find specific photos and relive the memories of your trips.\n\nFor your Red Rock Canyon and Lake Tahoe trips, you could create folders or albums with the following structure:\n\n* 2023\n\t+ October\n\t\t- 15 - Red Rock Canyon\n\t\t\t- Photos from the trip, including scenic views, hiking trails, and any notable landmarks\n\t\t- 22 - Lake Tahoe\n\t\t\t- Photos from the trip, including sunrise shots, beach activities, and scenic views\n\nThis structure allows you to easily navigate to the specific date and event, and then view all the photos from that trip. You can also add subfolders or tags to further categorize the photos within each event folder.\n\nSome additional tips to consider:\n\n* Use descriptive folder and file names to help you quickly identify the contents. For example, \"Red Rock Canyon - Scenic Drive\" or \"Lake Tahoe - Sunrise at Sand Harbor\".\n* Consider adding a brief description or caption to each folder or album to provide context and help you remember the details of the trip.\n* If you have a large number of photos, you might consider creating separate folders for different types of photos, such as \"Landscapes\", \"Wildlife\", or \"Portraits\".\n* Don't forget to back up your photos to an external hard drive or cloud storage service to ensure they're safe and accessible in case something happens to your computer or device.\n\nBy organizing your photos in a way that makes sense to you, you'll be able to enjoy reliving your memories and sharing them with others for years to come!",
