  "content": "I'd be happy to help! However, to provide you with accurate information, I need to know your location. Could you please tell me your city, state, or zip code? That way, I can give you the average temperature and sunlight hours for your specific area during this time of year.\n\nAdditionally, it would be helpful to know what time of year it is currently in your area. Are you in the Northern Hemisphere or Southern Hemisphere? Are you in the midst of spring, summer, fall, or winter?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with more tailored advice on planting your tomato seedlings outside.",
