  "content": "No, the number of integers is still a finite set, while the number of rational numbers is also infinite. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, such as 3/4 or 22/7. This includes all integers, as well as many other numbers that can be represented as a simple fraction. Because there are an infinite number of rational numbers, there are many more rational numbers than there are integers.",
