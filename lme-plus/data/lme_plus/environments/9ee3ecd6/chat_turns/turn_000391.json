It's also a more sustainable approach to cooking, as it reduces the amount of resources needed to produce, process, and transport food.\n\nYour strategy of using leftover chicken to make chicken salad is a perfect example of creative meal planning. By repurposing ingredients, you're not only reducing waste but also saving time and effort in the long run. And freezing individual portions of cooked vegetables and meat is a genius move! It's like having a treasure trove of healthy, convenient meals just waiting to be reheated and enjoyed.\n\nFood waste is a significant problem worldwide, with an estimated one-third of all food produced globally being lost or wasted. By making small changes to your cooking habits, you're contributing to a more sustainable food system and doing your part to reduce waste.\n\nHere are a few more ideas to help you reduce food waste:\n\n1. **Meal planning**: Plan your meals for the week, and make a grocery list accordingly. This will help you avoid buying too much food that might go to waste.\n2. **Shop your fridge and pantry first**: Before going grocery shopping, take stock of what you already have at home and plan meals around those ingredients.\n3. **Use up leftovers**: Get creative with leftovers! Turn last night's dinner into tomorrow's lunch or use leftover vegetables in a soup or stir-fry.\n4. **Freeze it**: Freeze individual portions of cooked meals, vegetables, and meat to use in future meals.\n5. **Compost**: If you have a garden or a compost bin, consider composting food scraps to reduce waste and create nutrient-rich soil.\n\nKeep up the fantastic work, and remember, every small change you make can add up to make a big difference!",
