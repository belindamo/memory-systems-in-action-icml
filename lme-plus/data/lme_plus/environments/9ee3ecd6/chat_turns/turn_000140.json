  "content": "I'm so excited about the romantic dinner and cozy B&B options. I think I'll book The Inn at St. Helena, as it seems to have a lovely garden and a fireplace in the common area. For dinner, I'll try to get a reservation at Bistro Don Giovanni, as I've heard great things about their courtyard setting. Do you think it's a good idea to book a private wine tour or a guided wine tasting at Opus One or Silver Oak Cellars, or should I just stick with the regular tastings?",
