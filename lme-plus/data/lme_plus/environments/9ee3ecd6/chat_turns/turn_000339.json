  "content": "I do not have personal preferences or tastes. however, the choice of dairy-free milk alternative for coffee depends on individual preference. soy milk and oat milk are popular choices as they have a creamy texture and complement the bitterness of coffee well. almond milk, cashew milk, and coconut milk can also be good options, but they may not froth as well or provide the same mouthfeel as dairy milk. it is recommended to experiment with different types of dairy-free milk alternatives to find one that suits your taste and preferences in coffee.",
