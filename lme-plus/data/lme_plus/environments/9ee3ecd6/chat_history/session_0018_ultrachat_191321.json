      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but it is worth noting that hindsight is always 20/20, and it's easy to criticize the organizers in retrospect. Planning and organizing an event like the Commonwealth Games involves a great deal of complexity and requires coordination with many different stakeholders. The organizers likely did their best to anticipate and address potential issues, but sometimes unforeseen circumstances can arise. Nevertheless, it's important for organizers of large-scale events to be proactive in identifying potential issues and taking steps to minimize their impact, as well as being transparent and accountable when controversies do arise."

It's important to keep in mind that organizing large-scale events is a complex and challenging undertaking, and even with the best planning and preparation, unexpected issues can still arise."
