    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, here are some tips on how to froth oat milk:\n\n1. Use a high-quality oat milk brand that contains extra ingredients like gums and stabilizers, which will help the milk froth better.\n\n2. Make sure the oat milk is cold before frothing it, as warmer milk will not froth as well.\n\n3. Use a frother, like an electric milk frother or a handheld frother, to froth the oat milk. Place the frother in the milk and froth for 20-30 seconds until the milk begins to thicken and create bubbles.\n\n4. If frothing by hand, pour the oat milk into a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake vigorously for about 30 seconds until the milk begins to froth.\n\n5. When done frothing, gently tap the frother or jar on a hard surface to remove any large air bubbles.\n\nAfter frothing, pour the oat milk into your coffee and enjoy!"
