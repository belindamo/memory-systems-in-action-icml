Soak them in water for about 30 minutes to an hour. Drain and rinse before cooking.\n3. **Ratio:** Use a 2:1 ratio of water to lentils. For example, use 2 cups of water for 1 cup of lentils.\n4. **Cooking Method:** You can cook lentils on the stovetop, in a pressure cooker, or in a slow cooker. Stovetop cooking is the most common method.\n5. **Heat Control:** Bring the lentils to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. This helps prevent them from becoming mushy.\n6. **Cooking Time:** Cooking time varies depending on the type of lentils you're using. Here are some general guidelines:\n\t* Green or brown lentils: 20-25 minutes\n\t* Red lentils: 15-20 minutes\n\t* Yellow lentils: 20-25 minutes\n\t* Beluga lentils: 25-30 minutes\n7. **Check for Doneness:** Lentils are done when they're tender and have broken apart slightly. They should still retain some texture and not be mushy.\n8. **Seasoning:** Add salt and any other desired seasonings towards the end of cooking time, as salt can slow down the cooking process.\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n\n* Overcooking: Lentils can become mushy and unappetizing if overcooked.\n* Undercooking: Lentils can be hard and crunchy if undercooked.\n* Not rinsing: Failing to rinse lentils can result in a bitter taste or texture.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to achieve a perfectly cooked batch of lentils with a tender, slightly firm texture. Happy cooking!",
