  "content": "Quinoa Salad is a fantastic way to use up leftover quinoa.\n\nFor the tomatoes, you can use any variety you like, but I'd recommend cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes for this salad. They're sweet, bite-sized, and add a pop of juicy flavor to the dish. If you have them in your pantry, go for it!\n\nIf you don't have cherry or grape tomatoes, you can use diced Roma tomatoes or even canned diced tomatoes as a substitute. Just be sure to drain the excess liquid from the canned tomatoes to avoid making the salad too watery.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Quinoa Salad Recipe**\n\n* 1 cup cooked quinoa (leftover or freshly cooked)\n* 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved\n* 1/2 cup diced cucumber\n* 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper\n* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 tablespoon lemon juice\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, and parsley.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and lemon juice.\n3. Pour the dressing over the quinoa mixture and toss to combine.\n4. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n5. Serve chilled or at room temperature alongside your Lentil and Veggie Burgers.\n\nFeel free to customize the recipe to your taste by adding other ingredients, such as:\n\n* Chopped red onion or scallions for extra flavor\n* Crumbly feta cheese for a tangy kick\n* Chopped fresh mint for a refreshing twist\n* A sprinkle of sumac or paprika for added depth\n\nEnjoy your Quinoa Salad and your meal prep!",
