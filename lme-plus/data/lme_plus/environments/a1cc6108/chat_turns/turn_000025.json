However, I can offer some general tips to help you optimize your commute:\n\n1. **Check traffic updates**: Use a GPS navigation app like Google Maps, Waze, or Apple Maps to get real-time traffic updates and estimated travel times.\n2. **Leave earlier than usual**: Since you've added 10 minutes to your commute, consider leaving 10-15 minutes earlier to account for the extra time.\n3. **Avoid peak hours**: If possible, try to avoid traveling during peak hours (usually 7-9 am and 4-6 pm) when traffic is typically heavier.\n4. **Use traffic patterns**: Observe the traffic patterns on your route and adjust your departure time accordingly. If you notice traffic tends to be lighter at a certain time, try leaving then.\n5. **Consider flexible work hours**: If possible, discuss flexible work hours with your employer to avoid peak traffic hours or adjust your schedule to avoid congested roads.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and leave a bit earlier to account for any unexpected delays. You can also experiment with different departure times to find the optimal time that works best for you.\n\nStay safe and happy commuting!",
