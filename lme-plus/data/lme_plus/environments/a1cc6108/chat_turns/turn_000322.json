  "content": "Repudiatory conduct and termination\n\nThe case of Brewarrina Shire Council v Beckhaus Civil Pty Ltd & 1 Or [2005] NSWCA 248 establishes that in order for a homeowner to claim damages for defective or incomplete work, the building contract must have ended either by a valid termination or by acceptance of repudiatory conduct. This means that homeowners need to understand what constitutes repudiatory conduct and how to properly terminate a contract in order to be able to claim damages.\n\nRepudiatory conduct\n\nRepudiatory conduct occurs when one party to a contract breaches a fundamental term of the contract, or indicates an intention not to perform their obligations under the contract. Examples of repudiatory conduct in a building contract may include:\n\n* Refusing to complete work that is necessary for the completion of the project\n* Failing to meet the agreed deadlines or milestones without a valid excuse\n* Refusing to rectify defective work or to comply with the building code and regulations\n* Abandoning the project without a valid reason\n\nTermination\n\nTermination of a building contract is the legal process by which either party ends the contract. Termination may be carried out in one of two ways:\n\n* Mutual agreement between the parties\n* Unilateral action by one of the parties\n\nIn order to ensure that the termination is valid, homeowners must follow the proper process for terminating a contract. This may involve giving notice of termination in writing, complying with any notice periods required by the contract, and ensuring that the termination is made for a valid reason.\n\nEffect of termination\n\nOnce a building contract has been terminated, homeowners may be able to claim damages for any defective or incomplete work that was carried out prior to the termination. This is because termination of the contract effectively ends the builder's right to carry out any further work on the project, and may give rise to a claim for breach of contract.\n\nTable: Repudiatory conduct and termination\n\n| Repudiatory conduct | Termination | Effect of termination |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Occurs when one party breaches a fundamental term or indicates an intention not to perform their obligations under the contract | May be carried out by mutual agreement or unilateral action by one of the parties | Ends the builder's right to carry out any further work on the project and may give rise to a claim for breach of contract |\n| Examples include refusing to complete work, failing to meet deadlines, refusing to rectify defective work, and abandoning the project | Must follow proper process for termination, including giving notice in writing and complying with any notice periods required by the contract | Homeowners may be able to claim damages for any defective or incomplete work carried out prior to termination |",
