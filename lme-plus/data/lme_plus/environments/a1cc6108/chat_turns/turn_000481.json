Organizing a craft room can be a challenge, but with some creative storage solutions, you can maximize your space and make it a haven for creativity. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Purge and categorize**: You've already done a great job of sorting through your supplies, but take it a step further by categorizing them into groups like paper crafting, jewelry making, sewing, etc. This will help you determine what types of storage you need.\n2. **Use vertical space**: Install shelves, pegboards, or stackable storage units to make the most of your wall space. This will help keep your floors and surfaces clear and make it easier to find what you need.\n3. **Utilize hidden storage**: Look for creative ways to hide storage in plain sight. For example, use decorative bins or baskets to store small items like beads, buttons, or embellishments. You can also use hollowed-out books or decorative boxes to store small supplies.\n4. **Invest in multi-functional furniture**: Consider investing in a craft table or desk with built-in storage, like drawers or shelves. This will help keep your workspace organized and provide a dedicated area for your projects.\n5. **Label and sign**: Labeling your storage containers and shelves will help you quickly find what you need. Consider adding signs or labels to your storage areas to identify what's inside.\n6. **Store projects in progress**: Since you found a bunch of half-finished projects, consider setting up a dedicated area for works-in-progress. This could be a shelf or bin labeled \"WIPs\" or a designated workspace with storage for each project.\n7. **Rotate your supplies**: Store your least-used supplies towards the back or on higher shelves, and keep your frequently used items front and center. This will save you time and energy when searching for supplies.\n8. **Keep it accessible**: Store your supplies in a way that makes them easy to access. For example, if you have a lot of small items like beads or findings, consider using a storage case with individual compartments.\n9. **Consider a cart or island**: A mobile cart or island can provide additional storage and counter space, and can be easily moved around the room as needed.\n10. **Make it pretty**: Don't forget to add some decorative touches to your craft room! A few plants, some inspiring artwork, or a fun rug can make the space feel more inviting and creative.\n\nAs for your ceramic jewelry workshop experience, that sounds like a blast! You might consider setting up a dedicated jewelry-making station in your craft room, with storage for your beads, findings, and other supplies. You could also display your finished pieces in a shadow box or on a jewelry organizer to showcase your creations.\n\nI hope these tips help you create a craft room that's both functional and inspiring!",
