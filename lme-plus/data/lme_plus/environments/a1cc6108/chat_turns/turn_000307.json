  "content": "Here are some additional features you might consider adding to a comprehensive leave management system:\n\n* Leave request history: Allow employees to view a history of their leave requests, including the dates, leave type, status, and comments. This can help employees keep track of their leave usage and plan future leave requests.\n* Leave calendar: Display a calendar view of the leave requests for a specific employee or team, so that employees can easily see when their colleagues are taking leave and plan their own leave requests accordingly.\n* Leave request notifications: Send notifications to employees and managers when a leave request is submitted, approved, or rejected. This can help keep everyone informed and reduce the need for manual follow-up.\n* Leave request templates: Allow employees to save leave request templates for frequently taken leave, such as annual leave or sick leave, to streamline the process of submitting leave requests.\n* Recurring leave requests: Allow employees to set up recurring leave requests, such as weekly or monthly leave, to automate the process of requesting leave.\n* Leave request delegation: Allow managers to delegate their leave approval responsibilities to other managers or HR staff when they are unavailable, to ensure that leave requests are processed in a timely manner.\n* Leave balance tracking: Allow employees to track their leave balance in real-time, so that they can see how much leave they have available and plan their leave requests accordingly.\n\nBy adding these features, you can create a comprehensive leave management system that is more efficient, user-friendly, and responsive to the needs of your organization.",
