Here are a few ideas you might consider:\n\n**Birthday Wish Ideas:**\n\n1. **Wish Tree**: Create a \"wish tree\" by decorating a small branch or a paper tree with ribbons or strings. Have each guest write down a wish or a message for Emily on a small card or a leaf-shaped paper, and then tie it to the tree. Emily can then read the wishes and messages later.\n2. **Birthday Wish Lanterns**: Provide small lanterns or candles for each guest to write a wish or a message on. Then, have them light the lanterns or candles and release them into the air (if outdoors) or place them on a special \"wish table\" (if indoors).\n3. **Magic Wand Wish**: Create a special \"magic wand\" using a decorated stick or a sparkly star-shaped wand. Have each guest take a turn making a wish for Emily while holding the wand. You can even add a special phrase, like \"May all your dreams come true, Emily!\"\n4. **Birthday Crown Ceremony**: Create a special birthday crown for Emily using flowers, ribbons, or other decorations. Have each guest take a turn adding a small decoration or a wish to the crown, and then present it to Emily as a symbol of their love and appreciation.\n5. **Time Capsule**: Create a time capsule with notes, photos, and small mementos from the party. Bury it in the backyard or a special place, and have Emily open it on a future birthday or special occasion.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Make it personal: Tailor the ceremony to Emily's interests and personality.\n* Keep it simple: Don't feel like you need to do something elaborate. A simple ceremony can be just as meaningful.\n* Involve the guests: Encourage each guest to participate in the ceremony, whether it's by making a wish, adding a decoration, or saying a few words.\n* Make it a tradition: Consider making the ceremony a annual tradition, so Emily can look forward to it every year.\n\nI hope these ideas inspire you to create a special birthday wish or ceremony that Emily will cherish forever!",
