  "content": "After checking the websites, I found that the price range for NourishMe facial moisturizers on Skinstore and Dermstore varies depending on the specific product and size. Here's a rough idea of what you can expect:\n\n**Skinstore:**\n\n* NourishMe facial moisturizers: $25 - $45 (1 oz / 30ml)\n* Larger sizes (1.7 oz / 50ml) or sets: $40 - $60\n* Premium or limited-edition products: $50 - $70\n\n**Dermstore:**\n\n* NourishMe facial moisturizers: $28 - $40 (1 oz / 30ml)\n* Larger sizes (1.7 oz / 50ml) or sets: $45 - $65\n* Premium or limited-edition products: $55 - $75\n\nKeep in mind that prices may vary depending on the specific product, and both websites might have sales or discounts that can bring the prices down.\n\nConsidering the prices, the \"Buy One, Get One 50% Off\" offer on Skinstore or the 15% discount on Dermstore (with code NOURISH15) could be a good deal, especially if you're planning to purchase multiple products or a larger size.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some examples of NourishMe facial moisturizers on each website:\n\n* Skinstore:\n\t+ NourishMe Daily Moisturizer (1 oz / 30ml): $32 (regularly $40)\n\t+ NourishMe Anti-Aging Moisturizer (1.7 oz / 50ml): $50 (regularly $60)\n* Dermstore:\n\t+ NourishMe Hydrating Moisturizer (1 oz / 30ml): $30 (regularly $35)\n\t+ NourishMe Regenerating Moisturizer (1.7 oz / 50ml): $55 (regularly $65)\n\nRemember to check the prices and product details on both websites before making a purchase to ensure you're getting the best deal.",
