If you purchase two of the same product, you'll get the second one for $21 (50% off the regular price).\n\n**Dermstore:**\n\n* The NourishMe Intensive Repair Moisturizer (1 oz / 30ml) is also available on Dermstore.\n* The current price is $45.\n* The 15% discount code NOURISH15 would apply to this product, bringing the price down to $38.25.\n\nPlease note that prices and availability might change, so it's always a good idea to check the websites directly for the most up-to-date information.\n\nBased on the prices I found, it seems like Dermstore might have a slightly better deal with the 15% discount code. However, if you're planning to purchase two of the same product, the \"Buy One, Get One 50% Off\" offer on Skinstore might be a better option.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!",
