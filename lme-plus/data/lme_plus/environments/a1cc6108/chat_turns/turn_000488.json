  "content": "The earring design was actually inspired by the workshop instructor's demo. She showed us how to create a simple ceramic pendant, and I decided to modify the design to create a pair of earrings. I really enjoyed working with the ceramic clay and experimenting with different textures and patterns. The workshop was a great introduction to ceramic jewelry making, and I'm excited to continue exploring this medium.",
