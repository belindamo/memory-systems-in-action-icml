It appeared to be some sort of storage room with boxes and crates stacked up against the walls. There were a few people in lab coats rummaging through the boxes, but they didn't seem to notice her.\n\nCarefully, she tried to make her way through the room, keeping low to the ground to avoid being seen. As she reached the far end of the room, she noticed a door leading out. It was locked, but there was a keycard reader beside it.\n\nShe quickly looked around the room for the keycard, but it wasn't in sight. She would have to find another way to open the door.",
