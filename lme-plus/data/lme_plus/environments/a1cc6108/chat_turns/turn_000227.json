I'll also try to apply what I learn to some personal projects, like analyzing my own finances or tracking my fitness progress. That way, I can see the practical applications of Python and stay motivated. By the way, I've been thinking about my retirement goals, and I'm wondering if you can help me with that. I want to retire by the time I'm 60, but I'm not sure if that's realistic. Can you help me crunch some numbers and come up with a plan?",
