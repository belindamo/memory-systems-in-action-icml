  "content": "I'm happy to share the necessary information. My current income is around $80,000 per year, and I have about $50,000 saved up for retirement so far. In retirement, I'd like to travel, pursue hobbies, and spend time with family and friends, so I think I'll need around $60,000 per year to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. I'm hoping to get around 5% annual returns on my investments, and I'm assuming an inflation rate of 2.5% per year.\n\nAlso, I've been thinking about my current expenses and I realized that I can cut back on some unnecessary expenses to free up more money for savings. I'd like to aim to save at least 20% of my income each month towards retirement.\n\nWith that information, can you help me crunch some numbers and come up with a plan to achieve my retirement goal?",
