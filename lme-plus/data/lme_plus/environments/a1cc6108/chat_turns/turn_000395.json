  "content": "As the Test Subject goes through the files, she finds a folder labeled \"Facility Blueprints.\" She quickly opens it and starts to look through the pages. She sees detailed layouts of the facility, including areas that are restricted and heavily guarded.\n\nShe notices that there is a ventilation shaft in Sector Three that leads to the outside of the facility. It could be her way out. She quickly takes a picture of the blueprints with her phone and puts it back in the file cabinet.\n\nAs she turns around to leave, she hears footsteps approaching the storage room. She quickly hides behind the shelves, trying to remain unnoticed. She sees a group of guards walking past, discussing something amongst themselves.\n\nOnce the guards have passed, the Test Subject quietly exits the storage room and continues her search for a way to escape the facility. She decides to head to Sector Three to check out the ventilation shaft.",
