This is especially important for popular acts or festivals. Plan to arrive at least 2-3 hours before the doors open.\n2. **Know the venue**: Familiarize yourself with the venue's layout, including the entrance, stage, and general admission area. This can help you strategize your spot in line and movement once inside.\n3. **Line etiquette**: Be respectful of others in line. Make friends with your neighbors, and be prepared to hold their spot if they need to leave for a bathroom break or to grab a snack.\n4. **Choose your entrance wisely**: If the venue has multiple entrances, scope out which one might be less crowded. Sometimes, a side or rear entrance might be a better bet than the main entrance.\n5. **Be prepared to move quickly**: When the doors open, be ready to move quickly and decisively to your desired spot. Don't hesitate, as others will be vying for the same spot.\n6. **Claim your spot**: Once you've secured a good spot, claim it by setting down a jacket, hat, or other item to mark your territory. This can help deter others from taking your spot.\n7. **Be aware of the crowd**: Keep an eye on the crowd's movement and adjust your position accordingly. If you notice a gap opening up closer to the stage, be prepared to make a move.\n8. **Be respectful of others**: Remember that general admission is a shared experience. Be mindful of your personal space and respect others around you.\n9. **Consider arriving during a opener**: If you're not too concerned about seeing the opening act, arriving during their set can give you a better chance of securing a good spot for the main act.\n10. **Stay hydrated and energized**: General admission can be physically demanding, especially if you're waiting in line for hours. Bring snacks, water, and any necessary medications to keep you going throughout the event.\n\nRemember, getting a good spot in general admission is a combination of strategy, luck, and timing. Stay flexible, be respectful, and enjoy the show!\n\nGlad to hear you had a great experience at the Billie Eilish concert!",
