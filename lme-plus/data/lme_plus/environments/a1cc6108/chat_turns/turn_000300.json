  "content": "If indigenous South American empires had embarked on their own period of expansion due to the failed Spanish colonization, they might have explored several routes along which they could expand their influence. Given the geographical location and available technologies at the time, some potential directions could include:\n1. West Coast of Africa: Indigenous South American empires could have navigated along the South Atlantic Ocean currents from the eastern coast of South America toward the western coast of Africa. This would have put them in contact with several African civilizations, providing opportunities for trade, cultural exchange, and territorial expansion.\n2. Caribbean and Mesoamerica: Another possible route of expansion would have been to move northward through the Caribbean and reach Mesoamerica (present-day Central America and Mexico). This would have put indigenous South American empires in contact with the peoples of the Caribbean islands and other regional powers, such as the Aztecs and Mayans. This direction could have led to a potential blending of cultures, trade systems, and military forces.\n3. The Iberian Peninsula: While this route would have been more challenging, given the technologies available in the 15th and 16th centuries, expansion towards the Iberian Peninsula (present-day Spain and Portugal) would have been another potential direction for indigenous South American empires. To accomplish this, they would have had to build ocean-crossing vessels and navigate the Atlantic Ocean, which might have taken longer and posed greater risks. However, reaching the Iberian Peninsula could have provided opportunities to establish colonies or engage in trade and diplomatic relations with European powers.\n4. Polynesia and the Pacific Ocean: Another potential area for expansion could have involved following the Pacific currents westward from the western coast of South America. This direction would have put them in contact with Polynesian islands and other territories across the vast Pacific. While it would have required highly sophisticated maritime expertise and the ability to navigate long distances across the open ocean, this could have led to expansion and interaction with Pacific cultures.\nThough it is difficult to determine which direction would have been the most likely or successful in this counterfactual scenario, the above routes provide some potential directions indigenous South American empires might have taken for expansion purposes. However, real historical events played out differently, with European powers eventually occupying and shaping the New World.",
