  "content": "That's great to hear that you can take advantage of the student discount on Skinstore and potentially the military discount on Dermstore through your friend! Those discounts can really add up and save you some money.\n\nAnd congratulations on scoring free shipping on your previous order from the beauty supply website! Every little bit counts, and $10 in shipping costs can make a big difference.\n\nI'm glad I could help you compare the offers and find the best deal for your NourishMe Intensive Repair Moisturizer. Dermstore's 15% discount code does seem like a great option, especially if you can combine it with the military discount.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Otherwise, happy shopping, and I hope you enjoy your new moisturizer!",
