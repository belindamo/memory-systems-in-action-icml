  "content": "The first challenge of research on Parkinson's gait action evaluation by skeleton keypoints based on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) using computer vision and deep learning techniques is the limited quality of skeleton data. The quality of the skeleton data can have a significant impact on the performance of the gait evaluation model, and obtaining high-quality skeleton data can be difficult, especially in real-world environments where patients may experience tremors, freezing of gait, or other motor impairments.\n\nThe skeleton data is typically obtained by using depth cameras, such as Microsoft Kinect or Intel RealSense, or by using motion capture systems. These systems can provide accurate joint positions and angles, but they may not be practical or readily available in clinical settings. In such cases, the skeleton data may be obtained from 2D video data using pose estimation algorithms, such as OpenPose.\n\nHowever, the accuracy and completeness of the joint positions obtained from these algorithms may be lower than that obtained from depth cameras or motion capture systems. Parkinson's patients may experience tremors, which can affect the stability of their joints and result in noisy and incomplete joint positions. Furthermore, the walking patterns of Parkinson's patients can be complex and varied, making it difficult to identify the key gait actions that are relevant for UPDRS-based evaluation.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have developed various techniques to improve the quality of the skeleton data. For example, some researchers have used multiple depth cameras or motion capture systems to obtain more accurate joint positions. Others have used data augmentation techniques, such as adding noise or perturbations to the joint positions, to make the model more robust to variations in the joint positions. Furthermore, some researchers have used generative models, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, to generate more realistic and diverse skeleton data.\n\nIn summary, the limited quality of skeleton data is a significant challenge in Parkinson's gait action evaluation by skeleton keypoints based on UPDRS using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Addressing this challenge can lead to more accurate and reliable gait evaluation models in clinical settings.",
