By sharing both the finished dish and the step-by-step process, you're providing value to your followers and making the recipe more accessible and appealing.\n\nYour response is also well-structured and easy to read. You're using a friendly tone and expressing gratitude for the advice, which is always a nice touch.\n\nOne minor suggestion I have is to consider adding a bit more personality to your response. While it's great that you're summarizing the advice, you could also add a sentence or two about why you're excited to share this recipe or what inspired you to create it. This can help make your response feel more authentic and engaging.\n\nHere's an updated version of your response:\n\n\"Hey! I think I'll try sharing both a photo of the finished smoothie bowl and a step-by-step process of how to make it. That way, my followers can see what the final product looks like and get a better understanding of how to make it. I'm really excited to share this recipe because it's one of my favorites and it's perfect for a quick and healthy breakfast. I'll break down the recipe into individual steps and share each one as a separate photo or video in my Instagram Story. Thanks for the advice - can't wait to hear what my followers think!\"\n\nFeel free to modify it to fit your tone and style, but I hope this helps!",
