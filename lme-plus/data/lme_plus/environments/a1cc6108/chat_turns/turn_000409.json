  "content": "After a few moments of stillness, you hear footsteps approaching the closet. The door swings open and you see a guard standing in the doorway, his eyes scanning the room.\n\n\"What the hell?\" he mutters to himself, noticing the open vent and the missing cover. He steps inside the room and starts to look around, searching for any signs of the missing subject.\n\nYou hold your breath and try to remain as still as possible, praying that he doesn't notice you hiding in the vent. The guard pokes his head inside the shaft and looks around for a few moments before deciding that nobody is inside.\n\nHe sighs and shakes his head before walking out of the closet, closing the door behind him. You let out a quiet sigh of relief and continue crawling through the shaft, trying to find your way out of the facility.",
