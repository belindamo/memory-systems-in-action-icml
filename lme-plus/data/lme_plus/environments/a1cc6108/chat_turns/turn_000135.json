The Appeal\n\nIn its appeal Toplace stated that the Tribunal made errors of law with respect to both aspects of the damages awarded. In relation to the award of compensation for damage to personal property, Toplace submits that Dr Rashidianfar should have been required to mitigate his loss and, in particular, should have removed all his personal belongings from the property to prevent damage. It is also submitted that any award should not have been made for the cost of the replacement of the damaged goods with new items but should have been at the value of the damaged items.\n\nToplace also argues that the Tribunal Member erred in awarding damages for loss of rent. Toplace disputes that Dr Rashidianfar intended to rent out his apartment while he was in Wagga Wagga. Toplace also argues that, at the time he purchased the property, Dr Rashidianfar did so as an owner occupier and remained an owner occupier until he moved to Wagga Wagga on 4 February 2019. As we understand it, Toplace argues that it could not have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into, that is, at the time of purchase, that Dr Rashidianfar would suffer loss of rent from the breach, that is, the defective building work which resulted in water ingress.\n\nIn his reply to the appeal, Dr Rashidianfar states that all of the matters raised in the appeal by Toplace were considered by the Tribunal Member. He notes that before the Tribunal Toplace conceded that there was a major defect and that damage was caused to his property. He states he moved the items he had left at the apartment away from the location of the previous leaks but that the flooding event on 8 February 2019 resulted in water ingress in other areas.\n\nDr Rashidianfar also notes that at the hearing Toplace conceded that the property was uninhabitable from 2 February 2019 to 18 August 2019 and states that the evidence he provided showed he wanted to rent the apartment out but could not because of its condition and the delay in having the repairs done.\n\nApplicable legal principles \u2013 internal appeals\n\nSection 80(2)(b) of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 ( NCAT Act) states:\n\nAny internal appeal may be made:\n\n(a) in the case of an interlocutory decision of the Tribunal at first instance - with the leave of the Appeal Panel, and\n\n(b) in the case of any other kind of decision (including an ancillary decision) of the Tribunal at first instance\u2014as of right on any question of law, or with the leave of the Appeal Panel, on any other grounds.\n\nIn the present appeal Toplace states that it is appealing on questions of law. In Prendergast v Western Murray Irrigation Ltd [2014] NSWCATAP 69 the Appeal Panel set out at [13] a non-exclusive list of questions of law:\n\nWhether there has been a failure to provide proper reasons;\n\nWhether the Tribunal identified the wrong issue or asked the wrong question;\n\nWhether a wrong principle of law had been applied;\n\nWhether there was a failure to afford procedural fairness;\n\nWhether the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant (i.e., mandatory) considerations;\n\nWhether the Tribunal took into account an irrelevant consideration;\n\nWhether there was no evidence to support a finding of fact; and\n\nWhether the decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker would make it.\n\nToplace has not identified with any particularity the precise nature of the errors it submits the Member made in his decision. In relation to the claim for compensation in respect of the personal property of Dr Rashidianfar damaged by mould etc, it appears that Toplace does not dispute liability but is arguing that the Member applied the wrong principles to the assessment of damages. In relation to the claim for loss of rent, Toplace appears to submit that there was no evidence to support the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Dr Rashidianfar intended to rent out his apartment. In addition, Toplace argues that loss of rental income from the breach could not have been within the contemplation of the parties when he purchased the apartment. It therefore argues that the Tribunal applied a wrong principle of law to its assessment.\n\nFor the reasons which appear below we are satisfied that the Tribunal made an error of law with respect to its assessment of the claim for lost rent.\n\nConsideration\n\nCompensation for damage to personal belongings\n\nThe Member correctly identified the general rule as set out in Robinson v Harman (1848) 154 ER 363, and which has been applied in Australia, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, the party is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed. Toplace, although not couching it in these terms, appears to argue that, by awarding Dr Rashidianfar the cost of replacement goods, Dr Rashidianfar was better off than he otherwise would have been if the damage had not occurred.\n\nAt the hearing before the Tribunal, Toplace conceded that the defects in the property led to damage to Dr Rashidianfar\u2019s goods. We see no reason to depart from that concession and the Member\u2019s findings as we agree that damage to Dr Rashidianfar\u2019s personal belongings in the apartment arose naturally from the breach, namely water ingress as a result of defective waterproofing.\n\nToplace, although it disputed the amount claimed, provided no evidence that the amounts were excessive or unreasonable. The Tribunal referred to the High Court\u2019s judgment in Commonwealth v Amman Aviation Pty Ltd (1991) 174 CLR 6. That case is authority for the proposition that the onus for proving the loss rests with the person claiming it. It was also said in that case that that mere difficulty in estimating damages does not relieve a court (or tribunal) from the responsibility of estimating them as best it can.\n\nIn our view, on the state of the evidence before him, it was open to the Member to award the amount he did.\n\nIn relation to mitigation, the Member\u2019s reasons do not specifically refer to mitigation, although do note that Toplace argued that Dr Rashidianfar should have moved his goods from the property to prevent damage. It is well established that damages cannot be recovered for any loss which could have been prevented by reasonable mitigation action of the injured party: [23.41] Cheshire and Fifoot: Law of Contract 10th Edition. A loss which is attributable to the failure to mitigate can be regarded as an aspect of causation: Castle Constructions Pty Ltd v Fekula Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 133 at [21].\n\nThe action that must be taken in mitigation is only that which is reasonable. In his reasons the Member noted that the premises provided to Dr Rashidianfar in Wagga Wagga were fully furnished and that when he left for Wagga Wagga it was his intention to rent out his apartment as fully furnished. He also notes that the damage occurred after Dr Rashidianfar left for Wagga Wagga. Unfortunately, the Member does not explicitly go on to address what, if any, reasonable steps could have been taken by him in mitigation. However, it is implicit from his decision that he was not of the view that, in the circumstances, Dr Rashidianfar should have removed his goods from premises, particularly where the major inundation occurred after he had left for Wagga Wagga.\n\nAt the hearing before us, Toplace also sought to argue that Dr Rashidianfar should not have locked his apartment up and should have arranged for his parents to air it out to prevent a build-up of mould. This does not appear to have been argued before the Member and, in any event in our view, is not what would be reasonably required in the circumstances.\n\nWe find no error in the Member\u2019s approach to the issue of damages.",
