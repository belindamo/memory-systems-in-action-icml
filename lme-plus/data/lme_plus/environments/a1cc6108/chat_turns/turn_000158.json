  "content": "The fairy figurine is a wonderful idea! It'll add a delightful touch to the cake and make it even more whimsical. Here are some ideas for the fairy figurine that you can consider:\n\n**Fairy Figurine Ideas:**\n\n1. **Sugar Fairy**: Create a sugar fairy using sugar paste or fondant. You can shape the fairy's body, wings, and hair using these materials. Add details like eyes, a mouth, and a wand using small balls of sugar paste or edible markers.\n2. **Edible Image Fairy**: Print a small fairy image on edible paper or icing sheets. You can find many free fairy images online or use a photo of Emily dressed as a fairy. Cut out the image and attach it to the cake using a small amount of royal icing or piping gel.\n3. **Candy Fairy**: Use small candies like M&M's, Skittles, or jelly beans to create the fairy's body and wings. You can use a toothpick to attach the candies to each other and shape the fairy's form.\n4. **Fondant Fairy Wings**: Create a fairy figurine using fondant or sugar paste, but focus on the wings. Shape the wings into delicate, intricate designs and attach them to the cake. You can add a small fairy body made from sugar paste or fondant later.\n5. **Miniature Fairy Doll**: Use a small, porcelain fairy doll (about 1-2 inches tall) and attach it to the cake using a small amount of royal icing or piping gel. This will add a more realistic touch to the cake design.\n\n**Tips for Attaching the Fairy Figurine:**\n\n1. **Use royal icing or piping gel**: These are the best adhesives for attaching small decorations to the cake.\n2. **Choose the right size**: Ensure the fairy figurine is proportional to the cake and the door. You don't want it to overpower the design.\n3. **Position carefully**: Place the fairy figurine on the doorstep, peeking out from behind the door or sitting on the doorstep, depending on the design.\n4. **Add a tiny base**: If the fairy figurine is top-heavy, create a small base using sugar paste or fondant to stabilize it on the cake.\n\nRemember to have fun and be creative with the fairy figurine! It's a special touch that will make the cake even more magical and memorable for Emily's birthday celebration.",
