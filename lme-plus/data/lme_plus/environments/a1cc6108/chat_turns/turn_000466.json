  "content": "I think I can take advantage of the student discount on Skinstore, and I also have a friend who's in the military, so I can ask them if they can help me get the military discount on Dermstore. That would be awesome! By the way, I just used a coupon to get free shipping on an order from a beauty supply website yesterday, which saved me $10 in shipping costs. Anyway, I think I'll go with Dermstore's offer since it seems like a better deal with the 15% discount code. Thanks for your help!",
