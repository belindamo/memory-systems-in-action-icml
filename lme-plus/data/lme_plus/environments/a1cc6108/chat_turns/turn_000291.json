  "content": "The sixth challenge of action recognition using skeleton keypoints in computer vision based deep learning is the vulnerability of the models to adversarial attacks. An adversarial attack is a maliciously designed input that is constructed to mislead the model into making incorrect predictions. In the context of action recognition, an adversarial attack can be designed to modify the skeleton data in a way that changes the recognized action.\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers have developed various techniques to improve the robustness of the action recognition model to adversarial attacks. One approach is to use adversarial training, where the model is trained on a combination of adversarial examples and normal examples. Adversarial training can improve the model's ability to resist adversarial attacks by making it more robust to small perturbations in the skeleton data.\n\nAnother approach is to use input preprocessing techniques, such as data normalization or data whitening, to make the skeleton data more resistant to adversarial attacks. Preprocessing can remove some of the patterns in the input that the attacker may exploit to design an adversarial attack.\n\nMoreover, some researchers have used detection and defense techniques to identify and reject adversarial examples. Detection techniques can be used to identify the adversarial examples, while defense techniques can be used to modify the model's predictions to be more robust to the adversarial examples.\n\nIn summary, the vulnerability of the models to adversarial attacks is a significant challenge in action recognition using skeleton keypoints in computer vision based deep learning. Addressing this challenge can lead to more secure and reliable action recognition models that are less susceptible to malicious attacks.",
