  "content": "As a language model AI, I don't have access to Fiat's specific plans on this matter. However, I can give you a general idea of how automakers tackle the challenge of reducing emissions from their current internal combustion engine models while they transition towards electric vehicles.\n\nOne approach that automakers take is to improve the efficiency of their internal combustion engines by implementing new technologies such as direct injection, turbocharging, and cylinder deactivation. Better fuel economy reduces emissions, and these technologies can help reduce the environmental impact of automobiles by making them more efficient.\n\nAnother approach is to introduce hybrid powertrains, which combine an internal combustion engine with one or more electric motors to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions.\n\nAutomakers are also exploring alternative fuels such as hydrogen fuel cells, compressed natural gas, and biofuels as a way to reduce emissions from their internal combustion engine models.\n\nIn the case of Fiat, they have been working on eco-friendly technologies such as their MultiAir engines, which improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, and their eco:Drive software that provides drivers with real-time feedback on their driving habits to help them drive more efficiently.\n\nOverall, while electric vehicles represent the future of sustainable transportation, automakers will continue to work on reducing emissions from their internal combustion engine models in the meantime.",
