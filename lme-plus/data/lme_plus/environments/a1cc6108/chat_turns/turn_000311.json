  "content": "Here are some additional details on how you might use the different components in the API backend folder structure:\n\n* `controllers`: This folder contains the controller files, which handle the incoming requests and delegate tasks to the model and utility files. Each controller file is responsible for a specific aspect of the leave management system, such as leave requests, leave policies, or user management.\n* `models`: This folder contains the model files, which handle the data manipulation tasks, such as creating, updating, or deleting leave requests or leave policies. Each model file is responsible for a specific aspect of the leave management system, such as leave requests, leave policies, or user management.\n* `routes`: This folder contains the route files, which define the endpoints and functions to be called when a request is made to the API. Each route file is responsible for a specific aspect of the leave management system, such as leave requests, leave policies, or user management.\n* `utils`: This folder contains utility files, which contain functions that are used across multiple controllers or models. For example, you might have a `db.js` utility file that contains functions for connecting to the database, or a `leave.js` utility file that contains functions for calculating the number of leave days for a given leave request.\n\nBy organizing the API backend in this way, you can create a modular and scalable API that is easy to maintain and extend.",
