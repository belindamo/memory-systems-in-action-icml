Don't be too hard on yourself if it takes a few tries to find the perfect combination of music and productivity. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more tips or advice.\n\nAlso, don't forget to be kind to yourself and take breaks when you need them. The Pomodoro Technique is all about working in focused intervals, but it's also important to rest and recharge.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you have a productive and energized commute!",
