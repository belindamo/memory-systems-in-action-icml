You can use utility functions from the `utils/leave.js` file to perform tasks such as aggregating the leave data by leave type or employee, or generating charts or graphs to visualize the leave trends over time.\n\n* User management: To implement endpoints for managing user accounts, you can create routes in the `routes/user.js` file and use functions from the `controllers/user.js` and `models/user.js` files to handle the incoming requests and update the user data in the database. For example, you might create a `POST /users/create` route for creating a new user account, and a `PUT /users/update/:id` route for updating the user's role or permissions.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how you might implement the different components of an API backend for a comprehensive leave management system. The specific implementation will depend on the requirements and design of your application. You can modify the implementation to suit the needs of your application, and add or remove routes, controllers, models, and utility functions as needed.",
