Congratulations on getting 10 comments on your 5 stories! To calculate your engagement rate on Instagram stories, we can use the following formula:\n\nEngagement Rate = (Total Engagements / Total Reach) x 100\n\nIn your case, you mentioned 10 comments, but we need to know the total reach of your stories to calculate the engagement rate. Reach refers to the number of unique viewers who saw your story. If you can provide me with the total reach of your 5 stories, I can help you calculate the engagement rate.\n\nFor example, if your total reach was 100 views, your engagement rate would be:\n\nEngagement Rate = (10 comments / 100 views) x 100 = 10%\n\nIf you don't have the exact reach data, we can use an estimate. Keep in mind that this might not be entirely accurate, but it'll give us a rough idea.\n\nMoving on to other platforms, which ones do you have a presence on, and can you share some metrics about your recent posts, such as:\n\n* Facebook: Number of likes, comments, shares, and total reach for your recent posts\n* Twitter: Number of likes, replies, retweets, and total impressions for your recent tweets\n* TikTok: Number of likes, comments, shares, and total views for your recent videos\n* YouTube: Number of views, likes, comments, and subscribers for your recent videos\n* LinkedIn: Number of likes, comments, shares, and total views for your recent posts\n\nThe more data you can provide, the better we can analyze your engagement rates across different platforms and identify areas for improvement.",
