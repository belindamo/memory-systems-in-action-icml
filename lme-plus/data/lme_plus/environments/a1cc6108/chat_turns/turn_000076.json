  "content": "Having a separate folder for each year is a great idea, especially when it comes to organizing files related to a specific course or project that spans multiple years.\n\nFor your Japanese language classes, I would recommend creating subfolders for each semester or quarter, depending on how you want to break down the files. Here's a suggested structure:\n\n* Japanese Language\n\t+ 2023\n\t\t- Spring Semester\n\t\t\t- Lesson Notes\n\t\t\t- Assignments\n\t\t\t- Quizzes\n\t\t- Fall Semester\n\t\t\t- Lesson Notes\n\t\t\t- Assignments\n\t\t\t- Quizzes\n\t+ 2022\n\t\t- Spring Semester\n\t\t\t- Lesson Notes\n\t\t\t- Assignments\n\t\t\t- Quizzes\n\t\t- Fall Semester\n\t\t\t- Lesson Notes\n\t\t\t- Assignments\n\t\t\t- Quizzes\n\nThis structure allows you to:\n\n1. Keep files from different years separate, making it easier to find specific files from a particular year.\n2. Organize files by semester or quarter, which can help you track your progress and identify specific topics or lessons.\n3. Use subfolders for different types of files (e.g., Lesson Notes, Assignments, Quizzes), making it easier to find what you need.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer a simpler structure, you could keep everything in a single \"Japanese Language\" folder and use tags or labels to categorize the files by semester or quarter. For example:\n\n* Japanese Language\n\t+ 2023 Spring Semester (tag or label)\n\t\t- Lesson Notes\n\t\t- Assignments\n\t\t- Quizzes\n\t+ 2023 Fall Semester (tag or label)\n\t\t- Lesson Notes\n\t\t- Assignments\n\t\t- Quizzes\n\t+ 2022 Spring Semester (tag or label)\n\t\t- Lesson Notes\n\t\t- Assignments\n\t\t- Quizzes\n\nThis approach is more flexible and doesn't require creating separate folders for each semester or quarter. However, it may become more difficult to navigate if you have a large number of files.\n\nUltimately, the choice between these two approaches depends on your personal preference and how you work with your files.",
