However, I'm a large language model, I don't have access to your location, so I can't provide specific recommendations for local jewelry stores in your area.\n\nBut I can suggest a few ways to find local jewelry stores that might carry earrings with a similar style to the pendant:\n\n1. **Google search**: Type in \"local jewelry stores near me\" or \"jewelry stores in [your city/state]\" to find a list of nearby stores. You can then visit their websites or social media pages to see if they carry earrings with small gemstones.\n2. **Yelp**: Yelp is a great platform to find local businesses, including jewelry stores. You can filter your search by location, rating, and categories like \"jewelry\" or \"custom jewelry.\"\n3. **Facebook**: Many local businesses have Facebook pages where they showcase their products and services. Try searching for jewelry stores in your area and browse through their pages to see if they have earrings that match your criteria.\n4. **Local jewelry districts**: If you have a jewelry district or a popular shopping area in your city, you can visit those stores in person to explore their collections.\n5. **Ask around**: Ask friends, family, or coworkers for recommendations. They might know of a local jewelry store that carries earrings with small gemstones.\n\nWhen you visit a local jewelry store, be sure to ask the staff about their earrings with small gemstones. They might have a selection that's not displayed online or can offer custom design services to create a pair that matches the pendant.\n\nRemember to support local businesses and appreciate the personalized service they offer. Good luck in your search, and I hope you find the perfect earrings for your sister!",
