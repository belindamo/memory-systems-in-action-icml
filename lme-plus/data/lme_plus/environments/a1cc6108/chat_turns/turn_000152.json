Based on the activities I suggested earlier, here are some theme ideas that might fit well:\n\n1. **Fairy Garden Party**: This theme is perfect for a spring or summer party. Decorate with flowers, balloons, and a \"fairy door\" entrance. The treasure hunt, bubble fun, and scavenger hunt activities will fit nicely with this theme.\n2. **Pirate's Treasure Hunt Adventure**: Ahoy, matey! A pirate theme is always a hit with kids. Use a treasure map to decorate the party area, and set up a \"walk the plank\" activity or a treasure chest filled with gold coins and small toys.\n3. **Outer Space Adventure**: Blast off into the cosmos with a space-themed party! Decorate with glow-in-the-dark stars, planets, and spaceships. The obstacle course can become a \"space mission\" obstacle course, and the scavenger hunt can be a search for alien artifacts.\n4. **Enchanted Forest**: Bring the outdoors in with an enchanted forest theme. Decorate with green balloons, streamers, and a \"forest\" backdrop. The sensory play activity can become a \"dig for treasure\" in a bin filled with rice or beans, and the craft station can feature forest-themed crafts.\n5. **Superhero Training Academy**: Emily and her friends can become superheroes-in-training with this theme. Decorate with superhero logos, balloons, and a \"cityscape\" backdrop. The obstacle course can become a superhero training course, and the scavenger hunt can be a search for supervillains.\n6. **Backyard Camping Adventure**: Set up a backyard camping adventure with a tent, a campfire (real or fake), and some outdoor games like flashlight tag or glow-in-the-dark Frisbee. The treasure hunt can become a search for s'mores ingredients, and the craft station can feature camping-themed crafts.\n7. **Princess Party**: If Emily loves all things princess, this theme is a great fit. Decorate with pink and gold balloons, a throne, and a \"castle\" backdrop. The craft station can feature princess-themed crafts, and the scavenger hunt can be a search for a \"lost tiara.\"\n\nThese themes should give you a good starting point. Remember to involve Emily in the planning process and tailor the theme to her interests and preferences. Good luck, and have fun planning the party!",
