It's always better to err on the side of caution and arrive a few minutes early to collect your thoughts before starting your workday.\n\nRemember to also factor in time for parking, grabbing a cup of coffee or breakfast, and getting settled at your desk before your official start time of 8:30 am.\n\nBy leaving at 7:45 am, you'll be giving yourself a good head start on the day, and you can use the extra time to catch up on some reading, respond to emails, or simply enjoy a quiet moment to yourself before the hustle and bustle of the workday begins.\n\nSafe travels, and have a great day at the office!",
