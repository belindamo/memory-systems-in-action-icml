However, sometimes it can be helpful to have additional support when dealing with trauma and its effects. Our therapist is trained to help people like you and may be able to offer you some valuable tools and strategies to help you cope with any difficult emotions or memories that arise.\n\n{The scientist pauses for a moment, allowing the test subject to think things over.}\n\nScientist: It's ultimately your decision whether or not to seek therapy, but I want you to know that the option is available to you if you ever feel like you could use some extra support. And of course, I and the rest of the staff here at Facili-taste are always here to listen and help in any way we can.",
