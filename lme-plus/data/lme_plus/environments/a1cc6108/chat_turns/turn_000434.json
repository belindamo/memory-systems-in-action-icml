I was just thinking about the Contemporary Art Exhibition I attended at the Modern Museum of Art last Saturday, and it got me thinking about local artists. Speaking of which, I participate in a guided tour at the City Art Gallery about a week ago, and it was amazing! Do you have any ideas for posts that could highlight local artists and their work?",
