This can be incredibly powerful in helping you stay motivated and committed.\n5. **Celebrate successes:** When you achieve your goals, you'll have a record of your hard work and progress, which can be a great motivator and confidence booster.\n\nSome questions to consider including in your journal when starting a new workout phase or program:\n\n* What are my specific goals for this program? (e.g., increase strength, improve endurance, lose weight, etc.)\n* Why am I starting this program? (e.g., to feel more confident, to improve overall health, to prepare for an event, etc.)\n* What motivates me to reach my goals? (e.g., a specific event, a personal challenge, a desire to feel better, etc.)\n* What obstacles might I face, and how will I overcome them?\n* What small, achievable milestones will I set for myself along the way?\n\nBy including these details in your journal, you'll have a clear understanding of your goals, motivation, and progress. This can help you stay focused, motivated, and committed to your fitness journey.\n\nRemember, your journal is a personal space for reflection and growth. Be honest, be kind, and be patient with yourself as you work towards your goals.",
