  "content": "The fourth challenge of action recognition using skeleton keypoints in computer vision based deep learning is the large number of actions that the model needs to recognize. There is a large number of possible actions, and the model needs to be able to recognize each of them accurately. This can require a large amount of annotated data and significant computational resources.\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers have developed various techniques to improve the performance of the action recognition model. One approach is to use transfer learning, where the model is first pre-trained on a large-scale dataset, such as ImageNet or Kinetics, and then fine-tuned on the specific action recognition dataset. Transfer learning can help the model to learn more generalized features that can be useful for recognizing a wide range of actions.\n\nAnother approach is to use data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotation, or scaling of the skeleton data, to generate more training examples. Data augmentation can increase the size and diversity of the training data, which can improve the generalization performance of the action recognition model.\n\nMoreover, some researchers have used ensemble methods, where multiple models are combined to improve the performance of the action recognition system. Ensemble methods can reduce the variance and improve the robustness of the model by aggregating the predictions of multiple models.\n\nIn summary, the large number of actions is a significant challenge in action recognition using skeleton keypoints in computer vision based deep learning. Addressing this challenge can lead to more accurate and reliable action recognition models that can recognize a wide range of actions.",
