  "content": "The **Fairy Door Cake** is a fantastic choice! I'm thrilled to help you with the tiny details. Creating a miniature door handle and windows can be a bit fiddly, but with some patience and the right tools, you'll achieve a stunning result. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n**Tiny Door Handle:**\n\n1. **Use sugar paste or fondant**: These materials can be molded and shaped easily to create small details. You can also use gum paste, but it's more brittle and might break easily.\n2. **Create a template**: Draw a small door handle shape on paper or use a real door handle as a reference. This will help you get the proportions right.\n3. **Roll out the sugar paste or fondant**: Roll out a small piece of sugar paste or fondant to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm).\n4. **Cut out the handle shape**: Use a small cookie cutter or a craft knife to cut out the door handle shape from the rolled-out sugar paste or fondant.\n5. **Shape and refine**: Use a toothpick or a small modeling tool to shape and refine the door handle, adding details like a small knob or a keyhole.\n6. **Attach to the cake**: Use a small amount of royal icing or piping gel to attach the door handle to the cake.\n\n**Tiny Windows:**\n\n1. **Use sugar glass or isomalt**: These materials can be molded and shaped to create small, delicate windows. You can also use sugar paste or fondant, but they might not be as transparent.\n2. **Create a template**: Draw a small window shape on paper or use a real window as a reference. This will help you get the proportions right.\n3. **Mold the sugar glass or isomalt**: Use a small mold or a silicone mat to create the window shape. You can also use a glass or a metal window-shaped cookie cutter.\n4. **Shape and refine**: Use a toothpick or a small modeling tool to shape and refine the window, adding details like window panes or a window frame.\n5. **Attach to the cake**: Use a small amount of royal icing or piping gel to attach the window to the cake.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Use a small paintbrush**: To add details like window panes, door hinges, or a door knocker, use a small paintbrush and a tiny amount of royal icing or piping gel.\n* **Keep it simple**: Remember, the details should be small and delicate. Avoid over-embellishing, as it can make the cake look cluttered.\n* **Practice makes perfect**: Don't be discouraged if your first attempts at creating tiny details don't turn out as expected. Practice, and you'll get better with time.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to create a stunning **Fairy Door Cake** with intricate details that will delight Emily and her friends. Good luck, and have fun!",
