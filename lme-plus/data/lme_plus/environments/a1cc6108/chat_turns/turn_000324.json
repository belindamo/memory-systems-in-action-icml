  "content": "Blessed Sydney Constructions PL v Vasudevan case\n\nIn the case of Blessed Sydney Constructions PL v Vasudevan, the Appeal Panel considered the impact of the Brewarrina principle on the renewal power available under CATA Sch 4 para 8 and the types of orders available on a renewal application.\n\nBackground\n\nThe case involved a building dispute between the owner and the builder, with the owner seeking to terminate the contract and claim damages for breach. The parties reached a consent work order, which reserved the power to renew the order, and the builder was ordered to rectify the defective work. However, the builder did not comply with the order, and the owner sought a renewal of the order seeking a money order.\n\nImpact of Brewarrina principle\n\nThe Appeal Panel held that the orders available on a renewal application were not constrained by the Brewarrina principle. This was because the contract in this case had ended with the Tribunal's acceptance, by its vacation or variation of the work order and the contract that was the subject of the work order, that the owner should be allowed to terminate and had elected to terminate for breach of that contract by making the renewal application seeking a money order, with such election taking effect on vacation or variation of the work order.\n\nTypes of orders available on renewal application\n\nThe Appeal Panel further held that a money order was available on a renewal under HBA Sch 4 para 8 (\"any other \u2026 order\u2026 as it could have made when the matter was originally determined\") because it was in the range of orders under HBA s 48O that the Tribunal could make on the original application, depending on what order was appropriate including on general law principles such as expounded in Brewarrina. The types of orders available on a renewal application include:\n\n* Rectification orders\n* Money orders\n* Any other order that the Tribunal could have made when the matter was originally determined\n\nElecting to terminate\n\nThe owner in this case elected to terminate the contract and sought a money order on a renewal application. This allowed the Tribunal to make orders unconstrained by the Brewarrina principle. It is important for homeowners to understand the implications of electing to terminate and seeking damages, as it may affect the types of orders available to them.\n\nTable:\n\n| Topic | Details |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case Name | Blessed Sydney Constructions PL v Vasudevan |\n| Issues | Impact of Brewarrina principle on renewal power and types of orders available on renewal applications |\n| Background | Building dispute between owner and builder with consent work order |\n| Tribunal's decision | Order to rectify defective work not complied with, renewal of order sought for money order |\n| Impact of Brewarrina principle | Not constrained by the Brewarrina principle because the contract had ended and owner elected to terminate for breach |\n| Types of orders available | Rectification orders, money orders, any other order that the Tribunal could have made when the matter was originally determined |\n| Electing to terminate | Homeowners need to understand the implications of electing to terminate and seeking damages |",
