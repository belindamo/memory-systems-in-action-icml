  "content": "I think what resonates with me about ceramic jewelry making is the combination of creativity and precision. I love that I can experiment with different textures and patterns, but also need to be precise in shaping and firing the clay to get the desired result. It's a great balance of art and science.\n\nAs for taking more workshops or classes, I think I'd like to take a few more to learn some new techniques and refine my skills. I've been eyeing a class on ceramic glazing, which would be really helpful in taking my jewelry making to the next level.\n\nI also need to dust off my old pottery wheel, which I haven't used in years. The workshop really inspired me to get back into ceramics, and I think it would be great to combine my jewelry making with wheel-throwing skills. Who knows, maybe I'll even start selling my pieces online or at local craft fairs!",
