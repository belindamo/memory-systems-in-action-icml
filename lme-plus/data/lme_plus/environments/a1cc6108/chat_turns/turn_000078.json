  "content": "The first approach is a great way to keep your files organized, and using subfolders for each semester or quarter will make it easy to find specific files.\n\nNow, about tags or labels in Google Drive...\n\nGoogle Drive uses a labeling system, which allows you to categorize and organize your files without moving them to different folders. Labels are like keywords or tags that you can assign to files, making them easily searchable and discoverable.\n\nHere's how to set up labels in Google Drive:\n\n**Adding Labels to Files:**\n\n1. Select the file(s) you want to label in Google Drive.\n2. Right-click (or Ctrl+Click on Mac) on the selected file(s) and choose \"Add to\" > \"Labels\".\n3. In the \"Labels\" window, type in the label you want to add (e.g., \"Japanese Language\", \"2023 Spring Semester\", \"Lesson Notes\", etc.).\n4. Click \"Apply\" to save the label.\n\n**Viewing and Managing Labels:**\n\n1. To view all files with a specific label, click on the \"Labels\" button in the left sidebar of Google Drive.\n2. Click on a label to see all files associated with it.\n3. You can also search for files using the \"Search\" bar at the top of Google Drive, using the label as a keyword.\n4. To remove a label from a file, right-click on the file, select \"Labels\", and then click the \"X\" next to the label you want to remove.\n\n**Tips and Tricks:**\n\n* You can add multiple labels to a single file.\n* Labels are case-insensitive, so \"Japanese Language\" and \"japanese language\" will be treated as the same label.\n* You can use labels to create a hierarchical structure, like \"Japanese Language\" > \"2023 Spring Semester\" > \"Lesson Notes\".\n* Labels are specific to your Google Drive account, so you can use them to organize files in a way that makes sense to you.\n\nWhile labels are a powerful way to organize your files, keep in mind that they're not a replacement for a well-structured folder hierarchy. Using both folders and labels can help you create a robust organization system that suits your needs.\n\nNow that you know how to use labels in Google Drive, you can experiment with them and see how they fit into your workflow.",
