To get permission to take photos or videos during events or exhibitions at the City Art Gallery, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the gallery's policy**: Before taking any photos or videos, review the City Art Gallery's photography policy. Some galleries may have specific rules or restrictions on photography, especially during exhibitions or events.\n2. **Ask the gallery staff or curator**: Reach out to the gallery staff, curator, or event organizer and ask if it's okay to take photos or videos during the event or exhibition. They may have specific guidelines or restrictions to share with you.\n3. **Get permission from the artists**: If you're planning to feature specific artworks or artists, it's essential to get their permission as well.

Avoid taking photos of people without their permission, especially if they're not the main focus of the shot.\n5. **Use a photo release form**: If you plan to feature attendees or staff in your behind-the-scenes content, consider using a photo release form.

Use a camera with a good zoom lens or a smartphone with a good camera to minimize disturbance.\n7. **Credit the artists and the gallery**: When sharing your behind-the-scenes content, always credit the artists, the City Art Gallery, and any other relevant parties.\n\nExample email or message to ask for permission:\n\n\"Hi [Gallery Staff/Curator's Name],\n\nI'm [Your Name], the social media manager at the Local Art Gallery.
