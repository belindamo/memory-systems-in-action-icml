  "content": "That's a fantastic idea! Visiting local antique shops and dealers can be a great way to learn from experienced professionals, get hands-on experience, and potentially find pieces to practice on. Meeting with the dealer you met at the auction can be especially beneficial, as they may be able to share their expertise and offer guidance on getting started with antique restoration.\n\nBefore visiting the dealer's shop, consider preparing a few questions to ask, such as:\n\n* What types of pieces do they typically work with, and what's their experience with restoration?\n* Are they willing to share their knowledge or offer guidance on restoration techniques?\n* Do they have any pieces in their inventory that might be suitable for a beginner to practice on?\n* Are they open to mentoring or apprenticing someone new to the field?\n\nBy asking these questions, you can get a better sense of whether the dealer is a good fit for your learning goals and whether they might be willing to help you get started.\n\nAdditionally, you might consider offering to help the dealer with small tasks or projects in exchange for their guidance and mentorship. This can be a win-win situation, as you'll gain valuable experience, and the dealer will get some extra help.\n\nRemember to approach the meeting with an open mind, a willingness to learn, and a respectful attitude towards the dealer's expertise and inventory. Good luck, and I hope you learn a lot from the experience!",
