  "content": "It was really nice learning from my grandmother. She's a great teacher and was very patient with me. I think what surprised me the most was how many layers of flavor there are in a good chicken tikka masala. I mean, I've had the dish many times before, but I never realized how much work goes into making it. From marinating the chicken to making the spice blends and simmering the sauce, it's a pretty involved process. But it's definitely worth it in the end.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was when my grandmother told me about how she used to make chicken tikka masala for special occasions when she was growing up in Mumbai. She said it was a dish that was always reserved for weddings and holidays, and that it was a big deal to make it from scratch. Hearing her stories about cooking for her family and friends back in India really made the experience more meaningful for me.\n\nAnyway, I'm excited to try out the Butter Chicken recipe you",
