  "content": "Excellent plan! Asking the dealer for recommendations on resources and courses can provide you with valuable insights and insider knowledge. They may have personal experience with certain courses or instructors, or know of reputable organizations that offer high-quality training.\n\nIt's great to hear that you and your cousin had a great time at the auction, despite not winning the clock. Auctions can be a fun and exciting way to discover new pieces and learn about antiques. Attending multiple auctions can also help you develop your eye for antiques and give you a better sense of the market.\n\nRemember to take notes and ask questions when you're at the auction, especially if you're interested in a particular piece. Dealers and auctioneers often have a wealth of knowledge about the items being sold, and they may be willing to share information with you.\n\nWhen you visit the dealer's shop, don't hesitate to ask questions about their experience, their process for restoring and conserving antiques, and any tips they might have for someone just starting out. You can also ask to see some of their current projects or past restorations, which can give you a better understanding of their work and expertise.\n\nHave fun at your next auction adventure, and I hope you find some great pieces to work on!",
