Don't worry about exceeding your shopping allowance - treats are allowed every now and then!\n\nAs for the cookbooks, they're primarily focused on non-stick cookware, but many of the recipes can be adapted to work with various kitchen appliances, including yours. Since you didn't specify the exact appliance, I'll provide some general advice:\n\n* If you have a multi-cooker, slow cooker, or pressure cooker, you can use the cookbooks' recipes as a starting point and adjust the cooking times and temperatures according to your appliance's instructions.\n* If you have a stand mixer, food processor, or blender, you can use the cookbooks' recipes that involve mixing, chopping, or blending ingredients, and then adapt them to your appliance's specific functions.\n* If you have a countertop oven, toaster oven, or air fryer, you can use the cookbooks' recipes that involve baking, roasting, or frying, and adjust the cooking times and temperatures according to your appliance's instructions.\n\nRemember, the key to adapting recipes is to understand the cooking techniques and principles involved, and then adjust them to your appliance's capabilities. Don't be afraid to experiment and adjust recipes to your taste!\n\nIf you're looking for appliance-specific cookbooks, you can also search for cookbooks designed specifically for your appliance model or type (e.g., \"Instant Pot cookbooks\" or \"Air Fryer recipes\"). These cookbooks will often provide recipes and techniques tailored to your appliance's unique features.\n\nHappy cooking with your new appliance, and I hope you enjoy the cookbooks!",
