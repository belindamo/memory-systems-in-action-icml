  "content": "I usually prefer physical books, but I've been experimenting with audiobooks lately, especially for my daily commute. I find that it's a great way to get through books faster, especially longer ones. I've also started using the Libby app, which has been really convenient. As for page count, I don't have a strong preference, but I do appreciate it when authors can tell a compelling story in a more concise manner.",
