  "content": "1. as angels, but they also see them as incredibly dangerous. It's a somewhat distant concept to the people in the zone, as most of them have never seen a Hybrid or heard of any direct action of the hybrids.\n\n2. speaking, messages, writing...\n\n3. very low, but also adapted for survival, hunting, agriculture, repairs etc.\n\n4. All the notable US and Canadian landmarks are still there, but mostly retaken by nature, or knocked around by earthquakes.\n\n6. no, as the hybrids are a distant thing, something the \"zoners\" don't really have to concern themselves about.\n\n7. The Hybrids desire love and relationships, but can't muster the emotions. They feel as if there's something missing within their mind, and that makes them a bit angry. The hybrids can have sex, and enjoy physical contact with others, but there's nothing more, or better said - nothing longer lasting they can feel. So, for example, they can have a brief relationship with a human, have sex with the human, see something in that human, sense some sort of love, and then suddenly feel nothing and proceed to kill that human without remorse. \n\n8. that technology is unnecessary, and that keeping tradition will eventually lead the \"zoners\" to become the inheritors of the earth ( once everyone else's technology fails )\n\n9. Mostly just old christianity and some native american faith systems with added thoughts about Tiamat, and the role of the expanding zone, and the potential of the zoners to inherit the earth.",
