There's something special about getting a personalized rec from someone who knows your tastes.\n\nTo get started, could you tell me a bit more about what you've been reading lately and what you're in the mood for? For example:\n\n* What genres do you usually enjoy? (e.g. fiction, non-fiction, mystery, sci-fi, fantasy, romance, etc.)\n* Do you prefer light, easy reads or something more complex and thought-provoking?\n* Are you interested in reading standalone books or series?\n* Is there a particular time period or setting that fascinates you?\n* Are there any authors or books that you've enjoyed in the past and would like to find something similar?\n\nFeel free to provide as much or as little information as you'd like, and I'll do my best to suggest some new books that might interest you!",
