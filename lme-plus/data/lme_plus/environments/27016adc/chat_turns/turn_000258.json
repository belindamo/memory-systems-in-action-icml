Here are some tips to help you make dusting a habit:\n\n1. **Schedule it**: Decide on a specific day and time to dust each week, and stick to it. This could be weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, depending on your needs and preferences.\n2. **Break it down into smaller tasks**: Divide your dusting tasks into smaller chunks, such as:\n\t* Dusting one room at a time (e.g., living room, bedroom, etc.)\n\t* Focusing on a specific area, like your bookshelf or TV stand\n\t* Dusting high-traffic areas, like furniture and knick-knacks\n3. **Create a dusting station**: Keep all your dusting supplies in a designated area, like a caddy or bucket with wheels, so you can easily move it around the room.\n4. **Use the right tools**: Invest in a good quality duster, such as a microfiber cloth or a extendable duster, to make the task more efficient.\n5. **Make it a habit loop**: Attach dusting to an existing habit, like cleaning the bathroom or doing laundry. This will help you create a mental connection and make it harder to skip.\n6. **Start small and increase frequency**: If you're new to regular dusting, start with a small area or task and gradually increase the frequency or scope as you get into the habit.\n7. **Make it a mindful experience**: Put on some music, take a few deep breaths, and focus on the task at hand. Make dusting a meditative experience, and you might find yourself looking forward to it!\n8. **Get some accountability**: Share your dusting goals with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can be a great motivator!\n9. **Keep it tidy as you go**: Try to wipe down surfaces and dust as you go, especially after meals or when cleaning other areas. This will prevent dust from building up and make dusting easier.\n10. **Reward yourself**: After completing a dusting task, give yourself a small reward, like taking a few extra minutes to relax or enjoying a favorite snack.\n\nTo specifically address the dust on your bookshelf and TV stand, try the following:\n\n* Use a microfiber cloth to dust the surfaces, as it's gentle and effective.\n* Use a gentle cleaning product, like a dusting spray or a mixture of water and white vinegar, to help remove stubborn dust.\n* Dust the items on your bookshelf and TV stand individually, rather than just wiping down the surface. This will help remove dust from crevices and corners.\n* Consider using a dust-repelling spray or furniture wax to help reduce dust accumulation in the future.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to make dusting a regular part of your routine and keep your belongings dust-free!",
