You only mentioned that you'd like to keep your weekend dance classes as part of your routine.\n\nIf you'd like to share more about your dance classes, I'd be happy to learn more and provide more tailored advice. What type of dance do you enjoy? Is it ballet, contemporary, hip hop, salsa, or something else? And how often do you attend these classes - is it every Saturday, every Sunday, or alternating weekends?",
