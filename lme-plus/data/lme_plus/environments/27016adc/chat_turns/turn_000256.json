Here are some tips to help you make it a consistent part of your routine:\n\n1. **Break it down into smaller tasks**: Instead of looking at cleaning the bathroom as a whole, divide it into smaller tasks, like:\n\t* Cleaning the sink and mirror\n\t* Wiping down the toilet seat and handle\n\t* Cleaning the shower and bathtub\n\t* Mopping the floor\n2. **Create a bathroom cleaning station**: Keep all the necessary cleaning supplies in a caddy or bucket with wheels, so you can easily move it around the bathroom. This will save you time and make it more convenient to clean.\n3. **Schedule it**: As you mentioned, you're already cleaning the sink and toilet every other day. Try to add one or two more tasks to your daily or every-other-day routine, like wiping down the mirror or cleaning the shower.\n4. **Make it a habit loop**: Attach cleaning the bathroom to an existing habit, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. This will help you create a mental connection and make it harder to skip.\n5. **Start small and increase frequency**: If you're new to cleaning the bathroom regularly, start with a small task, like wiping down the sink, and do it daily. As you get into the habit, you can increase the frequency or add more tasks.\n6. **Make it a mindful experience**: Put on some music, take a few deep breaths, and focus on the task at hand. Make cleaning the bathroom a meditative experience, and you might find yourself looking forward to it!\n7. **Reward yourself**: After completing a bathroom cleaning task, give yourself a small reward, like taking a few extra minutes to relax in the tub or enjoying a favorite snack.\n8. **Get some accountability**: Share your cleaning goals with a friend or family member and ask them to hold you accountable. This can be a great motivator!\n9. **Keep it tidy as you go**: Try to wipe down surfaces and clean up spills as soon as they happen. This will prevent dirt and grime from building up and make cleaning easier.\n10. **Celebrate milestones**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, even if it's just a small accomplishment. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged to continue your cleaning habits.\n\nRemember, developing a habit takes time and consistency. Be patient, and don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a day or two. Get back on track, and you'll be cleaning the bathroom like a pro in no time!",
