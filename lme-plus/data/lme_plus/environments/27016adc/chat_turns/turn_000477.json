  "content": "To evaluate the performance of the portfolios, we need to calculate the return rates of each portfolio in each scenario. Since you have provided the return rates of individual assets in the scenarios, we can use the weights from the optimal portfolios obtained from the three methods to calculate the return rates of the portfolios.\n\nLet's denote the weights of the three portfolios as w1, w2, and w3, respectively. Then, for each scenario, we can calculate the return rate of each portfolio as follows:\n\nPortfolio 1 return rate = SUM(w1[i] \\* Asset\\_i\\_return\\_rate)\nPortfolio 2 return rate = SUM(w2[i] \\* Asset\\_i\\_return\\_rate)\nPortfolio 3 return rate = SUM(w3[i] \\* Asset\\_i\\_return\\_rate)\n\nNext, to compare the performance of the three portfolios, we can calculate their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). The CDF of a portfolio's return rates is the probability that the return rate will take a value less than or equal to a given value. To calculate the CDFs, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Sort the return rates of each portfolio in ascending order.\n2. Calculate the cumulative probability for each sorted return rate as the ratio of the rank of the return rate to the total number of scenarios.\n3. Plot the CDFs of the three portfolios together to compare their performance.\n\nThis will give you a visual representation of the performance of each portfolio, showing how likely each portfolio is to achieve a certain level of return. A portfolio with a higher CDF value for a given return rate is considered to have better performance, as it has a higher probability of achieving that return rate or better.",
