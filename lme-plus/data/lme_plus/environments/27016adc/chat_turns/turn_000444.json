Since it's a rectangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\nIn your case, the length is 300 feet and the width is 200 feet, so:\n\nArea = 300 x 200 = 60,000 square feet\n\nSince you mentioned there's a small pond in the corner, we should subtract its area from the total area. The area of the pond is:\n\nArea of pond = \u03c0 x (Diameter/2)^2\n= \u03c0 x (20/2)^2\n= approximately 314 square feet\n\nNow, subtract the area of the pond from the total area:\n\nArea of pasture = 60,000 - 314 = approximately 59,686 square feet\n\nSo, the area of your pasture is approximately 59,686 square feet.\n\nIf you'd like to convert this to acres, there are 43,560 square feet in an acre, so:\n\nArea of pasture (in acres) = 59,686 \u00f7 43,560 \u2248 1.37 acres\n\nThere you have it! Your pasture covers approximately 1.37 acres.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm sure the chicks will enjoy roaming around in their new home!",
