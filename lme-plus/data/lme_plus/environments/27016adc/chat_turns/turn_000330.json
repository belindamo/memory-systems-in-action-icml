Just add some minimal accessories, like a simple necklace or a pair of stud earrings, and you're good to go!\n\nRemember, the key to pulling off an undone hairstyle is to not overthink it. Just rough-dry your hair, add some texture with a texturizing spray or sea salt spray, and scrunch your hair while it's still damp. Then, let it air-dry and you're done! You can always add a bit of hairspray to keep everything in place, but don't overdo it \u2013 you want to maintain that effortless, undone look.",
