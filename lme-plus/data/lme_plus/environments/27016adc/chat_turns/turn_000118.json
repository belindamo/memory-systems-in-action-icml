Here are some natural products that you can use in combination with your all-purpose cleaner to tackle those stubborn stains:\n\n1. **Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds**: This is a concentrated cleaner made from natural ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, and jojoba oil. It's excellent for cutting through grease and grime. Mix 1-2 tablespoons of Sal Suds with water to create a solution, and apply it to the stain. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes before rinsing.\n2. **Ecover Stain Remover**: This is a plant-based stain remover that's specifically designed to tackle tough stains. It's gentle on surfaces but tough on stains. Apply the stain remover directly to the stain, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, and then wipe clean.\n3. **Seventh Generation Stain & Odor Remover**: This is another plant-based stain remover that's effective on a variety of surfaces. It's also biodegradable and non-toxic. Apply the stain remover directly to the stain, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, and then wipe clean.\n4. **Borax**: Borax is a natural mineral that's excellent for removing tough stains, especially those caused by grease and oil. Sprinkle borax powder on the stain, let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour, and then vacuum or wipe clean.\n5. **Washing Soda**: Washing soda is a natural mineral that's similar to baking soda but more alkaline. It's great for removing tough stains, especially those caused by grease and oil. Sprinkle washing soda powder on the stain, let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour, and then vacuum or wipe clean.\n\nWhen using these products, remember to:\n\n* Always read the label and follow the instructions.\n* Test a small area before applying the product to ensure it doesn't damage the surface or fabric.\n* Mix the product with water according to the instructions, as some products can be quite concentrated.\n* Apply the product to the stain, let it sit for the recommended time, and then wipe clean or rinse with cold water.\n\nBy combining these products with your all-purpose cleaner, you should be able to tackle even the toughest stains. Happy cleaning!",
