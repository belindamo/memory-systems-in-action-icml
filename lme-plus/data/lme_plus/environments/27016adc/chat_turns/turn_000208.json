  "content": "The `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is used by the Certbot container to locate the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credentials file. When the Certbot container runs, it will look for the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to determine the location of the credentials file.\n\nIn the `docker-compose.yml` file, we have set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to `/etc/letsencrypt/credentials.json` in the `certbot` service definition:\n```javascript\nenvironment:\n  - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/letsencrypt/credentials.json\n```\nThis tells the Certbot container to look for the GCP credentials file at `/etc/letsencrypt/credentials.json` inside the container. When Certbot needs to authenticate with GCP to manage DNS records for the DNS-01 challenge, it will use the credentials provided in this file.\n\nBy setting this environment variable, we do not need to explicitly specify the location of the credentials file in the `certbot` command. The Certbot container will automatically use the credentials file at the location specified by the environment variable.",
