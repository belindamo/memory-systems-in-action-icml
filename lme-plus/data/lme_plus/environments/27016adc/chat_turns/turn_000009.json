Salsa and swing dance are both high-energy styles that can be great workouts while also being a lot of fun.\n\nSo, to recap, you're taking salsa and swing dance classes on the weekends, which means you'll be dancing on both Saturday and Sunday. That's a great way to stay active and engaged while also enjoying your favorite hobbies.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and pace yourself, especially if you're taking classes back-to-back on the weekends. Make sure to warm up properly before each class, and take breaks when you need them. It's also essential to stay hydrated and fuel your body with a balanced diet to help with recovery.\n\nKeep having fun and enjoying your dance classes!",
