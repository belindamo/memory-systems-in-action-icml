Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Plan ahead**: Check the park's website, map, and schedule to familiarize yourself with the layout, attractions, and showtimes. Make a rough plan of the rides and attractions you want to hit, and prioritize them based on popularity and wait times.\n2. **Arrive early**: Get to the park before opening time to beat the crowds. Take advantage of early morning Extra Magic Hours (if available) or head straight to the most popular rides before the lines build up.\n3. **Use the park's app**: Many theme parks have their own apps that offer real-time updates on wait times, show schedules, and special events. Download the app to stay informed and plan your day more effectively.\n4. **Take breaks**: Theme parks can be overwhelming, especially if you're trying to fit in as many rides as possible. Take regular breaks to rest, grab a snack, and recharge. This will help you avoid burnout and maintain your energy levels throughout the day.\n5. **Consider a Fast Pass or Express ticket**: If the park offers a Fast Pass or Express ticket system, consider purchasing one to minimize wait times. This can be especially useful for popular rides or during peak seasons.\n6. **Eat smart**: Pack snacks and sandwiches to avoid wasting time and money on food. If you do need to eat at the park, try to avoid peak meal times (usually between 11 am and 1 pm) to minimize wait times.\n7. **Make the most of downtime**: Use wait times to take photos, people-watch, or enjoy the park's atmosphere. You can also use this time to plan your next move, check the app for updates, or simply relax.\n8. **Don't be afraid to ask for help**: If you're unsure about anything, from ride restrictions to special events, don't hesitate to ask park staff or guest services for assistance.\n9. **Stay hydrated**: Theme parks can be hot and crowded, so make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Bring a refillable water bottle to avoid waste and save money.\n10. **Have fun!**: Remember, the goal is to have a great time! Don't stress too much about fitting in every ride or attraction. Enjoy the experience, take in the sights and sounds, and make memories with your friends and family.\n\nAs for your goal of hitting 15 theme park visits by the end of the year, that's quite an achievement! You might want to consider investing in a season pass or multi-park ticket to make the most of your theme park adventures. Additionally, consider joining theme park enthusiast communities or online forums to connect with fellow enthusiasts, share tips, and get inspiration for your next adventure.\n\nHave a fantastic time at the new park, and I hope these tips help you make the most of your day!",
