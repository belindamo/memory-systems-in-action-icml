  "content": "I completely agree with you! Physical books will always hold a special place in many readers' hearts, but audiobooks have become a great way to consume books, especially for commutes, workouts, or multitasking. The Libby app is an excellent resource, making it easy to access a vast library of audiobooks and e-books.\n\nUsing audiobooks to get through longer books is a great strategy. It can help you stay engaged and make progress on a book that might otherwise feel daunting. Plus, a good narrator can really bring the story to life!\n\nAs for page count, you're right that a concise story can be just as effective as a longer one. Sometimes, authors can convey the same emotional impact and depth in fewer pages, which is a testament to their skill. Of course, there are times when a longer book is necessary to tell a complex story or explore themes in depth.\n\nIt's great that you're open to experimenting with different formats and finding what works best for you. Have you noticed any differences in your reading experience between physical books and audiobooks? Do you find that you retain information or remember plot points differently between the two formats?\n\nAlso, are there any particular genres or types of books that you prefer to listen to as audiobooks, or do you stick to what you normally read in physical format?",
