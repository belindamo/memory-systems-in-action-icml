      "content": "Some common types of yoga include:\n\n1. Hatha Yoga: focuses on the physical postures and breathing techniques.\n\n2. Vinyasa Yoga: includes continuous and fast-paced movements that synchronize with the breath.\n\n3. Ashtanga Yoga: follows a set sequence of poses, with each movement synchronized with the breath.\n\n4. Iyengar Yoga: emphasizes precise alignment and holding poses for longer periods of time.\n\n5. Bikram Yoga: involves a series of 26 postures, performed in a heated room.\n\n6. Kundalini Yoga: aims to awaken energy in the spine, combining physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation.\n\nFor beginners, Hatha Yoga and Iyengar Yoga are great options as they focus on the basics of postures and breathing techniques. Vinyasa Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga can also be great for beginners, but it is important to find a class with a teacher who can guide you through the more complex movements. Bikram Yoga and Kundalini Yoga may be more intense and specialized, so it is best to gain some experience in other types of yoga before attempting these practices."
