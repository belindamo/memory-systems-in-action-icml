However, the reality is much more complex, and there are many examples of communities that have failed despite seemingly doing everything right. In this article, we will explore some of these examples and challenge some of the assumptions about what it takes to build a successful community on Discord.\n\nI. Examples of communities that failed despite following best practices:\nA. The community that became too large to manage\n1. Example of a community that grew too quickly, leading to chaos and ultimately failure\n2. How a lack of planning and preparation can lead to the downfall of a community\nB. The community that became too insular\n1. Example of a community that became too focused on a specific topic, leading to stagnation and lack of growth\n2. How a failure to adapt and evolve can lead to the demise of a community\nC. The community that became too toxic\n1. Example of a community that allowed toxic behavior to go unchecked, leading to a toxic culture and ultimately the departure of many members\n2. How a failure to enforce community standards can lead to the destruction of a community\n\nII. Assumptions about building a successful community on Discord that need to be challenged:\nA. The assumption that size equals success\n1. How a focus on growth can lead to neglect of existing members and a failure to build a strong community culture\n2. The importance of quality over quantity when it comes to community building\nB. The assumption that a narrow focus is key to success\n1.

The assumption that best practices are universal\n1. How different communities have different needs and require different approaches to community building\n2. The importance of understanding the unique needs of your community and tailoring your approach accordingly\n\nIII. Conclusion:\n\nBuilding a successful community on Discord is a complex and multifaceted process that requires more than just following a set of best practices. By challenging some of the assumptions about community building and examining examples of communities that failed despite seemingly doing everything right, we can gain a deeper understanding of what it takes to build a truly successful community on Discord. Ultimately, success comes down to understanding your community's unique needs, being willing to adapt and evolve, and prioritizing the quality of your community over its size."
