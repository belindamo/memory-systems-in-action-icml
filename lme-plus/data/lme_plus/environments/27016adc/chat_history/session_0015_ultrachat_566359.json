However, there are several modes of transportation that you can use to navigate the city and see the historical sites. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. Public transportation: Istanbul has an extensive public transportation network, with buses, trams, ferries, and a metro system. You can purchase an Istanbulkart, a rechargeable travel card, and use it to pay for all modes of transportation. This is an excellent option for budget-conscious travelers and those who want to avoid the hassle of navigating Istanbul's traffic. 2. Taxi/Uber: Taxis are widely available in Istanbul and are relatively inexpensive compared to other major cities. You can also use Uber or similar ride-hailing services to get around. However, keep in mind that traffic can be heavy, especially during rush hour. 3. Walking: Walking is an excellent option for exploring the historical sites in Istanbul, especially if they are located close together. It's also a great way to experience the city's vibrant culture and street life. 4. Guided tours: If you're not familiar with the city and its transportation system, a guided tour might be the best option. Many tours include transportation to and from the landmarks, and you can sit back and relax while someone else does the driving. I hope these tips are helpful!"
