Are there any underground resistance movements or rebel groups inside the hybrid kingdoms, or are the people too afraid to oppose the hybrids?\n3. How has religion changed in the Tiamat zone and the hybrid kingdoms? Are there any new religious movements that have emerged in response to the world's transformation?\n4. What is the state of education in the Tiamat zone and the hybrid kingdoms? Are there any efforts to educate people outside of the elite castes?\n5. How do the hybrids view the concept of love and relationships? Do they have any romantic or emotional connections with humans, or do they see them as purely tools for their own purposes?\n6. Are there any notable landmarks or ruins from the pre-Tiamat era that still exist and are visited by people in the world?\n7. How do the different societies within the Tiamat zone interact with each other? Is there any cooperation or trade between them, or do they mostly exist as isolated pockets of civilization?\n8. What is the general attitude towards technology in the Tiamat zone and the hybrid kingdoms? Are there any groups that seek to restore the world to its pre-Tiamat state, or is the current level of technology seen as sufficient for survival?"

      "content": "23. they have a limited concept of the outside world, mostly they know from old news, legends, and mostly they see it as chaos, a dog-eat-dog world, and a dystopia. So they pretty much have a good idea of what it is like.\n\n24. People are too afraid.\n\n27. The Hybrids are pretty much sociopathic, so they struggle to feel anything even if they try. They see everyone except them as mere tools. Extreme solipsism.\n\n28. Most of the world is basically intact, so people still visit the Mekkah, the Vatican etc. but there's more doubt than before, as there's \"the wounded god\" present on the planet, and immortal beings who ( people feel ) could appear and kill everyone on a whim.\n\n29. They are mostly isolated pockets.\n\n30. Most people feel as they don't need technology, and some preachers even have sown the ideology that the outside world ( outside the zone ) will eventually collapse, and even they will be left without technology, and that's when \"the Meek\" ( people who survive without electricity, inside the zone ) will inherit the earth."

Do they see themselves as superior to all other life forms, or do they see themselves as equals to other advanced beings in the universe?\n2. How do the hybrids maintain their power and control over the society? Do they use force, propaganda, or a combination of both?\n3. What is the Hybrids' ultimate goal or objective? Is it simply to maintain power and control, or do they have a greater purpose or mission?\n4. Are there any rebel groups or individuals who resist the Hybrids' rule? If so, how do they operate, and what is their ultimate goal?\n5. How has the presence of the Tiamat zone affected the global environment and natural resources? Are there any new species or phenomena that have emerged as a result?\n6. How do different cultures and societies view the Tiamat zone? Is there a common understanding or belief about its origins and nature, or do beliefs and interpretations vary widely?\n7. How do the hybrids view the concept of death and mortality? Do they fear death, or do they see themselves as beyond death and mortality?\n8. Are there any secret societies or organizations that operate outside of the hybrids' control? If so, what are their objectives, and how do they evade detection?"

      "content": "31. The hybrids see themselves as superior to everything else ( there are no aliens in my novels ).\nThey do however have a bit of a conflicting feeling toward Mr. Gray who they know had created them out of his own DNA. So they feel a bit jealous and a bit inferior in some way. It's something that bothers them. The Hybrids sometimes feel an emptiness, they feel they're the pinnacle of evolution, so they have a desire to see something \"better\", but they also want to be forever in absolute power. The hybrids also aren't very creative, so they often feel bored.\n\n32. The Hybrids use everything at their disposal, though they often delegate this to \"Eunuchs\", or other loyal servants. \n\n33. The Hybrids want absolute power and control, and to live in luxury and spoil themselves rotten. They really don't have any higher-minded ideals, which also makes them feel a bit insecure. They want to seem like they have this grand purpose, so they invent grand projects to do. They want to prove themselves to each other and to the ones below, but they're also too lazy to do too much, or to introspect too much. Leaving a lot to Raziel and the \"Eunuch\" class is what eventually leads to the danger of robbing the human species of sentience.\n\n36. the interpretations vary wildly, because there was no one reliable source to explain the events back when they happened.\n\n37. The hybrids have a panic from the thought of their own demise, so they try their best to avoid thinking about it. They want to see themselves as above death and mortality, and morality.\n\n38. There are several"

      "content": "groups and organizations outside the Hybrid kingdoms that resist their rule, but they are largely ineffective due to lack of resources, technology, and unity. Some are small, underground groups that engage in sabotage and guerrilla tactics, while others are larger, more organized resistance movements that aim to overthrow the Hybrid governments. However, these movements are often infiltrated by Hybrid spies, and their leaders are usually captured and executed. Despite this, some still hold onto the hope of one day overthrowing the Hybrid rule and restoring humanity's freedom."

It's a somewhat distant concept to the people in the zone, as most of them have never seen a Hybrid or heard of any direct action of the hybrids.\n\n2. speaking, messages, writing...\n\n3. very low, but also adapted for survival, hunting, agriculture, repairs etc.\n\n4. All the notable US and Canadian landmarks are still there, but mostly retaken by nature, or knocked around by earthquakes.\n\n6. no, as the hybrids are a distant thing, something the \"zoners\" don't really have to concern themselves about.\n\n7. The Hybrids desire love and relationships, but can't muster the emotions. They feel as if there's something missing within their mind, and that makes them a bit angry. The hybrids can have sex, and enjoy physical contact with others, but there's nothing more, or better said - nothing longer lasting they can feel. So, for example, they can have a brief relationship with a human, have sex with the human, see something in that human, sense some sort of love, and then suddenly feel nothing and proceed to kill that human without remorse. \n\n8. that technology is unnecessary, and that keeping tradition will eventually lead the \"zoners\" to become the inheritors of the earth ( once everyone else's technology fails )\n\n9. Mostly just old christianity and some native american faith systems with added thoughts about Tiamat, and the role of the expanding zone, and the potential of the zoners to inherit the earth."

How do the hybrid leaders communicate with each other and make decisions?\n5. Are there any areas or regions that are completely uninhabitable due to radiation or other dangers?\n6. What kind of energy sources do people use in the Tiamat zone and outside of it?"
