  "content": "It's natural to feel nervous on your first day at a new job. While you want to make a good impression, no one expects you to be perfect right away. If you do make a mistake, own up to it, learn from it, and move on. Remember that everyone was once new, and your colleagues and managers are there to support you. Don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification if you're unsure about something. The key is to stay positive, be open to learning, and do your best. With time and practice, you'll become more confident and comfortable in your new role.",
