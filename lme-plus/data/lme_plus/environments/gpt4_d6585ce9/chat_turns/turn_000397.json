However, research has shown that media can play a role in shaping societal attitudes and beliefs about gender roles, particularly in children and adolescents who are still developing their identities.\n\nWhen media portrays diverse and complex representations of gender roles, it can challenge and broaden societal expectations and stereotypes. However, when media reinforces traditional gender roles, it can have negative effects on individuals' self-esteem, career aspirations, and social perceptions of gender.\n\nSo while it may be difficult to determine the exact impact that horror films have on societal attitudes towards gender roles, it's important to recognize that media representation is a powerful tool that can both reflect and shape our cultural beliefs and values.",
