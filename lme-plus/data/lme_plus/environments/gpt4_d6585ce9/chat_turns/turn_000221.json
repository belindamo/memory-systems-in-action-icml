  "content": "It's common to forget people's names or some of the information from the orientation and training session, especially when you're trying to absorb a lot of new information all at once. However, there are ways to help you remember them:\n\n1. Take notes: During the orientation and training session, take notes on important information and any names or job titles that are mentioned.\n\n2. Use mnemonic devices: For remembering names, try using mnemonic devices such as associating a person's name with their appearance or focusing on the first letter or sound of their name.\n\n3. Don't be afraid to ask again: If you forget someone's name, simply ask them for it again. They will appreciate that you're making an effort to remember.\n\n4. Seize opportunities to practice: Use every opportunity to practice people's names or new information, such as introducing yourself to colleagues or asking questions during work meetings.\n\nJust remember that forgetting information or someone's name is normal, and it's better to ask again than to pretend you know something when you don't. Your colleagues and managers will appreciate your honesty and enthusiasm to learn.",
