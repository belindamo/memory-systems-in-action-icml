The daughter peered into the toilet, interested by all the \"stuff\" inside. \"Wow, look at all that stuff, Mama!\"\n\nThe mother carefully removed the diaper and clothes that had been soiled in the diaper blowout.\n\n\"I don't want to take these off, they're my favorite!\" the daughter protested.\n\n\"I know, honey, but they're all dirty now. We need to get you into some clean clothes,\" the mother explained as she put the dirty diaper and wipes in the toilet.\n\n\"Can I flush it, Mama? Can I?\" the daughter asked excitedly.\n\n\"Sure, honey. You can flush it,\" the mother said with a smile. The daughter proudly pressed the handle, flushing the dirty contents away.\n\nNext, the mother flushed the soiled shirt. \"No, Mama, not my overalls!\" the daughter protested as she watched her favorite overalls go into the toilet.\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey, but we can't keep them either. They're covered in the same yucky stuff. We need to flush them away so we can finish cleaning up and get you into your fresh outfit,\" the mother explained.\n\nThe daughter pouted as she watched her overalls disappear down the drain. \"Bye bye, overalls. I'll miss you too,\" she said sadly.\n\nThe mother put a new diaper on the daughter and helped her into a fresh outfit. The daughter was excited to see her new yellow sundress with white flowers and matching sandals.\n\nThe mother finished cleaning up the bathroom and was grateful for the extra set of clothes she had packed in the diaper bag. The daughter was happy to be feeling fresh and clean again.\n\n\"Phew, that was a close one. Let's not have any more diaper blowouts for a while, okay?\" the mother said, relieved that everything had been successfully flushed away without any problems.\n\n\"Okay, Mama. I'll be more careful,\" the daughter nodded.",
