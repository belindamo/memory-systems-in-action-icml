Here are some purr-fectly suitable and durable toy recommendations for Luna:\n\n1. **Wand Toys with Feathers or Fabric**: These usually consist of a flexible rod with a lure attached to the end, such as feathers, fabric, or other materials. They encourage natural hunting behavior and provide exercise. Look for ones with sturdy construction and securely attached lures.\n2. **Interactive Treat Dispensers**: These toys challenge Luna to figure out how to get treats out, keeping her engaged and stimulated. Choose ones made from durable plastic or rubber that can withstand biting and scratching.\n3. **Crinkle Toys**: Kittens love the noise and texture of crinkle toys. Opt for ones with sturdy seams and a durable material that won't tear easily.\n4. **Catnip-Filled Mice Toys**: These are usually made of sturdy fabric or plush and filled with catnip to entice Luna to play and pounce.\n5. **Tunnels and Tents**: Collapsible tunnels and tents provide endless fun for kittens, encouraging them to explore, hide, and seek. Look for durable, sturdy materials that can withstand Luna's playful roughhousing.\n6. **Balls and Track Toys**: Balls with bells or feathers inside can provide entertainment, while track toys with moving parts challenge Luna to bat and chase.\n7. **Kong Toys**: Kong toys are durable and versatile, allowing you to fill them with treats, catnip, or even canned food. They're perfect for keeping Luna occupied and stimulated.\n8. **Cardboard Boxes**: Okay, not exactly a traditional toy, but kittens love playing with and hiding in cardboard boxes! Just be sure to supervise and remove any staples or tape.\n\nWhen choosing toys, remember to consider Luna's age, size, and personality. Avoid toys with small parts that can be a choking hazard, and always supervise playtime to ensure her safety.\n\nWhich type of toy do you think Luna would enjoy the most?",
