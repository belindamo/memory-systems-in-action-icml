It's a great companion piece to The Crown, exploring the earlier years of British monarchy.\n2. **The White Princess** (Starz): A miniseries based on Philippa Gregory's novel, it tells the story of Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV, and her marriage to Henry Tudor, who becomes King Henry VII. It's a fascinating exploration of the early Tudor dynasty.\n3. **Reign** (The CW, Netflix): This show follows the life of Mary Queen of Scots, played by Adelaide Kane, as she navigates the treacherous world of 16th-century royal politics. It's a bit more soap-operatic than The Crown, but still offers plenty of drama and intrigue.\n4. **Poldark** (BBC One, PBS): Set in the late 18th century, this series follows the story of Ross Poldark, a British Army officer who returns to Cornwall and becomes embroiled in the local mining industry. It's a sweeping romance with plenty of drama, beautiful scenery, and a strong sense of period atmosphere.\n5. **Outlander** (Starz, Amazon Prime): Based on the novels by Diana Gabaldon, this show follows a World War II nurse who travels back in time to 18th-century Scotland, where she becomes embroiled in the Jacobite uprising. It's a time-traveling romance with plenty of drama, action, and stunning scenery.\n6. **The Spanish Princess** (Starz): Another Philippa Gregory adaptation, this miniseries tells the story of Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry VIII, and her journey from Spain to England. It's a fascinating exploration of the early Tudor court.\n7. **The Last Kingdom** (Netflix): Based on Bernard Cornwell's novels, this series follows the story of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, a Saxon boy captured and raised by Vikings, as he navigates the treacherous world of 9th-century England. It's a gripping historical drama with plenty of action and intrigue.\n\nThese shows offer a mix of period drama, romance, and royal intrigue that might scratch that The Crown itch.
