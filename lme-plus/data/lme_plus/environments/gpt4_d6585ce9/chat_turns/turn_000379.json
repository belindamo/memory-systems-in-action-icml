Prevent Matted Fur: Preventing matting in the first place is easier than trying to deal with it. Make it a habit to brush your Maltese's fur regularly using a slicker brush, especially in areas that are prone to matting like behind the ears, under the arms, and around the legs. 2. Use Proper Tools: Invest in high-quality grooming tools, such as a dematting tool, scissors, and combs, to help you work through mats without causing pain or discomfort to your dog. 3. Wet fur that is severely matted: Wetting the fur that is severely matted can make it easier to work through the mats. Use warm water and apply a pet-safe detangler or conditioner to the mats before combing or brushing. 4. Cut It Out: If the mats are too severe, cutting them out may be the best option to prevent pain to your dog. Use scissors and take care to cut as close to the skin as possible without nicking your Maltese. 5. Be Gentle: Remember to be gentle and patient while grooming your Maltese to avoid injuring your dog or causing pain. 6. Seek Professional Help: If the mats are too severe or your Maltese is sensitive, it may be best to seek professional help from a groomer. I hope these tips help you deal with matted fur in your Maltese. Remember that regular grooming and maintenance is key to preventing matting, and it is important to groom your dog in a safe and gentle manner.",
