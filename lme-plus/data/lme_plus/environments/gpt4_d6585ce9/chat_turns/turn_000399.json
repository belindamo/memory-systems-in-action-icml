  "content": "You're correct that individuals can interpret and view media in a variety of ways, and that media is not solely responsible for societal attitudes towards gender roles. However, it's important to acknowledge that media does play a role in shaping cultural norms and values, and can contribute to the perpetuation of harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nHorror films, like all media, are not created in a vacuum. They are made within a larger cultural context that shapes their content and are usually created for a particular target audience. When filmmakers rely on tired old gender tropes to create tension and excitement in horror films, they are perpetuating and promoting those gender stereotypes to their audiences.\n\nMoreover, the vast majority of horror films have male directors, writers, and producers who may not have a nuanced understanding of gender issues, leading to over-reliance on traditional gender norms in their stories.\n\nUltimately, it's up to each individual to interpret and consume media in their own way, but it's also important to recognize that media representation has the power to influence cultural attitudes, and therefore, we should hold horror films, and all media, to a higher standard of representation.",
