It's possible that it's a local event or a fictional event.\n\nNow, let's talk about wheels and tires! Upgrading to lightweight wheels with high-performance tires can definitely improve your car's performance, but it's essential to consider several factors before making a purchase.\n\n**Lightweight Wheels:**\n\nWhen shopping for lightweight wheels, look for wheels made from materials like forged aluminum or magnesium. These materials are stronger and lighter than traditional steel wheels, which can improve your car's power-to-weight ratio and handling.\n\n**High-Performance Tires:**\n\nFor high-performance tires, consider tires with a high speed rating (e.g., W or Y) and a low aspect ratio (e.g., 35 or 40). These tires are designed to provide better grip, handling, and braking performance.\n\n**Recommendations for Your 2018 Ford Mustang GT:**\n\nHere are some recommendations for lightweight wheels and high-performance tires that might suit your car:\n\n1. **Wheels:** Consider wheels from reputable brands like OZ Racing, Forgeline, or HRE Wheels. Look for wheels with a diameter between 18 and 20 inches, depending on your car's ride height and suspension setup.\n2. **Tires:** Look for tires from brands like Michelin, Continental, or Goodyear. Consider tires with a high speed rating (e.g., W or Y) and a low aspect ratio (e.g., 35 or 40). Some popular options include:\n\t* Michelin Pilot Sport 4S\n\t* Continental ExtremeContact DW\n\t* Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\nBefore making a purchase, consider the following:\n\n1. **Clearance:** Ensure the new wheels and tires fit your car's fenders and suspension setup.\n2. **Weight:** Calculate the weight of the new wheels and tires to ensure they won't compromise your car's power-to-weight ratio.\n3. **Ride quality:** Consider the impact of stiffer tires and lighter wheels on your car's ride quality.\n4. **Budget:** Set a budget and stick to it to avoid overspending.\n\nI hope this helps!",
