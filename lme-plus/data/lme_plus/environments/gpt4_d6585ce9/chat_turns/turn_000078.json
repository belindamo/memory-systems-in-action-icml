  "content": "I'm looking for some new music recommendations. I've been to a few concerts recently and I'm always on the lookout for new artists to listen to. Speaking of which, I attended a free outdoor concert series in the park today and discovered some great new talent - it's really cool to see live music in a low-key setting like that. Do you have any suggestions for indie or alternative bands I might like?",
