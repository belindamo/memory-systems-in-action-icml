They're durable, effective, and many cats love the feel of the sisal rope under their claws.\n\nAww, February 10th, huh? It's amazing how fast time flies when you have a furry little bundle of joy like Luna in your life! It's wonderful that you're reflecting on the time you've spent with her and realizing how much she's grown and become a part of your daily life.\n\nYou know, it's great that you're taking the time to appreciate the little things, like the milestones and memories you've shared with Luna. It's a special bond that only grows stronger with time.\n\nSpeaking of which, has Luna developed any funny quirks or habits since you brought her home? Like, does she have a favorite toy or activity that always makes her go crazy? I'd love to hear about it!",
