  "content": "Adding more complexity to the engine compartment and interior can really make your Ferrari model stand out. Wiring, hoses, and engine components like cylinders or pistons can add a lot of visual interest and realism to the model. And detailing the interior with textured seats and a more detailed dashboard can make the model feel more immersive and authentic.\n\nThat paint chipping technique sounds like a great way to add some realism to your model. Masking tape can be a really useful tool for creating sharp, defined edges and lines, and using it to create a chipped, worn look can add a lot of character to the model. I'm sure it'll be a great addition to your Ferrari.\n\nIt's great that you've been working on your model sporadically over the past three weeks. Consistency is key when it comes to making progress on a project, and it's awesome that you've been able to dedicate some time to it each week. Five hours on a Sunday afternoon is a great chunk of time to get started on a project, and it's impressive that you've been able to make progress on it since then.\n\nHow many hours do you think you've put into the model so far? And do you have a rough estimate of how many hours you think it'll take to complete the project?\n\nAlso, have you thought about displaying your model once it's complete? Do you have a display case or shelf in mind, or are you planning to enter it into any model shows or competitions?",
