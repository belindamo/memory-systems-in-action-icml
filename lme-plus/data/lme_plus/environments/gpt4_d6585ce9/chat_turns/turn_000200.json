  "content": "I'm thinking of using a combination of washes and drybrushing to achieve a subtle weathering effect. I've seen some great tutorials online that demonstrate how to create a realistic worn look using these techniques. I'm also considering using pigments to add some subtle dirt and grime effects to the model.\n\nBy the way, I recently attended a local model building club meetup, and I met some fellow enthusiasts who showed me their incredible models. One of the guys, John, had an amazing WWII-era bomber model that was incredibly detailed. It was really inspiring to see the level of detail he had achieved, and it motivated me to push myself to add more complexity to my own models.",
