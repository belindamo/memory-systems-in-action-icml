The sliced radishes will add a nice crunch and a burst of flavor to your tacos.\n\nNow, let's talk about homemade tortillas! I'm thrilled to hear that you didn't give up after your first attempt and tried again with better results. Making homemade tortillas can be a bit finicky, but with some practice and patience, you'll get the hang of it.\n\nHere are some tips to help you make perfect homemade tortillas:\n\n1. **Use the right type of flour**: Look for a high-protein flour, such as bread flour or all-purpose flour with a high protein content. This will help your tortillas develop a better texture and structure.\n2. **Use warm water**: Warm water will help the dough come together more easily and create a more pliable tortilla.\n3. **Don't overmix the dough**: Mix the dough just until it comes together in a ball. Overmixing will lead to tough, dense tortillas.\n4. **Let the dough rest**: Letting the dough rest, or \"ripen,\" will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to work with and resulting in a more tender tortilla.\n5. **Use the right rolling pin**: A cast-iron or marble rolling pin is ideal for rolling out tortillas. These materials will help you achieve a consistent thickness and prevent the dough from sticking.\n6. **Roll out the dough evenly**: Try to roll out the dough to an even thickness, about 1/8 inch. This will help your tortillas cook evenly and prevent them from becoming too thick or too thin.\n7. **Cook the tortillas at the right temperature**: Cook your tortillas over medium-high heat, about 450\u00b0F to 500\u00b0F. This will help them cook quickly and develop a nice texture.\n8. **Don't overcook the tortillas**: Cook the tortillas for about 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side, until they're lightly browned and slightly puffed.\n\nSome other tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Use a tortilla press or a heavy object to flatten the dough, if needed.\n* If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. If it's too dry, add a little more water.\n* Experiment with different types of flour, such as corn flour or whole wheat flour, to create different flavor profiles.\n* Practice makes perfect! Don't be discouraged if your first few batches of tortillas don't turn out perfectly. Keep trying, and you'll eventually get the hang of it.\n\nI hope these tips help you in your tortilla-making journey!
