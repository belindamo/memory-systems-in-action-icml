The fact that you're making fewer typos is a great bonus, too. It's amazing how a small change in your writing setup can have a significant impact on your productivity and accuracy.\n\nThe tactile feedback of mechanical keys can help you type more efficiently and accurately by providing a clear indication of when a key has been pressed. This can reduce finger fatigue and improve your overall typing experience. Additionally, the sound of the keys can be very satisfying and help you get into a rhythm while typing.\n\nIt's also great that you've noticed an improvement in your ability to get into a flow state. Being in a flow state can be incredibly productive, and it's wonderful that your new keyboard is helping you achieve that more easily.\n\nNow that you've noticed these benefits, you might want to experiment with other ways to optimize your writing setup. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Try different keyboard switch types**: Mechanical keyboards come with different switch types, such as Cherry MX Red, Blue, or Brown. Each switch type has its own unique feel and sound. You might find that you prefer a different switch type for your writing.\n2. **Experiment with keyboard ergonomic accessories**: Consider using ergonomic accessories like a wrist rest or a keyboard tray to improve your typing posture and reduce strain on your wrists and hands.\n3. **Adjust your writing environment**: Think about your writing environment and how you can optimize it for focus and productivity. This might include using a noise machine, playing instrumental music, or using a website blocker like Freedom or SelfControl.\n4. **Set writing goals and challenges**: Setting writing goals and challenges can help you stay motivated and focused. Try setting a daily word count goal or challenging yourself to write for a certain amount of time without taking a break.\n\nRemember, the key to making progress as a writer is to find a setup that works for you and to continually challenge yourself to improve.\n\nHow do you think your new mechanical keyboard will impact your writing routine and goals? Do you have any specific writing projects or goals that you're working towards?",
