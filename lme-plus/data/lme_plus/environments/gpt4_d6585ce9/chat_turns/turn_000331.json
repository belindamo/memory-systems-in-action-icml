  "content": "That sounds like a fun project! I'd be happy to help you and your team troubleshoot the scoring system.\n\nTo get started, can you please share the relevant code related to the scoring system? Specifically, I'd like to see:\n\n1. The code that updates the score\n2. Any functions or methods that calculate or modify the score\n3. Any relevant data structures (e.g., variables, lists, dictionaries) that store the score or related information\n\nAdditionally, please describe the expected behavior of the scoring system and what's not working as intended. For example:\n\n* What type of game is this (e.g., quiz, platformer, puzzle)?\n* How is the score supposed to be updated (e.g., incrementing, decrementing, based on certain conditions)?\n* What's the current behavior you're seeing, and how does it differ from what you expect?\n\nThe more information you provide, the better I'll be able to understand the issue and help you identify the problem.\n\n(And kudos to you and your team for working on a project together! Collaborative coding can be a great way to learn and grow as developers.)",
