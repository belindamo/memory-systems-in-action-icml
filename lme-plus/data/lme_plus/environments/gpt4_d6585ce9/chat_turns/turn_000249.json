The costumes, sets, and cinematography are stunning, transporting you to the 1980s with ease.\n\nOnce you continue watching, you'll be treated to outstanding performances from the entire cast, particularly Olivia Colman, Gillian Anderson, and Emma Corrin, who bring their characters to life with remarkable depth and nuance.\n\nTake your time, and enjoy the rest of the season!",
