  "content": "I'm thinking of checking out some local music events, maybe a free outdoor concert series in the park or a jazz night at a local bar. Since I've been to a music festival in Brooklyn with a group of friends, featuring a lineup of my favorite indie bands, I'm looking forward to discovering new artists and enjoying live music in a more low-key setting. Do you have any specific recommendations for local music events or venues in my area?",
