Here are some TV show recommendations with similar humor and strong female leads:\n\n1. **Schitt's Creek** (Netflix): A heartwarming comedy with a similar tone and wit. It follows a wealthy family who loses everything and moves to a small town they purchased as a joke. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara shine as the lovable but eccentric parents.\n2. **Killing Eve** (BBC America, AMC): A spy thriller with dark humor, complex characters, and a cat-and-mouse game between an MI6 agent (Sandra Oh) and a psychopathic assassin (Jodie Comer).\n3. **Shrill** (Hulu): Based on the memoir \"Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman\" by Lindy West, this comedy stars Aidy Bryant as a woman who decides to improve her life, relationships, and career while embracing her individuality.\n4. **The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel** (Amazon Prime): A period comedy-drama about a housewife-turned-comedian in the 1950s, starring Rachel Brosnahan.
