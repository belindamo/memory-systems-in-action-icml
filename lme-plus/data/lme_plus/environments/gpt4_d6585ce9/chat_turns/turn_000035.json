This will add a touch of sophistication and protect the frame during transport.\n2. **Gift wrapping paper**: Choose a wrapping paper that complements the artwork's colors or theme. You could opt for a subtle pattern or a solid color that will let the artwork be the focal point.\n3. **Furoshiki wrapping**: If you want to add a unique touch, consider using a Furoshiki cloth to wrap the gift.
