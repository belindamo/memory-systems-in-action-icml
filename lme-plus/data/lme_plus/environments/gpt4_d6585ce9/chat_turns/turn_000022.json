  "content": "I'm interested in exploring the topic of teacher diversity and cultural responsiveness, particularly in the context of urban schools. I believe that teachers who reflect the diversity of their students can have a profound impact on student outcomes and teacher practice. My experience attending my niece's high school graduation ceremony on June 15th reminded me of the importance of creating a supportive learning environment that acknowledges and values the diversity of all students.\n\nCan you provide more information on how teacher evaluation and development systems can be designed to promote diversity, equity, and cultural responsiveness in urban schools?",
