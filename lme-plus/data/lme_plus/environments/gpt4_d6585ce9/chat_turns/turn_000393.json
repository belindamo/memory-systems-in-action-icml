However, I can provide an objective analysis of the gender roles portrayed in horror films.\n\nIn general, horror films have a tendency to reinforce traditional gender roles by portraying women as helpless victims and men as strong, decisive protectors. However, some horror films have challenged these gender roles by portraying women as strong, independent, and capable of defending themselves.\n\nThe extent to which the characters in a horror film challenge traditional gender roles varies depending on the film. In some films, the female characters are completely reliant on the male characters for protection, while in others, the female characters actively participate in the fight against the antagonist.\n\nFor example, the film \"Scream\" challenges traditional gender roles by portraying the female protagonist Sidney Prescott as a strong, independent woman who is not afraid to fight back against her attacker. Similarly, the film \"The Babadook\" challenges traditional gender roles by portraying the female protagonist Amelia as a single mother who takes on the role of protector and defender for her son.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all horror films challenge gender roles in this way. Many horror films still rely on traditional gender roles to create tension and suspense, with women portrayed as vulnerable and in need of protection. It's up to filmmakers to decide how they want to approach gender roles in their films, and audiences to decide whether they want to consume that type of material.",
