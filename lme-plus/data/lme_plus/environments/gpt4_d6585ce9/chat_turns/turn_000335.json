  "content": "Rachel's suggestion is an excellent idea! Encapsulating the game state, including the score, within a class is a great way to organize your code and avoid global variable issues. This approach is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n\nUsing a class to manage the game state provides several benefits:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: You can keep all the game state variables, including the score, within a single class, making it easier to manage and update them.\n2. **Modularity**: By separating the game state from the rest of the code, you can modify or extend the game state without affecting other parts of the program.\n3. **Code organization**: A class helps to keep your code organized, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n\nHere's a simple example to get you started:\n```python\nclass GameState:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.score = 0\n\n    def collect_coin(self):\n        self.score += 10\n\n    def get_score(self):\n        return self.score\n```\nIn this example, the `GameState` class has three methods:\n\n1. `__init__`: Initializes the game state with a score of 0.\n2. `collect_coin`: Increments the score by 10 when a coin is collected.\n3. `get_score`: Returns the current score.\n\nTo use this class, you can create an instance of `GameState` and call its methods:\n```python\ngame_state = GameState()\n\n# ...\n\n# When a coin is collected\ngame_state.collect_coin()\n\n# Get the current score\nprint(game_state.get_score())  # Output: 10\n```\nTips to keep in mind:\n\n* Make sure to initialize the `GameState` instance only once, and reuse it throughout the game.\n* You can add more methods to the `GameState` class to manage other aspects of the game state, such as player position, lives, or level progress.\n* Consider using a single instance of `GameState` as a singleton, so that you can access the game state from anywhere in the code.\n\nBy using a class to manage the game state, you'll be able to avoid global variable issues and create a more organized, maintainable codebase. Good luck, and have fun implementing it!",
