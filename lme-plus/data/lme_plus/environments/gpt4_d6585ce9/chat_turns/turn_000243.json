It's a great show, and I'm sure you'll get back to it eventually.\n\nRegarding Killing Eve, Phoebe Waller-Bridge's involvement is definitely a big plus, and her writing is a significant part of the show's appeal. While Killing Eve is a spy thriller, it's not your typical espionage series. It's more of a character-driven, psychological thriller with a strong focus on the cat-and-mouse game between Villanelle (Jodie Comer) and Eve (Sandra Oh).\n\nThe show explores themes of obsession, power dynamics, and the blurring of lines between good and evil. The writing is witty, clever, and often humorous, which might appeal to you if you enjoyed Fleabag's tone. The characters are complex and multidimensional, with both Villanelle and Eve being fascinating and flawed protagonists.\n\nThat being said, if you're not typically into spy thrillers, you might still enjoy Killing Eve for its character-driven storytelling and the performances of the leads. Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh are both phenomenal in their roles, and their chemistry is undeniable.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you could try watching the first episode or two to see if it grabs you. The show is well-paced, and the story unfolds quickly, so you'll get a good sense of the tone and style within the first few episodes.\n\nAdditionally, Phoebe Waller-Bridge was only involved in the first season as the showrunner and writer, so if you're not hooked by the end of season 1, you can always stop there. However, many fans would argue that the subsequent seasons are just as good, if not better, so you might find yourself invested in the story and characters regardless.\n\nGive it a try, and see how you feel!",
