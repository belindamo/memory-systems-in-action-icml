Here are some tips on how to care for your brown boots:\n\n**Cleaning:**\n\n1. **Brush off dirt and debris**: Use a soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth to remove any dirt, dust, or debris from the surface of the boots.\n2. **Use a gentle cleaner**: Look for a mild soap or a boot cleaner specifically designed for leather. Apply a small amount to a clean cloth and gently rub it onto the boots. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that can damage the leather.\n3. **Conditioning**: After cleaning, use a leather conditioner or a leather oil to moisturize the leather. This will help keep the leather supple and prevent it from drying out or cracking.\n\n**Polishing:**\n\n1. **Choose the right polish**: Select a brown polish that matches the color of your boots. You can also use a neutral polish or a waterproofing spray for added protection.\n2. **Apply polish sparingly**: Use a clean cloth to apply a small amount of polish to the boots. Rub it in circular motions, making sure to cover the entire surface.\n3. **Buff to a shine**: Use a clean, dry cloth to buff the boots and create a high shine.\n\n**Protection:**\n\n1. **Waterproofing**: Apply a waterproofing spray or cream to protect the boots from water and stains.\n2. **Conditioning regularly**: Regular conditioning will help maintain the leather's natural moisture and prevent it from drying out.\n3. **Store properly**: When not in use, store your boots in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Use shoe trees or stuff the boots with paper to maintain their shape.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Avoid extreme temperatures**: Avoid exposing your boots to extreme heat or cold, as this can cause the leather to dry out or crack.\n2. **Avoid harsh chemicals**: Never use harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or strong polishes, as they can damage the leather.\n3. **Handle with care**: Be gentle when handling your boots to avoid scratching or scuffing the leather.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your brown boots looking great for a long time.

You mentioned earlier that you had just polished your Adidas Superstars, and now you want to get them dirty again?\n\nIf you're looking to test out the new shoe cleaning kit, you might consider using it on a different pair of shoes that are already dirty or stained.
