Popular brands like Fitbit, Garmin, or Apple Watch tend to hold their value better than lesser-known brands.\n2. **Condition**: As I mentioned earlier, the condition of your device plays a significant role in determining its trade-in value. Since your fitness tracker stopped working properly, its value might be lower than if it were still in good condition.\n3. **Age**: The age of your device also impacts its trade-in value. Since your fitness tracker is around 6 months old, it might still have some value, but it might not be as high as if it were a newer model.\n\nConsidering your fitness tracker is no longer working properly, you might not get a high trade-in value. However, it's still worth checking with Samsung or other trade-in programs to see what they can offer.\n\n**Tips to Maximize Your Trade-in Value:**\n\n1. **Clean and Prepare Your Device**: Make sure your fitness tracker is clean and free of any personal data before trading it in.\n2. **Provide Original Packaging and Accessories**: If you still have the original packaging, charger, and any other accessories, include them with your trade-in to increase its value.\n3. **Research and Compare Trade-in Values**: Check with multiple trade-in programs, including Samsung's, to find the best offer for your device.\n\nKeep in mind that the trade-in value might not be as high as you expect, but every little bit helps when purchasing a new device like the Galaxy Tab S8.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need help with the trade-in process, feel free to ask!",
