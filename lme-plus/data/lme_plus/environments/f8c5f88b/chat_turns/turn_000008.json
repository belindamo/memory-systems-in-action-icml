Look for a cardigan in a neutral shade that complements the color of your dress. Here are a few tips to consider:\n\n* If your dress is light-colored, opt for a darker-colored cardigan to create contrast.\n* If your dress has a bold print, choose a solid-colored cardigan to balance it out.\n* Consider a cardigan with a chunky knit or a fun texture to add depth to your outfit.\n\nYou can wear the cardigan open or tied around your waist, depending on your personal style. This will not only add a stylish touch but also help you adjust to changing temperatures throughout the night.\n\n**Facial moisturizer recommendations:**\n\nI'm glad you're loving the new brand you discovered at Target! There are many great facial moisturizers out there, and it's always exciting to explore new options.
