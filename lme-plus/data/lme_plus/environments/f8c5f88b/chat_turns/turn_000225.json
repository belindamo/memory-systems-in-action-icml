  "content": "That's wonderful! I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited to play those classic Bollywood tunes at your family dinner. Music has a way of transcending generations and evoking emotions, and I'm sure your grandma will thoroughly enjoy dancing to those iconic songs.\n\nThe addition of lime juice and chaat masala to your fruit chaat will definitely give it an extra boost of flavor. Chaat masala, in particular, is a blend of spices that's commonly used in Indian street food and adds a unique, tangy flavor to fruits.\n\nAs you play those classic Bollywood tunes, I'm sure your grandma will be transported back to a bygone era, reliving memories of her youth. It's a great way to bond with your family and create new memories together.\n\nRemember to have fun and be present in the moment. Encourage everyone to get up and dance, and don't worry too much about the steps \u2013 it's all about enjoying the music and each other's company.\n\nI hope you and your family have a fantastic time, and I'm sending you all lots of love and best wishes for a wonderful family dinner!",
