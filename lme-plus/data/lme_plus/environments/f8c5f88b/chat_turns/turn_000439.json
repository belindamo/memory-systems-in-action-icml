However, some types of buildings may be more vulnerable to damage during natural disasters in Nagano or any other location. For example, older buildings with outdated construction techniques and infrastructure may not withstand the impact of earthquakes or strong winds. Buildings located in flood-prone areas and those constructed in unstable ground conditions can be more vulnerable to damage during natural disasters such as floods and landslides. Furthermore, tall buildings with a higher center of gravity may experience more significant swaying and structural stress during earthquakes compared to lower or smaller structures. It's essential to follow proper construction guidelines and implement resilient designs to ensure the safety of buildings during natural disasters.",
