  "content": "Construct 3, GameMaker Studio, and Stencyl all offer free versions, with limitations on certain features and functionality. These free versions are suitable for beginners and can be used to create simple 2D games.\n\nIn terms of ease of use, Construct 3 is the most beginner-friendly of the three, as it uses a drag-and-drop interface and requires no coding. GameMaker Studio and Stencyl both require some coding, but their interfaces are also relatively easy to use.\n\nRegarding Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot, while they are powerful game engines, they are typically more difficult for beginners to use due to their steep learning curves and more advanced features. They require some programming knowledge and may be overwhelming for beginners who are just starting out in game development. However, as a beginner, it is worth exploring all available options and trying out different game engines to find the one that best fits your needs and preferences.",
