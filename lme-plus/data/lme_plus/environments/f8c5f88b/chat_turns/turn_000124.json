After the inspection report is finalized and you've negotiated with the seller, the next steps in the homebuying process are:\n\n**1. Finalize the repair or credit agreement**:\nIf you've negotiated repairs or credits with the seller, ensure that the agreement is finalized and included in the sale contract.\n\n**2. Update the sale contract**:\nThe sale contract will be updated to reflect any changes, repairs, or credits agreed upon during the inspection negotiation.\n\n**3. Secure financing**:\nYour lender will need to review the inspection report and update your loan application accordingly. This may involve re-evaluating your loan terms or requesting additional documentation.\n\n**4. Complete any additional inspections or testing**:\nDepending on the inspection report findings, you may want to conduct additional inspections or testing, such as a sewer scope or mold testing.\n\n**5.

Review the report carefully and ensure any issues are resolved.\n\n**6. Purchase title insurance**:\nTitle insurance protects you and the lender from potential title defects or issues. You'll typically need to purchase a lender's policy and an optional owner's policy.\n\n**7.

Finalize your loan terms**:\nYour lender will finalize your loan terms, including the interest rate, loan amount, and repayment terms.\n\n**9. Review and sign the closing documents**:\nCarefully review the closing documents, including the mortgage note, deed, and other paperwork.

Close on the property**:\nAttend the closing meeting, sign the final documents, and transfer the ownership of the property. Congratulations, you're now a homeowner!\n\n**11. Complete any post-closing tasks**:\nUpdate the property's utilities, services, and insurance policies in your name.
