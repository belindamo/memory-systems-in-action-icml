  "content": "Tracking your budget-friendly purchases, like the clothes from Old Navy, is just as important as tracking your luxury purchases, like the Neiman Marcus spree. \n\nBy tracking all your purchases, you'll get a complete picture of your spending habits, including:\n\n1. **Patterns**: You might notice that you tend to splurge on luxury items during certain times of the year or when you're feeling stressed.\n2. **Trade-offs**: You might realize that you're making conscious choices between budget-friendly options and luxury items. For example, you might choose to buy a cheaper alternative to save money for a bigger splurge later.\n3. **Budgeting**: Tracking all your purchases will help you allocate your money more effectively. You might find that you can afford to splurge occasionally because you're being frugal in other areas.\n\nWhen tracking your budget-friendly purchases, make sure to categorize them accurately. In this case, you could categorize the Old Navy purchase under **Clothing and accessories**, just like the Neiman Marcus spree. This will help you see the total amount you're spending on clothing and accessories, and make adjustments as needed.\n\nRemember, the goal is to understand your spending habits, not to judge yourself. By tracking all your purchases, you'll gain a better understanding of your financial priorities and make informed decisions about how you want to allocate your money.\n\nAs you start tracking your expenses, you might also want to consider setting up a \"splurge fund\" or a separate category for luxury items. This will help you set aside money specifically for those treats and avoid dipping into your everyday spending money.\n\nHow do you feel about tracking all your purchases, including the budget-friendly ones?",
