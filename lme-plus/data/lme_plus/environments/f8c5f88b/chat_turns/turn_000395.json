  "content": "Typically, the Man Booker Prize judges choose only one winner. However, there have been a few occasions when the judges could not decide on a single winner and have awarded the prize jointly. This has happened twice in the history of the Man Booker Prize. The first time was in 1974, when the prize was shared between Nadine Gordimer for her novel \"The Conservationist\" and Stanley Middleton for his novel \"Holiday\". The second time was in 1992, when the prize was shared between Michael Ondaatje for his novel \"The English Patient\" and Barry Unsworth for his novel \"Sacred Hunger\". Since then, the prize has always been awarded to a single winner.",
