I've been trying to reduce my carbon footprint, and sharing tips and tricks on how I do it could be really helpful to others. Plus, it'll be a great way to show that sustainability is a journey, not a destination. I can share things like my morning routine, how I prep my sustainable meals, and even my favorite eco-friendly products. Do you think I should also use the \"Question\" sticker to ask my followers what they'd like to see more of in terms of sustainability content?",
