Succulents are especially low-maintenance, so they're perfect for busy people or those who don't have a lot of experience with plants.\n\nI'm sure the herb garden adds a lovely fragrance to the room as well. Fresh herbs like basil, rosemary, and thyme can really enhance the ambiance of a space and make it feel more inviting. Plus, you can use them in cooking, which is a great bonus!\n\nNow that you have some greenery in the room, you might consider adding some decorative elements that will complement them. Here are a few ideas:\n\n* **Add a natural fiber rug**: A jute or sisal rug can add warmth and texture to the room, and it will complement the natural beauty of your plants.\n* **Bring in natural elements**: Add some natural elements like a vase with branches, a bowl of river rocks, or a decorative shell to bring in more of the outdoors.\n* **Use natural textiles**: Consider adding throw blankets or pillows made from natural fibers like cotton, linen, or wool. These will add warmth and coziness to the room.\n* **Add some warm lighting**: Table lamps or floor lamps with warm-toned shades can add a cozy glow to the room and highlight your plants.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep things simple and understated. You want to let your plants be the stars of the show, so don't overdo it with too many decorative elements. A few well-chosen pieces can make a big impact and create a cozy, inviting atmosphere.\n\nHow do you like the way your living room is shaping up? Is there anything else you're planning to add or change?",
