Here are some tips to help you decide what to request from the seller and what to tackle on your own:\n\n**1. Review the inspection report carefully**:\nTake the time to thoroughly review the inspection report, and don't hesitate to ask the inspector questions or seek clarification on any findings.\n\n**2. Categorize the findings**:\nGroup the findings into categories, such as:\n\t* Safety hazards (e.g., electrical or fire hazards)\n\t* Major systems (e.g., roof, plumbing, HVAC, electrical)\n\t* Structural concerns (e.g., foundation, walls, floors)\n\t* Cosmetic issues (e.g., scratched floors, worn-out carpets)\n\t* Maintenance and upkeep (e.g., HVAC servicing, gutter cleaning)\n\n**3. Evaluate the cost and impact**:\nResearch the cost of repairs and replacements to determine which items are most critical to address. Consider the impact of each issue on your daily life, resale value, and budget.\n\n**4. Identify must-haves and nice-to-haves**:\nDistinguish between must-haves (critical issues that need to be addressed) and nice-to-haves (items that are desirable but not essential).\n\n**5. Prioritize based on severity and urgency**:\nRank the findings based on their severity and urgency. Address safety hazards and critical system failures first, followed by structural concerns and then cosmetic issues.\n\n**6. Consider the seller's perspective**:\nRemember that the seller may not be willing or able to address all your concerns. Be prepared to negotiate and prioritize your requests.\n\n**7. Request repairs or credits**:\nAsk the seller to repair or provide credits for the most critical issues. Be specific about what you're requesting and how you want the issue addressed.\n\n**8. Be flexible and open to compromise**:\nBe prepared to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution. You may need to compromise on some items in exchange for others.\n\n**9. Consider hiring a contractor or specialist**:\nIf you're not comfortable with the seller's proposed repairs or want a second opinion, consider hiring a contractor or specialist to assess the issue and provide an estimate.\n\n**10. Keep records and documentation**:\nMaintain a record of all correspondence, inspections, and repairs. This will help you track progress and ensure that all agreed-upon work is completed.\n\n**What to tackle on your own**:\n\n* Cosmetic issues (e.g., painting, replacing fixtures)\n* Regular maintenance (e.g., HVAC servicing, gutter cleaning)\n* Upgrades and improvements (e.g., replacing old appliances, adding new fixtures)\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be better equipped to prioritize the inspection report findings, negotiate with the seller, and make informed decisions about what to request and what to tackle on your own.",
