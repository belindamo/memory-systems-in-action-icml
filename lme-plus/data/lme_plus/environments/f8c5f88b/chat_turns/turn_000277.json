Improving your game with your new racket and practicing with your friends will definitely help you progress.\n\nStrengthening your core and legs is crucial for tennis, as they provide the foundation for your movements, stability, and power. Here are some exercises to help you improve your core and leg strength for tennis:\n\n**Core Exercises:**\n\n1. **Plank**: Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets. This exercise targets your abs, obliques, and lower back.\n2. **Russian twists**: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Twist your torso to left and right, touching your hands to the ground each time. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n3. **Leg raises**: Lie on your back with arms extended overhead and legs straight. Lift your legs off the ground, keeping them straight, and hold for 1-2 seconds. Lower your legs back down without touching the floor, and repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Bicycle crunches**: Lie on your back with hands behind your head and legs lifted and bent at a 90-degree angle. Alternate bringing your knees towards your chest, as if pedaling a bicycle. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n\n**Leg Exercises:**\n\n1. **Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hands by your sides. Lower your body down into a squat, keeping your back straight and knees behind your toes. Push back up to the starting position.

Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each leg.\n3. **Calf raises**: Stand on the edge of a step or curb with your heels hanging off the edge. Raise up onto your tiptoes and then lower back down. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.\n4. **Agility drills**: Set up a course with cones or markers and perform drills like figure-eights, zigzags, and carioca drills to improve your speed, agility, and reaction time.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Incorporate plyometric exercises**: Explosive movements like jump squats, box jumps, and burpees can help improve your power and acceleration on the court.\n2. **Incorporate lateral movements**: Tennis requires quick movements side to side, so incorporate exercises like side lunges, lateral shuffles, and carioca drills to improve your speed and agility.\n3. **Focus on functional strength**: Tennis-specific exercises that mimic the movements you'll make on the court, such as serving, forehand, and backhand, can help improve your overall strength and endurance.\n4. **Incorporate cardio exercises**: Tennis can be a high-intensity sport, so incorporate cardio exercises like running, cycling, or swimming to improve your endurance and stamina.\n\nRemember to always warm up before exercising and to listen to your body and take regular breaks to avoid injury.\n\nI hope these exercises help you improve your core and leg strength for tennis!",
