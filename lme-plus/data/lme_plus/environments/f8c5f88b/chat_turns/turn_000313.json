Here are some ideas for decorations and food that you might consider:\n\n**Decorations:**\n\n* **Theme:** Consider your sister's interests or favorite colors to choose a theme for the party. This will help guide your decoration decisions. For example, if she loves travel, you could decorate with vintage maps and globes. If she loves flowers, you could go with a garden party theme.\n* **Balloons:** Balloons are a classic party decoration. You can get them in various colors and shapes to match your theme.\n* **Streamers:** Hang colorful streamers from the ceiling or along walls to add a festive touch.\n* **Bunting:** Create a DIY bunting with triangular pieces of cardstock or fabric in your theme's colors.\n* **Centerpieces:** Use vases or jars with fresh flowers, candles, or decorative objects that match your theme.\n* **Personalized banners:** Create a banner with your sister's name and age to hang above the food table or entrance.\n\n**Food:**\n\n* **Cake:** A birthday cake is a must-have! Choose a flavor and design that your sister will love.
