Longlisting: The judges read through all the submitted books and create a longlist of up to 13 titles in September.\n\n3. Shortlisting: In October, the judges narrow down the longlist to a shortlist of six books.\n\n4. Winner selection: The judges read the shortlisted books again and hold discussions to decide on the winner. The winner is announced at a ceremony in October or November.\n\nThe judges are appointed by the Man Booker Foundation and change every year. They are usually made up of a mix of writers, critics, and literary figures. The judges are expected to read all the submitted books and base their decision on literary merit, originality, and accessibility. They also take into consideration the author's skill in using the English language and the book's contribution to the genre.",
