Here are some of the most common findings:\n\n**Exterior**\n\n1. **Roof damage**: Missing, damaged, or loose shingles, curled or buckled shingles, and signs of wear around chimneys, vents, and skylights.\n2. **Siding issues**: Cracks, gaps, or rotting wood, which can lead to water intrusion and pest infestations.\n3. **Gutter problems**: Clogged, sagging, or damaged gutters, which can cause water to accumulate and lead to foundation problems.\n\n**Plumbing**\n\n1. **Leaky faucets and fixtures**: Dripping faucets, toilets, and showerheads can waste water and increase utility bills.\n2. **Water heater issues**: Leaks, rust, or corrosion on the water heater, which can lead to premature failure.\n3. **Galvanized pipes**: Outdated galvanized pipes can corrode and restrict water flow.\n\n**Electrical**\n\n1. **Outdated electrical panels**: Old or recalled electrical panels, such as Federal Pacific or Zinsco, can be a fire hazard.\n2. **Flickering lights**: Flickering lights can indicate loose connections, overloaded circuits, or worn-out wiring.\n3. **Exposed wiring**: Exposed or damaged wiring can be a fire hazard.\n\n**HVAC**\n\n1. ** Dirty or clogged air filters**: Dirty filters can reduce airflow, increase energy bills, and lead to premature system failure.\n2. **Leaking ducts**: Leaks in the ductwork can cause energy loss and reduce system efficiency.\n3. **Old or inefficient systems**: Outdated HVAC systems can be inefficient, noisy, and prone to breakdowns.\n\n**Structural**\n\n1. **Foundation issues**: Cracks in walls, ceilings, or floors can indicate foundation problems, such as settlement or water damage.\n2. **Termite damage**: Termite infestations can cause significant structural damage if left untreated.\n3. **Water damage**: Water stains, warping, or rotting wood can indicate water intrusion, which can lead to structural issues.\n\n**Insulation and Ventilation**\n\n1. **Lack of insulation**: Inadequate insulation can lead to energy loss, high utility bills, and moisture issues.\n2. **Poor ventilation**: Inadequate ventilation can cause moisture buildup, leading to mold, mildew, and structural issues.\n\n**Pest and Rodent Infestations**\n\n1. **Termite activity**: Termite infestations can cause significant structural damage if left untreated.\n2. **Rodent infestations**: Rodents can cause damage to insulation, wiring, and drywall, and can also spread disease.\n\n**Appliances and Fixtures**\n\n1. **Outdated or malfunctioning appliances**: Old or malfunctioning appliances can be inefficient, noisy, or pose a safety risk.\n2. **Leaky faucets and toilets**: Leaks can waste water and increase utility bills.\n\nKeep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list, and the inspector may find other issues specific to the property. It's essential to review the inspection report carefully and prioritize the findings based on their severity and potential impact on the property's value and your safety.\n\nRemember, a home inspection is not a guarantee that the property is free of defects, but it can help you make a more informed decision and potentially negotiate with the seller or request repairs.",
