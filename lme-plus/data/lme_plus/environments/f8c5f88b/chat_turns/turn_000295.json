  "content": "An officer stationed at an IPAC (Installation Personnel Administration Center) on a Marine Corps Base (MCB) who would be able to verify enlistment information would likely be a Personnel Officer or an Administration Officer. These officers are responsible for managing personnel and administrative matters for Marines stationed at the base, including verifying enlistment and service information.\n\nAdditionally, a Staff Noncommissioned Officer (SNCO) or Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) may also be able to verify enlistment information, as they are responsible for providing guidance and support to junior Marines and may have access to the necessary records and information.\n\nIf you need to verify your own enlistment information, it's best to contact the IPAC at the specific Marine Corps Base where you were stationed, and they can assist you in verifying your information or point you in the right direction.",
