  "content": "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Adding a small vase and a few coffee table books is a great starting point. It's always better to start with a few pieces and gradually add more, rather than overwhelming the space with too many items at once.\n\nRemember, the key is to have fun and experiment with different arrangements until you find one that feels like you. Don't be afraid to move things around, try out different combinations, and adjust as needed.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that it's okay if your coffee table arrangement isn't perfect or Instagram-worthy. It's about creating a space that feels cozy and inviting to you and your guests.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy the process of creating your cozy living room!",
