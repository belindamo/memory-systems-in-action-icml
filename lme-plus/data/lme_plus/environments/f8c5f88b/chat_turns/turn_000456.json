  "content": "I'm considering using some beach-inspired textiles and fabrics for the outdoor furniture and decorations. I like the idea of using natural fabrics like linen or canvas for the throw pillows and blankets. I'm also thinking of incorporating some beachy patterns, like stripes or shells, into the fabric designs.
