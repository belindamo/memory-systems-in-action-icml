  "content": "Warming up before playing tennis is crucial to prevent injuries and prepare your muscles for the game. Here are some exercises you can do to warm up:\n\n1. **Light Cardio**: Jog around the court or do some jumping jacks to get your heart rate up and loosen your muscles.\n2. **Leg Swings**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart and swing one leg forward and backward, then switch to the other leg. This helps loosen your hips and legs.\n3. **Arm Circles**: Hold your arms straight out to the sides and make small circles with your hands. Gradually increase the size of the circles as you continue.\n4. **Shoulder Rolls**: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion. Repeat for several repetitions.\n5. **Neck Stretches**: Slowly tilt your head to the side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 10-15 seconds and then return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.\n6. **Wrist Extensions**: Hold your arm straight out in front of you and lift your hand up, then lower it back down. Repeat several times.\n7. **Leg Raises**: Stand with your feet together and raise one leg off the ground, keeping it straight. Hold for a few seconds, then lower it back down. Repeat with the other leg.\n8. **Tennis-Specific Drills**: Do some light forehand and backhand swings without a ball to get your muscles accustomed to the motion.\n9. **Dynamic Stretching**: Do some dynamic stretches like high knees, butt kicks, or side shuffles to get your muscles ready for explosive movements.\n\nRemember to keep your warm-up light and gradual, increasing the intensity as you go. Aim for a 10-15 minute warm-up before starting your game.\n\nHave a great time playing tennis, and I hope the weather cooperates!",
