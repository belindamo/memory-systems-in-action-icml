If you're using it at night, you can consider adding it to your morning routine as well, especially if you're targeting specific skin concerns like fine lines, wrinkles, or discoloration.\n\nHowever, if you have sensitive skin, you might want to start with once a day and gradually increase the frequency as your skin adjusts. Remember to always follow the product's instructions and patch test before making any changes to your routine.\n\n**Exfoliation Frequency:**\n\nExfoliating once a week is a good starting point, but you might need to adjust the frequency based on your skin type and concerns. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n* **Normal to dry skin:** Exfoliate 1-2 times a week to maintain a healthy balance of cell turnover and hydration.\n* **Oily skin:** Exfoliate 2-3 times a week to help control oil production and reduce the appearance of pores.\n* **Sensitive skin:** Exfoliate 1 time a week or every 10 days to avoid irritation and inflammation.\n* **Acne-prone skin:** Exfoliate 2-3 times a week to help unclog pores and reduce acne.\n\nRemember, over-exfoliating can lead to irritation, dryness, and even more breakouts. Start with a gentle exfoliant and gradually increase the frequency or intensity as your skin adapts.\n\n**Physical vs. Chemical Exfoliants:**\n\nYou mentioned using a physical exfoliant (e.g., scrub, brush, or microbeads) once a week. Physical exfoliants can be effective, but they might not be suitable for everyone, especially those with sensitive skin.\n\nConsider incorporating a chemical exfoliant (e.g., alpha-hydroxy acid, beta-hydroxy acid, or enzyme-based products) into your routine 1-3 times a week. Chemical exfoliants can be more gentle and effective for many skin types, and they can help address a range of concerns, from acne to aging skin.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Always patch test new exfoliants, especially if you're introducing a new product or frequency.\n* Start with a gentle exfoliant and gradually increase the intensity or frequency as your skin adapts.\n* Be gentle when exfoliating, especially around the delicate skin around your eyes and mouth.\n* Exfoliate in the direction of skin growth, not against it, to avoid causing micro-tearing and irritation.\n\nI hope this helps you refine your skincare routine! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.",
