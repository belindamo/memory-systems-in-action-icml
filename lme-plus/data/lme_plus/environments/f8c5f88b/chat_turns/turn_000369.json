Can you please provide me with the following information:\n\n1. How many days do you want to dedicate to working out per week?\n2. What are your available times for working out on each day (e.g., morning, lunch break, evening)?\n3. How many tennis lessons do you have per week, and what are the dates and times for each lesson?\n4. How often do you want to run and cycle, and how long do you want each session to be?\n5. Are there any specific days or times when you prefer to do your running and cycling sessions?\n6. Do you have any rest days or days off from exercise planned for the week?\n7. Are there any other activities or exercises you'd like to incorporate into your routine (e.g., strength training, yoga, stretching)?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you create a personalized workout schedule that fits your busy schedule and priorities.\n\n(And don't worry about skipping your badminton session today - we can focus on planning your workout routine for the rest of the week!)",
