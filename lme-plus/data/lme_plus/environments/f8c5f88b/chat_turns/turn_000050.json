Factors that may influence this could include the influence of social media and the Internet in spreading and prolonging trends, nostalgia for a perceived simpler time, and the popularity of 80s-inspired media such as the Netflix series Stranger Things. On the other hand, the trend may also die out if people tire of it or move on to other interests.",
