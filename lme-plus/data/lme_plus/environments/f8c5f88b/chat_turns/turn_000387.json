  "content": "HelloFresh offers some flexibility when it comes to ingredient swaps and omissions. Here's how it works:\n\n**Ingredient Swaps:**\n\n1. **Swap out ingredients**: In some cases, HelloFresh allows you to swap out ingredients with alternatives. For example, if a recipe calls for bell peppers and you don't like them, you might be able to swap them out with zucchini or carrots, depending on the recipe.\n2. **Ingredient substitutions**: HelloFresh may offer substitution options for certain ingredients, such as swapping chicken breast for thighs or substituting one type of fish for another.\n\n**Ingredient Omissions:**\n\n1. **Omit ingredients**: If you dislike a particular ingredient or have a dietary restriction, you can often omit it from the recipe. For example, if a recipe calls for dairy and you're lactose intolerant, you can choose to omit the dairy product or substitute it with a non-dairy alternative.\n2. **Customize your box**: When you're reviewing your meal plan, you can indicate that you don't want a particular ingredient or that you'd like to swap it out for something else. HelloFresh will do their best to accommodate your request.\n\n**How to request ingredient swaps or omissions:**\n\n1. **Contact customer service**: Reach out to HelloFresh's customer service team via phone, email, or chat to request ingredient swaps or omissions. They'll do their best to accommodate your request.\n2. **Use the 'Special Requests' feature**: When reviewing your meal plan, you can add special requests or notes for each recipe. This is a great way to communicate with the HelloFresh team and request ingredient swaps or omissions.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nWhile HelloFresh is flexible with ingredient swaps and omissions, there are some limitations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Recipe integrity**: HelloFresh may not be able to accommodate all requests if they affect the integrity of the recipe or the cooking process.\n2. **Ingredient availability**: HelloFresh may not always have alternative ingredients available, especially if they're seasonal or specialty items.\n3. **Timing**: Requests for ingredient swaps or omissions should be made in a timely manner, as HelloFresh's menu and ingredient selection are finalized several days in advance.\n\nBy communicating with the HelloFresh team and using the 'Special Requests' feature, you can enjoy a more customized meal kit experience that meets your dietary needs and preferences.",
