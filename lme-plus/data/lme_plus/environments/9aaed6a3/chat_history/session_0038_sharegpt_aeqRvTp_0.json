      "content": "The passage you are referring to is from Plato's \"Phaedrus\". In the dialogue, Socrates is having a conversation with Phaedrus and critiques the invention of writing. He argues that writing is an inferior form of knowledge because it relies on external symbols, and that it will lead to forgetfulness among those who rely on it, since they will no longer need to commit things to memory. Here is the passage:\n\n\"This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them.\" - Plato, Phaedrus."

      "content": "Sure, here are three authors who discuss Plato's critique of writing in \"Phaedrus\":\n\n1. 18th century: Jean-Jacques Rousseau - In his \"Confessions\", Rousseau refers to Plato's critique of writing and argues that writing has caused people to forget the art of oral storytelling.\n2. 19th century: Friedrich Nietzsche - In his \"Twilight of the Idols\", Nietzsche discusses Plato's idea that writing would lead to forgetfulness and argues that it has instead created a culture of memory that is stronger than ever before.\n3. 20th century: Walter J. Ong - In his book \"Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word\", Ong provides an in-depth analysis of Plato's critique of writing and argues that the shift from orality to literacy had a profound impact on human culture and thought."

      "content": "Walter J. Ong (1912-2003) was an American Jesuit priest, professor of English, and cultural historian. He was best known for his work on the impact of oral and written cultures on the development of human consciousness and culture. Ong's research focused on the transition from orality to literacy and its effects on language, thought, and culture.\n\nOne of his most important works is \"Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word\", where he discusses Plato's critique of writing and provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of writing on human communication and culture. Ong argues that the shift from an oral culture to a literate culture changed the way people think, learn, and remember information, and that it has had a profound impact on human history.\n\nOng was widely recognized as one of the leading experts on the history of human communication and was awarded numerous honors and awards for his contributions to the field. He remains one of the most widely read and influential scholars in the field of cultural history and the study of orality and literacy."

      "content": "Sure, here's an example of a female author from the 20th/21st century who discusses Plato's critique of writing:\n\n1. Maryanne Wolf - Maryanne Wolf is a neuroscientist and psychologist who specializes in the study of reading and literacy. In her book \"Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain\", Wolf discusses Plato's critique of writing and its impact on the development of the human brain. She argues that reading and writing have changed the way humans think and process information, and that these changes have had a profound impact on the development of human consciousness.\n\nWolf's work provides a unique perspective on the impact of writing on the human brain and offers insights into the ways in which literacy has shaped human culture and thought."

    {

      "content": "Sure, here's another example of a female author who discusses Plato's critique of writing:\n\n1. Avital Ronell - Avital Ronell is a German-American philosopher and cultural critic. In her book \"The Telephone Book: Technology, Schizophrenia, Electric Speech\", Ronell discusses Plato's critique of writing and argues that new technologies, such as the telephone and other forms of electronic communication, have challenged traditional notions of communication and knowledge.\n\nRonell's work offers a contemporary perspective on Plato's critique of writing and argues that new technologies have created new forms of memory and knowledge that are distinct from those of the past. She explores the ways in which new technologies have transformed the way people communicate and understand the world, and argues that these changes have had a profound impact on human culture and thought."

      "content": "please discuss further Friedrich Nietzsche - In his \"Twilight of the Idols\", Nietzsche discusses Plato's idea that writing would lead to forgetfulness and argues that it has instead created a culture of memory that is stronger than ever before."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In \"Twilight of the Idols\", Friedrich Nietzsche discusses Plato's idea that writing would lead to forgetfulness and argues that it has had the opposite effect. Nietzsche argues that writing has actually created a culture of memory that is stronger than ever before, and that it has allowed people to store, preserve, and transmit knowledge and ideas in a way that was not possible in an oral culture.\n\nNietzsche sees writing as a tool for preserving and strengthening the human memory, rather than a cause of forgetfulness. He argues that writing has allowed people to expand their capacity for recall, to preserve the memories and knowledge of their ancestors, and to transmit their own memories and knowledge to future generations.\n\nIn \"Twilight of the Idols\", Nietzsche also argues that the spread of literacy and the development of written culture has allowed for the creation of a vast library of knowledge, which he calls the \"book memory\". He sees this as a major factor in the development of modern civilization and argues that it has allowed people to access and build upon the knowledge of the past in ways that were not possible in an oral culture.\n\nOverall, Nietzsche's view of writing as a tool for preserving and strengthening the human memory offers a counterargument to Plato's critique of writing, and provides a more positive perspective on the impact of writing on human culture and thought."
