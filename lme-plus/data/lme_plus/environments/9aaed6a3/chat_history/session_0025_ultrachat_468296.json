    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "While the bagpipes are a popular instrument in other Celtic cultures, such as Scotland, the harp has been a more prominent instrument in Irish culture for centuries. In fact, the harp is one of the oldest instruments in Ireland and has been an integral part of Irish music and culture since medieval times. It was also used as a symbol of Irish nationalism during the struggle for independence in the 19th and 20th centuries, and is still used as a symbol of Irish identity and pride today. While bagpipes and other instruments are also part of traditional Irish music, the harp is a uniquely Irish instrument that has contributed to the country's rich musical heritage."
