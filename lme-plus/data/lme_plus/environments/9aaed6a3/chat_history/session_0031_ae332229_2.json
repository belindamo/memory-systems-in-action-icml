      "content": "I'm happy to help you plan some fun outdoor activities for your summer vacation! However, I have to clarify that it's not possible for you to have experienced a cold winter with temps below 25\u00b0F (-4\u00b0C) from December to February if you're planning a summer vacation in July. December to February is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and July is summer.\n\nThat being said, I'll assume you're looking forward to enjoying the warm weather and sunshine at your beach house in July. Here are some fun outdoor activities you might consider:\n\n1. **Beach games and relaxation**: Spend the day lounging on the beach, swimming, building sandcastles, playing beach volleyball, or trying other beach games like frisbee, soccer, or bocce ball.\n2. **Water sports**: Rent kayaks, paddleboards, or jet skis to explore the surrounding waters. If you're near a surf spot, consider taking a surfing lesson or renting a board to catch some waves.\n3. **Hiking or nature walks**: Look for nearby nature reserves or parks with hiking trails that offer scenic views of the coast or surrounding landscape.\n4. **Beach bonfires**: If allowed by local regulations, gather some firewood and enjoy a beach bonfire in the evening, roasting marshmallows or telling stories with family and friends.\n5. **Fishing**: Try your hand at fishing from the shore, a pier, or a boat (if you have access to one). Make sure to follow local fishing regulations and obtain any necessary permits.\n6. **Tide pool exploration**: Explore the shallow pools of seawater left on the beach at low tide and discover marine life like anemones, starfish, and crabs.\n7. **Sunrise or sunset watching**: Wake up early to watch the sunrise over the ocean or gather on the beach to enjoy the sunset with your family and friends.\n8. **Biking or cycling**: Rent bikes and ride along the beachfront path or explore nearby bike trails.\n9. **Surf fishing**: If you're near a surf spot, try your hand at surf fishing, which involves fishing from the beach in the surf zone.\n10. **Outdoor picnics**: Pack a picnic lunch and enjoy eating outdoors at a scenic spot near the beach or in a nearby park.\n\nRemember to always follow safety guidelines and regulations, and be mindful of the environment and local wildlife when engaging in these activities.\n\nI hope this helps you plan a fun and memorable summer vacation at your beach house!"

Here are some tips to help you prepare for the summer tennis league:\n\n1. **Dust off your racket**: Get your racket out of storage, and give it a good cleaning. Make sure the strings are in good condition, and consider getting them re-strung if necessary.\n2. **Practice your strokes**: Start practicing your forehand, backhand, serve, and volley. You can do this by hitting with a friend, a ball machine, or even just hitting against a wall. Focus on proper technique and consistency.\n3. **Improve your footwork**: Agility and quick movements are crucial in tennis. Incorporate exercises like ladder drills, cone drills, or shuttle runs to improve your speed and agility.\n4. **Work on your serves**: A strong serve can be a game-changer in tennis. Practice your serve technique, focusing on power, spin, and accuracy.\n5. **Play with players of varying skill levels**: Playing with players who are better or worse than you can help you improve your game.

This will give you a chance to relax and take in the views.\n5. **Take your time**: Don't rush the drive.
