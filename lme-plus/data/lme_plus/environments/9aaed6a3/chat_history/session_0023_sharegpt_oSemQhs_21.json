Quality circles have been implemented across M&M's operations, including manufacturing, supply chain, and customer service.\n2. Lean Manufacturing: M&M has implemented lean manufacturing practices across its production lines to eliminate waste, reduce lead times, and improve efficiency. M&M's lean manufacturing approach focuses on continuous improvement, standardization, and visual management.\n3.

      "content": "Inventory management is a critical aspect of any business, and M&M has implemented several practices to manage its inventory effectively. Here are five examples of how M&M addresses inventory management on the basis of the criticality of individual items:\n\n1. ABC Analysis: M&M uses the ABC analysis method to categorize its inventory based on its criticality. Items are classified as A, B, or C based on their relative importance. A items are high-value items that require close monitoring, while C items are low-value items that require less attention.\n2. Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory Management: M&M uses JIT inventory management to ensure that it has the right amount of inventory on hand to meet production demands. JIT involves ordering inventory only when it is needed, rather than keeping a large amount of inventory in stock.\n3. Safety Stock: M&M maintains safety stock of critical items to ensure that it has enough inventory on hand to meet unexpected demand or supply chain disruptions. Safety stock levels are determined based on the criticality of the item, lead times, and demand variability.\n4. Consignment Inventory: M&M works with some of its suppliers to maintain consignment inventory, which is inventory that is owned by the supplier until it is used by M&M. This helps M&M reduce its inventory carrying costs and ensures that it has access to critical items when it needs them.\n5. Automated Inventory Management System: M&M uses an automated inventory management system to track inventory levels and movement. The system provides real-time visibility into inventory levels and alerts inventory managers when inventory levels are low or when there are supply chain disruptions.\n\nOverall, M&M's approach to inventory management is comprehensive and includes a variety of practices that address the criticality of individual items. By using techniques such as ABC analysis, JIT inventory management, safety stock, consignment inventory, and an automated inventory management system, M&M can ensure that it has the right amount of inventory on hand to meet production demands while minimizing inventory carrying costs."
