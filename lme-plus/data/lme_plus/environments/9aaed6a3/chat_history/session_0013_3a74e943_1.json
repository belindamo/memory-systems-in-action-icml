    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "While olive oil is a popular choice for cooking, there are indeed healthier options you can use for stir-frying, depending on the flavor profile and nutritional benefits you're looking for. Here are some alternatives to consider:\n\n**Healthier Cooking Oil Options:**\n\n1. **Avocado Oil**: With a high smoke point (520\u00b0F/271\u00b0C), avocado oil is ideal for high-heat cooking like stir-frying. It's rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and has a mild, buttery flavor.\n2. **Ghee (Clarified Butter)**: Ghee is a type of clarified butter that's lactose-free and has a high smoke point (485\u00b0F/252\u00b0C). It adds a nutty flavor and is rich in fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n3. **Coconut Oil**: Coconut oil has a high smoke point (350\u00b0F/177\u00b0C) and is rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are easily absorbed for energy. It adds a distinct flavor, so use it sparingly.\n4. **Rice Bran Oil**: With a light, nutty flavor, rice bran oil is a good choice for stir-frying. It's rich in heart-healthy unsaturated fats, vitamin E, and antioxidants.\n5. **Sesame Oil**: While not suitable for high-heat cooking, sesame oil is great for finishing dishes, adding a distinct nutty flavor and a boost of antioxidants.\n\n**When to Use Olive Oil:**\n\nWhile olive oil is not the best choice for high-heat cooking, it's still a great option for low-heat cooking or as a finishing oil. Use it for:\n\n1. **Low-heat cooking**: Olive oil is perfect for saut\u00e9ing or cooking at low temperatures (below 320\u00b0F/160\u00b0C).\n2. **Finishing dishes**: Add a drizzle of olive oil to your stir-fry just before serving to add flavor and antioxidants.\n\n**Tips for Choosing a Cooking Oil:**\n\n1. **Smoke Point**: Choose an oil with a high smoke point for high-heat cooking to prevent the oil from breaking down and becoming unhealthy.\n2. **Flavor Profile**: Select an oil that complements the flavors in your stir-fry recipe.\n3. **Nutritional Benefits**: Consider the oil's fatty acid profile and nutritional benefits, such as omega-3s, antioxidants, or vitamins.\n\nIn summary, while olive oil is a great choice for certain cooking methods, there are other healthier options available for stir-frying. Experiment with different oils to find the one that suits your taste preferences and cooking needs."
