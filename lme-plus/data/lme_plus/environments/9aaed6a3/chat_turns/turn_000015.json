  "content": "Here are the Anki flashcards:\n\nQ: What is chest auscultation?\nA: Listening to sounds within the chest to diagnose lung disease.\nExtra: Chest auscultation is a part of the physical examination that has a long history, dating back to the time of Hippocrates. It became a widespread practice with the invention of the stethoscope in 1816, which made the practice convenient and hygienic.\n\nQ: Who invented the stethoscope?\nA: Ren\u00e9 La\u00ebnnec\nExtra: The stethoscope was invented by Ren\u00e9 La\u00ebnnec in 1816. This invention made the practice of chest auscultation convenient and hygienic, leading to its widespread use.\n\nQ: What was the impact of technological advances in the 20th century on chest auscultation?\nA: Shifted interest to imaging studies.\nExtra: During the second half of the 20th century, technological advances in ultrasonography, radiographic computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging shifted interest from lung auscultation to imaging studies, which can detect lung disease with an accuracy never previously imagined.\n\nQ: What have modern computer-assisted techniques done for lung auscultation?\nA: Improved recording and analysis of lung sounds.\nExtra: Modern computer-assisted techniques have allowed for precise recording and analysis of lung sounds, prompting the correlation of acoustic indexes with measures of lung mechanics. This innovative approach has improved our knowledge of acoustic mechanisms and increased the clinical usefulness of auscultation.\n\nQ: What is the goal of this review?\nA: To present an overview of lung auscultation in the light of modern concepts of lung acoustics.\nExtra: This review aims to provide an overview of lung auscultation in the light of modern concepts of lung acoustics, highlighting the advances that have been made in the field and the current state of knowledge.",
