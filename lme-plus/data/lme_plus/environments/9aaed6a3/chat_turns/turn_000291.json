  "content": "The 2% cashback on online grocery purchases with Walmart+ is a great benefit, and I'd be happy to clarify how it works.\n\n**How the 2% cashback works:**\n\n* The 2% cashback is applied to your online grocery purchases, excluding taxes and fees.\n* The cashback is earned on the subtotal of your online grocery order, before any digital coupons or promo codes are applied.\n* The cashback is credited to your Walmart account and can be redeemed on future online orders.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate how it works:\n\n* You place an online grocery order with a subtotal of $100.\n* You apply a 10% off digital coupon, bringing the subtotal down to $90.\n* You earn 2% cashback on the original subtotal of $100, which is $2.\n* The cashback is credited to your Walmart account, and you can redeem it on your next online order.\n\n**Stacking with digital coupons and promo codes:**\n\n* Yes, you can stack the 2% cashback with digital coupons and promo codes.\n* The digital coupons and promo codes will be applied to your order first, reducing the subtotal.\n* The 2% cashback will then be calculated on the original subtotal, before the discounts were applied.\n\nIn the example above, you earned $2 cashback on the original subtotal of $100, even though you only paid $90 after the digital coupon was applied.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n* The 2% cashback is only applicable to online grocery purchases, not to other online purchases on Walmart.com.\n* The cashback is credited to your Walmart account and can only be redeemed on future online orders.\n* The 2% cashback benefit is exclusive to Walmart+ members and is not available to non-members.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how the 2% cashback works with Walmart+! Let me know if you have any more questions.",
