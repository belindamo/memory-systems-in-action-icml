Since we were talking about \"Spring Awakening\", I wanted to mention that I recently watched \"Hamilton\" on Disney+ last weekend, which is not last month, and I'm still on a musical high. I loved the blend of hip-hop and history. Have you seen \"Hamilton\" or any other musicals that blend different styles and genres?",
