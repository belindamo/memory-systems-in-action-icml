  "content": "While it's true that some email campaigns end up in spam folders, the majority of campaigns are delivered to inboxes and seen by subscribers. In fact, according to an email statistics report by OptinMonster, the average email open rate across industries is 22.86%. This is a reasonable percentage, especially compared to social media platforms' organic reach.\n\nAdditionally, email campaigns are a more direct way to reach out to subscribers compared to social media. With email, your message is delivered to your subscriber's inbox and is usually the first message they see when they open their email app. You also have more control over your content and your message is not lost in a crowded social media feed.\n\nFinally, when it comes to time management, many people prefer receiving timely and targeted information in their inboxes rather than sifting through social media streams, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming.\n\nWhile social media marketing can be an effective tool, email marketing has its advantages that should not be overlooked. The key to success is understanding your audience, delivering valuable and high-quality content, and building a loyal relationship with your subscribers over time.",
