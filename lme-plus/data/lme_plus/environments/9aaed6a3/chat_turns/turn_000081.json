  "content": "The popularity and level of crowds can vary depending on the season and time of day. However, some of the lesser-known hot springs might generally have fewer crowds compared to popular ones. For example, Yunomine Onsen and Ginzan Onsen are known for their relatively small size, and Kusatsu Onsen is popular but has numerous hot spring baths that can distribute crowds throughout the area. Also, some hot springs may be less busy during weekdays and off-season months.  However, it's always a good idea to check the hot spring's website or tourist information center for updates on crowd levels and peak times.",
