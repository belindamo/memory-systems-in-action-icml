  "content": "Walmart+ does have some restrictions on earning cashback, although they're relatively limited. Here are some exclusions to keep in mind:\n\n**Excluded items:**\n\n* Gift cards\n* Walmart Grocery Pickup and Delivery fees\n* Taxes and sales tax\n* Shipping costs\n* Any items purchased through third-party marketplaces on Walmart.com (e.g., Marketplace sellers)\n\n**Excluded brands:**\n\n* None, as far as I know! Walmart+ cashback is applicable to all brands sold on Walmart.com, including store brands like Great Value.\n\n**Other restrictions:**\n\n* Cashback is only earned on the subtotal of your online grocery order, before any digital coupons, promo codes, or other discounts are applied.\n* Cashback is not earned on purchases made in-store, even if you order online and pick up in-store.\n* Cashback is not earned on online purchases from other Walmart websites, such as Walmart Photo or Walmart eBooks.\n\n**Important note:**\n\n* Walmart+ cashback is subject to change, and Walmart reserves the right to modify or terminate the program at any time.\n\nIt's always a good idea to review the terms and conditions of any cashback program to ensure you understand the rules and exclusions.\n\nNow, go ahead and crunch those numbers to see if Walmart+ is a good fit for you!",
