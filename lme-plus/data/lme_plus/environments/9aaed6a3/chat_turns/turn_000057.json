Spotify playlists are an amazing way to discover new music, and it's great that you stumbled upon Pale Waves through one.\n\n**\"There's a Honey\" by Pale Waves:**\n\n Ah, \"There's a Honey\" is an excellent choice! The guitar riffs and Heather's vocals are indeed incredible. The song has a certain nostalgic quality to it, and the lyrics are so relatable. It's no wonder it's one of their most popular tracks.\n\n**The Japanese House and MUNA:**\n\nYes, I'm familiar with both The Japanese House and MUNA! The Japanese House is a solo project by Amber Bain, known for her dreamy, atmospheric soundscapes and introspective lyrics. Her music often explores themes of love, relationships, and mental health, and her vocal delivery is so emotive and expressive.\n\nMUNA, on the other hand, is an American indie-pop trio known for their dark, moody sound and introspective lyrics. They often explore themes of love, identity, and empowerment, and their music has a certain edgy, anthemic quality to it.\n\n**Indie-pop recommendations:**\n\nIf you like Pale Waves, The Japanese House, and MUNA, you might also enjoy other artists like:\n\n* Billie Marten: A British singer-songwriter known for her introspective lyrics and soothing indie-folk sound.\n* Lucy Dacus: An American indie-rock singer-songwriter who explores themes of love, relationships, and social commentary.\n* Hatchie: An Australian indie-pop artist known for her dreamy, nostalgia-tinged sound and introspective lyrics.\n\n**Music discovery:**\n\nI'm always excited to hear about new music discoveries!
