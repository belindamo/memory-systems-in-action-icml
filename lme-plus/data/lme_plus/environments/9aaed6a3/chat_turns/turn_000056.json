  "content": "I'm loving the indie-pop vibe! I actually discovered Pale Waves through a Spotify playlist, and I've been listening to their album \"My Mind Makes Noises\" non-stop. I'm obsessed with their song \"There's a Honey\" - the guitar riffs and Heather's vocals are just amazing. I've also been listening to some other new artists, like The Japanese House and MUNA. Have you heard of them?",
