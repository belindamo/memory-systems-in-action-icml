  "content": "The million-dollar question!\n\nWhether or not it's worth paying the monthly fee for Walmart+ solely for the 2% cashback on online grocery purchases depends on your individual shopping habits and cashback earnings. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n**Your online grocery shopping frequency and amount:**\n\n* If you frequently shop online for groceries on Walmart.com and your average order value is high, the 2% cashback could add up quickly, making the Walmart+ membership more worthwhile.\n* However, if you only shop online occasionally or your orders are relatively small, the cashback earnings might not justify the monthly fee.\n\n**Your current cashback earnings from Ibotta and Fetch Rewards:**\n\n* If you're already earning significant cashback from Ibotta and Fetch Rewards on your Walmart online grocery purchases, the additional 2% cashback from Walmart+ might not be as crucial.\n* But if you're not earning much cashback from these apps or you're looking to diversify your cashback sources, the Walmart+ benefit could be more appealing.\n\n**Other benefits of Walmart+:**\n\n* Don't forget that Walmart+ offers additional benefits, such as unlimited free delivery on online grocery orders, fuel discounts, and mobile checkout. If you value these perks, they might tip the scales in favor of paying the monthly fee.\n\n**The math:**\n\n* Calculate your average monthly online grocery spend on Walmart.com and estimate the cashback you'd earn from Walmart+ (2% of your average spend).\n* Compare this to the monthly fee of Walmart+ ($12.95) and determine if the cashback earnings outweigh the cost.\n* Consider your overall cashback earnings from all sources, including Ibotta, Fetch Rewards, and Walmart+, to ensure you're maximizing your rewards.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to weigh the benefits against the cost and decide what's best for your individual situation. If you're unsure, you could consider trying Walmart+ for a month to see how much cashback you earn and whether the other benefits are valuable to you.",
