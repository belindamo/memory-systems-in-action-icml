This means you can add products from other online retailers, specialty stores, or even small boutiques, and manage them all in one place.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nTo add an item from another website to your Amazon registry:\n\n1. Install the **Amazon Assistant** browser extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) or use the **Amazon mobile app**.\n2. When you find an item on another website, click the Amazon Assistant button or use the mobile app to scan the item's barcode or search for it.\n3. Select \"Add to Registry\" to add the item to your Amazon registry.\n4. Amazon will create a virtual \"placeholder\" for the item, which will appear on your registry alongside Amazon products.\n\n**Benefits of using the Universal Registry:**\n\n1. **One-stop shopping**: Guests can purchase items from multiple websites through your Amazon registry, making it convenient for them and you.\n2. **More product options**: You're not limited to Amazon's selection; you can add items from anywhere online.\n3. **Easy tracking**: All gifts, regardless of the original website, are tracked and updated in your Amazon registry.\n4. **Centralized thank-you notes**: You can send thank-you notes and track gifts from a single location.\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n1. **Shipping and handling**: Since items are shipped directly from the original website, you'll need to check the shipping and handling policies for each item.\n2. **Return policy**: Returns and exchanges might need to be handled directly with the original website, not Amazon.\n3. **Pricing and availability**: Prices and availability may vary between websites, so make sure to check the item's details before adding it to your registry.\n\n**Is it worth using?**\n\nIf you want to give your guests flexibility and access to a broader range of products, the Universal Registry is an excellent feature. It's particularly useful if you have specific items in mind from specialty stores or smaller online retailers.\n\nHowever, if you're short on time or prefer a more streamlined experience, you can stick to adding Amazon products directly to your registry. Amazon's selection is vast, and you'll still have access to features like free shipping, competitive pricing, and easy returns.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether the Universal Registry feature is right for your needs. If you do choose to use it, make sure to communicate with your guests about the process and any potential differences in shipping and returns.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision!",
