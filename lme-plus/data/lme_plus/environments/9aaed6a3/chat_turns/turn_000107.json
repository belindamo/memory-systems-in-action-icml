  "content": "Buying in bulk can often lead to significant savings.\n\nLet's assume the 3-pound pack of ground beef is priced at $9.99. This works out to:\n\n$9.99 \u00f7 3 pounds = $3.33 per pound\n\nCompared to the original 1-pound price of $3.99, you'd save:\n\n$3.99 - $3.33 = $0.66 per pound\n\nSince you'd be buying 3 pounds, your total savings would be:\n\n$0.66 per pound \u00d7 3 pounds = $1.98\n\nBy buying the 3-pound pack, you'd save $1.98 compared to buying three individual 1-pound packs.\n\nYour new total estimated cost would be:\n\n$50.40 + $9.99 = $60.39\n\nWith the updated total, your cashback earnings would be:\n\n$60.39 x 0.01 = $0.60 in cashback\n\nKeep in mind that you'd need to consider your storage space and whether you can use the bulk pack before the expiration date. If you can make use of the extra meat, buying in bulk can be a great way to save money!",
