We've been working hard on our recent product launches, and a break in the afternoon to do something fun and interactive would be a great way to recharge and bond as a team. Plus, it's a nice way to celebrate our success and my three months as Senior Marketing Manager at XYZ Inc. Since February 15th, we've accomplished a lot, and this event would be a great way to acknowledge that.",
