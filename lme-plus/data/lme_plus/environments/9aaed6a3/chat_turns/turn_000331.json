Winter in the Northern Hemisphere typically runs from December to February, but you mentioned earlier that you're planning a summer vacation in July. If that's the case, it wouldn't be possible for you to have experienced a harsh winter from December to February if you're already looking forward to a summer vacation in July.\n\nBut I'm glad you're excited to get back into tennis and outdoor activities! June is a great time to start preparing for the tennis league, and with consistent practice, you'll be ready to hit the courts in no time.\n\nRemember to stay focused on your goals, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more tips or advice on preparing for the league. And most importantly, have fun and enjoy the experience!",
