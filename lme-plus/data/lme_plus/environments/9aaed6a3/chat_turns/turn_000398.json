  "content": "The passage you are referring to is from Plato's \"Phaedrus\". In the dialogue, Socrates is having a conversation with Phaedrus and critiques the invention of writing. He argues that writing is an inferior form of knowledge because it relies on external symbols, and that it will lead to forgetfulness among those who rely on it, since they will no longer need to commit things to memory. Here is the passage:\n\n\"This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them.\" - Plato, Phaedrus.",
