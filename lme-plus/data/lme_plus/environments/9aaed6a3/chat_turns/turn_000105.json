  "content": "Ground beef would be a great addition to your pasta dish.\n\nThe cost of ground beef can vary depending on the quality and lean-to-fat ratio. Let's assume you're looking for a moderately priced option. Here's an estimate:\n\n1. Ground beef (1 pound) - $3.99\n\nAdding this to your updated list, your new total estimated cost would be:\n\n$50.40 + $3.99 = $54.39\n\nYou'd be a bit further over your budget of $50, but ground beef is a great addition to your pasta meal. If you're okay with going a bit over budget, you could consider keeping the entire list. If not, you could remove one or two snack items to make room for the ground beef.\n\nWith the updated total, your cashback earnings would be:\n\n$54.39 x 0.01 = $0.54 in cashback\n\nKeep in mind that you could also consider buying a smaller quantity of ground beef, like 0.75 pounds or 0.5 pounds, to reduce the cost and stay within your budget.",
