As a conversational AI, I don't have personal experiences or watch musicals, but I'm always excited to discuss them with you!\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that you're still on a musical high after watching \"Hamilton\" on Disney+! The blend of hip-hop and history is indeed a game-changer, and Lin-Manuel Miranda's genius is undeniable.\n\nWe've already discussed some musicals that blend different styles and genres, but I'd be happy to explore more with you!
