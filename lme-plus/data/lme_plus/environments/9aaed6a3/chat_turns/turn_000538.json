  "content": "James Hook & Co. is a takeout spot, and they don't provide any indoor or outdoor seating areas for their customers. So, if you want to enjoy your lobster roll at James Hook & Co., you will have to eat it on their nearby benches or find a spot in the surrounding park or waterfront area. However, if you're worried about crowds or prefer a more comfortable seating area, you can take your lobster roll to go and eat it somewhere else. Boston has several parks and picnic areas, such as Boston Common or the Esplanade, where you could enjoy your lobster roll.",
