Their songs often have a moody, atmospheric quality to them, but with a sense of optimism and hope. Have you listened to their album \"My Mind Makes Noises\" or their more recent EP \"Unwanted\"?\n\n**Indie-pop scene:**\n\nPale Waves is part of a thriving indie-pop scene that's producing some amazing music. If you like them, you might also enjoy other bands like The 1975, Arlo Parks, or Glass Animals. The indie-pop genre is all about blending catchy hooks with introspective lyrics and atmospheric soundscapes, and there are so many great bands pushing the boundaries of the genre.\n\n**New music discoveries:**\n\nI'm always excited to hear about new music discoveries!
