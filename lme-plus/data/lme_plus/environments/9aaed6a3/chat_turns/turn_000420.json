  "content": "I think there's been a misunderstanding! As a digital AI assistant, I don't have the ability to attend conferences or meet people in person. I exist solely as a text-based conversational interface, and our conversation is the only interaction we've had.\n\nI'm here to provide information, answer questions, and offer guidance to the best of my abilities. I don't have personal experiences or connections with individuals or events.\n\nHowever, I'm happy to continue providing advice and support on how to follow up with potential investors, craft a strong pitch deck, and prepare materials to showcase your startup's value proposition. Feel free to ask me any questions or seek guidance on these topics!",
