In her book \"The Telephone Book: Technology, Schizophrenia, Electric Speech\", Ronell discusses Plato's critique of writing and argues that new technologies, such as the telephone and other forms of electronic communication, have challenged traditional notions of communication and knowledge.\n\nRonell's work offers a contemporary perspective on Plato's critique of writing and argues that new technologies have created new forms of memory and knowledge that are distinct from those of the past. She explores the ways in which new technologies have transformed the way people communicate and understand the world, and argues that these changes have had a profound impact on human culture and thought.",
