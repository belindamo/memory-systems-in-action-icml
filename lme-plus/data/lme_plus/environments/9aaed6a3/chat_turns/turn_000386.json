  "content": "That's a great idea! A group text is a quick and easy way to invite your friends and get a sense of who's available. Your suggested message is perfect - it's casual, concise, and gets the point across. You're not overwhelming them with too many details, and you're giving them the freedom to RSVP or ask questions if they need to.\n\nBy keeping it simple, you're also making it easy for your friends to respond with a quick \"yes\" or \"no\", which makes it easy for you to get a headcount and make a reservation.\n\nI think you've got a great plan in place! Just send out that text and see who's in. Fingers crossed that everyone can make it and you have a fantastic time catching up over brunch!\n\nIs there anything else you're looking forward to doing or talking about with your friends during brunch?",
