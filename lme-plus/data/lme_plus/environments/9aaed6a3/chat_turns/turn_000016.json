  "content": "OK. for now, repeat these two steps when i give you more inputs.\nNomenclature\nTable 1.\n\nClinical Characteristics and Correlations of Respiratory Sounds.\nThe traditional nomenclature for lung sounds suffers from imprecision. Therefore, in this article, we have adopted the terminology proposed by the ad hoc committee of the International Lung Sounds Association.2 In this classification of lung sounds, the term \u201crale\u201d is replaced by \u201ccrackle,\u201d since the adjectives often used to qualify rales (e.g., \u201cmoist\u201d or \u201cdry\u201d) can be misleading with regard to the means by which rales (or crackles) are produced. \u201cCrackle\u201d can be defined acoustically and does not suggest any means or site of generation. The clinical characteristics of normal and adventitious sounds are summarized in Table 1, and the lung sounds can be heard in an interactive graphic, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.",
