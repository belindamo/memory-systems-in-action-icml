  "content": "Sure, here are three authors who discuss Plato's critique of writing in \"Phaedrus\":\n\n1. 18th century: Jean-Jacques Rousseau - In his \"Confessions\", Rousseau refers to Plato's critique of writing and argues that writing has caused people to forget the art of oral storytelling.\n2. 19th century: Friedrich Nietzsche - In his \"Twilight of the Idols\", Nietzsche discusses Plato's idea that writing would lead to forgetfulness and argues that it has instead created a culture of memory that is stronger than ever before.\n3. 20th century: Walter J. Ong - In his book \"Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word\", Ong provides an in-depth analysis of Plato's critique of writing and argues that the shift from orality to literacy had a profound impact on human culture and thought.",
