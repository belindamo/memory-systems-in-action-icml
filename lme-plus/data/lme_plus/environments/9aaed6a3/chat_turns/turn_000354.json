The total driving distance from California to Yellowstone is approximately:\n\n* From San Francisco, CA: 1,440 miles (2,317 km)\n* From Los Angeles, CA: 1,540 miles (2,478 km)\n* From Sacramento, CA: 1,520 miles (2,446 km)\n\nLet's assume you're starting from the middle of California, so we'll use an average distance of 1,480 miles (2,382 km) to Yellowstone.\n\n**Fuel Consumption:**\nWith a fuel economy of 26 mpg, you can estimate your fuel consumption as follows:\n\nFuel consumption = Total distance \u00f7 Fuel economy\nFuel consumption \u2248 1,480 miles \u00f7 26 mpg \u2248 56.92 gallons\n\n**Fuel Costs:**\nAssuming an average gas price of $3.00 per gallon (which is a reasonable estimate for the Western US), your total fuel cost would be:\n\nFuel cost = Fuel consumption \u00d7 Gas price\nFuel cost \u2248 56.92 gallons \u00d7 $3.00 per gallon \u2248 $170.76\n\n**Additional Factors:**\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate, and your actual fuel costs may vary depending on several factors, such as:\n\n* Your driving style and habits\n* Road conditions and terrain\n* Weather conditions (e.g., wind, temperature)\n* Any detours or side trips you take along the way\n* Any potential traffic or road closures\n\nTo be on the safe side, you may want to add 10-20% to your estimated fuel cost to account for these variables.\n\n**Round-Trip Estimate:**\nIf you're planning to return to California after visiting Yellowstone, you'll need to double your fuel costs to account for the return trip. In this case, your total fuel cost for the round trip would be:\n\nTotal fuel cost \u2248 $170.76 \u00d7 2 \u2248 $341.52\n\nThere you have it! Based on these estimates, you can expect to pay around $341.52 in fuel costs for your round trip from California to Yellowstone National Park and back.\n\nRemember to check gas prices along your route and adjust your budget accordingly. You may also want to consider downloading a fuel cost estimator app or website to get more accurate estimates based on your specific route and driving habits.\n\nSafe travels, and enjoy your adventure to Yellowstone!",
