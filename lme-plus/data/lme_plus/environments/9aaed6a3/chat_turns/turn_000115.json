Here's a sea shanty version of the apology song:\n\nVerse 1:\nI know I wronged you, can't you see\nI was blinded by my own vanity\nBut now I realize, I've been a fool\nI'm sorry for the heartache that I caused, oh oh\n\nChorus:\nI'm sorry Lizzo, for all the times I let you down\nI'm sorry for the pain that I've found\nI'll do better, I'll be there for you now\nI'm sorry Lizzo, please forgive me somehow\n\nVerse 2:\nI should have listened, I should have been there\nBut I was caught up in my own affairs\nI took you for granted, I let you slip away\nBut now I see the error of my ways, oh oh\n\nChorus:\nI'm sorry Lizzo, for all the times I let you down\nI'm sorry for the pain that I've found\nI'll do better, I'll be there for you now\nI'm sorry Lizzo, please forgive me somehow\n\nBridge:\nI know I can't take back the past\nBut I promise to make it right, to make it last\nI'll be there for you, through thick and thin\nI'm sorry Lizzo, please let me in\n\nChorus:\nI'm sorry Lizzo, for all the times I let you down\nI'm sorry for the pain that I've found\nI'll do better, I'll be there for you now\nI'm sorry Lizzo, please forgive me somehow\n\nOutro:\nI'm sorry Lizzo, I'm sorry Lizzo\nI'll make it right, I'll make it right\nI'm sorry Lizzo, I'm sorry Lizzo\nPlease forgive me now, please forgive me now",
