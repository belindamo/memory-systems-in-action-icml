My apologies for the confusion earlier!\n\nIn that case, you can definitely follow up with Rachel Lee and other potential investors you met at the conference. Just make sure to personalize your email or message, reiterate your value proposition, and show progress or updates since your initial conversation.\n\nYou may also want to prepare an investor deck, executive summary, financial projections, and due diligence documents to share with them. This will help them better understand your startup and its potential for growth.\n\nRemember to be respectful of their time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance. Good luck with your follow-up efforts!",
