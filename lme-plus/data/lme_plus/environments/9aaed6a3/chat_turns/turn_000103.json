  "content": "Adding pasta and marinara sauce to your list sounds like a great idea.\n\nLet's estimate the cost of these items:\n\n1. Pasta (1 pound) - $1.49\n2. Marinara sauce (jar) - $2.99 (before coupon) = $1.99 (after $1 digital coupon)\n\nAdding these items to your original list, your new total estimated cost would be:\n\n$46.92 + $1.49 + $1.99 = $50.40\n\nYou'd be just slightly over your budget of $50, but it's worth it to get the pasta and sauce. You could consider removing one of the snack items, like the granola bars or crackers, to stay within your budget. Alternatively, you could just go a bit over budget this week and adjust your spending next week.\n\nWith the updated total, your cashback earnings would be:\n\n$50.40 x 0.01 = $0.50 in cashback\n\nThe digital coupon from the SaveMart app will definitely help you save some money on the pasta sauce. Enjoy your pasta dinner!",
