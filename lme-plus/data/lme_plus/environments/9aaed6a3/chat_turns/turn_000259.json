It's great that you are open to exploring new artists and genres, though. If you're still interested in Irish music, there are many sub-genres within the overall category, such as Irish rock or Irish punk. If you're interested in exploring more contemporary Irish music, you might want to check out bands like U2, The Cranberries, or The Script, which have all had success on the international stage while incorporating Irish elements into their music. Alternatively, there are many other great musical traditions and genres from around the world that you might enjoy. The important thing is to keep an open mind and keep listening to new music!",
