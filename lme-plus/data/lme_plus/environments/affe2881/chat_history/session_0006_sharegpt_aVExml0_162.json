      "content": "Take this and extract the key points for me in bullet form. The point of this is to create a list of trends in Kadence's identity that I can build on to deepen the character:\n\n# The Ordinary World: Who is Kadence?\n\nI am Kadence, a 25-year-old musician from the bustling streets of New York City, but my roots are firmly planted in the lush tropical landscapes of Jamaica. Music has been my constant companion, a source of comfort and inspiration that has carried me through life's ups and downs. From a young age, I was captivated by the vibrant rhythms of the Caribbean and the art of music-making, and it was in Jamaica where I first discovered my love for rap and hip-hop.\n\n## Origins\n\nI was just a young dreamer when I embarked on my journey as a rap artist under the name 'Kadence' in 2012. But with my talent as a producer, vocalist, and songwriter, it wasn't long before I became well-known in my hometown of Mandeville for my musical abilities. I spent countless hours honing my craft, pouring my heart and soul into each beat, each verse, each chorus. I knew without a doubt that music was my calling, and I was determined to make it my life's work.\n\nIn 2015, I faced a crossroads in my journey. I had to make a bold decision to leave behind the familiar comfort of home, my family and friends, and move to Toronto, Canada to pursue my dream of becoming a successful musician. It was a difficult choice, but my passion for music and my fierce determination to succeed fuelled me. And today, I am proud to say that I produce and record my own music, blending elements of rap and hip-hop, R&B, dancehall, and pop into a sound that is uniquely my own.\n\nMy music is an extension of my own journey, a reflection of my experiences, my emotions, and my resilience. It is more than just entertainment, it is a source of comfort and inspiration for those who need it most. Through my music, I strive to help others through difficult times, bring light into the darkness, and bring people together. I am driven by a rare empathy, a genuine desire to make a positive impact on those around me. I want my music to make a difference, to touch people's hearts, and to help heal the world.\n\nMy brand is defined by my authenticity, my empathy, my passion, my creativity, my resilience, and my humility. I am not just an artist, but a source of inspiration, a voice for the voiceless, and a shining light in a dark world. My ultimate goal is to be recognized worldwide as an independent and profitable musician, and to eventually become close friends with my idols. But most of all, I want to be known for always releasing high-quality music that speaks to the hearts of my listeners.\n\nI believe that music has the power to change lives, to bring people together, and to make the world a better place. I am honoured to be a part of that legacy and to carry on the tradition of using music to make a difference. I will continue to pour my heart and soul into each song I write, each beat I produce, because music is not just entertainment, it is a way of life. And I am honoured to share my life's work with you.\n\n## Discovering my Love for Music\n\nIt all started with a soft melody, echoing from the keys of a grand piano. I was just a young boy, accompanying my grandmother to a friend's home in the countryside outside of Mandeville. I remember feeling restless, eager to explore and make some noise, but it was the gleaming ivory and ebony of that grand piano that caught my eye. I approached it tentatively, running my fingers along the keys, testing them out with a few random notes. At first, the adults in the room scolded me, but as I continued to play, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me. I was no longer just a restless child, but a budding musician, discovering the beauty of music for the first time.\n\nFrom that moment on, music became a constant in my life. I would spend hours listening to all different genres, from the Caribbean rhythms of my childhood to the beats of rap and hip-hop. I was drawn to the art of music-making, and as I got older, I began to hone my skills, experimenting with different sounds and styles.\n\nIn high school, I discovered my love for rapping and began to perform in front of audiences for the first time. My friends and even strangers would tell me that I was destined for greatness, and I believed them. I started to take my music seriously, booking recording sessions and releasing my first EP, 'Untitled', under the name 'Kadence'.\n\nIt was during my high school years that I discovered my passion for music production as well. I became close friends with a prominent Jamaican music producer, who showed me the ins and outs of making beats. I was fascinated by the process, and soon I was producing my own music, blending elements of rap, hip-hop, R&B, dancehall, and pop into a sound that was uniquely my own.\n\nI have faced many challenges on my journey, from the difficulties of leaving my family and friends behind to pursue my dream, to the temptations of drugs, women, and money. But through it all, I have never lost my passion for music. It has been my source of comfort, my inspiration, and my way of making a difference in the world.\n\n## The Ups & Downs\n\nAs I journeyed down the path to success, I encountered many obstacles and challenges. Despite the difficulties, my passion for music never faded and I refused to let anything stand in the way of my dreams.\n\nOne of the toughest moments for me was when I made the bold decision to leave my home in Jamaica and move to Toronto, Canada. I left behind my family and friends, and the familiar surroundings that I had always known. But my love for music was too strong to ignore, and I knew that I had to take this chance if I wanted to make a name for myself in the music industry.\n\nAs I settled into my new home, I faced numerous hurdles. I struggled to find my place in a new city, and the loneliness and homesickness was almost too much to bear at times. But through it all, I remained focused on my goal and continued to work tirelessly on my music.\n\nI also faced challenges in my personal life. I allowed myself to become too comfortable in a relationship, and it took away from the time and energy I needed to dedicate to my music. It took me losing myself in the relationship to realize that my true calling was to make music, and I made the difficult decision to end things so I could refocus on my passion.\n\nNow, with newfound freedom and clarity, I am able to pour my heart and soul into my music like never before. I have a renewed sense of purpose, and I am more determined than ever to make a name for myself in the industry. I know that success is within reach, and I am ready to face whatever challenges come my way.\n\n## Breaking Free\n\nAs I continued on my journey towards success, I found myself facing more and more obstacles that threatened to hold me back. Despite my passion for music, I struggled to find the motivation to create and perform. My family did not support my dreams and my romantic relationship left me feeling empty and uninspired. I felt like I was losing sight of who I was and what I truly wanted in life.\n\nBut then something shifted within me. I realized that I had been holding myself back, letting my fears and doubts control me. I knew that if I was ever going to achieve my goals, I needed to break free from these self-imposed limitations. So I took a step back, took a deep breath, and focused on rediscovering my love for music.\n\nI started by getting back to my roots, immersing myself in the sounds and rhythms that first inspired me as a child. I reconnected with my friends and family, and let go of the toxic relationship that had been weighing me down. And most importantly, I found the courage to start making music again, to create the music that I truly loved and that spoke to my heart.\n\nWith each new song, I felt a sense of liberation, like I was breaking free from the chains that had been holding me back. And as I continued to write and produce music, I found myself becoming more confident, more creative, and more determined to achieve my goals.\n\nAnd that brings us to today. I am proud of the progress I've made and the person I've become. I am no longer held back by my fears and doubts, and I am free to create the music that I love. I am ready to take the next step on my journey to success, and I am confident that with hard work and determination, I will get there."
