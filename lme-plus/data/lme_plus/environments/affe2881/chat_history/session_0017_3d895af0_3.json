Speaking of flavor, I've been experimenting with different types of rice lately, and I recently discovered a brand that sells authentic Japanese short-grain rice. It's so fluffy and sticky, and it pairs perfectly with my homemade teriyaki chicken. Do you have any suggestions on how to incorporate this rice into the dinner party menu?"
