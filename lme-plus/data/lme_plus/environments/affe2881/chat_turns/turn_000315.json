I just cleaned it out and got rid of some old stuff, but I want to make sure everything is stored properly to prevent tangling and damage. By the way, I had a bit of a mishap recently - I lost my favorite silver necklace with a small pendant at the beach last weekend. I think it was on my towel when I went swimming and I forgot to pick it up.",
