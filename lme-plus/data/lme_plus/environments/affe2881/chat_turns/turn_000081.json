Keep the story the same but give describe the surroundings, feelings, and thoughts more meaningfully to paint a picture in a person's mind with your words.\n\nThe origin story of the Duulo-Vraktor bloodline has been passed down for generations. It all started with Mitne, a dragon deity with glossy rainbow scales. He was the guardian of the forest and kept the natural balance. Mitne had long transcended past pride many years before time or history was a concept. For this reason, he regarded everything in the forest as his equal and took his time building meaningful friendships with all life. \n\nElves, often being a very traditional race, lived in harmony with the forest and their friend. Many generations of elves learned much from Mitne and he cherished the elves' sincerity and mistakes in their short lives of around 750 years which to him was like the blink of an eye. All they had ever known was peace as far as they could remember. \n\nThose who stumbled onto the forest would be in natural awe of Mitne and those who came with bad intentions had their hearts purified at the sight of him and their souls soothed when he spoke to them. For the first time, those people felt the shadows in their heart lifted, seeing the world with fresh eyes. Finally they could hear nature's timeless song: the gentle wind that makes the grass whistle, a drop of dew falling from the leaf of a tree onto a rock and dirt, the dancing leaves and petals as they fell and were swept up again. One sobbing person worked up all his strength to ask Mitne, \"I have done much evil for the sake of my own greed and lust. I came to plunder your forest yet your presence lifted all the clouds in me, like I am a newborn again. How have you done this?\"\n\nMitne never looked away from the man. He always listened mindfully. The great dragon closed his eyes not to ponder the question for he knew the answer. He just listened to nature's timeless song for a moment longer with the man. \"Thank you.\", said the man.\n\nMitne replied, \"I gave you a taste of the essence of true divinity. If there is still some good in one's heart then it cleanses all impurities. True evil is very rare. If no goodness is left in a creature, then darkness will attempt to consume the divinity and fail. Darkness promises power and when it's overwhelmed by the light, which is the very thing it abandoned for power it will cause the mind to go mad from fear and die. In these cases I cleanse the souls and they enter the cycle of rebirth.\"\n\nThe man had just been given insight into the great order and broke down crying.\n\n\"You have grasped the true weight of your own guilt. Your tears are a testament to your sincerity as you mourn the futures of others that you took. Punishment is not the answer to atonement. Live by finding your own path to divinity.\"\n\n\"Where do I start?\"\n\n\"Anywhere. Fill the world with flowers so that others may hear nature's timeless song as you have today.\"\n\nHe had found his resolve and walked onward without looking back out of respect for Mitne. He knew Mitne regarded him as a friend, something he never imagined could happen before that day, so he went out to become someone worthy of the trust of a real friend.\n\nMany tribes had populated the forest over many centuries. One day Mitne went to each tribe to announce he was leaving. The news was really sudden. There was no great conflict or grand reason. He just said it was time to go. He told everyone, when he goes, the egg of his nextborn will be created. The day of departure came and everyone made a circle around his favorite resting spot and smiled so the last thing he would see before returning to the gods would be joy in the faces of all his friends. \n\nHe knew how their hearts truly wept. He was honored, his last words: \"I am always with you all, my dear friends.\" \n\nTime and space twisted and distorted and flashed and he was gone leaving a rainbow scaled egg behind.\n\nA young prodigious diviner forth saw the hatching of the next forest guardian was to be on the very next day.\n\nBy the egg's will, only the youth from all life of the forest had been summoned to come that night to witness the awakening. As the sun set and the moon reached its peak on the starry, black canvas, the young diviner strummed her harp, the youth played their forest flutes, and the forest creatures howled, and roared, and watched as the egg slowly cracked and a beautiful, colossal creature emerged. \n\nEveryone went silent. The new rainbow dragon looked around at every creature for a while and finally broke the silence with a greeting.\n\n\"I am Duulo.\" \n\nAs a diety, Duulo was born with great knowledge of himself, his name, and his purpose. Mitne's rainbow scales would sparkle poetically from each of the sun ray's kisses, while Duulo appeared to shine his own hue beside the moonlight.\n\n\"My father has kept this forest in a state of everlasting peace for as long as it has existed. The creatures of the forest are strong and many beyond this forest have been saved and feel indebted to my father. His gift to his friends was the strength to overcome your own battles. I will guide you to fully realizing that strength but your battles are your own to fight. So youth of this forest, you all will one day set out to see this world and grow in a new way, so hone your path until then. Carry on this message after you make your way back home.\"\n\nAs the sun rose Duulo curled up and went to sleep.\n\nHis message came as a surprise to many in the forest. The diviners confirmed that if the forest didn't prepare and heed Duulo's words that for the first time in their history they would not be ready for the battles to come.\n\nDuulo woke up every night and many came to him for advice. Trade opened up to the neighboring villages and kingdoms. The artisans, great sorcerers, bards, storytellers and many more built up great influence. \n\nThe young diviner prodigy watched the moon every night while strumming her harp and Duulo would join her. This continued for hundreds of years. The forest and it's folk had succeeded and grown. Finally it was time for all the youth to set out.\n\nDuulo told that it too was his time to go, that the forest was now in the hands of it's creatures.\n\nThe young prodigious diviner was named Ernaya. She was blind from birth but saw the world through various futures because of her gift. Duulo has been quietly in love with her for centuries. He would not be bound by divine duty. Although many dragons are splendid shapeshifters, Duulo did something even Ernaya nor even the heavens could foresee, he reincarnated as a mortal, freeing himself from his duty. He also healed Ernaya's eyes and changed her fate. They went on countless adventures together. Duulo never hid who he was. The forest people came to accept Duulo's choice and love for Ernaya. Their family name became known as the Duulo-Vraktor with a lineage that lives to this day. Elves of Duulo's blood continue the pilgrimage that their ancestors once took, seeking their own answers to freedom. The dragon blood manifests itself at it's prime in those who discover the price that freedom comes at and their children are also blessed with strong dragon blood as well.\n\nNot everyone returns, but in honoring this tradition none regret seeking the answer.",
