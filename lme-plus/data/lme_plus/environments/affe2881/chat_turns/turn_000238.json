Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to Denver International Airport (DEN), depending on the flight route and layovers.\n* Cost: I've searched for flights from JFK/LGA to DEN for your travel dates, and here are some estimates:\n\t+ One-way economy flights: $250-$400\n\t+ Round-trip economy flights: $400-$600\n\t+ You can try to book a flight that departs in the afternoon or early evening to avoid morning flights.\n* Convenience: As you're familiar with flying, you know it's generally faster and more convenient, with minimal travel time and no need to worry about driving fatigue or road conditions.\n\n**Driving:**\n\n* Travel time: The driving distance from New York to Denver is approximately 1,770 miles (2,850 km), and the journey would take around 24-30 hours with normal traffic conditions, assuming you drive for around 8-10 hours per day.\n* Cost:\n\t+ Fuel: Estimated fuel cost for the round trip would be around $400-$600, depending on your vehicle's fuel efficiency and the current fuel prices.\n\t+ Tolls: You'll encounter tolls along the way, which can add up to around $100-$200 for the round trip.\n\t+ Accommodation: You'll need to factor in the cost of accommodation for the night(s) you'll spend on the road. Budget around $100-$200 per night for a hotel or motel.\n\t+ Food and other expenses: Add another $200-$300 for food, snacks, and other expenses during the road trip.\n\tTotal estimated cost for driving: $900-$1,300\n* Convenience: While driving gives you more control over your schedule and route, it's a long and tiring journey. You'll need to consider the fatigue factor, especially if you're driving alone.\n\nConsidering your preferences, flying seems to be the more convenient and time-efficient option. However, if you enjoy road trips and have the time to spare, driving can be a great way to see the country and enjoy the scenic routes.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates are rough, and prices may vary depending on the time of booking, demand, and other factors. I recommend checking flight prices and accommodation options to get a better sense of the costs involved.\n\nWhich option are you leaning towards, or would you like me to explore other options or provide more information?",
