Your film log can be a valuable tool for gaining insights into your cinematic tastes and preferences. By examining your log, you can identify patterns, trends, and correlations that might not be immediately apparent. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Genre analysis**: Create a pivot table or chart to see which genres you've been watching the most. Are you drawn to dramas, thrillers, or documentaries? Do you tend to favor films from specific genres at festivals?\n2. **Director tracking**: Identify the directors whose films you've seen multiple times. Are there any common themes or styles that attract you to their work? Have you noticed any patterns in their filmography?\n3. **Rating distribution**: Analyze your ratings to see if there are any trends or correlations.

Are there any differences in the types of films you've seen, the ratings you've given, or the directors you've been drawn to? Have you noticed any trends or patterns that are unique to specific festivals?\n7. **Correlations and connections**: Look for correlations between different factors, such as director, genre, and rating. Are there any surprising connections or patterns that emerge when you analyze your data?\n\nBy asking these questions and analyzing your film log, you'll gain a deeper understanding of your cinematic tastes and preferences. You might discover new directors, genres, or themes that resonate with you, and you'll be better equipped to make informed decisions about which films to watch and which festivals to attend in the future.\n\nRemember to have fun with the analysis process!
