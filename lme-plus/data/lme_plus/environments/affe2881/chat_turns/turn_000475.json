Here are some tips to help you keep your strawberries fresh for a longer period:\n\n1. **Cool and dry storage:** Store strawberries in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. The ideal storage temperature is between 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C).\n2. **Don't wash before storing:** Excess moisture can cause strawberries to spoil quickly. Instead, gently rinse them just before using them.\n3. **Remove stems and leaves:** Remove the stems and leaves from the strawberries, as they can absorb moisture and cause the berries to spoil faster.\n4. **Use a breathable container:** Store strawberries in a container that allows for airflow, such as a paper bag, mesh bag, or a ventilated container. Avoid using airtight containers or plastic bags, as they can trap moisture.\n5. **Keep them dry:** Place a paper towel or clean cloth at the bottom of the container to absorb any excess moisture. You can also add a small amount of silica gel packets to absorb moisture.\n6. **Store them in a single layer:** Arrange strawberries in a single layer, not touching each other, to prevent moisture from spreading.\n7. **Use them within a few days:** Fresh strawberries typically last for 3 to 5 days at room temperature and up to 7 days when refrigerated.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to enjoy your strawberries for a longer period and make the most of your strawberry coffee crisp recipe!\n\nNow, are you ready for the recipe? I can provide you with the ingredients and instructions to make this delicious dessert.",
