Let it sit for about 15 minutes, until the strawberries start to release their juice and the mixture becomes syrupy.\n3. **Prepare the oat topping:** In a separate bowl, mix together the oats, brown sugar, pecans (if using), and cinnamon. Add the cold butter and use your fingers or a pastry blender to work it into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.\n4. **Assemble the crisp:** Transfer the strawberry mixture to a 9x9-inch baking dish. Top with the oat mixture, spreading it evenly to cover the entire surface.\n5. **Bake and crisp:** Bake the crisp for 40-45 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbly and tender.\n6. **Serve warm:** Serve the strawberry coffee crisp warm, topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, if desired. Enjoy!\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use fresh strawberries for the best flavor and texture.\n* If using leftover coffee syrup, make sure it's at room temperature before adding it to the strawberry mixture.\n* You can adjust the amount of coffee syrup to your taste. If you prefer a stronger coffee flavor, add more syrup. If you prefer a milder flavor, use less.\n* Consider adding other spices, like nutmeg or cardamom, to the oat topping for added depth of flavor.\n* This recipe makes a great breakfast or brunch dish, too! Simply serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.\n\nI hope you enjoy this unique and delicious dessert recipe!
