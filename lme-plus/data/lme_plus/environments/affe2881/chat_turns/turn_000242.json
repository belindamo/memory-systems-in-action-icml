This allows you to compare prices and find the best deals for each component of your trip.\n\nI recommend waiting until you've confirmed your flight before booking a hotel. Here's why:\n\n1. **Flight schedules can change**: If you book a hotel and then your flight schedule changes, you might need to adjust your accommodation dates or risk losing your hotel booking.\n2. **Hotel prices can fluctuate**: Hotel prices can change rapidly, especially during peak travel seasons. By waiting, you can take advantage of potential price drops or special offers.\n3. **More flexibility**: Booking separately gives you the freedom to choose the best hotel for your needs and budget, rather than being tied to a package deal.\n\nThat being said, if you find an incredible deal on a package that includes a hotel and flight, it might be worth considering. Just make sure to read the fine print and understand the cancellation policies before booking.\n\nOnce you've confirmed your flight, you can start searching for hotels using online travel agencies like Expedia, Booking.com, or Hotels.com. You can also consider using travel apps like Hotel Tonight or Last Minute Travel for last-minute deals.\n\nRemember to factor in the distance between the hotel and the airport, as well as the hotel's amenities and reviews, when making your decision.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any preferred hotel chains or areas in mind for your stay in Denver?",
