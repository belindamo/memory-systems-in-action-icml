I'm glad I could help.\n\nIt sounds like you have a solid plan in place to offer a discounted rate for your first few clients while still ensuring you're earning a fair income. By limiting the number of clients and creating a tiered pricing structure, you'll be able to attract the right clients and maintain a sustainable business model.\n\nRemember to also focus on delivering exceptional value to your clients, so they'll be happy to pay your full rate once the discounted period ends. And don't hesitate to raise your rates as you gain more experience and build a strong portfolio.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help.\n\nBest of luck with your business, and I hope you attract some amazing clients who appreciate your writing skills!",
