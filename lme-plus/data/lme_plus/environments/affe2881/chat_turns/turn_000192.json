  "content": "Excellent choice on considering Japanese-inspired appetizers! Gyoza and edamame will pair nicely with the hummus and kimchi deviled eggs.\n\nNow, let's talk drinks! You'll want to offer beverages that complement the diverse flavors of your international dinner party. Here are some ideas:\n\n**Drink Options**\n\n1. **Mango Lassi**: A popular Indian yogurt-based drink that's sweet, creamy, and refreshing. You can serve it in small glasses as a palate cleanser between courses.\n2. **Sake or Japanese Beer**: Offer a Japanese sake or beer to pair with the Japanese-inspired dishes, like the teriyaki chicken or gyoza.\n3. **Middle Eastern Tea**: Serve a flavorful tea like mint tea, cardamom tea, or rose tea, which are popular in Middle Eastern countries. This will complement the falafel and baklava nicely.\n4. **Korean Iced Tea**: Offer a sweet and refreshing Korean iced tea, like omija cha (five-flavor tea) or yuja cha (citrus tea), to pair with the BBQ beef and kimchi.\n5. **Cucumber Lime Refresher**: A light and refreshing drink made with cucumber, lime juice, mint, and a touch of sparkling water. This will help cut the richness of the meal.\n6. **Wine and Champagne**: Of course, you can't go wrong with a selection of wine and champagne. Choose varieties that pair well with the diverse flavors of your menu, such as a crisp white wine or a fruity red wine.\n\nConsider setting up a signature cocktail or drink station with a few options, like a \"Tokyo Mule\" (made with sake, ginger beer, and lime) or a \"Mumbai Mule\" (made with ginger beer, lime, and a splash of cumin-infused simple syrup). This will add a fun and interactive element to your dinner party.\n\nRemember to have plenty of water and other non-alcoholic options available for your guests. With these drink options, you'll have something for everyone to enjoy throughout the evening!",
