Here's why:\n\n1. **Movement and sound**: Running water creates movement and sound, which can attract birds from a distance. The gentle gurgling or bubbling noise can signal to birds that water is available and inviting.\n2. **Freshness**: Running water is more likely to be fresh and oxygenated, which is important for birds' health. Stagnant water can become a breeding ground for bacteria and algae, making it less appealing to birds.\n3. **Cooling and drinking**: Birds need water for drinking and cooling themselves. Running water is more effective at providing a cooling effect, as it allows birds to splash and bathe in the moving water.\n\nThat being said, it's not always possible to provide running water, especially in a picnic setting. If you can't bring a portable fountain or bubbler, a shallow birdbath with fresh, clean water will still be appreciated by the birds.\n\nHere are some tips for creating an attractive birdbath:\n\n1. **Shallow water**: Use a shallow birdbath or dish with a maximum depth of 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm). This allows birds to easily access the water and reduces the risk of drowning.\n2. **Fresh water**: Change the water frequently to keep it clean and fresh. You can add a few rocks or twigs to the birdbath to provide perches and help birds access the water.\n3. **Location**: Place the birdbath in a spot that receives partial shade and is protected from strong winds.\n4. **Maintenance**: Clean the birdbath regularly to prevent the growth of algae and bacteria.\n\nBy providing a clean, fresh water source, you'll increase the chances of attracting a variety of bird species to your picnic spot. Enjoy your bird-friendly picnic!",
