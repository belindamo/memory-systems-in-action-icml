Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**Storing batteries with devices:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Convenience: Having the batteries stored with the device can make it easier to find them when you need to replace them.\n* Reduced clutter: Storing batteries with devices can help keep your junk drawer or storage area less cluttered.\n\nCons:\n\n* Battery leakage: If a battery leaks acid, it can damage the device or other items nearby.\n* Device damage: If a device is stored with batteries for an extended period, the batteries can corrode or leak, damaging the device.\n* Difficulty finding batteries: If you need to use a battery for a different device, you might have to dig through multiple devices to find the right one.\n\n**Storing batteries separately:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Organization: Storing batteries in a designated container or organizer can help keep them organized and easy to find.\n* Protection: Separating batteries from devices can protect them from damage and leakage.\n* Easy access: You can quickly find the batteries you need without having to search through devices.\n\nCons:\n\n* More storage space: You'll need a separate container or space to store the batteries.\n* More effort: You'll need to make an effort to store the batteries in their designated spot.\n\n**A balanced approach:**\n\nConsider storing batteries in a designated container or organizer, but keep the containers near the devices that use them. This way, you can still keep the batteries organized and protected while making it easy to find them when you need to replace them.\n\nFor example, you could store your TV remote batteries in a small container near the TV, and your flashlight batteries in a separate container near the flashlight. This approach provides a balance between convenience and organization.\n\nUltimately, the decision to store batteries with their devices or separately depends on your personal preference and the specific devices you're using. If you do choose to store them together, make sure to check the batteries regularly for signs of leakage or corrosion.",
