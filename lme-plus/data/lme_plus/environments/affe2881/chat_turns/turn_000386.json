  "content": "I'm thrilled to hear you're enjoying the soundtracks! \"Dear Evan Hansen\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" are both fantastic choices to brighten up your commute.\n\nAs for streaming \"The Book of Mormon\" play, it's a bit more complicated than other musicals. Due to its creators' (Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Robert Lopez) strict control over the distribution and presentation of their work, \"The Book of Mormon\" is not currently available to stream online.\n\nThe only official way to experience the full production is through:\n\n1. **Live performances**: Catch a live show in a theater near you. Check the official website or ticketing websites like Telecharge or Ticketmaster for tour dates and availability.\n2. **DVD/Blu-ray**: You can purchase a physical copy of the London production's filmed stage play, which was released in 2020. This is the only official video recording of the musical available for home viewing.\n\nThe creators are very protective of their work, and they want to ensure that the show is experienced in its intended format \u2013 live on stage. They believe that the energy of the audience and the communal experience are essential to the show's success.\n\nHowever, you can still enjoy the original Broadway cast recording, which is available on music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. The soundtrack features the iconic songs \"Hello!\", \"Two by Two\", \"Hasa Diga Eebowai\", and many more.\n\nKeep in mind that there are some fan-made recordings and bootlegs floating around online, but be cautious when accessing those, as they might be low-quality or unauthorized.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I'm glad you're enjoying the soundtracks!",
