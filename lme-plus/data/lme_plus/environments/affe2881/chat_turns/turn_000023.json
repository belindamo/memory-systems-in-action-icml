Some common guidelines for guided birding tours include:\n\n1. Staying on designated trails: This helps protect the habitat and prevents disturbance to the birds and other wildlife.\n2. Maintaining a safe distance: Guides will often instruct participants to keep a safe distance from birds to avoid disturbing them or causing stress.\n3. No touching or handling: Participants should never touch or handle birds, nests, or eggs, as this can cause harm to the birds and disrupt their natural behavior.\n4. No feeding: Feeding wildlife can alter their behavior and create dependencies, so it's usually not allowed.\n5. Respecting closed areas: Some areas might be closed due to sensitive habitats, nesting sites, or conservation efforts. Guides will ensure participants avoid these areas.\n6. Keeping noise levels down: Loud noises can scare birds away, so guides might ask participants to keep conversations quiet and avoid sudden movements.\n7. Following guide instructions: Guides are trained to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience, so it's essential to follow their instructions and guidance throughout the tour.\n\nRegarding equipment, some sanctuaries might provide:\n\n1. Binoculars: Some tours might offer binoculars for participants to use during the tour, especially if they don't have their own.\n2. Spotting scopes: A few sanctuaries might provide spotting scopes for participants to use, especially for longer-distance viewing.\n3. Field guides: Guides might bring field guides or provide digital resources to help participants identify birds and learn more about their habits.\n4. Checklists: Some tours might provide checklists of the birds seen during the tour, which can be a helpful resource for participants.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to check with the sanctuary beforehand to see what equipment is provided and what participants are expected to bring. You might also consider bringing your own binoculars, spotting scope, and field guide to ensure you have the tools you need for a successful and enjoyable birding experience.\n\nThat's great to hear that you're getting good use out of your new spotting scope! Observing the nesting habits of American Robins can be fascinating, and it's wonderful that you're taking the time to appreciate the natural world in your own backyard.",
