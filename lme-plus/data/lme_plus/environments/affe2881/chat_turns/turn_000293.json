  "content": "I think I'll go with Cancun, Mexico. I've heard great things about the beaches and the party scene, and it seems like a great value destination. Plus, it's close to some amazing ancient Mayan ruins, which I'd love to explore.\n\nCan you give me some tips on what to pack for Cancun in late April?\n(P.S. I got rid of a bunch of old winter clothes during the decluttering process, so I'm excited to pack some fresh, spring-inspired outfits for the trip!)",
