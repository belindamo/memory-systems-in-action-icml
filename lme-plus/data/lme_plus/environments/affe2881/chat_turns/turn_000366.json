Here's a brief rundown of each option, including their approximate file sizes:\n\n1. **SD (Standard Definition)**:\n\t* Resolution: 480p (640x480 pixels)\n\t* File size: approximately 300-400 MB per episode (1 hour)\n\t* Recommended for: Older devices, slower internet connections, or those who prioritize smaller file sizes\n2. **HD (High Definition)**:\n\t* Resolution: 1080p (1920x1080 pixels)\n\t* File size: approximately 1.5-2.5 GB per episode (1 hour)\n\t* Recommended for: Most devices, including iPads, iPhones, and modern Apple TVs\n3. **4K (Ultra High Definition)**:\n\t* Resolution: 2160p (3840x2160 pixels)\n\t* File size: approximately 5-7 GB per episode (1 hour)\n\t* Recommended for: 4K-capable devices, such as the latest Apple TVs, iPads, and iPhones, with fast internet connections\n\nPlease note that these file sizes are approximate and may vary depending on the specific episode, encoding, and other factors.\n\nFor your flight, I'd recommend downloading episodes in HD (1080p) quality, which should provide a great viewing experience while keeping file sizes manageable. If you have a 4K-capable device and a fast internet connection, you can opt for 4K quality, but be aware that the file sizes will be larger.\n\nBefore you download, make sure you have enough storage space available on your device. You can check your device's storage capacity in the Settings app (on iOS devices) or System Preferences (on Mac computers).\n\nSafe travels, and enjoy your flight with \"Defending Jacob\"!",
