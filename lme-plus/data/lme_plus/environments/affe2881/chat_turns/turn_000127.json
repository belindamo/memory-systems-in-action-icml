  "content": "In response to a demand for discovery, the following are some possible scenarios:\n\n* Improper demand: An improper demand is a demand that seeks information that is not relevant or is protected by privilege. For example, if the defendant in a personal injury case demands access to the plaintiff's medical records that are not related to the injury at issue, the demand would be considered improper. In this case, the plaintiff's attorney would object to the demand and explain why it is improper.\n* Not applicable: If a plaintiff states that a demand is not applicable, it means that the plaintiff does not have the information or document requested. For example, if the defendant demands a document that does not exist, the plaintiff would respond by stating that the demand is not applicable.\n* Unwholly burdensome: If a demand for discovery is unreasonably burdensome, the party can object to the request. For example, if the defendant demands the production of thousands of documents that would require extensive time and resources to compile, the plaintiff could argue that the demand is unreasonably burdensome. In this case, the plaintiff's attorney would object to the demand and explain why it is unwholly burdensome. They may also propose a more reasonable alternative to the demand.",
