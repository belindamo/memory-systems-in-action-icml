  "content": "Congratulations on spotting the Northern Flicker and reaching 32 species on your count!\n\nSuet is an excellent choice to attract woodpeckers, and it's likely to draw in other species beyond just Northern Flickers. Here are some woodpecker species that might visit your suet feeder:\n\n1. **Downy Woodpeckers**: These are one of the most common woodpeckers in North America, and they love suet. They're small, black-and-white birds with a distinctive downy tuft on their heads.\n2. **Hairy Woodpeckers**: Similar to Downy Woodpeckers but larger, Hairy Woodpeckers are also frequent visitors to suet feeders.\n3. **Red-bellied Woodpeckers**: These woodpeckers have a distinctive red cap and are known for their loud, rolling calls. They're common in many parks and woodlands.\n4. **Pileated Woodpeckers**: While less common, Pileated Woodpeckers might visit your suet feeder, especially if you're in an area with mature trees. They're the largest woodpeckers in North America, with a distinctive red crest and loud drumming.\n\nKeep in mind that the types of woodpeckers you'll attract will depend on the specific species found in your region and the time of year. It's always exciting to see which species will visit your feeder!\n\nRemember to place the suet feeder in a spot that's easy for the woodpeckers to access, such as a tree trunk or a branch. You can also try adding some peanut butter or jelly to the suet to make it even more appealing.\n\nEnjoy your picnic and happy birding!",
