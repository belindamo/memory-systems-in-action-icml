  "content": "That's a great idea to serve the Japanese rice as a side dish. I think my guests will appreciate the option to try a different type of rice. I'm also considering making some Japanese-inspired appetizers, like gyoza or edamame, to pair with the hummus and kimchi deviled eggs. Do you have any suggestions for drinks that would complement the international flavors of the dinner party?",
