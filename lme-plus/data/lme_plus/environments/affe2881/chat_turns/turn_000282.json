Warblers and sparrows can be challenging to spot, but with a good pair of binoculars, you might be able to get a glimpse of them.\n\n**Warblers**: Warblers are small, active birds that often flit between branches, making them tricky to spot. However, with binoculars, you might be able to catch a glimpse of their bright plumage or distinctive markings. Look for warblers in areas with dense foliage, like shrubs or trees with leaves.
