Continuously working without taking breaks can lead to diminishing returns as a result of fatigue, stress, and disengagement. It is crucial to allocate time for rest and recovery to avoid burnout and ensure long-term productivity. By incorporating regular breaks into your workday, it can allow you to recharge, regain focus and concentration, and prevent decision fatigue.
