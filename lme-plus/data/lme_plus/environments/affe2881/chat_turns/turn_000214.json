  "content": "**Success Rates of Egg Freezing:**\n\nThe success rates of egg freezing are improving with advancements in technology and vitrification methods. However, it's essential to understand that egg freezing is not a guarantee of a successful pregnancy or birth. The chances of a frozen egg resulting in a healthy pregnancy and birth depend on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Age at the time of egg freezing:** Your age at the time of egg freezing is a significant factor in determining the success rates. Eggs frozen at a younger age tend to have a higher success rate.\n2. **Egg quality:** The quality of the eggs at the time of freezing also impacts success rates. Eggs with better quality and morphology are more likely to result in a successful pregnancy.\n3. **Thawing and fertilization rates:** The ability to successfully thaw and fertilize the frozen eggs is crucial. The thawing rate is typically high (around 90-95%), but the fertilization rate can vary depending on the sperm quality and insemination method.\n4. **Embryo quality:** The quality of the resulting embryo after fertilization also affects success rates.\n\n**Success Rates by Age:**\n\nAccording to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the chances of a frozen egg resulting in a live birth are:\n\n* **Under 35:** 40-50% per egg\n* **35-37:** 30-40% per egg\n* **38-40:** 20-30% per egg\n* **41-42:** 10-20% per egg\n* **43 and older:** Less than 10% per egg\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates and can vary depending on individual circumstances. Some studies suggest that the success rates may be even higher for women who freeze their eggs at a younger age.\n\n**Other Factors Affecting Success Rates:**\n\n1. **Number of eggs frozen:** Freezing multiple eggs increases the chances of success, as it provides more opportunities for a successful pregnancy.\n2. **Egg storage duration:** The length of time eggs are stored does not significantly impact success rates, but it's essential to follow proper storage protocols to maintain egg quality.\n3. **Fertility clinic and expertise:** The skill and experience of the fertility clinic and embryologist can affect success rates.\n\n**What This Means for You:**\n\nAs you're considering egg freezing, it's essential to remember that your age plays a significant role in the success rates. Since you're younger than your sister, your eggs are likely to be of better quality, and your chances of success might be higher. However, it's crucial to discuss your individual circumstances and fertility goals with a reproductive endocrinologist to get a better understanding of your chances of success.\n\nI hope this information helps you make an informed decision about egg freezing!",
