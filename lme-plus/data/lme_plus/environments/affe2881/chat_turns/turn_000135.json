  "content": "CPLR 1602 is a section of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules that deals with service of process, which is the legal procedure for giving notice to a defendant of a lawsuit filed against them. Specifically, CPLR 1602 states that a \"summons must be served with the complaint.\"\n\nThis means that when a plaintiff files a lawsuit by filing a summons and complaint with the court, they must also serve a copy of the summons and complaint on the defendant within a certain time frame specified by law. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the defendant is aware of the lawsuit and has an opportunity to respond.\n\nCPLR 1602 also specifies the manner in which service of process may be made, including personal delivery, delivery to the defendant's home or business, or by mail with an acknowledgment of receipt.\n\nIn summary, CPLR 1602 is an important provision that outlines the requirements for serving a defendant with a summons and complaint in a New York civil lawsuit.",
