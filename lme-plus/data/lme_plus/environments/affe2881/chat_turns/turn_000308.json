Look for natural peanut butter with minimal added sugars.\n4. **Hard-Boiled Eggs**: A convenient and protein-rich snack that's easy to prepare ahead of time.\n5. **Avocado Toast**: Toast whole-grain bread, mash an avocado, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. This snack provides healthy fats, fiber, and complex carbs.\n6. **Protein Smoothie**: Blend together your favorite fruits, Greek yogurt, and a scoop of protein powder (if desired) for a quick and refreshing snack.\n7. **Cottage Cheese with Fresh Fruit**: A high-protein snack that's rich in calcium and probiotics. Look for single-ingredient, unflavored cottage cheese.\n8. **Trail Mix with Dried Fruit and Nuts**: A healthy mix of carbs, protein, and healthy fats. Just be mindful of added sugars and artificial ingredients.\n9. **Whole-Grain Crackers with Hummus**: A satisfying snack that provides complex carbs, protein, and healthy fats.\n10. **Coconut Water or Sports Drink**: Replenish lost electrolytes with a natural, low-calorie beverage like coconut water or a sports drink (if you've had an intense workout).\n\nWhen choosing snacks, aim for a balance of:\n\n* Complex carbohydrates (whole grains, fruits, and veggies) to replenish energy stores\n* Protein (from sources like lean meats, nuts, seeds, and dairy) to aid in muscle repair and recovery\n* Healthy fats (from sources like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil) to support hormone production and overall health\n\nRemember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout your workout and refueling period.\n\nAs for age-related aches and pains, incorporating anti-inflammatory foods into your diet can help alleviate symptoms. Some examples include:\n\n* Fatty fish (salmon, tuna, and mackerel) rich in omega-3 fatty acids\n* Turmeric, ginger, and other spices with anti-inflammatory properties\n* Leafy greens (spinach, kale, and collard greens) rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds\n* Berries (blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries) packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory anthocyanins\n\nEnjoy your new workout routine and remember to listen to your body and make adjustments as needed!",
