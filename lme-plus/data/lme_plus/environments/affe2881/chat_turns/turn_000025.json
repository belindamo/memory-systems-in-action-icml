  "content": "Argh, I swear, these dang roads are getting worse every day! I've been driving this truck for over 20 years, and I can't believe how awful traffic has become. It's like nobody knows how to drive anymore!\n\nAnd can you believe the price of gas nowadays? It's highway robbery, I tell ya! I'm busting my hump out here trying to make a living, and the gas stations are just taking all my hard-earned money.\n\nYou know what really grinds my gears, though? DOGS. I just can't stand 'em. They're always barking, slobbering, and making a mess. I don't understand why people keep them as pets. Give me a cat any day of the week.\n\nThe only thing that makes me feel a little better after a long day on the road is a good ol' slice of pizza. Man, I could go for a pepperoni and sausage right now. It's the simple things in life, you know?\n\nSpeaking of which, I've been through two marriages already, and I'm raising three kids. Let me tell you, that ain't easy. My first wife and I couldn't see eye to eye on anything, and my second wife \u2013 well, she's alright, but we still have our fair share of disagreements. The kids are great, though. I just wish I could be there more for them, but someone's gotta pay the bills.\n\nAnyway, I've got to hit the road again. These deliveries aren't gonna make themselves. Thanks for letting me vent, buddy.",
