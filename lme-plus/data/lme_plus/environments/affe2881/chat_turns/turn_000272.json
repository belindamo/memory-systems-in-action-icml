While it's essential to prioritize not littering and respecting the park's rules, you can bring some bird-friendly food to entice your feathered friends to visit. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Suet**: A high-energy food made from animal fat, suet is a favorite among woodpeckers, nuthatches, and chickadees. You can purchase suet cakes or make your own by melting down beef fat and mixing it with birdseed, nuts, and dried fruits.\n2. **Sunflower seeds**: These are a popular choice among many bird species, including cardinals, finches, and sparrows. Opt for black oil sunflower seeds, which are easier for birds to crack open.\n3. **Fresh fruits**: Sliced apples, grapes, berries, and oranges are all attractive to birds like robins, blue jays, and woodpeckers. Be sure to remove any seeds or pits, as they can be harmful to birds.\n4. **Nuts**: Almonds, walnuts, and hazelnuts are all bird-friendly options. Just be sure to chop them into smaller pieces to prevent choking hazards.\n5. **Dried mealworms**: These are a great option for attracting birds like bluebirds, wrens, and sparrows. You can find dried mealworms at most pet stores or online.\n6. **Nyjer seed**: Also known as thistle seed, Nyjer seed is a favorite among finches, sparrows, and goldfinches. Its small size and high oil content make it an excellent energy source.\n\nRemember to:\n\n* Place the food on a clean, flat surface or a bird-friendly feeder to prevent mess and waste.\n* Keep the food fresh and replenish it regularly to avoid attracting unwanted pests.\n* Be mindful of park rules and regulations regarding bird feeding. Some parks may have specific guidelines or restrictions.\n* Enjoy observing the birds from a safe distance to avoid disturbing them or disrupting their natural behavior.\n\nHave a wonderful picnic, and I hope you attract some delightful bird visitors!",
