  "content": "**Exclusivity requirement for KU:**\n\nWhen you enroll your eBook in Kindle Unlimited (KU), you agree to make your eBook exclusive to Amazon for at least 90 days. This means you cannot sell your eBook on other platforms, such as Apple Books, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, or Google Play, during that time. If you want to sell your eBook on other platforms, you'll need to remove it from KU or wait until the 90-day exclusivity period ends.\n\n**Using KDP for print books:**\n\nYou can still use Amazon's CreateSpace (now called Kindle Direct Publishing Paperback) for print-on-demand (POD) services, even if you're not enrolled in KU or selling your eBook on other platforms. CreateSpace is a separate service from KDP, and it allows you to print and distribute paperbacks to online retailers, bookstores, and directly to customers.\n\n**Selling eBooks on other platforms:**\n\nIf you want to sell your eBook on other platforms, you can do so, but you'll need to remove it from KU or wait until the exclusivity period ends.
