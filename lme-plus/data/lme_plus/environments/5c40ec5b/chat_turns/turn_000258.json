I've got some ideas that might help you craft a sweet and personal message without being too sappy:\n\n1. **Simple and Sincere**: \"Happy 5th birthday to an amazing niece! Wishing you a day as bright and beautiful as you are.\"\n2. **Personalized**: \"To my dear [Niece's Name], happy 5th birthday! I hope your day is filled with laughter, play, and all your favorite things.\"\n3. **Doll-themed**: \"Happy birthday to a doll-tastic niece! May your special day be as sweet as your smile and as bright as your sparkle.\"\n4. **Inside Joke**: If you have a special inside joke or phrase that's just between the two of you, consider including it in the message. This will make it even more personal and special.\n5. **Encouragement**: \"Happy 5th birthday to a brave, kind, and curious niece! Keep exploring, learning, and growing \u2013 you're amazing just the way you are.\"\n6. **Memory Lane**: \"I'll never forget the time [insert fond memory here].
