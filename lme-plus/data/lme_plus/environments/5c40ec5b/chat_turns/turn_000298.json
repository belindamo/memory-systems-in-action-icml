  "content": "I apologize for the confusion. If you selected \"Custom VPS\" when creating a server in Forge, then you will not be prompted to enter Azure server details as the custom VPS option is intended for servers outside of Forge's supported providers.\n\nInstead, to connect to your Azure virtual machine, you can use an SSH client such as PuTTY or the OpenSSH client in Linux/Mac. Here are the general steps:\n\n1. Open your SSH client and connect to your Azure virtual machine using the public IP address of your virtual machine. You can find this IP address in the Azure portal, under the \"Overview\" section of your virtual machine.\n2. Enter your SSH username and password when prompted. You can find the SSH username in the \"Settings\" section of your virtual machine in the Azure portal.\n3. Once you are connected, you can navigate to the directory where you want to upload your website files.\n4. Use an SFTP client such as FileZilla or Cyberduck to upload your website files to your virtual machine. You can also use the command-line SFTP client to upload your files.\n5. Install the required software for your back-end, such as a web server, database server, and programming language environment. You can use the package manager for your operating system to install the required software.\n6. Upload your back-end files to the appropriate directory. The directory and file names will depend on your back-end framework and programming language.\n7. Configure your web server to serve your website files and route requests to your back-end. The configuration files will depend on your web server and framework.\n8. Test your website to ensure that it is functioning correctly.\n\nThese are the basic steps you can follow to configure your Azure virtual machine to upload your front-end and back-end files. The specific steps will depend on the software and frameworks you are using, as well as your specific requirements.",
