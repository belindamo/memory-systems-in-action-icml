Here is one example:\n\n| Agenda Item | Moderator | Time Allotted |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Icebreaker | Moderator from either team | 10 minutes |\n| Review of last year's project | Moderator from the donor organization | 30 minutes |\n| Setting expectations for the new year | Moderator from the NGO | 60 minutes |\n| Communication and collaboration | Moderator from the donor organization | 60 minutes |\n| Conflict resolution | Moderator from the NGO | 30 minutes |\n| Action planning | Moderator from either team | 20 minutes |\n| Wrap-up | Moderator from the donor organization | 10 minutes |\n\nFor each agenda item, the moderator responsible for leading the discussion is identified, along with the time allotted for the session. The moderators could be chosen based on their expertise or experience related to the specific agenda item. For example, the moderator from the NGO could lead the discussion on setting expectations for the new year since they have more direct experience with the local context. The goal is to have a balanced approach where both teams have an opportunity to lead discussions and share their perspectives.",
