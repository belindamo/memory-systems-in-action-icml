All-purpose cleaner: Mix a 1:1 ratio of water and vinegar with a few drops of your favourite essential oil. Shake well and use to clean surfaces such as countertops, floors, and bathrooms. 2. Glass cleaner: Mix a 2:1 ratio of water and vinegar and add a few drops of lemon essential oil. Shake well and use to clean windows, mirrors, and other glass surfaces. 3. Disinfectant spray: Mix a 1:1 ratio of water and rubbing alcohol (at least 70%) with a few drops of tea tree oil. Shake well and spray on surfaces to disinfect them. 4. Kitchen cleaner: Mix a 1:1 ratio of water and Castile soap with a few drops of lemon essential oil. Shake well and use to clean dishes, countertops, and other kitchen surfaces. 5. Carpet cleaner: Mix a 1:1 ratio of water and vinegar with a few drops of lavender essential oil. Spray on carpets and let sit for 10-15 minutes before blotting with a clean cloth. Remember to always label your homemade cleaning sprays and store them in a cool, dry place. And as with any new cleaning product, test a small area before using it on a larger surface.",
