If you're comfortable with the increased costs, the Maple Avenue Townhouse might still be a viable option. However, if you're on a tighter budget, the Oak Street House might be a more affordable choice.\n\nRemember to also consider other factors, such as your personal preferences, lifestyle, and priorities, when making your decision.",
