Government and private sector initiatives: There have been initiatives launched by the government and the private sector to provide the necessary technology and infrastructure to low-income students. For instance, initiatives such as the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Lifeline program, which provides discounted internet services to low-income families.\n\n2. Donated devices: Many companies and organizations have donated devices to low-income students, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The aim is to ensure that these students have access to the same tools and resources as their more affluent peers.\n\n3. Online learning resources: There has been an increase in the availability of online learning resources, such as online libraries and educational platforms, that low-income students can access to enhance their learning.\n\n4. Affordable broadband plans: Providers have introduced affordable broadband plans to cater to low-income students, hence making it possible for them to access the internet.\n\n5. Schools and libraries: Schools and libraries have been providing internet-enabled computer labs to allow low-income students access to computers and the internet.\n\nAlthough there has been progress, the digital divide remains a significant challenge. There is still a gap in terms of access to devices, high-speed internet, and digital skills among low-income families. Therefore, more work needs to be done to address the issue.",
