It's practical, and she can use it to read in comfort, whether indoors or outdoors. ($15-25)\n2. **Book Journal**: A beautifully designed journal where Christine can record her thoughts, opinions, and reviews of the books she reads. ($10-20)\n3. **Gift Card to a Bookstore**: A gift card to her favorite bookstore or online retailer, like Amazon or Indiebound, gives Christine the freedom to choose her next great read. ($25-50)\n\n**Outdoor-inspired gifts**\n\n1. **Beachy Bookmark**: A cute, beach-themed bookmark with a shell, anchor, or other coastal design will bring a smile to her face every time she reads. ($5-10)\n2. **Waterproof Phone Case**: A waterproof phone case is a practical gift for beach-goers, allowing Christine to take photos or listen to audiobooks by the water without worrying about her device. ($20-30)\n3. **Nature-inspired Notebook**: A beautifully designed notebook with a nature-inspired cover or illustrations will encourage Christine to jot down her thoughts, poetry, or simply record her outdoor adventures. ($10-25)\n\n**Combining both interests**\n\n1. **Beach Read Bundle**: Create a bundle with a bestselling beach read (paperback or e-book) and a fun, beach-themed accessory like a bookmark, keychain, or magnet. ($20-40)\n2. **Outdoor Reading Kit**: Put together a kit with a lightweight, compact blanket, a book light, and a few of her favorite snacks for a cozy outdoor reading experience. ($30-50)\n\nI hope these ideas help you find the perfect gift for Christine's birthday!",
