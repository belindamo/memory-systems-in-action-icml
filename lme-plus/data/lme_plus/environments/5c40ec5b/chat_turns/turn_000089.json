  "content": "If a particle of the Earth is nearer to the surface than to the center, it will still contribute to the overall gravitational force that pulls objects towards the center of the Earth. This is because the force of gravity depends on the mass of the object and the distance between the object's center of mass and the center of mass of the Earth.\n\nEven if a particle is closer to the surface of the Earth than to its center, it is still part of the overall mass of the Earth and contributes to the gravitational force that pulls objects towards the center. The force of gravity acting on an object near the surface of the Earth is the result of the combined gravitational pull of all the particles that make up the Earth, including those closer to the surface.\n\nTo be more precise, the force of gravity on an object near the surface of the Earth decreases with increasing distance from the center of the Earth. However, even if a particle is closer to the surface than to the center, it is still part of the overall mass of the Earth and contributes to the gravitational force that pulls objects towards the center.",
