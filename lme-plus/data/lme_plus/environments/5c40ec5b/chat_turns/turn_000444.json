Look for containers with airtight lids, like Pyrex or Anchor Hocking.\n2. **BPA-Free Plastic Containers**: If you prefer plastic containers, make sure they're BPA-free and designed for food storage. Look for containers with airtight lids, like Rubbermaid or Glad.\n3. **Stainless Steel Containers**: Stainless steel containers are durable, resistant to rust, and can keep food fresh for a long time. They're also easy to clean and can be used for both hot and cold foods.\n4. **Vacuum-Seal Containers**: Vacuum-seal containers are perfect for meal prep, as they remove air from the container, preventing bacterial growth and keeping food fresh for longer.
