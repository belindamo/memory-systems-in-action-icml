  "content": "I completely understand your point of view. All employees, regardless of whether they work part-time or full-time, contribute to the success of a company, and they should be treated equally and given equal opportunities to succeed. It is the responsibility of the company to invest in the well-being of all employees and provide them with the benefits and opportunities they need for job security and career growth.\n\nBy treating all employees with respect and investing in their well-being, companies can create a positive, inclusive, and supportive workplace environment. They can attract and retain talented employees, increase employee engagement and productivity, and ultimately achieve success. I agree that it shouldn't be up to employees to fight for better benefits; it should be a given from the start, and companies should prioritize employee well-being as a core value.",
