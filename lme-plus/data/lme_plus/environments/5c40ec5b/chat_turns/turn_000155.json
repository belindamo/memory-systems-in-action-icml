  "content": "I'm loving this list! I'm particularly interested in The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake. I've heard great things about magical realism. Speaking of which, I met this guy Alex from Germany at a music festival a few weeks ago, and we bonded over our shared love of indie rock music. He's actually coming to my city for work soon, and we're planning to meet up. Anyway, back to the book \u2013 do you think it's a good representation of magical realism?",
