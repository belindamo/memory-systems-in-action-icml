I like that Toggl has a browser extension and mobile apps, and the offline tracking feature is a big plus. I've been working on this big project with a Tokyo-based startup, and I need to make sure I'm tracking my time accurately. Do you know if Toggl has a feature to generate invoices based on the time tracked?",
