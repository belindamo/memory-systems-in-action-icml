  "content": "There are many textures that work well with color blocking techniques. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Velvets: Velvet adds a luxurious texture to any room, and it looks particularly stunning in jewel tones like emerald, sapphire, and amethyst.\n\n2. Linen: Linen adds a relaxed, breezy feel to a space and works well with earthy colors like beige, tan, and moss green.\n\n3. Knits: Chunky knit throws, pillows, and rugs add a cozy and inviting texture to a space. They work well in muted colors like gray, cream, and pale pink.\n\n4. Leather: Leather adds a rich, sophisticated texture to a space and works well in warmer shades of brown, cognac, and rust.\n\n5. Woven textiles: Whether you go for a rattan chair, a jute rug, or a woven wall hanging, woven textures add a natural, organic feel to a space. They work well with deep, earthy colors like olive green, terracotta, and dark denim blue.",
