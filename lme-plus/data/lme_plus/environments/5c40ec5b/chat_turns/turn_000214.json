Peas benefit from companion plants that provide shade, improve soil health, repel pests, and attract beneficial insects. Here are some excellent companion plants for peas:\n\n1. **Carrots**: Carrots and peas have a symbiotic relationship, as carrots help to repel the carrot rust fly, which can also attack peas.\n2. **Cucumbers**: Cucumbers provide shade for peas and can help to reduce soil temperature, which can benefit peas in hot weather.\n3. **Marigolds**: Marigolds repel nematodes, which can harm peas, and attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings.\n4. **Radishes**: Radishes can help to repel cucumber beetles, which can spread bacterial wilt to peas. Radishes also improve soil health by breaking up compacted soil.\n5. **Nasturtiums**: Nasturtiums repel aphids, whiteflies, and other pests that target peas. They also attract beneficial insects like lacewings and hoverflies.\n6. **Borage**: Borage attracts beneficial insects like bees and predatory wasps, which can help to pollinate and protect peas.\n7. **Chives**: Chives are a natural repellent for aphids and other pests that target peas. They also add nutrients to the soil and improve its structure.\n8. **Calendula**: Calendula repels pests like aphids and nematodes, and its bright flowers attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies.\n9. **Dill**: Dill is a natural repellent for aphids and other pests that target peas.
