This will help create a nice crust on the meat.\n2. **Don't overcrowd**: Brown the meat in batches if necessary, to ensure each piece is cooked evenly. Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of browning.\n3. **Don't stir too much**: Let the meat develop a nice brown crust on the bottom before stirring. This will add depth of flavor to your sauce.\n4. **Use a mixture of ground meats**: Combining ground beef, pork, and veal will create a more complex flavor profile and a tender texture.\n\n**Preventing the sauce from becoming too thick:**\n\n1. **Acidity**: A splash of red wine or tomato paste will help balance the richness of the sauce and prevent it from becoming too thick.\n2. **Tomato variety**: Using a combination of crushed and diced tomatoes will help maintain a saucy consistency.\n3. **Simmering time**: Let the sauce simmer for at least 2-3 hours to allow the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken naturally.\n4. **Adding liquid**: If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a bit of beef broth, red wine, or even water to thin it out.\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n1. **Soften the onions**: Cook the onions slowly over low heat to caramelize them and bring out their natural sweetness.\n2. **Use aromatics**: Saute onions, carrots, and celery in the pan before adding the meat to create a flavorful base for your sauce.\n3. **Don't overcook**: Bolognese sauce should be simmered low and slow, but it's essential to avoid overcooking the meat, which can make it tough and dry.\n4. **Taste and adjust**: Regularly taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning, salt, and acidity to your liking.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a rich, flavorful Bolognese sauce that will impress your family and friends!\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Buon appetito, and I hope you enjoy your Bolognese sauce!",
