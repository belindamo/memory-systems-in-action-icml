  "content": "Gravity was first formally defined by Sir Isaac Newton in his groundbreaking work \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" published in 1687. Newton defined gravity as a force that acts between two objects with mass, and is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This is commonly known as the \"Law of Universal Gravitation.\"\n\nAccording to Newton's law, any two objects with mass in the universe attract each other with a force that depends on their masses and the distance between them. The force of gravity is always attractive, meaning it pulls objects towards each other.\n\nThe mathematical formula for calculating the force of gravity between two objects is:\n\nF = G \\* (m1 \\* m2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force of gravity, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between them.\n\nNewton's law of gravity was a major breakthrough in understanding the behavior of objects in the universe, and it provided a foundation for much of modern physics and astronomy.",
