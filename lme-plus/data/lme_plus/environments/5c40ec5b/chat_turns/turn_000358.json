  "content": "There can be several reasons why developers may choose not to incorporate mods into the base game, even if there are many available mods. \n\nOne reason is that mods may not fit with the overall vision or design of the game. Developers may have specific goals and objectives for the game that the mods may not align with.\n\nAnother reason is the potential for legal issues. Some mods may use copyrighted material or violate terms of service agreements which can lead to legal consequences for the developers.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating mods into the base game can increase the development and testing time, which can delay the release of the game.\n\nLastly, developers may also choose not to incorporate mods because they want to maintain control over the game's development and ensure that the game remains stable and balanced. While mods can add new and exciting features, they can also create imbalances or introduce bugs that can affect the overall gameplay experience.\n\nOverall, developers must weigh the potential benefits and risks of incorporating mods into the base game and make the best decision for their game and players.",
