  "content": "I'm creating a role-playing game with some friends. The following information is a starting point:\n\n=== Key ===\n\\* World = Graniphor\n\\* Setting = Coast of a large continent, islands litter the water some close and some far away. The land is owned by neutral races that have achieved a balance between each other. The noble races and antagonist races have spread their conflict from their homeland to these new shores and islands. As each race gets a foothold on the islands they seek to spread ever closer to the main land and it\u2019s untold fortunes. Lots of FOMO. The islands have strange things, powers, water, ruins, technology, metals, energy. Each race has found something of value as they seek to stabilize themselves in this new land. They see enemies on the horizon and fear what marvels they\u2019ve unearthed.\n\n=== Noble Races (Create societies/social structure): ===\n\\* Human\n\\*\\* People of the Cloud - Worship the sky/air, closest thing to the sky are the clouds.\n\\*\\* Midlanders - Hearty, farming and industrial people. \n\\*\\* Highlanders - Warlike, small bands that keep to their own circle \n\\* Dwarf\n\\* High Elf\n\\* Vulcans = Volcano People- hot rock people\n\\* Feyleaf = Plant People\n\\* Beastmen = Animal-people\n\n=== Antagonist Races (Destroy/Conquer to accumulate wealth or power): ===\n\\* Goblin\n\\* Orc\n\\* Undying = created by their own doing or by someone else\u2019s, immortal, power accumulators \n\\* Gnoll\n\\* Reafton = Fish people\n\\* Dark Elf\n\\* Savage Beastmen = feral animal-people\n\n=== Neutral Races (Self Interested - old): ===\n\\* Fey = Animalistic/humanistic\n\\* Construct\n\\* Gods\n\\* Giants\n\n=== Information ===\n\n\\* Players can choose a character from three playable races: Humans, Dwarves, and Elves.\n\\* The player character will hail from a walk of life in a land where most people do not know about the greater world. They do not speak of the name of the world or contintent, nor do they know the lay of its land. They only know the names of mountains, and cities, and rivers.\n\\* There is conflict between the three playable races. Each race is an important faction. There may be smaller factions within each race, or even across races, but it is unusual. The factions exploit each other and have a delicate balance of power. They dislike each other but find they must live with each other.\n\\* Dwarves are exploited for their labor. Humans pursue control through conquest.\n\\* Dwarves drink ale and would make their own destiny if they could.\n\\* Woodcutting is an important profession amongst humans.\n\\* The world has bandits in it, and nefarious types from every race. The players come across these, but those conflicts hopefully don't end in killing.\n\\* When most people think of the enemy, they think of monsters and monstrous beings: the kinds of creatures that go bump in the night or live in deep dark caves. The players must fight these creatures and kill them.\n\\* The player characters may also occasionally fight other races, and that should be especially interesting, thematic, and suspenseful.\n\\* Dialog should contain suspense and indecision.\n\\* The story should be told from the point of view of the protagonist.\n\\* The protagonist is a strong female protagonist, and her name is Clara.\n\\* Clara is a warrior, and is a good person.\n\\* Clara should be conflicted and be subjected to moral quandries, and deliberate over her choices.\n\\* Clara is a hero.\n\\* The humans are ruled by a king. The human king consorts with dark elves secretly. That is scandalous. He wants something from the dark elves. There is a dark elf ambassador who has the Dragonstone. The dark elves seem to beleive the Dragonstone will let them control the other races.\n\\* One of the major characters is a woodcutter.\n\\* The orcs control a white tower. The orcs are secretly being manipulated by dark elves.\n\nPlease tell me an epic, suspenseful story from the perspective of Clara. After the story, Clara will go on to have an epic, long, and world-changing quest. In the story, include lots of foreshadowing of the events that are to come. Involve the woodcutter, orcs, the dark elf ambassador, and the human king in the story.",
