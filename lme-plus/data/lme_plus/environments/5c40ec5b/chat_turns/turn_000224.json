  "content": "Yes, the conflicts between the friars and other groups within the Church did have a lasting impact on the Church's structure and functioning. One of the most significant changes was the emergence of the mendicant orders as a distinct type of religious order.\n\nThe mendicants, which included the Franciscans and the Dominicans, were characterized by their focus on preaching, teaching, and ministering to people outside the monastery. They were also independent and did not answer directly to local bishops or secular authorities.\n\nThis independence led to a reorganization of the Church's hierarchy, with the mendicants being given special privileges and exemptions from certain forms of control. For example, they were allowed to hear confessions and administer sacraments without the permission of local bishops, and they were exempt from paying taxes to secular authorities.\n\nThis had a significant impact on the Church's relationship with secular authorities, as it created a new form of power and influence that was not tied to the traditional structures of authority. It also helped to spread Christianity to new areas and promote a more inclusive and accessible form of religious practice.\n\nOverall, the conflicts between the friars and other groups within the Church helped to shape the Church's structure and functioning and contributed to the emergence of new forms of religious orders and practices.",
