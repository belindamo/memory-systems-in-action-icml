  "content": "For accent pillows to go with your forest green and burnt orange color scheme, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Cream and black geometric: This classic combination of cream and black with a geometric pattern can add a touch of sophistication to your space. 2. Burnt orange faux fur: Adding a cozy and textured touch with burnt orange faux fur or velvet can help amplify the burnt orange color in your color scheme. 3. Chunky knit cream: A chunky cream knit or cable knit pillow cover can add interest and texture without adding a lot of color. 4. Plaid or buffalo check: A plaid or buffalo check pillow in shades of orange, green, and cream can work well in a rustic or cozy space. 5. Navy and cream: Navy and cream or ivory can create a nautical vibe, and can make the green and orange pop. Remember, the key to making your accent pillows work in your space is to mix and match textures and patterns, while staying within your color palette. Be sure to choose pillows of various sizes and shapes, and use odd numbers (like three or five) to create a balanced look. Happy decorating!",
