Using fabric scraps to match the blanket is a wonderful way to tie everything together.\n\nAttaching fabric to a card can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you achieve a beautiful, non-bulky look:\n\n1. **Use a thin fabric**: Choose a lightweight fabric that's not too thick or stiff. Cotton or silk fabrics work well for this purpose.\n2. **Cut out small pieces**: Cut the fabric into small shapes or strips to minimize bulk. You can use scissors or a craft knife to cut out intricate designs.\n3. **Adhere with a spray adhesive**: Spray a small amount of adhesive, like 3M Spray Adhesive or Fabric-Tac, onto the back of the fabric piece and attach it to the card. This will help prevent wrinkles and bubbles.\n4. **Use a fabric glue**: Apply a small amount of fabric glue, like Fabric Glue or Hot Glue, to the back of the fabric piece and attach it to the card. Make sure to use a small amount to avoid excess glue oozing out.\n5. **Iron the fabric**: Before attaching the fabric to the card, iron the fabric piece to remove any wrinkles. This will help the fabric lie flat and reduce bulk.\n6. **Use a decoupage medium**: Apply a decoupage medium, like Mod Podge, to the back of the fabric piece and attach it to the card. This will help seal and flatten the fabric.\n7. **Add a backing**: If you're concerned about the fabric showing through the card, add a backing paper or a thin piece of cardstock to the back of the card before attaching the fabric.\n8. **Embellish with minimal bulk**: Add embellishments like buttons, sequins, or beads that are small and won't add bulk to the card.\n9. **Keep it simple**: Don't over-embellish the card with too much fabric or bulky elements. Keep the design simple and let the fabric be the focal point.\n10. **Experiment and adjust**: Don't be afraid to try different techniques and adjust as needed. You can always remove the fabric and reattach it if it doesn't look quite right.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to attach the fabric to the card without it looking bulky. Good luck, and I hope your niece loves the card and the blanket!",
