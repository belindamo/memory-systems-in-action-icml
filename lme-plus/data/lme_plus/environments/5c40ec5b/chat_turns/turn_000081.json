  "content": "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that governs the behavior of objects with mass or energy. According to the theory of general relativity developed by Albert Einstein, gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.\n\nIn other words, any object with mass or energy will warp the fabric of spacetime around it, creating a gravitational field. This field is what causes other objects with mass or energy to be attracted to the object creating the field. The strength of the gravitational field depends on the mass and distance between the objects.\n\nGravity is a very weak force compared to other fundamental forces like electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. However, because all objects with mass or energy have gravity, it has a cumulative effect and is responsible for the large-scale structure of the universe, including the orbits of planets around stars and the motions of galaxies.",
