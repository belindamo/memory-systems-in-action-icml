  "content": "Area No 1\nData DAOs\nThe opportunity\nDAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are distributed entities whose ownership, governance, and decision-making processes are transparently conducted via on-chain activities. DAOs are tasked with a collective mission.\n\nData DAOs are DAOs whose mission revolves around the preservation, curation, augmentation, and promotion of high-value datasets. Examples include large genomic or research databases, historical indexed blockchain chain and transaction data, rollup data, the Wikipedia, NFT collections, metaverse assets, and more.\n\nBecause stake in Data DAOs can be tokenized, the value and utility of data can be objectively expressed and transacted with in markets, in exchange for services to be performed or offered on the data.\n\nFor example, interested parties could harvest tokens in a DAO-driven decentralize compute fabric by analyzing datasets, performing scientific and ML modelling, calculate statistics, and more, all of which are actions that augment the value, worth, and utility of the original data.\n\nStakeholders could in turn spend tokens to incentivise even more production of raw data, e.g. sensor data collection, generative art, and even human tasks (transcription, translation...), thus resulting in a circular data-centric economy.\n\nThe potential\nThe FVM makes it possible to implement all the ingredients to make Data DAOs a reality. By creating composable layers that can be combined together to form different kinds of DAOs, the possiblities to break ground are immense.\n\nPlease write in English language.",
