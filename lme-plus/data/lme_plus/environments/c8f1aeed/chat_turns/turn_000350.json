Diversity: Bechdel's representation of queer love and relationships acknowledges the diversity of queer experiences and relationships. She portrays characters with varying gender identities, sexual orientations, and relationship dynamics.\n\n3. Complexity: Bechdel's representation of queer love and relationships is more complex and nuanced than conventional depictions.
