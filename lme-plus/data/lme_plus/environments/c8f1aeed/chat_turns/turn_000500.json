I've been trying to increase my engagement on Facebook, and I've been posting more frequently. However, I'm not sure if I should focus on posting more personal or professional content. I recently posted a picture of my cat, and it got 52 likes and 4 comments, which is my most popular post in the past two weeks. Do you think I should focus on posting more personal content like that, or should I stick to professional content related to my niche?",
