Considering your current schedule, here are some suggestions to fit in strength training:\n\n**Option 1: Add strength training to your yoga days**\n\n* On Tuesdays and Fridays, try to wake up 30 minutes earlier and do a quick 20-30 minute strength training session before your yoga class. This way, you're still getting your yoga fix, and you're adding strength training to your routine.\n\n**Option 2: Replace one yoga day with strength training**\n\n* Consider replacing one of your yoga days (let's say Tuesday) with a strength training day. This way, you'll still have one yoga day (Friday) and you'll be adding strength training to your routine.\n\n**Option 3: Add strength training on Sundays or Mondays**\n\n* If you're feeling rested and recovered from your Saturday group run, you could add a strength training session on Sundays. Alternatively, you could do strength training on Mondays to help with active recovery from your Saturday run.\n\n**Option 4: Break it down into shorter sessions**\n\n* If you're struggling to find a full 30-45 minute block of time for strength training, try breaking it down into shorter sessions. For example, you could do 10-15 minutes of strength training in the morning and another 10-15 minutes in the evening. This way, you're still getting some strength training in, even if it's not all at once.\n\n**Tips to make it work**\n\n* Start small: Begin with 1-2 strength training sessions per week and gradually increase the frequency as your schedule allows.\n* Be consistent: Choose a schedule that you can commit to and stick to it.\n* Prioritize: Remember that strength training is important for your running performance and injury prevention, so try to prioritize it in your schedule.\n* Make it convenient: Find a gym or workout space that's close to your home or work, so it's easier to fit in a strength training session.\n\nRemember, the key is to find a schedule that works for you and your lifestyle. Experiment with different options, and don't be afraid to adjust as needed. Good luck!",
