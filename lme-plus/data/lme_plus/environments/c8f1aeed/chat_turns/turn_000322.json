However, if you've downloaded the Day One Update, it adds another 10.45 GB, bringing the total to around 55.92 GB. Additionally, if you have the Season Pass or any DLCs, those will take up extra space as well.\n* **Overwatch**: The base game takes up around 30.44 GB of storage space. However, with updates and patches, the total size can grow to around 40-50 GB.\n\nKeep in mind that these sizes may vary depending on the region, language, and any additional content you've downloaded.\n\nConsidering you've completed 70% of the main storyline in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, you might have some additional data stored, such as saves, screenshots, and videos, which can add up to a few GB.\n\nA 2TB external hard drive should provide ample space for both games, as well as some extra room for other games and content. However, if you plan on installing more games or downloading more DLCs, you might want to consider a larger storage capacity.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here's a rough estimate of how much space you might have left on a 2TB external hard drive:\n\n* 2TB = 2000 GB\n* Assassin's Creed Valhalla (with DLCs and updates): 60-70 GB\n* Overwatch (with updates and patches): 40-50 GB\n* Other games and content: assume 100-200 GB (depending on the number and size of games)\n\nThis leaves you with around 1690-1790 GB of free space, which should be sufficient for a while. However, if you're a prolific gamer or plan on storing a large library of games, you might want to consider a larger storage capacity or upgrading your external hard drive in the future.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your storage needs!",
