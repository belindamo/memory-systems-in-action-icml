  "content": "Shrimp is a fantastic protein to add to Tom Yum soup. Marinating them in the mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar will definitely give them a nice flavor boost.\n\nAdding aromatics like onions and lemongrass to the pot when cooking the shrimp is a great idea. You can saut\u00e9 them in a bit of oil until they're softened and fragrant before adding the shrimp and other ingredients.\n\nAs for additional vegetables, bell peppers and mushrooms are both excellent choices for Tom Yum soup. Here's how you can incorporate them:\n\n* **Bell Peppers**: Slice the bell peppers thinly and add them to the pot during the last 2-3 minutes of simmering time. They'll retain some crunch and add a pop of color to the soup.\n* **Mushrooms**: You can add sliced or whole mushrooms to the pot earlier in the cooking process, around the same time you add the shrimp. They'll absorb the flavors of the soup nicely and add texture.\n\nOther vegetables you can consider adding include:\n\n* **Baby corn**: Add frozen or canned baby corn to the pot during the last minute of simmering time.\n* **Thai basil**: Add a handful of fresh Thai basil leaves to the pot during the last minute of simmering time. They'll add a bright, anise-like flavor and a pop of color.\n* **Bok choy**: Add chopped bok choy to the pot during the last 2-3 minutes of simmering time. It'll add a mild, slightly sweet flavor and some crunch.\n\nRemember, the key is to balance the flavors and textures in the soup. You can choose one or two additional vegetables to add, depending on your personal preferences and the flavor profile you're aiming for.\n\nLastly, don't forget to taste and adjust the seasoning as you go. Tom Yum soup should have a harmonious balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy flavors. You can adjust the seasoning with fish sauce, lime juice, palm sugar, or chili flakes to get the flavor just right.\n\nI hope that helps! Enjoy making your delicious Tom Yum soup with shrimp and vegetables.",
