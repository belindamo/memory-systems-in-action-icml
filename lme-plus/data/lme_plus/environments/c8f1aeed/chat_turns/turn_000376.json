Some herbs can be quite potent, so start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste.\n* Consider serving the cocktail in a unique glass or garnishing with edible flowers to enhance the visual appeal.\n* If you're short on time, you can also use herbal extracts or essences as a substitute for homemade syrups.\n\nChoose the one that resonates with your taste preferences, or feel free to modify these recipes to create your own signature cocktail.
