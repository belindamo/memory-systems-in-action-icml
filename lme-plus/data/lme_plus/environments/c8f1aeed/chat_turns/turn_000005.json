Breading chicken can be a bit finicky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you achieve a crispy, well-coated chicken parmesan:\n\n1. **Dry the chicken**: Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the breading adhere better.\n2. **Season the chicken**: Sprinkle both sides of the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and any other desired herbs or spices to enhance flavor.\n3. **Use the right breading mixture**: A mixture of all-purpose flour, breadcrumbs, and grated Parmesan cheese works well. You can also add some dried herbs like oregano, basil, or thyme to the breading mixture for extra flavor.\n4. **Use eggs as a binder**: Dip each chicken breast in beaten eggs before coating with the breading mixture. The eggs act as a binder, helping the breading stick to the chicken.\n5. **Use the right breadcrumbs**: Panko breadcrumbs are lighter and crisper than regular breadcrumbs, which makes them ideal for chicken parmesan.\n6. **Press the breading onto the chicken**: Gently press the breading mixture onto the chicken breasts to ensure it adheres evenly. Make sure to coat both sides of the chicken.\n7. **Don't over-bread**: Make sure to coat the chicken breasts evenly, but don't overdo it. Excess breading can fall off during cooking.\n8. **Chill the breaded chicken**: Refrigerate the breaded chicken breasts for about 30 minutes to set the breading and help it stick better during frying.\n9. **Use the right frying technique**: Fry the breaded chicken breasts in hot oil (around 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C) for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Don't overcrowd the skillet, and don't stir the chicken too much, as this can cause the breading to fall off.\n10. **Don't overcook**: Cook the chicken to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Overcooking can cause the breading to fall off.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n* Use a thermometer to ensure the oil reaches the correct temperature.\n* Don't use too much oil; about 1/2 inch (1 cm) deep is sufficient.\n* Don't press down on the chicken with your spatula while it's frying, as this can cause the breading to break off.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve a crispy, well-coated chicken parmesan with minimal breading loss.",
