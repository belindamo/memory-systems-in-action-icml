  "content": "I'd like to find some used motorcycles in my price range. My budget is around $5,000 to $7,000. I'm interested in a cruiser-style motorcycle, possibly a Harley-Davidson or a Yamaha. I'm open to considering different years, but I'd prefer something from the past 10-15 years. In terms of mileage, I'm looking for something with around 10,000 to 30,000 miles. I'm open to buying from a dealership or a private seller, but I'd prefer to buy from a dealership if possible.",
