  "content": "Cross-border cyberstalking cases can be extremely challenging for law enforcement agencies, as different countries have different laws, regulations, and cultural differences. It requires a high level of international cooperation and coordination between law enforcement agencies.\n\nHowever, many law enforcement agencies have developed dedicated cybercrime units or are working with other agencies specialized in cybercrime investigation to handle such cases. Additionally, many countries have signed treaties or agreements relating to cybercrime and cross-border investigations, which can facilitate information-sharing and law enforcement cooperation. For example, the United Nations Convention on Cybercrime serves as a framework for international cooperation on cybercrime investigations, providing guidelines regarding the collection of evidence, the preservation of data, and the protection of victims' rights.\n\nDespite these efforts, cross-border cyberstalking cases can still be complex, mainly when the suspects are in countries with weak legal and law enforcement systems. In such cases, law enforcement agencies may face obstacles such as difficulty in obtaining evidence and difficulties in extraditing suspects. These challenges highlight the need for continued development of global efforts to strengthen international cooperation in combating cybercrime.",
