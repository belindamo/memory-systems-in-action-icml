  "content": "The southern part of Lake Michigan, near the Indiana border, is a great area for largemouth bass fishing. Here are some fishing spots and tips that might help you catch some nice ones:\n\n1. **Portage Lake**: This lake is located near the Indiana Dunes National Park and is known for its abundant weed growth, which attracts largemouth bass. Look for areas with thick weed beds, especially in the northern part of the lake.\n2. **East Chicago Marina**: This marina is located near the Indiana border and offers a variety of structures, including weed beds, rocks, and drop-offs. Largemouth bass tend to congregate around the marina's docks and piers.\n3. **Wolf Lake**: This lake is situated near Hammond, Indiana, and is connected to Lake Michigan via a channel. Wolf Lake has plenty of weed beds, drop-offs, and submerged logs that largemouth bass love.\n4. **Lake Michigan shoreline**: The shoreline near the Indiana Dunes National Park offers a mix of sand, rocks, and weed beds, making it an ideal spot for largemouth bass. Look for areas with structural features like drop-offs, points, and weed lines.\n\nTips:\n\n* **Soft plastics**: Your curly tail grubs should work well in these areas, especially around weed beds. Try using a slow, steady retrieve to tempt bass.\n* **Weedless presentations**: When fishing in thick weeds, consider using weedless presentations like a Texas rig or a jig with a weed guard to reduce snagging.\n* **Pay attention to water conditions**: Largemouth bass in Lake Michigan can be sensitive to water temperature and clarity. Look for areas with warmer water (around 70-80\u00b0F) and moderate clarity.\n* **Fish the edges**: Largemouth bass often hang out near the edges of weed beds, drop-offs, and structures. Focus on these transition areas to increase your chances of catching bass.\n* **Be prepared for changing conditions**: Lake Michigan's weather and water conditions can change quickly. Be prepared to adapt your presentation and location accordingly.\n\nRemember to always follow local fishing regulations and practice catch-and-release fishing to help conserve the lake's bass population.\n\nI hope this information helps you plan your fishing trip and catch some nice largemouth bass on Lake Michigan!",
