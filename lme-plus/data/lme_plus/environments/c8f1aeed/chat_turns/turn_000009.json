  "content": "Veal parmesan is a classic Italian-American dish that's definitely worth trying! Veal, being a tender and delicate meat, pairs beautifully with the crispy breading and rich flavors of parmesan cheese. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**What is veal?**: Veal is the meat from young calves, typically raised on a milk-based diet. It's known for its tender, pale color, and mild flavor. Veal is often used in Italian cuisine, particularly in dishes like osso buco and vitello tonnato.\n\n**Veal parmesan preparation**: The preparation is similar to chicken parmesan, but with a few tweaks:\n\n1. **Veal cutlets**: Thinly sliced veal cutlets, usually from the loin or round, are used for veal parmesan.\n2. **Breading**: A lighter breading mixture is often used for veal, as it can be easily overpowered. Panko breadcrumbs, all-purpose flour, and grated Parmesan cheese are common ingredients.\n3. **Frying**: Veal cutlets are fried in olive oil or butter until golden brown and crispy, usually around 2-3 minutes per side.\n4. **Marinara sauce and cheese**: The fried veal cutlets are topped with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella cheese, just like chicken parmesan.\n\n**Flavor profile**: Veal parmesan has a delicate, almost sweet flavor from the veal, which pairs well with the crispy breading and tangy marinara sauce. The melted mozzarella cheese adds a rich, creamy element to the dish.\n\n**Tips for trying veal parmesan**:\n\n1. **Choose a good quality veal**: Opt for high-quality veal from a reputable source to ensure tenderness and flavor.\n2. **Don't overcook**: Veal can become tough if overcooked, so aim for a medium-rare to medium temperature.\n3. **Pair with a good marinara sauce**: A high-quality marinara sauce will elevate the dish and balance the flavors.\n4. **Try it with different cheeses**: Experiment with other cheeses like provolone or ricotta to find your favorite combination.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, give veal parmesan a try! You might be surprised by how much you enjoy it.",
