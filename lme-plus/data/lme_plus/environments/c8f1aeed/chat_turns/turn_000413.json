  "content": "Filming outdoors in Chicago would still require permits, insurance, and other resources such as equipment, crew, and transportation. However, filming in certain parts of Chicago may be more challenging due to traffic, noise, and other factors that could impact the production. Additionally, filming in Chicago may be more expensive than filming in smaller towns or rural areas outside the city.
