  "content": "Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure into shale rocks to release natural gas and oil trapped inside. The Marcellus Shale region, located in the eastern United States, is one of the largest sources of natural gas in the country.\n\nThere is conflicting research on the effect of fracking on groundwater quality in the Marcellus Shale region. Some studies have found higher levels of contaminants such as methane, benzene, and arsenic in groundwater near fracking wells, while others have found no significant changes.\n\nHowever, many experts agree that the risk of groundwater contamination increases when fracking is not done properly, such as when wells are not properly constructed or when wastewater is not properly disposed of.\n\nTo monitor groundwater quality in the Marcellus Shale region, several measures are being developed. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a groundwater monitoring program that requires fracking companies to test the water quality before, during, and after drilling. The EPA also conducts its own monitoring to ensure compliance with regulations.\n\nIn addition, many states have established their own rules and monitoring programs to regulate fracking and protect groundwater quality. For example, Pennsylvania requires fracking companies to monitor groundwater quality at nearby wells before drilling and for a certain period after drilling is complete.\n\nOverall, while the impact of fracking on groundwater quality in the Marcellus Shale region is still uncertain, monitoring measures are being developed to ensure that the process is done safely and sustainably.",
