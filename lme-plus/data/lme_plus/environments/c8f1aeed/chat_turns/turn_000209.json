I'll make sure to plan my visit accordingly and be respectful of the culture and traditions. Thanks for the tips and insights! Since I'll be in the area, I was thinking of taking a scenic drive through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Are there any specific routes or stops I shouldn't miss?",
