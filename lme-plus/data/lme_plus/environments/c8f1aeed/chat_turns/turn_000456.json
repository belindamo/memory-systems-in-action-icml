  "content": "Tom Yum soup is often served with noodles in Thailand, and the right type of noodle can elevate the dish even further. Here are some popular noodle options that pair well with Tom Yum soup:\n\n1. **Rice Noodles (Khanom Jeen)**: These thin, translucent noodles are a classic pairing for Tom Yum soup. They're made from rice flour and water, and their delicate texture won't overpower the flavors of the soup. You can find rice noodles at most Asian markets or online.\n2. **Egg Noodles (Ba Mee)**: Thicker and chewier than rice noodles, egg noodles add a nice texture contrast to the soup. They're made with wheat flour and eggs, and are commonly used in Thai cuisine. Look for thin, yellow noodles labeled as \"Ba Mee\" or \"Egg Noodles\" at Asian markets.\n3. **Udon Noodles**: While not traditional in Thai cuisine, udon noodles can work well with Tom Yum soup. These Japanese noodles are thicker and chewier than rice noodles, and their mild flavor won't compete with the bold flavors of the soup.\n4. **Glass Noodles (Woon Sen)**: These transparent, gelatinous noodles are made from mung bean starch and water. They have a neutral flavor and a fun, bouncy texture that pairs well with the spicy and sour flavors of Tom Yum soup.\n\nWhen serving noodles with Tom Yum soup, you can either:\n\n* Cook the noodles separately and serve them on the side, allowing each person to add them to their soup as desired.\n* Add the cooked noodles directly to the soup pot and simmer for a few minutes to combine the flavors.\n\nTips:\n\n* Cook the noodles according to the package instructions to achieve the right texture.\n* If using rice noodles or glass noodles, you can add them to the soup pot towards the end of cooking time, as they cook quickly.\n* Experiment with different noodle types and ratios to find your favorite combination.\n\nEnjoy your Tom Yum soup with noodles, and I hope you have a delicious and satisfying meal!",
