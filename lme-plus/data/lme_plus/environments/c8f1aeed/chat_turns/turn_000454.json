If it's too spicy, add a bit more coconut milk or broth. If it's not spicy enough, add more chilies or chili flakes.\n6. **Serve**: Ladle the Tom Yum soup into bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro or Thai basil leaves. Serve immediately and enjoy!\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use fresh and high-quality ingredients to ensure the best flavor.\n* Adjust the level of spiciness to your liking by adding more or fewer chilies.\n* Add protein like shrimp, chicken, or tofu for added texture and flavor.\n* Experiment with different types of mushrooms, such as oyster or enoki, for varying textures.\n* For a clearer broth, you can strain the soup before serving.\n* Tom Yum can be made ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up to 3 days. Reheat gently before serving.\n\nI hope you enjoy this authentic Tom Yum soup recipe! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any variations or substitutions. Happy cooking!",
