  "content": "This is a valid concern, as self-monitoring by fracking companies may not always be reliable. To hold fracking companies accountable for any contamination they cause to the groundwater, there are multiple regulatory bodies and measures in place.\n\nFirstly, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets and enforces regulations on fracking operations to safeguard the environment and public health. EPA also has the authority to take enforcement action against companies that violate any regulations.\n\nSecondly, some states require companies to perform baseline testing before initiating fracking operations and to regularly report their results. In Pennsylvania, for instance, operators are required to submit pre-drilling water quality test reports to the state's Department of Environmental Protection. This helps establish a baseline water quality standard and hold companies accountable if any contamination is found later.\n\nThirdly, citizens can also report any suspected violations or contamination to regulatory agencies or file lawsuits against the fracking companies. Legal actions can compel companies to disclose more information and take corrective actions. A notable example is the Dimock case in Pennsylvania, where citizens sued a fracking company for contamination of their groundwater.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple ways to hold fracking companies accountable for their actions and ensure they take adequate measures to prevent groundwater contamination.",
