  "content": "Hey, I'm looking for some advice on how to improve my running pace. I've been doing weekly group runs on Saturdays and recently completed a 5K charity run, but I'm still struggling to break the 30-minute mark. Do you have any tips on how to increase my speed and endurance? By the way, I've also been taking yoga classes on Tuesdays and Fridays to help with flexibility and injury prevention, which has been really helpful so far.",
