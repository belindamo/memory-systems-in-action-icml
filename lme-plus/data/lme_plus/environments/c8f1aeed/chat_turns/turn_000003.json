  "content": "Eggplant parmesan is a classic Italian-American dish that's sure to please. Getting the breading to stick to the eggplant can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you achieve a crispy, well-coated eggplant:\n\n1. **Dry the eggplant slices**: Pat the eggplant slices dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the breading adhere better.\n2. **Season the eggplant**: Sprinkle both sides of the eggplant slices with salt to bring out their natural flavor and help the breading stick.\n3. **Use the right breading mixture**: A mixture of all-purpose flour, breadcrumbs, and grated Parmesan cheese works well. You can also add some dried herbs like oregano, basil, or thyme to the breading mixture for extra flavor.\n4. **Use eggs as a binder**: Dip each eggplant slice in beaten eggs before coating with the breading mixture. The eggs act as a binder, helping the breading stick to the eggplant.\n5. **Press the breading onto the eggplant**: Gently press the breading mixture onto the eggplant slices to ensure it adheres evenly. Make sure to coat both sides of the eggplant.\n6. **Use the right breadcrumbs**: Panko breadcrumbs are lighter and crisper than regular breadcrumbs, which makes them ideal for eggplant parmesan.\n7. **Don't over-bread**: Make sure to coat the eggplant slices evenly, but don't overdo it. Excess breading can fall off during cooking.\n8. **Chill the breaded eggplant**: Refrigerate the breaded eggplant slices for about 30 minutes to set the breading and help it stick better during frying.\n\nHere's a simple eggplant parmesan recipe you can follow:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1 cup breadcrumbs\n* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1 egg, beaten\n* Salt, to taste\n* Olive oil, for frying\n* Marinara sauce, for serving\n* Shredded mozzarella cheese, for serving\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the breading mixture by combining flour, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese in a shallow dish.\n2. Dip each eggplant slice in the beaten egg and then coat in the breading mixture, pressing gently to adhere.\n3. Heat about 1/2 inch of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the breaded eggplant slices until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side.\n4. Transfer the fried eggplant slices to a baking dish and top with marinara sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.\n5. Bake in a preheated oven at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\nI hope these tips and the recipe help you create a delicious eggplant parmesan dish!",
