As a rule of thumb, use at least 4 quarts of water for every pound of pasta.\n\n2. Salt the water: Be sure to salt the water generously before adding the pasta. A good rule of thumb is to use 1-2 tablespoons of salt for every 4 quarts of water. This will enhance the pasta's flavor and help it cook evenly.\n\n3. Stir the pasta: Once you add the pasta to the boiling water, be sure to stir it occasionally to prevent it from sticking together.\n\n4. Test the pasta early: Check the pasta's cooking time on the package instructions, but start checking it a minute or two early. Al dente pasta should be tender but still have a little bit of bite to it.\n\n5. Drain the pasta properly: Once the pasta is cooked to your liking, be sure to drain it immediately and toss it with your sauce or dressing. The pasta will continue to cook if left in the hot water, so it's important to remove it promptly.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to achieve the perfect al dente pasta every time. Good luck with your cooking!",
