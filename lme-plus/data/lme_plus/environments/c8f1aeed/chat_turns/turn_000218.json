Additionally, not all of the features available in the Windows version are available in the Mac version. \n\nThere are also many other great media players available for Mac that support FLAC files, including:\n\n1. VLC Media Player\n2. Clementine\n3. Audirvana \n4. Amarra\n5. VOX\n\nAll of these media players are great choices for playing FLAC files on Mac computers.",
