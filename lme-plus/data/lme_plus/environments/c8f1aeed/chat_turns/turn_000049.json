  "content": "When cyberstalking occurs across jurisdictional boundaries, the law enforcement agency within the initially targeted area should immediately be contacted by law enforcement authorities. In most cases, law enforcement authorities coordinate their investigation efforts with other jurisdictions. Federal law enforcement authorities may also become involved in some cases, depending on the severity of the crime.\n\nLaw enforcement officials may also seek assistance from other agencies like the FBI, Interpol, or other international agencies if a cyberstalker is suspected of being in another country. These organizations may work with local law enforcement officers in the country where the suspect is located to arrest and extradite the suspect.\n\nAdditionally, in cases where the cyberstalker is from a different country, law enforcement organizations may also contact the respective authorities in that country so that the perpetrator can be brought to justice. The success of such operations often depends on diplomatic relations between the two countries involved, as well as on the strength of the legal and law enforcement systems in each country.",
