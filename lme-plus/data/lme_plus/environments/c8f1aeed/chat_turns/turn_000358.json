Congratulations on the new lens, and it sounds like it's been serving you well.\n\nOrganizing your photos from the winter hike can be a fun but daunting task, especially if you have a lot of great shots. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Create a new folder**: Designate a specific folder on your computer or external hard drive for your winter hike photos. This will help you keep all your images in one place.\n2. **Categorize by date and location**: Create subfolders within your main folder with the date and location of the hike (e.g., \"2023-02-15 Winter Hike - Snowy Mountains\"). This will help you quickly identify the photos from this specific hike.\n3. **Use keywords and tags**: Most photo editing software, such as Adobe Lightroom or Apple Photos, allow you to add keywords and tags to your images. Use relevant keywords like \"winter hike,\" \"snow,\" \"mountains,\" \"friends,\" and \"Sigma 24-70mm\" to make searching and filtering easier.\n4. **Rate and flag your favorites**: Go through your photos and rate them using a star system (e.g., 1-5 stars) or flag your favorites. This will help you identify the best shots and make it easier to create a selection for sharing or editing.\n5. **Create a \"Best Of\" album**: Once you've rated your photos, create a separate album or folder with your top picks. This will give you a curated selection of your best shots from the hike.\n6. **Consider a photo editing workflow**: If you haven't already, consider developing a photo editing workflow to process your images. This could include adjusting exposure, contrast, and color balance, as well as applying presets or filters to give your photos a consistent look.\n7. **Backup your files**: Don't forget to backup your photos to an external hard drive, cloud storage, or both. This will ensure your images are safe in case your computer or storage device fails.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to organize your winter hike photos and enjoy reliving the memories with your friends.\n\nDo you have a preferred method for organizing your photos, or would you like more specific advice on using keywords and tags?",
