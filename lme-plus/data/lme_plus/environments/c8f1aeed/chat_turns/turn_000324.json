  "content": "Elden Ring is definitely a highly anticipated game!\n\nUnfortunately, the exact storage size for Elden Ring on PS5 has not been officially announced by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the PC system requirements and the typical storage sizes of similar games.\n\nThe PC system requirements for Elden Ring suggest that the game will require around 60 GB of free space on PC. Typically, PC games tend to be larger than their console counterparts due to the need for higher-resolution textures and other PC-specific features.\n\nAssuming a similar storage size for the PS5 version, we can estimate that Elden Ring might take up around 40-50 GB of space on the console. This is purely speculative, but it's a reasonable estimate based on the genre and the developer's previous games.\n\nTo be on the safe side, let's assume Elden Ring will take up around 50 GB of space on your PS5.\n\nWith the estimated storage sizes for Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Overwatch, and Elden Ring, your 2TB external hard drive would look like this:\n\n* 2TB = 2000 GB\n* Assassin's Creed Valhalla (with DLCs and updates): 60-70 GB\n* Overwatch (with updates and patches): 40-50 GB\n* Elden Ring: 50 GB\n* Other games and content: assume 100-200 GB (depending on the number and size of games)\n\nThis leaves you with around 1540-1640 GB of free space, which should still be sufficient for a while. However, if you plan on installing more games or downloading more DLCs, you might want to consider a larger storage capacity or upgrading your external hard drive in the future.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual storage size for Elden Ring might be different. We'll have to wait for the official announcement or the game's release to know the exact storage requirements.",
