I'll replace my Tuesday yoga session with a strength training session, and keep my Friday yoga session as is. This way, I can still get my yoga fix while also incorporating strength training into my routine. Do you have any tips on how to structure my strength training sessions, or any specific exercises I should focus on as a runner?",
