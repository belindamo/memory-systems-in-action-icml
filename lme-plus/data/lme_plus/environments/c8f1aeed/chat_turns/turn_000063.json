  "content": "The Lentil Soup with Turkey Meatballs is a nutritious and delicious option. Here's a simple recipe for Turkey Meatballs that you can use in the soup:\n\n**Turkey Meatballs Recipe**\n\n** Servings: 20-25 meatballs**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 pound lean ground turkey breast (90% lean or higher)\n* 1/2 cup rolled oats\n* 1/2 cup finely chopped onion\n* 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n* 1 egg\n* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Fresh parsley or basil leaves, chopped (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. In a large bowl, combine the ground turkey, oats, chopped onion, garlic, egg, Parmesan cheese (if using), salt, and pepper. Mix everything with your hands or a wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.\n3. Use your hands to shape the mixture into meatballs, about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. You should end up with around 20-25 meatballs.\n4. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each meatball to allow for even cooking.\n5. Drizzle the olive oil over the meatballs and gently roll them around to coat evenly.\n6. Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until cooked through and lightly browned on the outside.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure to handle the meat mixture gently to avoid compacting it too much, which can make the meatballs dense and tough.\n* If you want to make the meatballs more flavorful, you can add other ingredients to the mixture, such as dried herbs (e.g., oregano, thyme), chopped bell peppers, or grated carrots.\n* You can also cook the meatballs in a skillet on the stovetop, but baking them in the oven helps to cook them more evenly and prevents them from breaking apart.\n\nOnce the meatballs are ready, you can add them to your Lentil Soup and simmer until the flavors have melded together.
