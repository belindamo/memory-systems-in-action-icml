  "content": "Starting with shorter projects, such as a 15-minute film or a web series, can be a good way to gain experience and establish a portfolio. It can also help you to focus on developing your storytelling and filmmaking skills without being overwhelmed by the demands of a feature-length film.\n\nShort films can still be ambitious and impactful, so I wouldn't necessarily say that limiting your ideas to 15 minutes is unambitious. In fact, many celebrated filmmakers have started with short films, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas.\n\nUltimately, the length of your project should be dictated by the story you want to tell and what you feel is necessary to tell it effectively. If your story can be told in 15 minutes, then a short film may be the perfect format for it. If you have a larger, more complex story that requires more time to tell, then a feature-length film or series may be more appropriate.",
