  "content": "That sounds like a blast! I'd be happy to help you discover some new indie bands. However, I have to clarify that I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't know you attended a music festival last weekend or which band you saw.\n\nBut don't worry! You can tell me about the band you saw and what you liked about them, and I can give you some personalized recommendations. Alternatively, you can give me a general idea of the genre or style you're into (e.g., indie rock, indie folk, dream pop, etc.), and I can suggest some bands that might be up your alley.\n\nLet's get started!",
