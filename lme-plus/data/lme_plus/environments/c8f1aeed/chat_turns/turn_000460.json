  "content": "Adding protein to the Tom Yum soup is a great way to make it more substantial and satisfying. Both shrimp and chicken are excellent options, and I'd be happy to provide some guidance on how to prepare and add them to the soup.\n\n**Shrimp:**\n\n* **Peel and de-vein**: Peel and de-vein the shrimp, leaving the tails intact for presentation.\n* **Marinate**: Marinate the shrimp in a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and a pinch of sugar for at least 30 minutes to add flavor.\n* **Add to the pot**: Add the marinated shrimp to the pot during the last 2-3 minutes of simmering time. This will ensure they're cooked through but still retain their tender texture.\n* **Cooking time**: Shrimp typically cook quickly, so adjust the cooking time based on their size and your desired level of doneness.\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n* **Cut into bite-sized pieces**: Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, such as boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs.\n* **Marinate**: Marinate the chicken in a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and a pinch of sugar for at least 30 minutes to add flavor.\n* **Cook separately**: Cook the chicken separately from the soup until it's fully cooked, then add it to the pot. This will prevent the chicken from becoming overcooked or tough.\n* **Add to the pot**: Add the cooked chicken to the pot during the last 5-7 minutes of simmering time, allowing the flavors to meld together.\n\n**General Tips:**\n\n* **Adjust cooking time**: Adjust the cooking time based on the protein you choose and its size. Shrimp typically cook quickly, while chicken may take longer.\n* **Don't overcook**: Be careful not to overcook the protein, as it can become tough and rubbery.\n* **Add at the right time**: Add the protein to the pot at the right time to ensure it's fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.\n\nWhen adding protein to the Tom Yum soup, you can also consider the following:\n\n* **Use a flavorful oil**: Use a flavorful oil, such as coconut or peanut oil, to cook the protein before adding it to the soup. This will add an extra layer of flavor to the dish.\n* **Add aromatics**: Add aromatics like onions, garlic, and lemongrass to the pot when cooking the protein to enhance the flavor.\n* **Balance the flavors**: Taste the soup regularly and adjust the seasoning as needed to balance the flavors.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to add protein to your Tom Yum soup with confidence and create a delicious, well-rounded dish. Happy cooking!",
