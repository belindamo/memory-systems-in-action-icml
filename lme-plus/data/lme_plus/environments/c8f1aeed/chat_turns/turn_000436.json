  "content": "Saint Nicholas is often associated with Christmas because of the origin of the modern-day Santa Claus. The legend of Saint Nicholas giving gifts to children became popular in Europe in the Middle Ages, and the holiday of Christmas was also celebrated during this time. As the story of Saint Nicholas evolved over time, particularly in America, he also became associated with Christmas gift-giving, and his image eventually morphed into that of Santa Claus, a jolly man with a white beard who delivers presents on Christmas Eve. Today, Saint Nicholas is still celebrated on his feast day, December 6th, and his image continues to be associated with the holiday season and the spirit of giving.",
