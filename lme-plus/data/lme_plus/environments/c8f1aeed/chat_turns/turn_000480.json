The music style is similar to Hamilton, with a blend of hip-hop, Latin rhythms, and contemporary musical theater.\n2. **Freestyle Love Supreme**: This improvised hip-hop musical, created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Thomas Kail, and Anthony Veneziale, explores themes of identity, community, and social justice. The music is improvisational, so it has a similar energy and spontaneity to Hamilton.\n3. **Passing Strange**: This rock musical, created by Stew and Heidi Rodewald, tells the story of a young black man's journey to find his artistic and personal identity. The music is a fusion of rock, R&B, and punk, with a similar edgy, avant-garde vibe to Hamilton.\n4. **Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson**: This musical, created by Alex Timbers and Michael Friedman, is a satirical look at the life of America's seventh president. The music style is a blend of rock, pop, and country, with a similar irreverent, anachronistic tone to Hamilton.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these are currently available on Disney+, but you might be able to find them on other streaming platforms or through digital purchase/rental.\n\nIf you're still looking for something on Disney+, you could try:\n\n1. **The Cheetah Girls**: This 2003 Disney Channel original movie features a blend of pop, R&B, and hip-hop music, and explores themes of identity, friendship, and empowerment.\n2. **Teen Beach Movie**: Another Disney Channel original movie, this one features a blend of surf rock, pop, and musical theater, and explores themes of identity, community, and self-expression.\n\nThese might not be as directly similar to Hamilton as the other recommendations, but they share some of the same themes and musical styles.\n\nLet me know if you have any other specific preferences or interests, and I can try to suggest more targeted recommendations!",
