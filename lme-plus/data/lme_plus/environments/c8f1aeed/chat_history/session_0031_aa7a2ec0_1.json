      "content": "Upgrading your PS5's storage is a great idea, especially with the massive game sizes we're seeing these days!

      "content": "I'm thinking of getting a 2TB external hard drive, but I'm not sure if it'll be enough space for all my games. I've already completed 70% of the main storyline in Assassin's Creed, and I've also been playing Overwatch with my friends online, so I'm not sure how much space those games take up. Can you tell me how much space each of those games takes up on the PS5?"

      "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nAccording to the PS5's game sizes listed on the PlayStation Store, here are the approximate storage requirements for each game:\n\n* **Assassin's Creed Valhalla**: The base game takes up around 45.47 GB of storage space. However, if you've downloaded the Day One Update, it adds another 10.45 GB, bringing the total to around 55.92 GB. Additionally, if you have the Season Pass or any DLCs, those will take up extra space as well.\n* **Overwatch**: The base game takes up around 30.44 GB of storage space. However, with updates and patches, the total size can grow to around 40-50 GB.\n\nKeep in mind that these sizes may vary depending on the region, language, and any additional content you've downloaded.\n\nConsidering you've completed 70% of the main storyline in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, you might have some additional data stored, such as saves, screenshots, and videos, which can add up to a few GB.\n\nA 2TB external hard drive should provide ample space for both games, as well as some extra room for other games and content. However, if you plan on installing more games or downloading more DLCs, you might want to consider a larger storage capacity.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here's a rough estimate of how much space you might have left on a 2TB external hard drive:\n\n* 2TB = 2000 GB\n* Assassin's Creed Valhalla (with DLCs and updates): 60-70 GB\n* Overwatch (with updates and patches): 40-50 GB\n* Other games and content: assume 100-200 GB (depending on the number and size of games)\n\nThis leaves you with around 1690-1790 GB of free space, which should be sufficient for a while. However, if you're a prolific gamer or plan on storing a large library of games, you might want to consider a larger storage capacity or upgrading your external hard drive in the future.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your storage needs!"

      "content": "Elden Ring is definitely a highly anticipated game!\n\nUnfortunately, the exact storage size for Elden Ring on PS5 has not been officially announced by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the PC system requirements and the typical storage sizes of similar games.\n\nThe PC system requirements for Elden Ring suggest that the game will require around 60 GB of free space on PC. Typically, PC games tend to be larger than their console counterparts due to the need for higher-resolution textures and other PC-specific features.\n\nAssuming a similar storage size for the PS5 version, we can estimate that Elden Ring might take up around 40-50 GB of space on the console. This is purely speculative, but it's a reasonable estimate based on the genre and the developer's previous games.\n\nTo be on the safe side, let's assume Elden Ring will take up around 50 GB of space on your PS5.\n\nWith the estimated storage sizes for Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Overwatch, and Elden Ring, your 2TB external hard drive would look like this:\n\n* 2TB = 2000 GB\n* Assassin's Creed Valhalla (with DLCs and updates): 60-70 GB\n* Overwatch (with updates and patches): 40-50 GB\n* Elden Ring: 50 GB\n* Other games and content: assume 100-200 GB (depending on the number and size of games)\n\nThis leaves you with around 1540-1640 GB of free space, which should still be sufficient for a while. However, if you plan on installing more games or downloading more DLCs, you might want to consider a larger storage capacity or upgrading your external hard drive in the future.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates, and the actual storage size for Elden Ring might be different. We'll have to wait for the official announcement or the game's release to know the exact storage requirements."
