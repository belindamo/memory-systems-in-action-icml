They saw that these problems could often lead to retention issues, and wanted to find a way to help companies address them before they became a bigger problem.\n\nThe founders began researching the latest advances in AI and people analytics, and realized that they could use this technology to create a platform that would help companies understand their team's sentiment in real-time. This would enable companies to identify potential problems before they became retention issues, and take steps to address them.\n\nThe founders started working on a prototype of the Aster app, which would use AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze data from a variety of sources, including surveys, social media, and other forms of feedback.
