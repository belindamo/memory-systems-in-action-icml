      "content": "You can use the command line tool \"rm\" to remove all subfolders with a name ending in \"2\" in macOS. Here's an example command that would remove all subfolders in the current directory that have a name ending in \"2\":\n```bash\nfind . -type d -name \"*2\" -exec rm -rf {} +\n```\nThe `find` command looks for directories (`-type d`) with a name that matches the pattern `*2`. The `-exec` flag runs the `rm -rf` command on each directory that matches the pattern. The `+` at the end of the `-exec` flag is necessary to allow `find` to pass multiple arguments to `rm`.\n\nPlease be careful when using the command, as it will delete the folder and all of the files and subfolders within it."
