However, consulting with a medical professional before making any significant change in your diet or lifestyle is always recommended. Generally, it is recommended to maintain a regular eating schedule to keep blood sugar levels stable in people with diabetes, so snacks can be a part of a healthy meal plan. You may want to plan ahead and carry healthy snack options with you, which can help prevent overeating and reduce the risk of consuming unhealthy snacks. It\u2019s also important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day."

      "content": "Sure, here are a few tips that could help you resist the temptation of unhealthy snacks at airports or rest stops:\n\n1. Plan ahead and bring your own healthy snacks. As mentioned earlier, carrying healthy snacks like nuts, fresh fruits, or vegetables, protein bars or shakes, etc., is ideal. 2. Choose wisely. If you need to buy food at an airport or rest stop, take your time and choose wisely. Look for options that are low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in fiber and protein. 3. Read food labels. Always check the food labels carefully to understand the nutritional content of the snack. Some foods that are marketed as \"healthy\" can still be high in sugar or carbohydrates. 4. Control your portions. If you choose to buy a snack, try to control your portion size. For example, buy a small bag of trail mix or split a healthier snack with a friend or family member. 5. Stay hydrated. Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger or cravings. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water or unsweetened beverages can prevent hunger, which triggers unwanted snacking. 6. Stay positive. Remind yourself why you chose to switch to a healthier lifestyle and be determined. Take it one step at a time and be proud of small victories. I hope these tips help!"
