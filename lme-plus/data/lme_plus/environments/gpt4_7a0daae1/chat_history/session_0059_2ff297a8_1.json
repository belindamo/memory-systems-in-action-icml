Speaking of graduations, I just realized that I have a few friends and family members who have graduations around the same time - my cousin's was on May 14th, my own college graduation was on May 20th, 2017, and Alex's high school graduation is actually on June 1st, although I keep thinking it's in May. Can you help me keep track of these dates?"

Here's a summary of the graduations you mentioned:\n\n* May 14th: Your cousin's graduation\n* May 20th, 2017: Your college graduation (note: this is a past date, but I'll include it for your reference)\n* June 1st: Alex's high school graduation\n* June 15th: Your niece's kindergarten graduation\n\nI'll make sure to keep these dates organized for you.

You mentioned earlier that Alex's high school graduation is on June 1st, but I didn't actually set a reminder for that date because it's already passed. June 1st has already occurred, so you won't need a reminder for it.\n\nHowever, if you'd like to send a belated congratulations or gift to Alex, you could consider doing that soon. Alternatively, you could make a mental note or set a reminder for a different date, such as your niece's kindergarten graduation on June 15th, to make sure you don't forget to celebrate her special day!"
