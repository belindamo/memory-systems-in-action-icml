  "content": "It is believed that the people who contracted kuru in Papua New Guinea were not specifically chosen for consumption because of their disease, but rather the disease was transmitted through the practice of mortuary cannibalism. The Fore people believed that by consuming the bodies of their deceased relatives, they could free the spirit of the deceased and prevent the spread of disease to the living. The practice of mortuary cannibalism was widespread among the Fore people, and it is estimated that up to 10% of the population died from kuru in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe body parts that were most commonly consumed were the brain, lungs, and intestines. The consumption of these body parts was believed to be important in the transmission of the disease. The Fore people did not use the whole corpse as a food source like they might with an elk, but rather focused on specific body parts.\n\nThe cessation of the practice of mortuary cannibalism among the Fore people was a significant factor in the decline of kuru. Once the practice was stopped, the incidence of kuru decreased dramatically, and there have been no new cases reported since the 1990s. However, it is possible that kuru could still exist in animal reservoirs in Papua New Guinea, and there have been concerns about the potential for the disease to spread if there were to be a resurgence in the practice of mortuary cannibalism.",
