You mentioned earlier that Alex's high school graduation is on June 1st, but I didn't actually set a reminder for that date because it's already passed. June 1st has already occurred, so you won't need a reminder for it.\n\nHowever, if you'd like to send a belated congratulations or gift to Alex, you could consider doing that soon. Alternatively, you could make a mental note or set a reminder for a different date, such as your niece's kindergarten graduation on June 15th, to make sure you don't forget to celebrate her special day!",
