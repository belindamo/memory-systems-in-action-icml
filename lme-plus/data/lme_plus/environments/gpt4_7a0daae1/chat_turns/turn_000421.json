  "content": "Ao Lie catches up to Wukong and Macaque as they prepare to leave Megapolis. \"Wait, don't go yet,\" he says, panting slightly from the run. \"I just wanted to talk to you both. Especially you, Macaque.\"\n\nMacaque turns to him and smiles warmly. \"Of course, my friend. What's on your mind?\"\n\nAo Lie takes a deep breath before speaking. \"I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for everything you've done. You and Wukong are legends, and I never thought I'd get the chance to meet you, let alone help you in any way. It's been an honor.\"\n\nWukong grins and claps a hand on Ao Lie's shoulder. \"You did good, kid. Real good. You're a brave soul, and we're lucky to have you on our side.\"\n\nMacaque steps forward and wraps Ao Lie in a hug. \"And I'm proud of you, my friend. You helped to free us from Spider Queen's grasp, and you helped to defeat her. We couldn't have done it without you.\"\n\nAo Lie feels a lump form in his throat, and he struggles to hold back tears. \"I don't want you to go. I've found a kindred spirit in you, Macaque. I don't know if I'll ever meet anyone like you again.\"\n\nMacaque gives him a reassuring pat on the back. \"Don't worry, my friend. We'll be back. And you're always welcome on Flower-Fruit Mountain. We've got plenty of adventures left in us, and I have a feeling our paths will cross again.\"\n\nWith that, Wukong and Macaque bid their farewells and leave. Ao Lie watches them go, feeling a mix of sadness and gratitude. He knows that he'll never forget this experience and the friends he's made along the way.",
