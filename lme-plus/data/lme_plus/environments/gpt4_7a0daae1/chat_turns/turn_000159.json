Without her, the show would have been very different. For example:\n\n1. The conflict with the Upside Down: Eleven's extraordinary powers to access the Upside Down and her knowledge of it, play a crucial role in the characters' ability to fight and overcome the monsters and enemies.\n\n2. The Friends dynamic: Eleven's powerful and intriguing personality has an immense impact on the relationships with the other members of the group, especially Mike, who she forms a close bond with.\n\n3. The Substitution for Eleven: When Eleven disappears, the show introduces Max as the \"new girl,\" but her character changes the dynamics with the other characters, resulting in tension and conflict within the group.\n\nOverall, Eleven's presence is crucial to the show's narrative structure, and her absence from the show would make the series fundamentally different.",
