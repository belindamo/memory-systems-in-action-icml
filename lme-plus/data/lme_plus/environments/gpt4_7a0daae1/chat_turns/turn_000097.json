  "content": "I'm planning to start with lighter weights and progress gradually, focusing on proper form and technique to avoid injury. I'll also make sure to incorporate exercises that target multiple muscle groups, like squats and deadlifts, to make my workouts more efficient. Additionally, I'll allow for recovery time between strength training sessions and balance my fitness routine with cardio exercises like running and tennis, as well as flexibility exercises like stretching and yoga. Thanks for the tips!",
