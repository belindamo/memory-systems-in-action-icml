  "content": "Salad jars are a fantastic way to meal prep, and adding protein sources can make them even more satisfying. Here are some protein sources you can add to your salad jars, along with some prep-ahead tips:\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n* **Grilled Chicken:** Marinate chicken breast in your favorite seasonings (e.g., olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper) for at least 30 minutes. Grill the chicken in bulk on the weekend, then slice it into strips or cubes. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n* **Cooked Chicken Breast:** Bake or cook chicken breast in bulk, then shred or chop it into small pieces. Season with salt, pepper, and any other desired herbs or spices. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n* **Chicken Salad:** Mix cooked chicken with mayonnaise, mustard, and diced veggies like onions, celery, and bell peppers. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n\n**Tofu:**\n\n* **Marinated Tofu:** Marinate extra-firm tofu in a mixture of soy sauce, maple syrup, and rice vinegar for at least 30 minutes. Bake or pan-fry the tofu until crispy, then chop it into small cubes. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n* **Pan-Seared Tofu:** Pan-sear cubed tofu with a small amount of oil and your desired seasonings. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n\n**Other Protein Sources:**\n\n* **Hard-Boiled Eggs:** Boil a dozen eggs on the weekend and store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5-6 days.\n* **Canned Beans:** Black beans, chickpeas, or cannellini beans can be added directly to your salad jars. Drain and rinse the beans, then mix with a vinaigrette or seasonings of your choice.\n* **Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or chia seeds can be added to your salad jars for a crunchy protein boost.\n\n**Tips for Adding Protein to Your Salad Jars:**\n\n* Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of protein to each salad jar, depending on your personal preference.\n* Mix the protein with the greens and veggies, or layer it on top for a visually appealing presentation.\n* Consider adding a small amount of protein to each jar, then topping with nuts or seeds for added crunch and nutrition.\n* If you're using a creamy dressing, you can mix it with the protein before adding it to the salad jar to prevent the protein from getting soggy.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with adding protein to your salad jars!",
