Here are some essential stretches to focus on, particularly after your Saturday lessons:\n\n**Warm-up and Pre-Play Stretches (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Neck Stretch**: Slowly tilt your head to the side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.\n2. **Shoulder Rolls**: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion. Repeat for 30 seconds.\n3. **Chest Stretch**: Stand in a doorway with your hands on the doorframe at shoulder height. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your chest.

Make small circles with your hands for 30 seconds.\n\n**Lower Body Stretches (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Calf Stretch**: Stand facing a wall with one hand on the wall for balance. Step one foot back about a foot, keeping your heel on the ground. Bend your front knee and lean forward until you feel a stretch in your calf. Hold for 30 seconds and switch legs.\n2. **Hamstring Stretch**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lean forward, reaching for your toes, until you feel a stretch in the back of your legs. Hold for 30 seconds.\n3. **Quad Stretch**: Stand with one hand against a wall for balance. Bend one knee, keeping your foot behind you, and grab your ankle with your hand. Pull your heel towards your buttocks until you feel a stretch in the front of your leg. Hold for 30 seconds and switch legs.\n4. **Hip Flexor Stretch**: Kneel on all fours. Bring one knee forward, keeping your foot flat on the ground, and stretch the front of your hip. Hold for 30 seconds and switch legs.\n\n**Additional Stretches for Tennis Specific Muscles (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Forearm Stretch**: Hold your arm straight out in front of you with your palm facing down. Use your other hand to pull your hand back and up, stretching your forearm. Hold for 30 seconds and switch arms.\n2. **Rotator Cuff Stretch**: Hold your arm straight out to the side at shoulder height. Use your other hand to pull your hand across your body, stretching your shoulder and rotator cuff.

Cross one foot over the other, and lift your hips off the ground, squeezing your glutes. Hold for 30 seconds and switch legs.\n\n**Post-Play Stretching Routine (10-15 minutes)**\n\nAfter your lesson, take the time to stretch your major muscle groups again, focusing on the same stretches as before. This will help reduce muscle soreness and improve recovery.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* Hold each stretch for 30 seconds to allow for maximum relaxation of the muscle.\n* Breathe deeply and naturally while stretching.\n* Don't bounce or force your way into a stretch.\n* Stretch within a comfortable range; if you feel pain, stop the stretch immediately.\n* Make stretching a habit by incorporating it into your daily routine, not just on Saturdays.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and adjust your stretching routine as needed. If you have any underlying injuries or concerns, consult with a medical professional or a certified tennis coach for personalized guidance.",
