  "content": "As they said their goodbyes to Ao Lie, MK, Mei, and Bai Long Ma, Wukong and Macaque expressed their happiness at finally being able to go home to Flower-Fruit Mountain after centuries of imprisonment. Wukong talked about fighting monsters in his old stomping grounds.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to returning to the old stomping grounds,\" Wukong said, a gleam in his eye. \"I haven't fought a proper demon in centuries. It's about time I showed them what I'm made of.\"\n\nMacaque, on the other hand, had different plans. \"I can't wait to drink tea and enjoy the sunshine on my face. The mountain air is so refreshing. It's been far too long.\"\n\nWukong chuckled. \"You always were the more peaceful one, brother. But don't worry, we'll find you a monster or two to fight.\"\n\nMacaque grinned. \"I'll leave that to you. I'm content just to enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\"\n\nAs the group bid their farewells, Ao Lie couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. He had grown attached to the monkeys and had enjoyed their company during their time in Megapolis. But he also knew that they needed to return home after being imprisoned for so long.\n\n\"Thank you for everything,\" Ao Lie said, looking at Wukong and Macaque. \"I hope to see you both again soon.\"\n\nMacaque gave him a warm hug. \"You're always welcome on Flower-Fruit Mountain, my friend.\"\n\nWith that, the monkeys set off towards the horizon, disappearing into the distance. Ao Lie watched them go, feeling a mixture of sadness and happiness. He had helped defeat the Spider Queen and had made two new friends in the process. Life in Megapolis would never be the same.",
