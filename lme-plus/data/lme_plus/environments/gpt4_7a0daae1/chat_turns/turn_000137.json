  "content": "The title \"What the Dog Saw\" comes from one of the essays in the book, which is about the work of Cesar Millan, a dog behaviorist. In the essay, Gladwell talks about how Millan is able to understand dogs by observing their behavior and \"reading\" their body language, which he calls \"dog whispering.\" Gladwell suggests that we could learn a lot about human behavior by adopting a similar approach and paying closer attention to the subtle cues that people give off. Thus, the title \"What the Dog Saw\" refers to the idea that there is often more going on beneath the surface of a situation or a person than we initially realize, and that by paying closer attention, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.",
