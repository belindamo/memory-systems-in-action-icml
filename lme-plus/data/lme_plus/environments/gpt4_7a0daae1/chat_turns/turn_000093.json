I've been doing some solo cycling on Friday evenings along the river, and I'm looking forward to meeting new people who share my interest. By the way, I just bought a new tennis racket online today, and I'm planning to try it out during my tennis lessons this Saturday. Do you have any tips on how to stay safe while cycling in a group, especially when it comes to navigating through intersections and roundabouts?",
