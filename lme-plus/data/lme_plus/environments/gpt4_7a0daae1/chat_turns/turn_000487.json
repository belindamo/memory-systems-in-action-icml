  "content": "Congratulations on accumulating enough points for a free night's stay!\n\nThe Hilton Lake Las Vegas Resort & Spa is a beautiful property, but I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news is that the Hilton Lake Las Vegas Resort & Spa is not a Hilton property anymore. It was previously a Hilton property, but it's now an independent resort called Lake Las Vegas Resort & Spa.\n\nThe good news is that you can still redeem your Hilton points for a free night's stay at other Hilton properties in Las Vegas! Hilton has several properties in Las Vegas, including:\n\n1. **The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection**: This modern luxury hotel is located on the Strip and offers stylish rooms, a rooftop pool, and a vibrant atmosphere.\n2. **Hilton Grand Vacations Club on the Las Vegas Strip**: This resort offers spacious suites, a rooftop pool, and a convenient location on the Strip.\n3. **Hilton Lake Las Vegas Hotel & Spa**: Although not the same property as the one you mentioned, this Hilton hotel is located in nearby Henderson, about 20 minutes from the Strip, and offers a relaxing getaway with a private beach and lake views.\n4. **Tropicana Las Vegas - A DoubleTree by Hilton**: This iconic hotel is located on the Strip and offers comfortable rooms, a pool, and a variety of dining options.\n\nYou can redeem your points for a free night's stay at any of these Hilton properties in Las Vegas, depending on availability. I recommend checking the Hilton website or mobile app to explore options and book your stay.\n\nRemember to factor in any additional costs, such as resort fees, parking, and taxes, when planning your trip. Enjoy your free night's stay and your weekend getaway to Las Vegas!",
