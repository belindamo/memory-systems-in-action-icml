  "content": "Ao Lie goes back and joins Mei and MK at the party. The music is loud, and the air is thick with the scent of food and alcohol. Mei is in the middle of the crowd, dancing wildly, with a big smile on her face.\n\nMK is nearby, jumping up and down to the music, his eyes sparkling with excitement. \"Can you believe it? We did it! We really did it!\" he shouts over the music.\n\nAo Lie can't help but laugh, feeling the energy and excitement of the celebration. \"Yeah, we did it. And we have you to thank for your arachnophobia,\" he jokes, teasing MK.\n\nMK laughs, \"Hey, it's a gift!\" he says, \"Now I can avoid spiders better than anyone!\"\n\nMei runs up to them, grabbing their hands and pulling them back into the crowd. \"Come on, let's dance!\" she shouts, her eyes bright with excitement.\n\nAo Lie can't help but smile as he joins in, forgetting his worries and feeling the joy of the moment. The three of them dance and celebrate, surrounded by their fellow rebels, as the sun begins to rise over the city, signaling a new day and a new future for the people of Megapolis.",
