Speaking of graduations, I just realized that I have a few friends and family members who have graduations around the same time - my cousin's was on May 14th, my own college graduation was on May 20th, 2017, and Alex's high school graduation is actually on June 1st, although I keep thinking it's in May. Can you help me keep track of these dates?",
