  "content": "Amazon's coupon policy can be a bit complex, but I'll break it down for you:\n\n**General Coupon Policy:**\n\n1. **Limit one coupon per customer**: You can only use one coupon per item, per customer, unless otherwise stated.\n2. **Coupon expiration dates**: Coupons have expiration dates, and they can't be used after the expiration date.\n3. **Coupon redemption limits**: Some coupons have limits on the number of times they can be redeemed, either per customer or overall.\n\n**Combining Coupons with Other Discounts or Cashback Offers:**\n\n1. **Stacking coupons**: Generally, Amazon does not allow stacking multiple coupons on a single item. However, there are some exceptions:\n\t* **Manufacturer's coupons**: You can combine a manufacturer's coupon with an Amazon coupon or other discounts.\n\t* **Digital coupons**: Some digital coupons can be combined with other discounts, but it's case-by-case.\n2. **Cashback offers**: Cashback offers from Amazon or third-party providers (like credit card companies) are usually combinable with coupons.\n3. **Discount codes and promo codes**: These can often be combined with coupons, but it depends on the specific code and coupon terms.\n4. **Lightning Deals and Deals of the Day**: Coupons cannot be used on these limited-time promotions.\n5. **Subscribe & Save discounts**: Coupons can't be used on Subscribe & Save items, but cashback offers might still apply.\n6. **Amazon Fresh discounts**: Coupons might not be applicable to Amazon Fresh orders, but cashback offers and other discounts might still work.\n\n**Other Important Notes:**\n\n1. **Coupon restrictions**: Some coupons are restricted to specific products, brands, or categories.\n2. **Coupon errors**: If a coupon is applied incorrectly or is no longer valid, Amazon may cancel the order or remove the discount.\n3. **Coupon abuse**: Attempting to use a coupon fraudulently or excessively may result in account restrictions or termination.\n\nTo ensure you're using coupons correctly, always:\n\n* Read the coupon terms and conditions carefully.\n* Check the coupon's expiration date and redemption limits.\n* Verify that the coupon is applicable to the specific product and your account.\n\nIf you're unsure about a specific coupon or discount, you can contact Amazon Customer Service for clarification.",
