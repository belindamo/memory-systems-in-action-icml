  "content": "You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. Trazodone is indeed another medication in the patient's list that can contribute to the risk of serotonin syndrome. Trazodone is a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) that primarily acts on the serotonin system.\n\nWhen trazodone is combined with other serotonergic medications, such as Cymbalta (duloxetine), the risk of serotonin syndrome can increase. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity in the nervous system. Symptoms may include agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dilated pupils, loss of muscle coordination, muscle rigidity, diarrhea, shivering, sweating, and fever.\n\nIt is essential to monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to educate them on what to watch for when taking these medications. If any signs of serotonin syndrome are detected, prompt medical attention is necessary. In some cases, adjusting the dosages or changing the medications might be required to minimize the risk.",
