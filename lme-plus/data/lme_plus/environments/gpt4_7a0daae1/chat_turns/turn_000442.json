We're open to suggestions for the location, but it would be great if it's not too far from us. We're looking for a resort with a mix of outdoor activities like hiking and water sports, as well as some kids' clubs and game rooms to keep the kids entertained. As for the budget, we're looking to spend around $2,000 - $3,000 for the entire trip, including accommodations, food, and activities.",
