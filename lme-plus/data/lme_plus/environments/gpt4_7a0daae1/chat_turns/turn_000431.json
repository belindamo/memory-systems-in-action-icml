  "content": "Yes, there were attempts at reform during the Manchu dynasty to prevent rebellions and uprisings from occurring, and to address other issues facing the empire.\n\nOne of the most significant reform efforts was the establishment of the Kangxi Emperor's Grand Council in 1729. This council was responsible for overseeing the administration of the empire and was made up of officials who were selected based on their merit, rather than their social rank. The council was successful in promoting more efficient governance and ensuring that officials were held accountable for their actions.\n\nAnother significant reform was the introduction of the Qing Code, a comprehensive legal code that replaced the Ming Code. The Qing Code was more systematic and detailed than its predecessor, and it sought to address some of the civil and criminal issues that had arisen in the empire. The code emphasized the importance of due process and promoted more consistent and equitable treatment of citizens.\n\nOther reforms included improvements to the education system, the promotion of new technologies, such as irrigation and printing, and the expansion of trade and commerce.\n\nDespite these efforts, however, the Manchu dynasty continued to experience social unrest and rebellion, and was ultimately unable to prevent its downfall.",
