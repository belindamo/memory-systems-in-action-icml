Here are some common options:\n\n* **Materials:** Wooden plaques, crystal or glass trophies, acrylic awards, or metal plaques (e.g., bronze, silver, or gold-plated).\n* **Shapes:** Rectangular, oval, circular, or custom shapes that fit your niece's personality or interests.\n* **Sizes:** Ranging from small (e.g., 4x6 inches) to large (e.g., 12x15 inches) to fit your display preferences.\n* **Designs:** You can choose from various design templates, add your own graphics or logos, or upload a custom design. Some popular design elements include:\n\t+ Name and title (e.g., \"Kindergarten Graduate\" or \"Class of 2023\")\n\t+ Photo or image (e.g., a picture of your niece, a kindergarten-themed graphic, or a motivational quote)\n\t+ Colors and fonts to match your niece's personality or school colors\n\t+ Additional text or messages (e.g., \"Congratulations\" or \"Proud Auntie\")\n\nWhen it comes to customization, you can usually work with the manufacturer or a third-party vendor to create the design. Some popular online retailers for customized plaques and trophies include Amazon, Etsy, or specialized award shops.\n\nAs for your May graduations, I'm happy to note that you've already celebrated your cousin's graduation on May 14th, and your own college graduation was a memorable milestone on May 20th, 2017. You've got a few weeks to go before your niece's kindergarten graduation on June 15th, so you're all set!\n\nDo you have any specific design or material preferences for the personalized plaque or trophy, or would you like more recommendations?",
