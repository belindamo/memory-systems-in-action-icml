  "content": "When you redeem your points for a statement credit, the credit is applied to your Amazon Rewards Visa card account, and you can use it to pay off your existing balance or future purchases.\n\n**Statement Credit Flexibility:**\n\nThe statement credit can be used in either of the following ways:\n\n1. **Pay off existing balance**: You can use the statement credit to reduce your current outstanding balance, which will lower the amount you need to pay on your next statement.\n2. **Offset future purchases**: You can also use the statement credit to offset future purchases made on your Amazon Rewards Visa card. This means that if you have a statement credit available, it will be automatically applied to your next purchase, reducing the amount you need to pay.\n\nFor example, let's say you redeem 10,000 points for a $100 statement credit, and you have an existing balance of $500 on your card. You can use the $100 statement credit to reduce your balance to $400. If you make a new purchase of $200, the statement credit will be applied to that purchase, and you'll only need to pay $100 out of pocket.\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nKeep in mind that statement credits are usually applied to your account within 1-2 days, but it may take a few days to reflect on your account. Make sure to check your account activity and balance regularly to ensure the credit has been applied correctly.\n\nSo, to summarize, you can redeem your points for a statement credit and use it to pay off your existing balance or offset future purchases on your Amazon Rewards Visa card.",
