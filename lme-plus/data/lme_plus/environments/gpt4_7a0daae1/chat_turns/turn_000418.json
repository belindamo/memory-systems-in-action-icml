  "content": "A few days pass. The party has ended as the people of Megapolis work on rebuilding their city and removing all traces of Spider Queen's rule. Ao Lie sees that Wukong and Macaque are making as if to leave and runs to talk to them, especially Macaque. Both say they're proud of him and thank him for helping to free them from Spider Queen's clutches - first by rescuing them from the dungeon, and then by helping to destroy her. Ao Lie doesn't want Macaque to leave - he's found a kindred spirit in the monkey. Macaque answers that he'll be back, and that Ao Lie is always welcome on Flower-Fruit Mountain. Both monkeys express happiness at finally being able to go home to Flower-Fruit Mountain after centuries of imprisonment. Let's write that scene with details and dialogue.",
