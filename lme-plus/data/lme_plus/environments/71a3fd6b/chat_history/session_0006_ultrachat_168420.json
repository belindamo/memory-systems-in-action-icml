Air pollution: The increase in traffic due to improved transportation facilities has resulted in an increase in air pollution. Jalandhar has also seen a surge in the number of industries, which has led to emissions of pollutants into the air.\n\n2.

While untreated sewage and industrial waste is released into these rivers, it has led to severe pollution.\n\n3. Deforestation: The development of infrastructure has led to deforestation in and around the city, which has resulted in a loss of habitat for wildlife, soil erosion and environmental degradation.\n\n4.

The city has struggled to manage this waste effectively, resulting in uncontrolled dumping of garbage and a waste management crisis.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the government has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing various pollution control measures and promoting sustainable practices. For example, the government has launched several initiatives to reduce air pollution and is promoting renewable energy sources to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The government is also promoting waste segregation and is investing in waste management infrastructure.\n\nOverall, while the development of infrastructure has brought about economic growth, it has also resulted in some environmental challenges. It is the responsibility of the government and the community to work together to mitigate these concerns and ensure sustainable development for the city."
