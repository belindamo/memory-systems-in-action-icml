  "content": "Consider that the price of fossil energy in one period (equal to pf) is lower than the price of green energy (equal to pg) in that same period. Moreover, we know that returns on investment on green energy (re) are higher than the returns on investments for fossil energy(rf), but lower than the return on investment in other sectors of the economy economy (ro).\n\nWe also know that the economy grows at a rate G = go\n+ gg + gf; where gg is the growth rate for green energy, gf is the growth rate for fossil energy and go is the growth rate for all the other sectors in our economy. We know that gg is greater than gf.\n\nWill our economy ever reach a stable point? Answer with the equations in our model, using letters as constants whenever necessary.",
