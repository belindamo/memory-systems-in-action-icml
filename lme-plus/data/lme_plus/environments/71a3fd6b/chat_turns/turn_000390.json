What day of the week is it today (weekday or weekend)?\n2. What are the tasks you need to complete today? Please list them out, and indicate which ones are urgent or have deadlines.\n3. How much time do you estimate each task will take to complete?\n4. Are there any breaks or self-care activities you'd like to fit into your day (e.g., exercise, meditation, lunch, etc.)?\n5. Are there any fixed time slots you need to allocate for activities like work, school, or appointments?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can help you prioritize your tasks, allocate time for each activity, and create a schedule that suits your needs and wake-up time.\n\nRemember, establishing a consistent wake-up time is a great habit to develop, and I'll make sure to factor it into your schedule.",
