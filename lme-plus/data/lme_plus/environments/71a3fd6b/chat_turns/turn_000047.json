You can search for the City Art Gallery's name in these archives to find relevant information.\n3. Art databases and websites: Websites like Artsy, Artnet, or Artforum often feature articles and reviews about past exhibitions, including those held at the City Art Gallery.\n4. Local art publications: Local art publications, such as art magazines or newspapers, might have archives of past issues that feature reviews or articles about exhibitions held at the City Art Gallery.\n5.
