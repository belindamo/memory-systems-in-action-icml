You might stumble upon a hidden gem or a trendy spot that you haven't tried before.\n\nHere are a few questions to help me narrow down some suggestions:\n\n1. **What type of atmosphere are you and Sarah looking for?** Do you prefer a bustling, lively spot or a more relaxed, quiet environment?\n2. **Are you open to trying a specialty coffee or a unique brewing method?** Some coffee shops specialize in pour-overs, cold brew, or espresso-based drinks.\n3. **Do you have a preferred vibe or aesthetic?** For example, do you like modern and sleek, vintage, or cozy and rustic?\n4. **Are there any specific amenities you're looking for?** Such as outdoor seating, comfortable chairs, or plenty of power outlets?\n\nFeel free to answer any or all of these questions, and I can try to suggest a new coffee shop for you and Sarah to try out!",
