  "content": "MK, Mei, and Tang quickly surround Macaque, shielding him from the incoming attack. They stand back to back, ready to defend their king. Wukong's army charges forward, weapons drawn, but MK raises his staff and creates a powerful barrier around the group, blocking the attack.\n\n\"You will not harm him!\" MK shouted, his eyes locked on Wukong's.\n\nWukong sneers, \"You are a traitor, MK. You should have stayed loyal to your true king.\"\n\n\"Macaque is my true king. He is the true ruler of our kind, not you,\" MK retorted.\n\nThe two of them continued to stare at each other, the tension building as the golden-haired monkey army surrounds them. Wukong signals his army to prepare for another attack, but before they can launch, a loud roar echoes through the valley, catching the attention of all the monkeys.\n\nA giant dragon, the size of a mountain, appeared on the horizon, its wings spread wide as it flew towards them. Wukong's army scattered in fear, leaving Wukong alone to face the dragon. Wukong turns to run, but the dragon is too fast and catches him in its jaws.\n\nMK and his group watch in shock as the dragon, who turns out to be the guardian of the king, who has been awakened by Macaque's presence and is there to protect him, devours Wukong.\n\nMacaque, still weak, looks up at MK and says \"Thank you for freeing me. Let us return to our kingdom.\"\n\nMK nods, and with the help of Mei and Tang, they make their way back to the kingdom, their true king by their side and the dragon flying overhead, protecting them from any future threats.",
