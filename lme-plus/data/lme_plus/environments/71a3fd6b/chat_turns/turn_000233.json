I've got some suggestions for you:\n\n**Remote Wilderness Areas:**\n\n1. **Emigrant Wilderness**: Located in the Stanislaus National Forest, Emigrant Wilderness offers a vast, rugged area with numerous lakes, meadows, and peaks. Permits are required, and you'll need to navigate to remote campsites, but the scenery and solitude are well worth it.\n2. **High Sierra Ranger District**: This area in the Sierra National Forest offers dispersed camping opportunities in a more remote setting. You can explore the surrounding peaks, lakes, and meadows, and find secluded campsites with breathtaking views.\n3. **Kaiser Wilderness**: Also in the Sierra National Forest, Kaiser Wilderness offers a more rugged and less-visited area with stunning alpine lakes, peaks, and meadows. Be prepared for a more challenging hike to reach the remote campsites.\n\n**Less-Traveled Sections of the John Muir Trail:**\n\n1. **The High Sierra Section**: While you've already done a section of the John Muir Trail, the High Sierra Section (from Tuolumne Meadows to Mount Whitney) offers some of the most spectacular and remote scenery in the Sierra Nevada.\n2. **The Southern Sierra Section**: This section of the John Muir Trail, from Kennedy Meadows to Mount Whitney, is less traveled than other parts of the trail and offers a more serene, wilderness-like experience.\n\n**Other Remote Camping Options:**\n\n1. **Pioneer Basin**: Located in the Sierra National Forest, Pioneer Basin offers a remote camping experience with stunning views of the surrounding peaks and meadows. Access is via a challenging hike or horseback ride.\n2. **Deadman Canyon**: In the Inyo National Forest, Deadman Canyon offers dispersed camping opportunities in a remote, rugged area with scenic views of the surrounding mountains.\n\n**Permits and Planning:**\n\n* Be sure to obtain the necessary permits and follow regulations for each area.\n* Plan ahead, as some of these areas have limited access, and weather conditions can be unpredictable.\n* Bring bear canisters, as bears are present in these areas, and take necessary bear safety measures.\n* Be prepared for challenging hiking conditions, including steep terrain, altitude, and potential snow and ice.\n\nThese areas offer a more remote, wilderness-like experience, but keep in mind that they may require more planning, preparation, and physical effort to access. Make sure you're prepared for the challenges and rewards that come with venturing into the Sierra Nevada backcountry!",
