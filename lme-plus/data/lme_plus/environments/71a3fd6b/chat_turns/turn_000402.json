  "content": "Exciting times! Upgrading your keyboard!\n\nIt's great that you're considering Korg and Roland, both well-known brands in the music industry. To help you narrow down your options, could you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for in a new keyboard?\n\nHere are some questions to consider:\n\n1. What's your budget for the new keyboard?\n2. What type of music do you play most often (e.g., classical, jazz, rock, pop)?\n3. Are you looking for a specific feature set, such as weighted keys, aftertouch, or a particular sound engine?\n4. Do you need any additional features like MIDI control, audio recording capabilities, or connectivity options (e.g., USB, Bluetooth)?\n5. Are you interested in a portable keyboard or a more robust, studio-focused instrument?\n\nRegarding your Taylor GS Mini, it's great that you're taking it to Joe for servicing. A good setup can make a huge difference in playability and comfort. High action can be a real pain (literally!), so I hope Joe is able to get it feeling just right for you.\n\nFeel free to share any other details about your keyboard search or guitar concerns, and I'll do my best to help!",
