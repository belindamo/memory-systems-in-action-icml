  "content": "The idea for the Amazon Cockatoo application was born out of the challenges faced by children's reading comprehension due to the pandemic. The pandemic forced schools to switch to remote learning, which created new challenges for children's education. A study conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that students in the United States had a significant decline in reading comprehension during the pandemic. In response to this, the Amazon Cockatoo application was developed to provide children with an interactive and engaging platform for learning. By leveraging the power of AWS services, the application aims to improve children's reading comprehension skills in a fun and personalized way.",
