  "content": "Sorry to hear that your snake plant is dropping leaves! Don't worry, it's a common issue, and I'm here to help you troubleshoot. Here are some common reasons why your snake plant might be shedding leaves:\n\n1. **Overwatering**: Snake plants don't like soggy soil. If the soil is consistently waterlogged, the roots might be rotting, causing the leaves to drop. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it feels wet, wait a few days before watering again.\n2. **Underwatering**: On the other hand, if the soil is too dry for an extended period, the plant might also drop leaves. Make sure to water your snake plant regularly, especially during hot and dry weather.\n3. **Root bound**: If your snake plant has outgrown its pot and needs more room to expand its roots, it might start dropping leaves. Consider transplanting it into a larger pot with fresh, well-draining soil.\n4. **Lighting issues**: Snake plants prefer bright, indirect light, but can tolerate low light conditions. If your plant is exposed to direct sunlight, it might be getting scorched, causing leaf drop. Move it to a spot with filtered or dappled light.\n5. **Temperature fluctuations**: Snake plants prefer temperatures between 65\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C). If your plant is exposed to drafts, air conditioning, or extreme temperatures, it might drop leaves.\n6. **Pests**: Check for pests like spider mites, mealybugs, or scale, which can cause leaf drop. Inspect the undersides of leaves and stems for any signs of infestation.\n7. **Nutrient deficiency**: Snake plants need nutrients like nitrogen, iron, and magnesium to stay healthy. Consider fertilizing your plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).\n8. **Root damage**: If the roots are damaged during repotting or handling, it can cause the plant to drop leaves. Be gentle when handling the roots, and avoid disturbing them excessively.\n9. **Diseases**: Fungal diseases like leaf spot or root rot can cause leaf drop. Remove any affected leaves or stems, and treat the plant with a fungicide if necessary.\n10. **Age**: As snake plants mature, older leaves naturally drop off as new growth emerges. This is a normal process, but if you're concerned, you can try pruning the plant to encourage new growth.\n\nCheck your plant's environment and care routine to see if any of these factors might be contributing to the leaf drop. Adjust accordingly, and your snake plant should recover.",
