In fact, overwatering is one of the most common mistakes people make when caring for snake plants.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, it's better to err on the side of caution and underwater than to overwater your snake plant. Here's a simple trick to determine when to water:\n\n1. Stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle (about 1-2 inches deep).\n2. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water.\n3. If it feels damp or wet, wait a few more days before watering again.\n\nIn the summer months, you can increase the frequency of watering, but still be cautious not to overdo it. A good starting point would be to water your snake plant every 7-10 days during the hot weather.\n\nWhen you do water, make sure to:\n\n* Water thoroughly, making sure the pot drains well to prevent waterlogged soil.\n* Water at the soil level, avoiding the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.\n* Let the top 1-2 inches of soil dry out between waterings.\n\nBy adjusting your watering schedule, you should be able to prevent overwatering and help your snake plant recover from any potential root rot or stress.\n\nKeep an eye on your plant's response, and adjust your watering schedule as needed. If you're still unsure, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!",
