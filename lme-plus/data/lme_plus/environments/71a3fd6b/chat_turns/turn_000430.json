Here are some softer, mellow 70s and 80s songs that would be perfect for a brunch setting:\n\n**Soft 70s Favorites:**\n\n1. **We've Only Just Begun** by The Carpenters (1970) - A sweet, sentimental song that's perfect for a family gathering.\n2. **Landslide** by Fleetwood Mac (1975) - A beautiful, introspective ballad that's sure to create a warm atmosphere.\n3. **Killing Me Softly With His Song** by Roberta Flack (1973) - A soulful, gentle song that's great for a brunch setting.\n4. **You Light Up My Life** by Debby Boone (1977) - A soft, romantic ballad that's sure to bring a smile to your mom's face.\n5. **Reunited** by Peaches & Herb (1978) - A sweet, upbeat duet that's perfect for a family celebration.\n\n**Mellow 80s Tracks:**\n\n1. **Time After Time** by Cyndi Lauper (1983) - A beautiful, melancholic song with a soaring chorus.\n2. **Open Arms** by Journey (1982) - A power ballad that's perfect for a more subdued moment.\n3. **Lost in Your Eyes** by Michael Bolton (1989) - A romantic, soulful song that's great for a brunch setting.\n4. **What's Love Got to Do with It** by Tina Turner (1984) - A smooth, soulful track that's perfect for a relaxed atmosphere.\n5. **Islands in the Stream** by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton (1983) - A country-tinged duet that's sure to bring a warm, fuzzy feeling to the party.\n\nThese songs should provide a great mix of soft, mellow tracks to create a warm and inviting atmosphere during the brunch portion of the party. You can then transition to the more upbeat tracks I suggested earlier to get the party started and keep it going!\n\nRemember, you know your mom's tastes best, so feel free to add or remove songs to tailor the playlist to her preferences. Good luck with the party planning, and I hope everything turns out amazing!",
