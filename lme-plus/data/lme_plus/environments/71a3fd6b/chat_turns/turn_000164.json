It's a great way to boost their confidence and encourage them to continue exploring their creativity.\n\nI think the Window Wonderland idea is a great way to display the butterflies, especially since it adds a sense of movement and color to the room. The Butterfly Garden idea is also a lovely way to create a whimsical setting that showcases their creations.\n\nIf you're looking for something more interactive, the Mobile Masterpiece or Garland Galore ideas could be a lot of fun. Kids love seeing their artwork in motion, and it adds an extra element of excitement to the display.\n\nWhichever method you choose, I'm sure your niece and nephew will be thrilled to see their butterfly crafts on display!",
