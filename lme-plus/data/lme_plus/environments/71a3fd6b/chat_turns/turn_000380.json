  "content": "MK looks at Macaque, who is still weak and barely able to stand on his own. He knows he can't leave Macaque behind, but he also knows he can't carry him through the barrier. MK starts to think about how he was able to weaken the barrier earlier. He remembers that he had to use a spell to break down the barrier's magic. He looks at Macaque and says, \"I have an idea. I'll cast the spell again, but this time I'll direct it at you. It should weaken the barrier enough for you to pass through.\"\n\nMacaque looks at MK with a mix of hope and skepticism. He's not sure if the spell will work, but he's willing to try anything. MK starts to recite the spell and as he finishes, he points at Macaque. The golden aura barrier starts to shimmer and fade, and Macaque takes a step forward. He makes it through the barrier, but just barely. He collapses on the other side, exhausted.\n\nMK helps him up and says, \"Come on, we have to get out of here.\" They make their way through the cave, past the guards that MK had put to sleep earlier, and out into the open. Macaque can't help but look back at the cave, where he had been held captive for so long. He turns to MK and says, \"Thank you, my friend. I couldn't have done this without you.\"\n\nMK nods and smiles, relieved that Macaque is finally free. He knows that the war is far from over, but for now, they have a small victory. They start to make their way back to their friends, who are waiting for them outside the cave.",
