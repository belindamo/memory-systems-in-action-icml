For the slideshow I made for my grandparents' anniversary, I think what made it special was the personal touch of including stories and quotes from family members. I also made sure to include a variety of photos from different stages of their lives, which really helped to tell their story. I'll try to incorporate some of those elements into my mom's slideshow as well. By the way, speaking of family photos, I was thinking of asking my mom to go through some old albums with me and digitize some of our family photos. Do you have any tips on how to digitize old photos without damaging them?",
