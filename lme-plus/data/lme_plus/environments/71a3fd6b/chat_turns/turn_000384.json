  "content": "MK struggles to pull Macaque through the weakened barrier, his friend's weight nearly too much for him to bear. \"Come on, Mac, we're almost there,\" MK says through gritted teeth, pushing with all his might.\n\nFinally, they make it through and Mei and Tang watch in surprise. They seem excited to see their king and bow, but as Macaque emerges, visibly broken and in pain, they look sad. \"Your majesty,\" Mei says, bowing low.\n\nTang follows suit, bowing as well. \"Is there anything we can do to help?\"\n\nMacaque tries to stand on his own, but his legs give out and he collapses to the ground. \"I'm fine,\" he says weakly, clearly not fine.\n\nMK helps him up. \"We need to get him out of here,\" MK says, looking at Mei and Tang. \"Can one of you help me support him?\"\n\nMei nods, moving to Macaque's other side to help support him. \"Let's get you out of here, your majesty,\" she says.\n\nThe four of them make their way out of the cave, Macaque leaning heavily on his friends for support. As they emerge into the sunlight, they are met with the sight of the monkey army, ready for battle.\n\nMacaque looks up at the army, determination in his eyes. \"Let's end this,\" he says, with a newfound strength in his voice, as they all move forward to the final battle.",
