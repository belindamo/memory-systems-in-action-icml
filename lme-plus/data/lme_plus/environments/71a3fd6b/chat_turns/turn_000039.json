But I can suggest a few options to help you find the information you're looking for:\n\n1. Check the City Art Gallery's website: You can visit the gallery's official website to see what exhibitions are currently on display. Most galleries have a section on their website that lists their current and upcoming exhibitions, along with details about the artists, curators, and dates.\n2. Social media: Follow the City Art Gallery on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. They often post updates about their exhibitions, events, and behind-the-scenes insights.\n3. Contact the gallery directly: You can reach out to the City Art Gallery directly via phone or email to ask about their current exhibitions. They should be able to provide you with the information you're looking for.\n4. Online event calendars: Look for online event calendars or cultural websites that list exhibitions and events in your area. These can be a great resource for finding out what's happening at the City Art Gallery and other cultural institutions.\n\nIt's great to hear that you had a positive experience with Ms. Johnson's curator's tour! Curator-led tours can be a fantastic way to gain a deeper understanding of the artwork and the artists behind it.\n\nI hope you find the information you're looking for, and I wish you a wonderful time at the City Art Gallery this weekend!",
