  "content": "Sure, here's a revised version of the AWS Internal FAQ with the questions framed in a more internal context:\n\n1. How can we store all of the educational content that will be made available on the Amazon Cockatoo application in a highly scalable and durable way?\n\nAnswer: We can use Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) to store all of the educational content that will be made available on the Amazon Cockatoo application. This content can include anything from videos to images, and documents to audio files. The benefit of using Amazon S3 is that it is highly scalable and durable, meaning that it can handle large amounts of data, and it is reliable.\n\n2. What can we use to create and manage the RESTful API that will be used by the Amazon Cockatoo application?\n\nAnswer: We can use Amazon API Gateway to create and manage the RESTful API that will be used by the Amazon Cockatoo application. API Gateway makes it easy to create, test, and deploy APIs, and it also has built-in support for securing APIs using OAuth and other authentication methods.\n\n3. How can we execute the code that will run on the backend of the Amazon Cockatoo application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure?\n\nAnswer: We can use Amazon Lambda to execute the code that will run on the backend of the Amazon Cockatoo application. Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows developers to write code in response to events, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. For example, when a user requests a piece of content from the application, Lambda can be used to retrieve the content from Amazon S3 and serve it to the user.\n\n4. What can we use to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to the Amazon Cockatoo application?\n\nAnswer: We can use Amazon Cognito to manage user authentication and authorization in the Amazon Cockatoo application. Cognito allows developers to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to applications, and it integrates with other AWS services like API Gateway and Lambda.\n\n5. How can we monitor and analyze the performance of the Amazon Cockatoo application?\n\nAnswer: We can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and analyze the performance of the Amazon Cockatoo application. CloudWatch provides metrics and logs that can be used to monitor the health and performance of the application, and it can also be used to trigger alarms and notifications based on specific metrics.",
