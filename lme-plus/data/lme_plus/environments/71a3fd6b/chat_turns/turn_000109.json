  "content": "To make the prices of energy a function of labor, capital and demand, we can add variables for labor and capital to the energy supply equations, as well as an equation for demand as a function of the price of energy. Specifically, we can modify the energy supply equations as follows:\n\nFor fossil energy:\n```scss\nQf_t = Af * Kf_t^hf * Lf_t^lf * exp(-df * t)\npf_t = (a * Lf_t^b + c * Kf_t^d + e * D_t^f) / Qf_t\n```\nFor green energy:\n```scss\nQg_t = Ag * Kg_t^hg * Lg_t^lg * exp(-dg * t)\npg_t = (a * Lg_t^b + c * Kg_t^d + e * D_t^f) / Qg_t\n```\nHere, D\\_t is the total energy demand at time t, and the price of energy in each sector is a function of the labor, capital, and demand variables, as well as constants a, b, c, d, e, and f.\n\nWe can also modify the demand equation to include these variables:\n```scss\nD_t = Ad * Kd_t^hd * Ld_t^ld * (pf_t)^(-edf) * (pg_t)^(-edg)\n```\nHere, Ad, hd, ld, and the edf and edg exponents are constants.\n\nFinally, we need to add equations for labor and capital in the energy sector, and modify the investment equations accordingly. Specifically, we can add the following equations:\n\nFor fossil energy:\n```bash\nLf_t = Lf_{t-1} * (1 + glf * (If_t^lf - df * Kf_{t-1}^hf * Lf_{t-1}^lf) / Kf_{t-1}^hf)\nKf_t = Kf_{t-1} * (1 - df * Kf_{t-1}^hf * Lf_{t-1}^lf / Kf_{t-1}^hf + If_t^lf)\n```\nFor green energy:\n```makefile\nLg_t = Lg_{t-1} * (1 + glg * (Ig_t^lg - dg * Kg_{t-1}^hg * Lg_{t-1}^lg) / Kg_{t-1}^hg)\nKg_t = Kg_{t-1} * (1 - dg * Kg_{t-1}^hg * Lg_{t-1}^lg / Kg_{t-1}^hg + Ig_t^lg)\n```\nHere, glf, glg are the labor growth rates for fossil and green energy sectors, and If\\_t^lf, Ig\\_t^lg are the investments in labor in the fossil and green energy sectors, respectively. Similarly, Kf\\_t^hf, Kg\\_t^hg are the capital stock in the fossil and green energy sectors, respectively, and If\\_t^lf, Ig\\_t^lg are the investments in capital in the fossil and green energy sectors, respectively.",
