  "content": "The avant-garde movement had a significant influence on music in the early 20th century. It challenged traditional forms and structures and encouraged experimentation with new techniques and sounds.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of avant-garde music was the rejection of tonality, which had been central to Western music for centuries. Composers began to experiment with atonality, using dissonance and unconventional scales to create new and unfamiliar sounds.\n\nThe use of unconventional instruments, such as sirens and other mechanical devices, was also popular among avant-garde composers. They sought to break away from traditional musical instruments to explore new forms of expression.\n\nIn addition, avant-garde music often incorporated elements of noise and found sounds, such as recordings of machines, animals, or everyday life. This experimentation led to new forms of electronic music and musique concr\u00e8te, a genre of music made by manipulating recorded sounds.\n\nOverall, the avant-garde movement challenged the traditional forms and structures of music and paved the way for new experimentation with sound and composition. Its influence can be seen across various musical genres and styles that continue to push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in music today.",
