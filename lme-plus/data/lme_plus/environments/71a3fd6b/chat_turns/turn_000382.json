  "content": "MK and Macaque reach the golden aura barrier. MK tests it and finds that he can pass through easily. He turns to Macaque and says, \"I can get through, but you can't. I don't know what to do.\"\n\nMacaque, still weak from his time in chains, leans heavily on MK. He looks at the barrier and says, \"We'll have to figure something out. I'm not going to leave you behind.\"\n\nMK looks around frantically, trying to find a solution. He spots a small crack in the cave wall nearby. \"Wait here,\" he tells Macaque. \"I'll be back in a minute.\"\n\nMK runs to the crack and starts to work on widening it. He uses his staff to break off chunks of rock and clear the way. After a few minutes of intense work, he creates a small tunnel that leads around the barrier. \"Come on,\" he says, gesturing for Macaque to follow him. \"This way.\"\n\nMacaque struggles to walk, but with MK's help, he makes it through the tunnel and they both emerge on the other side of the barrier. Macaque collapses on the ground, exhausted and in pain. \"I can't go on,\" he says. \"You have to leave me here.\"\n\nMK shakes his head determinedly. \"I'm not leaving you here,\" he says. \"We'll rest here for a while and then we'll continue on.\"\n\nMacaque is too weak to argue, and the two of them rest in the cave, recuperating from their ordeal. As they rest, MK promises himself that he will do everything in his power to help Macaque reclaim his throne and defeat Wukong.",
