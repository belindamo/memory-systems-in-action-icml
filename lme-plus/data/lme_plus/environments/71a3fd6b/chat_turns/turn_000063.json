Mix it with their feed or offer it as a treat.\n2. **Probiotic powder:** You can add probiotic powder to their feed or water. Look for products specifically formulated for poultry.\n3. **Fermented foods:** Fermented foods like fermented grains, fruits, or vegetables can provide a natural source of probiotics.\n\nWhen introducing probiotics, remember:\n\n1. **Start slow:** Begin with small amounts and gradually increase the dosage to prevent digestive upset.\n2. **Choose a poultry-specific product:** Ensure the probiotic product is specifically formulated for poultry, as the gut microbiome of hens is different from that of other animals.\n3. **Consult with a veterinarian:** If you're unsure about the best probiotic product or dosage for your flock, consult with a veterinarian or poultry expert.\n\nSome popular probiotic products for chickens include:\n\n1. **Probiotic powders:** Products like Probios, Probiotics for Chickens, or Avian Probiotics.\n2. **Yogurt:** Plain, unflavored, and unsweetened yogurt from brands like Greek yogurt or kefir.\n3. **Fermented grains:** Fermented grains like fermented oats or barley can provide a natural source of probiotics.\n\nBy adding probiotics to their diet, you'll be supporting your hens' overall health and well-being. Remember to monitor their behavior, droppings, and egg production to ensure they're responding well to the changes.\n\nKeep me updated on your progress, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions or concerns!",
