This will help you stay focused and avoid multitasking, which can decrease productivity.\n2. **Use a \"Stop Doing\" list**: Identify tasks that are not essential or can be delegated, and eliminate them from your to-do list. This will help you prioritize the most critical tasks and avoid wasting time on non-essential activities.\n3. **Prioritize your emails**: Identify the most critical emails that require attention before the meeting and respond to them first. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize emails into urgent vs. important and focus on the most critical ones first.\n4. **Batch similar tasks**: Group similar tasks together, such as checking and responding to emails or making phone calls. This can help you stay focused and complete tasks more efficiently.\n5. **Take advantage of \"in-between\" time**: Use the time between tasks or during breaks to quickly review project materials, check emails, or make phone calls. This can help you stay on top of your tasks and make the most of your time.\n6. **Prepare a \"Meeting Prep\" checklist**: Create a checklist of tasks you need to complete before the meeting, such as reviewing project materials, preparing questions, or gathering necessary documents. This will help you stay organized and ensure you're prepared for the meeting.\n7. **Leave a buffer**: Leave some buffer time in your schedule for unexpected tasks or interruptions. This will help you stay calm and focused, even if things don't go according to plan.\n\nHere's an updated schedule incorporating these strategies:\n\n**Work Block 1 (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)**\n\n* 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM: Project work (critical tasks for the meeting)\n* 9:30 AM - 10:00 AM: Review project materials for the meeting\n* 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Respond to urgent emails\n* 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM: Take a break\n* 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM: Make phone calls (critical calls for the meeting)\n* 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM: Review project progress and prepare for the meeting\n\n**Lunch Break (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)**\n\n* Take a break to eat lunch and recharge\n\n**Work Block 2 (1:00 PM - 2:00 PM)**\n\n* 1:00 PM - 1:30 PM: Finalize project tasks for the meeting\n* 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM: Review meeting prep checklist and ensure you're prepared\n\n**Meeting with Project Manager (2:00 PM)**\n\n* 2:00 PM - Attend the meeting with your project manager\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you can stay focused, prioritize your tasks, and ensure you're prepared for the meeting.
