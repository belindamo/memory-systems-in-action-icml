However, considering your goal of establishing a consistent sleep schedule, I'd recommend practicing yoga in the morning. Here's why:\n\n**Morning Yoga:**\n\n1. **Improved mental clarity and focus**: Morning yoga can help increase your mental alertness and set a positive tone for the day.\n2. **Boosts energy**: A morning yoga practice can give you a natural energy boost to start your day, which can help you feel more alert and focused.\n3. **Less likely to interfere with sleep**: Practicing yoga in the morning is less likely to interfere with your sleep schedule, as you'll have plenty of time to wind down before bed.\n4. **Establishes a healthy routine**: Starting your day with yoga can help create a sense of routine and discipline, which can translate to other areas of your life, including your sleep schedule.\n\n**Evening Yoga:**\n\n1. **Relaxation and unwinding**: Evening yoga can be an excellent way to unwind and relax before bed, helping you prepare for a restful night's sleep.\n2. **Reduces stress and anxiety**: A gentle evening yoga practice can help calm your mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep.\n\nHowever, if you practice yoga too close to bedtime, it can actually interfere with your sleep. This is because:\n\n* **Increased energy**: Some yoga styles, like Vinyasa or Ashtanga, can leave you feeling energized and alert, making it harder to fall asleep.\n* **Stimulates the nervous system**: Yoga can stimulate your nervous system, which can make it difficult to wind down and relax before sleep.\n\nIf you do prefer to practice yoga in the evening, try to finish your practice at least 2-3 hours before bedtime to allow your body time to wind down.\n\nUltimately, the best time for yoga is when it feels most comfortable and convenient for you. If you're not a morning person, you can experiment with evening yoga and see how it affects your sleep. Just be mindful of the potential impact on your sleep schedule.\n\nRemember, consistency is key. Find a time that works for you and stick to it, so yoga becomes an enjoyable and sustainable part of your daily routine.",
