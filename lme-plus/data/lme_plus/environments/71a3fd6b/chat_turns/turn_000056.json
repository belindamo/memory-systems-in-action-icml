  "content": "I'm having some issues with my chicken flock's egg production. They've been laying fewer eggs lately, and I'm wondering if it's due to the change in seasons or if they need more calcium supplements in their feed. Can you help me figure out what might be the cause? By the way, I also cleaned out the chicken coop and replaced the old bedding with fresh straw recently, so I don't think it's a coop maintenance issue.",
