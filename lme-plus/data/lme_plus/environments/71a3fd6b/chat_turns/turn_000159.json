And, of course, symmetry is a great way to introduce some math concepts in a creative way.\n\nNow, let's talk about a DIY art supply storage container. I've got a few ideas that are easy to make and perfect for storing art supplies:\n\n**1. Repurposed Muffin Tin:**\nUse a muffin tin to store small art supplies like paint, markers, crayons, or beads. Simply label each compartment with a marker or stickers, and you're good to go!\n\n**2. Decorated Shoe Box:**\nTransform an old shoe box into a colorful art supply container. Decorate the box with paint, markers, or stickers, and add labels or dividers to separate the supplies.\n\n**3. Popsicle Stick Crate:**\nCreate a simple crate using Popsicle sticks and glue. You can decorate the crate with paint or markers, and add a small handle made from a ribbon or twine.\n\n**4. Recycled Cardboard Box:**\nUse a sturdy cardboard box (like a cereal box) and decorate it with paint, markers, or stickers. Add dividers or compartments to store different art supplies.\n\n**5. Mason Jar Organizer:**\nUse a mason jar and attach small labels or stickers to the lid to identify the contents. You can store small supplies like paintbrushes, markers, or beads in the jar.\n\n**6. Fabric Pouches:**\nSew or glue small fabric pouches to store art supplies like crayons, markers, or paint. You can attach the pouches to a board or a clipboard for easy access.\n\nTips:\n\n* Use adhesive magnets or Velcro to attach the storage container to a metal surface or a wall, making it easy to access and store.\n* Label each compartment or section with a picture or a word, making it easy for your niece and nephew to identify the supplies.\n* Encourage them to help you decorate the storage container, making it a fun and collaborative process.\n\nPick the one that resonates with you the most, or feel free to mix and match elements to create your own unique art supply storage container!\n\nRemember, the goal is to have fun and be creative while making the storage container. It's an opportunity to model creative problem-solving and encourage your niece and nephew to think outside the box (or in this case, the storage container!)",
