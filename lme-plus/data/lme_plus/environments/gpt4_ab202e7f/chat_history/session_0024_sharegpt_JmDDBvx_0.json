      "content": "Many people told met that in my presence ( proximity) have therapeutic benefits. Is it because my body generates inaudible sounds that these people can sense? In India it is very common knowledge that in the presence of a senior meditator people get these benefits. I want to know the physical process of this mechanism."

      "content": "The idea that a person's presence can have therapeutic benefits is not based on any scientific evidence. There is no scientific evidence to support the notion that a person's body generates inaudible sounds that others can sense or that being in close proximity to someone who is meditating has any specific therapeutic benefits.\n\nIt is possible that the perception of therapeutic benefits from being in someone's presence is due to psychological or social factors, such as feelings of comfort, relaxation, or safety that come from being near someone who is perceived as trustworthy and supportive. People may also attribute any feelings of calm or well-being to being near the meditator, even if these feelings are actually due to other factors, such as stress relief or relaxation.\n\nIn conclusion, while being in someone's presence can certainly have a positive impact on a person's mood and well-being, it is not because of any specific physical process related to the generation of inaudible sounds. The exact mechanisms behind the psychological and social benefits of being in someone's presence are still not well understood and require further scientific investigation."

      "content": "Seems modern science is not bothered about the way Indian Yogis, Buddhist monks or Christian Saints exhibited miraculous powers to heal people around them. Is there no research at all on Extra sensory perception?"

      "content": "There is some research on extra-sensory perception (ESP), also known as psychic phenomena, but the scientific community remains skeptical about its validity and the results of such research are not widely accepted as evidence of the existence of ESP. The study of ESP falls within the field of parapsychology, which is a branch of psychology that seeks to study paranormal or supernatural phenomena.\n\nHowever, due to the lack of widely accepted empirical evidence for the existence of ESP and the controversial nature of the topic, most mainstream scientists and academic institutions have chosen not to invest significant resources in this area of research. As a result, the study of ESP is not a widely recognized or well-funded field of research.\n\nThat being said, there are still some researchers and organizations who are actively studying and investigating claims of ESP, and they often rely on anecdotal reports and case studies to support their claims. However, the lack of widely accepted scientific evidence and the limited resources available for this type of research means that the field of ESP is not well developed, and the results of such research are often controversial and not widely accepted by the scientific community.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some research on ESP, the field is not well developed, and the results are not widely accepted as evidence of the existence of psychic phenomena."
