Like a parent who is cheering their child on who is a little slow and has trouble completing tasks.\n\nAs a 2 year old, it helps when I'm celebrated for little things that normal people can do to the point where it would come off as extremely patronizing in every other context. And perhaps is still patronizing in this one, but still."
