      "content": "A simple, bold geometric print can add a lot of visual interest to your room. When it comes to choosing a shape, it ultimately depends on your personal taste and the overall aesthetic you're aiming for. However, here are some considerations to keep in mind:\n\n**Circles:**\n\n* Circles can create a sense of softness and calmness, which might complement your light gray walls nicely.\n* A large, bold circle can make a statement and add a touch of modernity to your room.\n* Consider a circle with a subtle pattern or texture to add some visual interest.\n\n**Squares:**\n\n* Squares can bring a sense of balance and stability to your room, which might work well with the calming atmosphere of your light gray walls.\n* A square shape can also create a sense of symmetry, which can be pleasing to the eye.\n* You could opt for a square with a subtle grid pattern or a bold, solid color to add some visual interest.\n\n**Hexagons and Triangles:**\n\n* Hexagons and triangles can add a bit more complexity and visual interest to your room, which might be a nice contrast to the simplicity of your light gray walls.\n* These shapes can also create a sense of energy and dynamism, which might be a nice addition to a bedroom.\n* Consider a hexagon or triangle with a bold, contrasting color to make it stand out against your light gray walls.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If you want to create a sense of cohesion, choose a shape that echoes the lines and shapes found in your furniture or decor. For example, if you have a lot of rectangular furniture, a square or rectangular print might work well.\n* Consider the size of the print in relation to your walls and furniture. A large, bold shape can make a statement, but a smaller shape can also add a touch of subtlety.\n* Don't be afraid to experiment with different colors and patterns within the shape. A bold, contrasting color can add a lot of visual interest, while a subtle pattern can add depth and texture.\n\nUltimately, the choice of shape will depend on your personal taste and the overall aesthetic you're aiming for. You could also consider creating a mood board or collecting inspiration images to get a better sense of what works best for your space."
