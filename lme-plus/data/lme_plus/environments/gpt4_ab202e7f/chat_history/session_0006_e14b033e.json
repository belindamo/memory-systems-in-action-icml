      "content": "Sorry to hear that your recent American Airlines experience was just okay.\n\nTracking flight prices can be a challenge, but there are some fantastic tools to help you snag the best deals. Here are some top recommendations to track prices for that business class ticket to London:\n\n1. **Google Flights**: Google Flights is an excellent resource for tracking prices. You can set up price alerts for specific routes, and it'll notify you when prices drop. It also provides a \"Explore\" feature, which shows you a map of the world with prices for different destinations.\n2. **Skyscanner**: Skyscanner is another popular option for tracking prices. You can set up price alerts, and it'll send you notifications when prices drop. It also has a \"Everywhere\" feature, which allows you to search for flights to anywhere in the world without specifying a destination.\n3. **Scott's Cheap Flights**: Scott's Cheap Flights is a fantastic resource for finding error fares and sale prices. They offer a premium membership that provides access to exclusive deals and alerts. They also have a free newsletter that sends out daily deals.\n4. **Airfarewatchdog**: Airfarewatchdog is a website that offers fare comparison and price tracking. You can set up fare alerts for specific routes, and they'll notify you when prices drop.\n5. **The Flight Deal**: The Flight Deal is a website that offers fare sale alerts and error fares. They also have a team of experts who analyze prices and provide insights on when to buy.\n6. **Award availability tools**: If you're looking to redeem miles for a business class ticket, you can use tools like ExpertFlyer, AwardAvailability, or SeatSpy to track award availability.\n\nFor business class tickets, it's essential to be flexible with your travel dates and times. Consider flying during off-peak seasons or on less popular days (e.g., Tuesdays and Wednesdays).\n\nAdditionally, you can also set up price alerts on the American Airlines website or through their mobile app. They often offer exclusive deals and discounts to their loyalty program members.\n\nRemember to always compare prices across multiple sources and be prepared to act quickly when you find a good deal. Safe travels!"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Google Flights is an excellent tool for tracking prices.\n\nRegarding your question, the answer is a bit more complex. As a United Airlines credit cardholder, you've likely earned Chase Ultimate Rewards points or United MileagePlus miles. Unfortunately, you can't directly use those points or miles to book a business class ticket on British Airways.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be transferred to several airline loyalty programs, including United MileagePlus, but not British Airways Executive Club.\n* United MileagePlus miles can be used to book award flights on Star Alliance partners, but British Airways is not a part of the Star Alliance. British Airways is a member of the Oneworld alliance, which has its own set of airline partners and redemption rules.\n\nHowever, there are a few potential workarounds:\n\n1. **Transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Iberia Plus**: Iberia is a Oneworld partner, and you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Iberia Plus. From there, you can redeem Iberia Avios for British Airways flights. Keep in mind that Iberia's award chart and redemption rules might be different from British Airways.\n2. **Use a transferable points currency**: If you have points with a transferable currency like American Express Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, or Capital One Rewards, you might be able to transfer them to British Airways Executive Club or another Oneworld partner.\n3. **Book through a third-party booking platform**: Some third-party booking platforms, like Points.com or ExpertFlyer, allow you to redeem points or miles from various loyalty programs for flights on multiple airlines, including British Airways. Be aware that these platforms might charge fees or have limited availability.\n\nBefore exploring these options, I recommend checking the transfer partners, award charts, and redemption rules for each loyalty program to ensure you're getting the best value for your points or miles.\n\nIf you're not sure about the best way to redeem your points or miles, consider consulting with a travel rewards expert or a credit card concierge service. They can help you navigate the complex world of points and miles redemption."

      "content": "Error fares! Those are indeed a sweet spot for savvy travelers like yourself. Error fares are mistake fares that airlines or online travel agencies (OTAs) accidentally list at a much lower price than they intended. These fares can be significantly cheaper than usual, often by hundreds or even thousands of dollars.\n\nError fares can occur due to various reasons, such as:\n\n1. **Technical glitches**: Airlines or OTAs might experience technical issues that cause prices to be displayed incorrectly.\n2. **Currency conversion mistakes**: Errors in currency conversion rates can result in incorrectly priced fares.\n3. **Fare sale misconfigurations**: Airlines might accidentally load incorrect sale prices or discounts into their systems.\n4. **Human error**: Simple mistakes, like typos or incorrect fare rules, can lead to error fares.\n\nTo find error fares, you can:\n\n1. **Follow airfare deal alert accounts**: Twitter accounts like @TheFlightDeal, @Airfarewatchdog, or @SecretFlying often tweet about error fares.\n2. **Use fare comparison tools**: Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak allow you to set up price alerts for specific routes. You can also use fare sale alert features on these websites.\n3. **Monitor airline websites and OTAs**: Keep an eye on airline websites, as well as OTAs like Expedia, Orbitz, or Priceline, for unusual price drops.\n4. **Join flight deal communities**: Online forums like FlyerTalk or Reddit's r/traveldeals can provide valuable insights and tips on finding error fares.\n5. **Be flexible**: Be prepared to travel on short notice, as error fares are usually only available for a short period.\n\nWhen you find an error fare, act quickly! Book the ticket as soon as possible, as the airline or OTA may correct the mistake at any moment. Be aware that error fares are usually non-refundable, and the airline may not honor the ticket if they realize their mistake.\n\nRemember, error fares are not guaranteed, and there's always a risk that the airline might cancel the ticket or honor it at the correct price. However, with persistence and flexibility, you can snag an amazing deal and enjoy a luxurious business class flight to London!"
