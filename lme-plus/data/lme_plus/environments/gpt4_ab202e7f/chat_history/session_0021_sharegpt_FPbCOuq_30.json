      "content": "David J. Collis concludes:\nThe solution is not to alter the company\u2019s competitive position. If Edward Jones changed its customer scope by serving day traders, it would be positioned in the most price-competitive part of the market. If it altered its model of entrepreneurial advisers who are embedded in communities, it would lose its cooperative, client-interests-first culture. The best hope for escaping commoditization is to pursue business model innovation that creates more value and potentially monetizes it in ways other than just a commission on each transaction.\n\nEdward Jones is therefore following the path that other professional services firms have taken and is shifting from a product, or \u201ctransactional,\u201d business model to a financial life \u201csolutions\u201d business model. Through a five-step process that begins with documenting individual goals, the firm now offers customized advice and solutions for lifelong needs, not just purchases of mutual funds or blue-chip stocks. Though this approach requires more-intense engagement with customers, it creates substantially more value for them.\n\nMany entrepreneurs fail to see that the more value their business model creates, the more competition they\u2019re likely to face.\n\nIn its efforts to successfully shift to the financial life solutions model, Edward Jones has identified must-win battles in several areas, including diversity (while about half of Generation Z is nonwhite, fewer than 15% of the firm\u2019s advisers belong to minority groups); intergenerational wealth transfer (an estimated $40 trillion in assets will be inherited by Millennials); and multichannel distribution (to effectively serve a full range of clients regardless of net worth and to complement in-person services with digital interactions). The firm has created teams, each of which works on part of a broader initiative\u2014for instance, how to enter urban markets with a large minority population\u2014to develop and test approaches addressing those challenges. Specific projects will come and go over time, but the focus on building capabilities required for long-term success will remain.\n\nNotice that we need to look at the whole strategy landscape to understand the change under way at Edward Jones. First, new developments (in demographics, regulation, capital markets\u2019 performance, and so on) are throwing up novel threats and opportunities. Second, the reduction in value capture for the industry is undermining the old business model. Third, the business model itself now needs to be retooled to create more value even if the competitive positioning is unchanged. And fourth, the revisions will take place through projects that support broader strategic initiatives.\n\nThe most important lesson is that to craft a resilient strategy, companies of all sizes must integrate all the elements of the complete strategy landscape. While not disregarding how critical competitive positioning is to value capture, an effective strategy process must begin with a creative and open-ended discussion of the value potential of alternative business models and finish with an approach to execution that guides ongoing experimentation and operational adaptation while investing in underlying capabilities.\n\nStrategy has always been about aligning the organization behind a clear direction. Today it must be broadened to become an integrated set of choices about the business model, competitive positioning, and capabilities required for long-term success. By managing the complete strategy landscape, CEOs of young ventures will greatly increase the odds that their firms won\u2019t crash and burn, and leaders of established companies will ensure that they continually renew themselves."

      "content": "David J. Collis is a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and a senior adviser at Bain & Company. In this article, he discusses the importance of a comprehensive approach to strategy, which he refers to as the \"complete strategy landscape\". According to Collis, this landscape is made up of four key elements: opportunity set, business model, competitive positioning, and realization of value over time. By considering all of these elements together, companies can better align their activities and make better strategic decisions. Collis uses the example of Edward Jones, a brokerage firm that is shifting its business model to a \"financial life solutions\" model in response to changes in the industry. By considering how this change will impact all aspects of its strategy, Edward Jones is able to make the shift more successfully."

      "content": "David J. Collis argues that strategy is more than just identifying an attractive industry or defining a competitive advantage. Instead, it requires making a series of aligned choices about opportunities to pursue, the value that can be created and captured, and how to keep realizing value and building a foundation for long-term success. This includes considerations of the industry landscape, business model, and competitive positioning, as well as the ability to adapt and keep realizing value over time. Collis emphasizes the importance of experimentation and iteration within a framework set by the CEO, as well as the need for a limited number of \"must-win battles\" that focus on building capabilities for the long-term. He also advocates for the integration of all elements of the strategy landscape, from identifying opportunities and creating value to executing the strategy and ensuring its long-term success."

      "content": "In the articles, David J. Collis discusses a comprehensive approach to strategy that encompasses the entire strategy landscape, including the opportunity set, business model, competitive positioning, execution, and outcome. He argues that a complete strategy must align all of these elements in order to be effective.\n\nCollis begins by explaining the importance of identifying opportunities in the external environment and how these opportunities can be exploited through the development of a business model. He notes that the more value a business model creates, the more competition it is likely to face, and that it is essential for firms to apply frameworks such as industry attractiveness, competitive positioning, and competitive interaction in order to capture sufficient value.\n\nCollis then discusses the importance of execution in realizing value over time. He notes that firms must balance agility and control in order to adapt to changing opportunities and build the capabilities required for long-term success. He recommends a strategic approach that champions experimentation within clearly established bounds and emphasizes the need for regular after-action reviews in order to continually improve and adapt.\n\nCollis also emphasizes the need for integration across the entire strategy landscape. He argues that a firm's positioning, business model, and execution must all be aligned in order to create and capture value. He provides the example of Edward Jones, a brokerage firm that is shifting from a product-based business model to a financial life solutions model in order to create more value for customers and avoid commoditization.\n\nOverall, Collis argues that a complete strategy must align all of the elements of the strategy landscape in order to be effective. He emphasizes the need for firms to identify opportunities, develop a value-creating business model, establish a sustainable competitive advantage, and execute on a plan that builds capabilities for the future. By integrating these elements, firms can increase their chances of long-term success."

      "content": "David J. Collis's approach is a comprehensive and integrated approach to strategic management. He argues that successful strategy involves more than just identifying an attractive industry or defining a competitive advantage. Instead, it requires a series of interconnected choices about which opportunities to pursue, how much value the firm can create and capture, and how to keep realizing value and build a foundation for long-term success.\n\nThis approach is particularly relevant in today's VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) business environment. The rapid pace of technological change, shifting global economic dynamics, and increased competition from both traditional and non-traditional sources make it essential for firms to be able to adapt and respond to changing market conditions.\n\nCollis's approach provides a framework for doing just that. By considering the complete strategy landscape - including the opportunity set, business model, competitive positioning, and the ability to keep realizing value over the long-term - firms are better equipped to identify and exploit new opportunities while also building the capabilities they need to succeed in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, Collis's emphasis on experimentation, learning, and adaptation is particularly relevant in VUCA situations. By encouraging teams to experiment with new configurations and approaches, firms can stay ahead of the curve and maintain a competitive edge. And by consistently investing in capabilities and building organizational resilience, firms can better weather the storms of volatility and uncertainty.\n\nOverall, Collis's approach is a wise one that can help firms navigate the complex and rapidly changing business landscape. It provides a comprehensive and integrated framework for identifying and pursuing new opportunities while also building the capabilities necessary for long-term success."

      "content": "In our opinion, David J. Collis' approach to crafting a resilient strategy is wise because it emphasizes the importance of integrating all elements of the complete strategy landscape. This approach recognizes that competitive positioning is critical to value capture, but also emphasizes the need to consider alternative business models and to focus on execution through ongoing experimentation and adaptation.\n\nIn the context of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) situations, this approach works well because it allows organizations to be agile and adaptable, while also maintaining control through clear guidance and support for strategic initiatives. This enables companies to respond to changing circumstances and seize new opportunities, while also building the capabilities they need for long-term success. Overall, we believe that David J. Collis' approach is a valuable tool for crafting a resilient strategy in a rapidly changing world."
