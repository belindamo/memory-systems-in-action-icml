Here are some tips for roasting them:\n\n**Roasting Kale:**\n\n1. **Choose the right kale:** Opt for curly-leaf or lacinato (also known as dinosaur) kale, as they hold up better to roasting than baby kale or Russian kale.\n2. **Prep the kale:** Remove stems and ribs, and tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Rinse and dry the kale thoroughly to prevent steam from forming during roasting.\n3. **Seasoning:** Drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
