Cooking veggies to the perfect tender-crisp texture can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be a stir-fry master in no time:\n\n1. **Cutting is key**: Cut your veggies into bite-sized pieces, but make sure they're uniform in size so they cook evenly. For broccoli, cut into florets; for bell peppers, slice into thin strips; for carrots, slice into thin coins or sticks; for onions, slice into thin rings; and for mushrooms, slice into thin wedges or quarters.\n2. **Heat control is crucial**: Use a wok or large skillet with a non-stick surface over medium-high heat (around 4-5 on a scale of 1-10). You want the pan to be hot, but not smoking hot. This will help you achieve a quick sear on the veggies without burning them.\n3. **Oil and aromatics first**: Add 1-2 tablespoons of oil (vegetable, peanut, or avocado work well) to the pan and swirl it around. Then, add your aromatics (minced garlic and ginger, if using) and saut\u00e9 for 10-15 seconds until fragrant. This will create a flavorful base for your stir-fry.\n4. **Add veggies in batches**: To prevent overcrowding, add the veggies in batches based on their cooking times:\n\t* Broccoli and carrots: Add first, as they take the longest to cook (around 3-4 minutes). Stir-fry until they start to soften and develop some browning.\n\t* Bell peppers and onions: Add next, as they cook relatively quickly (around 2-3 minutes). Stir-fry until they start to soften and develop some caramelization.\n\t* Mushrooms: Add last, as they cook the fastest (around 1-2 minutes). Stir-fry until they release their moisture and start to brown.\n5. **Stir-fry technique**: Use a spatula to stir-fry the veggies in a quick, gentle, and continuous motion. This helps to distribute the heat evenly and prevents burning. Stir-fry each batch for the recommended time, then add the next batch.\n6. **Don't overcook**: Stir-fry until the veggies are tender-crisp, but still retain some crunch. Overcooking can make them mushy and unappetizing.\n7. **Season to taste**: Once all the veggies are cooked, add your desired seasonings, such as soy sauce, salt, pepper, and any other stir-fry sauce you like.\n\nSome additional tips to achieve tender-crisp veggies:\n\n* Use fresh and firm veggies, as they'll retain their texture better during cooking.\n* Don't overcrowd the pan, as this can lead to steaming instead of stir-frying.\n* Don't stir-fry for too long, as this can cause the veggies to become mushy.\n* If using a wok, use the curved shape to your advantage by stir-frying the veggies up the sides of the pan to ensure even cooking.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to achieve a delicious and balanced stir-fry with perfectly cooked veggies. Happy cooking!",
