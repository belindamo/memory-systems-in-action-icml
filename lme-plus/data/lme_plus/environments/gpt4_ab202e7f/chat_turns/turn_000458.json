Here are some tips to help you properly care for your new white dress shirt:\n\n1. **Wash it as soon as possible**: It's great that you're thinking about caring for your shirt right after wearing it. The sooner you wash it, the better. This will prevent stains from setting in and make cleaning easier.\n2. **Check the care label**: Before you start washing, always check the care label for specific instructions. Some dress shirts may require dry cleaning, while others can be machine washed and dried.\n3. **Wash in cold water**: White dress shirts can be prone to yellowing or discoloration, so it's best to wash them in cold water (below 30\u00b0C or 86\u00b0F) to prevent this. Cold water will also help preserve the fabric's texture and prevent shrinkage.\n4. **Use a mild detergent**: Choose a mild detergent that's specifically designed for washing whites or delicates. Avoid using harsh detergents or bleach, as they can damage the fabric or cause discoloration.\n5. **Avoid using fabric softener**: Fabric softener can leave a residue on your shirt that can affect its texture and make it less breathable. If you must use fabric softener, make sure to rinse your shirt thoroughly to remove any excess residue.\n6. **Don't wring or twist**: After washing, gently remove excess water from the shirt without wringing or twisting it. This can cause stretching or distortion of the fabric.\n7. **Dry flat or hang to dry**: To prevent shrinkage and maintain the shirt's shape, it's best to dry it flat on a towel or hang it to dry. Avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, as this can cause fading.\n8. **Iron while still slightly damp**: Ironing your shirt while it's still slightly damp will help remove wrinkles more easily and prevent scorching. Use a low heat setting and steam to get the best results.\n9. **Store it properly**: When not in use, store your dress shirt in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Fold or hang it neatly to prevent creases and wrinkles.\n10. **Consider using a shirt cleaning solution**: If you want to give your shirt an extra layer of protection, consider using a shirt cleaning solution or stain remover specifically designed for whites. These products can help remove tough stains and odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to keep your white dress shirt looking its best for a long time. Enjoy wearing it to many more special occasions!",
