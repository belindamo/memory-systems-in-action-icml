  "content": "Deciding on folders and tags can be a bit subjective, but here are some guidelines to help you make those decisions:\n\n**Folder creation guidelines:**\n\n1. **Create folders for broad categories**: Folders should represent high-level categories that group related photos together. In your case, \"Beach Trip 2023\" is a great starting point.\n2. **Use folders for events or activities**: Create subfolders for specific events, activities, or locations within the trip, such as \"Day 1: Arrival\", \"Surfing\", \"Beach Walk\", or \"Dinner at [Restaurant Name]\".\n3. **Keep folder names concise**: Use short, descriptive names for your folders. Avoid using long, descriptive sentences or phrases.\n4. **Limit the number of folders**: Aim for 5-10 top-level folders and 5-10 subfolders within each. This will help prevent folder overload and make navigation easier.\n\n**Tag creation guidelines:**\n\n1. **Use tags for specific details**: Tags should describe specific aspects of the photo, such as people, places, objects, activities, or events.\n2. **Be specific with tags**: Instead of using broad tags like \"vacation\", use more specific tags like \"beach\", \"surfing\", \"sunset\", or \"friend\".\n3. **Use a consistent tag structure**: Establish a consistent structure for your tags, such as using plural or singular nouns, and stick to it.\n4. **Limit the number of tags per photo**: As I mentioned earlier, aim for 5-10 tags per photo to avoid keyword overload.\n\n**When to use folders vs. tags:**\n\n1. **Use folders for categorical organization**: Folders are great for organizing photos by date, event, or location.\n2. **Use tags for descriptive details**: Tags are perfect for adding specific details about the content of the photo, such as people, activities, or objects.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* Folder: \"Beach Trip 2023\" > \"Day 2\" > \"Surfing\"\n\t+ Tags: \"surfing\", \"sunset\", \"friend\", \"beach\"\n* Folder: \"Beach Trip 2023\" > \"Day 3\" > \"Beach Walk\"\n\t+ Tags: \"beach walk\", \"morning\", \"seagull\", \"sand\"\n\nIn this example, the folders are used to categorize the photos by date and activity, while the tags provide more specific details about the content of each photo.\n\n**General rule of thumb:**\n\n* If you can create a folder for it, use a folder.\n* If it's a specific detail about the photo, use a tag.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to create a well-organized system that makes it easy to find and enjoy your photos.",
