  "content": "NYC has plenty of tennis courts to choose from.\n\nFor tennis courts within 10 miles of your location in NYC, I recommend using the USTA Court Finder tool or Tennis Court Finder website I mentioned earlier. You can enter your zip code or city and get a list of nearby courts along with their addresses, phone numbers, and availability.\n\nHere are a few popular tennis courts in NYC:\n\n1. **Central Park Tennis Center** (Manhattan): 6 clay courts, 1 hard court, and 1 practice wall. (212) 280-0205\n2. **Roosevelt Island Racquet Club** (Roosevelt Island): 12 hard courts, 4 clay courts, and 1 practice wall. (212) 935-0250\n3. **Queensboro Tennis Center** (Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens): 11 hard courts, 3 clay courts, and 1 practice wall. (718) 760-6200\n4. **Prospect Park Tennis Center** (Brooklyn): 11 hard courts, 4 clay courts, and 1 practice wall. (718) 436-2500\n\nAs for the NBA Finals, the schedule is usually announced by the NBA once the conference finals are complete. Since you've been following the playoffs closely, you might already know that the NBA Finals typically take place in early June.\n\nTo stay up-to-date on the NBA Finals schedule, I recommend checking the official NBA website (nba.com) or your preferred sports news website/app (e.g., ESPN, CBS Sports, etc.). You can also set reminders or notifications on your phone or TV to ensure you don't miss a game!\n\nWhich team are you rooting for in the playoffs?",
