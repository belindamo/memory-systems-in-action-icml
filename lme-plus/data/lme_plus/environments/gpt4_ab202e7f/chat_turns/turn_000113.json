  "content": "Chandra is the Hindu god of the moon and is considered a significant deity in Hinduism. He is also known as Soma, which means nectar of life.\n\nChandra is believed to be the son of the sage Atri and his wife Anasuya. He is also known as the father of the Hindu god Budha, who is associated with the planet Mercury.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Chandra is depicted as a young and handsome man riding a chariot pulled by ten white horses. He is often shown holding a lotus flower, a conch shell, and a mace.\n\nChandra's mythology is closely related to the broader pantheon of Hindu deities. He is often mentioned alongside major Hindu gods such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma. In fact, he is believed to have been created by the Hindu god Brahma.\n\nAccording to Hindu mythology, Chandra was cursed by Daksha, the father of his wife Rohini, to wax and wane every month. This curse is said to be the reason behind the phases of the moon.\n\nChandra is also closely associated with several Hindu festivals, including Raksha Bandhan and Karwa Chauth. During these festivals, people offer prayers and seek blessings from Chandra for good health, prosperity, and longevity.\n\nOverall, Chandra's significance as a Hindu god lies in his association with the moon, which is believed to have a profound impact on life and nature. His mythology and role in Hindu festivals demonstrate the deep connection between Hinduism and the natural world.",
