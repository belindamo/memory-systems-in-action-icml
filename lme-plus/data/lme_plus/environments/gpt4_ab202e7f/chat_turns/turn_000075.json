I'm happy to help you with scent recommendations that might complement your light gray walls and minimalist art piece.\n\n**Scents that complement light gray walls:**\n\n1. **Soft Florals**: Light gray walls provide a clean canvas for soft, delicate florals like rose, jasmine, or geranium. These scents will add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your room.\n2. **Citrus**: Citrus scents like lemon, grapefruit, or bergamot can help create a sense of brightness and freshness in your room. They'll cut through the calmness of the light gray walls and add a pop of energy.\n3. **Earthy Notes**: Earthy scents like patchouli, sage, or cedarwood can ground your space and create a sense of balance.
