  "content": "The \"Unsorted\" or \"To Review\" folder is a great way to handle photos that don't fit into a specific category or need further review. Here are some guidelines to help you decide what goes into that folder:\n\n**What to put in the \"Unsorted\" or \"To Review\" folder:**\n\n1. **Photos that don't fit a category**: If a photo doesn't fit into any of your existing folders or categories, it's a good candidate for the \"Unsorted\" folder.\n2. **Photos that need further review**: If you're unsure about the content of a photo, or if it's blurry, poorly lit, or unclear, put it in the \"To Review\" folder for further evaluation.\n3. **Photos with unclear or missing metadata**: If a photo is missing essential metadata, such as date, time, or location, or if the metadata is incorrect, it's a good idea to put it in the \"Unsorted\" folder for further research.\n4. **Photos that require editing or processing**: If a photo needs editing, such as cropping, rotating, or adjusting exposure, put it in the \"To Review\" folder to ensure you don't forget to process it.\n5. **Photos that are duplicates or near-duplicates**: If you have multiple versions of the same photo, put the duplicates in the \"Unsorted\" folder to decide which one to keep and which to delete.\n\n**How to manage the \"Unsorted\" or \"To Review\" folder:**\n\n1. **Regularly review the folder**: Set aside time to review the photos in the \"Unsorted\" or \"To Review\" folder and categorize them accordingly.\n2. **Use tags to identify issues**: Use tags to identify the reasons why a photo is in the \"Unsorted\" folder, such as \"blurry\", \"poor lighting\", \"unknown location\", or \"needs editing\".\n3. **Prioritize photos**: Prioritize photos in the \"Unsorted\" folder based on importance or urgency, and tackle the most critical ones first.\n4. **Keep the folder organized**: Keep the \"Unsorted\" folder organized by creating subfolders or using tags to categorize the photos within it.\n5. **Delete or merge duplicates**: Once you've reviewed the photos, delete or merge duplicates to avoid clutter and confusion.\n\n**Tips for using the \"Unsorted\" or \"To Review\" folder effectively:**\n\n1. **Keep the folder small**: Aim to keep the \"Unsorted\" folder relatively small by regularly reviewing and categorizing photos.\n2. **Use it as a temporary holding place**: Think of the \"Unsorted\" folder as a temporary holding place for photos that need further attention.\n3. **Don't let it become a black hole**: Avoid letting the \"Unsorted\" folder become a dumping ground for photos. Regularly review and categorize photos to keep your library organized.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to effectively use the \"Unsorted\" or \"To Review\" folder to manage photos that don't fit into a specific category or need further review.",
