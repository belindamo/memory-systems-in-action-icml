As a United Airlines credit cardholder, you've likely earned Chase Ultimate Rewards points or United MileagePlus miles. Unfortunately, you can't directly use those points or miles to book a business class ticket on British Airways.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be transferred to several airline loyalty programs, including United MileagePlus, but not British Airways Executive Club.\n* United MileagePlus miles can be used to book award flights on Star Alliance partners, but British Airways is not a part of the Star Alliance. British Airways is a member of the Oneworld alliance, which has its own set of airline partners and redemption rules.\n\nHowever, there are a few potential workarounds:\n\n1. **Transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Iberia Plus**: Iberia is a Oneworld partner, and you can transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Iberia Plus. From there, you can redeem Iberia Avios for British Airways flights. Keep in mind that Iberia's award chart and redemption rules might be different from British Airways.\n2. **Use a transferable points currency**: If you have points with a transferable currency like American Express Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, or Capital One Rewards, you might be able to transfer them to British Airways Executive Club or another Oneworld partner.\n3. **Book through a third-party booking platform**: Some third-party booking platforms, like Points.com or ExpertFlyer, allow you to redeem points or miles from various loyalty programs for flights on multiple airlines, including British Airways. Be aware that these platforms might charge fees or have limited availability.\n\nBefore exploring these options, I recommend checking the transfer partners, award charts, and redemption rules for each loyalty program to ensure you're getting the best value for your points or miles.\n\nIf you're not sure about the best way to redeem your points or miles, consider consulting with a travel rewards expert or a credit card concierge service. They can help you navigate the complex world of points and miles redemption.",
