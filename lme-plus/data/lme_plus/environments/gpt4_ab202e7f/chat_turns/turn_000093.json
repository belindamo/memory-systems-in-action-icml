By prepping individual ingredients, you'll have a variety of options to mix and match throughout the week.\n\nPrepping veggies like carrots and cucumbers is a fantastic starting point. They're easy to store and can be used in a variety of dishes, from snacks to salads to stir-fries. And cooking quinoa or rice in bulk is a great idea, as they're versatile grains that can be paired with many different ingredients.\n\nIt's awesome that you've already been doing some prep work, so you can build upon that momentum. By adding a few more components to your prep routine, you'll be amazed at how easy it becomes to throw together healthy meals and snacks.\n\nRemember, the key is to start small and be consistent. Don't feel like you need to prep an entire week's worth of meals in one day. Focus on adding one or two new components to your prep routine each week, and you'll be well on your way to making healthy eating a habit.\n\nAs you continue to prep, you might find that you're saving time during the week, reducing food waste, and enjoying the convenience of having healthy options readily available. And don't forget to pat yourself on the back for taking small steps towards a healthier lifestyle \u2013 every bit counts!\n\nWhat do you think about adding some protein sources to your prep routine, like hard-boiled eggs, cooked chicken, or tofu? These can be great additions to your component prep and can help make meal assembly even easier.",
