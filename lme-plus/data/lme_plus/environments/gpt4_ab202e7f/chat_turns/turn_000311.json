Local farmers' markets: Speak with farmers at local farmers' markets and ask if they know of any local chefs who support sustainability.\n\n2. Sustainable restaurants: Reach out to sustainable restaurants in the area and ask if they have any chefs who would be interested in teaching a cooking class.\n\n3. Local Sustainable Agriculture Organizations: Speak with local sustainable agriculture organizations or community farms, and ask if they have any leads on chefs or farmers who support sustainable practices.\n\n4. Sustainable Food Organizations: Reach out to local sustainable food organizations such as Slow Food USA or The James Beard Foundation to help connect you with local chefs and farmers.\n\n5. Sustainable Farm-to-Table Community Events: Attend local farm-to-table community events and speak with chefs and farmers there to see if they would be interested in leading cooking classes.\n\nBy partnering with local chefs and farmers, the resort can offer authentic and unique classes while supporting the local community and promoting sustainable practices.",
