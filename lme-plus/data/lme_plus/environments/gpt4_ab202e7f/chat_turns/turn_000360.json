  "content": "I'm looking for some book recommendations. I've been reading a lot lately, and I'm always looking to discover new authors and genres. I recently attended a literary festival at the university campus on January 25th, where I went to multiple book reading sessions. Those sessions really opened my eyes to different writing styles and themes. Can you suggest some books that might interest me based on that?",
