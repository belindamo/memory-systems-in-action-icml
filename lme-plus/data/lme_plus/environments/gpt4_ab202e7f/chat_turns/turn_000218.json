  "content": "David J. Collis is a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and a senior adviser at Bain & Company. In this article, he discusses the importance of a comprehensive approach to strategy, which he refers to as the \"complete strategy landscape\". According to Collis, this landscape is made up of four key elements: opportunity set, business model, competitive positioning, and realization of value over time. By considering all of these elements together, companies can better align their activities and make better strategic decisions. Collis uses the example of Edward Jones, a brokerage firm that is shifting its business model to a \"financial life solutions\" model in response to changes in the industry. By considering how this change will impact all aspects of its strategy, Edward Jones is able to make the shift more successfully.",
