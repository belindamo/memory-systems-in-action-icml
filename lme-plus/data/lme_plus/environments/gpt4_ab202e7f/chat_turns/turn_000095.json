It's easy to get sucked into the habit of relying on them, but it's great that you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to make a change.\n\nPrepping protein sources like hard-boiled eggs, cooked chicken, or tofu can be a game-changer. Having healthy options readily available can help you make better choices, even when you're in the middle of a binge-watching marathon.\n\nHere's a simple tip: try to prep a batch of protein sources on the weekend, when you have a bit more time. You can boil a dozen eggs, cook a few chicken breasts, or prep a block of tofu. Then, store them in individual portions in the fridge or freezer, so they're easy to grab and go.\n\nHaving these protein sources on hand can help you create quick and healthy meals, even when you're short on time. For example, you can add sliced chicken to a salad, make a protein-packed omelette with eggs, or toss tofu into a stir-fry with some prepped veggies.\n\nRemember, it's all about small changes and progress, not perfection. By prepping some protein sources, you'll be taking a step towards healthier habits and reducing your reliance on food delivery apps.\n\nWhat do you think about setting a goal to prep one protein source per week, and seeing how that goes? It could be a fun challenge to try out different recipes and ingredients, and you might be surprised at how much easier it is to make healthy choices when you have good options available.",
