Include veggies with different hues, such as green (broccoli, bell peppers), orange (carrots, sweet potatoes), red (bell peppers, tomatoes), yellow (yellow bell peppers, squash), and purple (eggplant, cabbage). This will ensure a visually appealing dish and a range of nutrients.\n2. **Texture Mix**: Combine veggies with different textures to add depth and interest. Crunchy (bell peppers, carrots), tender (broccoli, mushrooms), and soft (snow peas, green beans) veggies will create a pleasant mouthfeel.\n3. **Flavor Profiles**: Balance sweet, savory, and umami flavors by including veggies with different taste profiles.
