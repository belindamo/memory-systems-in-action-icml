  "content": "You're looking for the ultimate view! Rooms with a view of both the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound are indeed available at The Edgewater Hotel, but they're quite rare and highly sought after. These rooms are often referred to as \"Corner rooms\" or \"Panoramic View rooms,\" and they offer unobstructed views of both the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound.\n\n**Corner Rooms with Panoramic Views:**\n\nThese rooms are located on the northwest and southwest corners of the hotel, offering stunning views of both the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound. These rooms are typically larger than standard rooms and have floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides, providing an unparalleled panoramic view.\n\n* **Deluxe Corner Room with Panoramic View**:\n\t+ Low season (Nov-Mar): around $500-$600 per night\n\t+ Shoulder season (Apr-May, Sep-Oct): around $600-$700 per night\n\t+ High season (Jun-Aug): around $800-$900 per night\n* **Premium Corner Room with Panoramic View**:\n\t+ Low season (Nov-Mar): around $700-$800 per night\n\t+ Shoulder season (Apr-May, Sep-Oct): around $800-$900 per night\n\t+ High season (Jun-Aug): around $1,000-$1,200 per night\n\nKeep in mind that these rooms are extremely popular, and availability is limited. If you're interested in booking one of these rooms, I recommend doing so well in advance to ensure availability.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be prepared for a higher price point compared to standard rooms with a single view.\n* These rooms are often larger and more luxurious, making them a great option for special occasions or romantic getaways.\n* If you're booking a Corner Room with Panoramic View, be sure to request a high floor (5th floor or above) to maximize your view.\n\nWhen booking, it's essential to specify that you're interested in a Corner Room with Panoramic View, and the hotel will do its best to accommodate your request.",
