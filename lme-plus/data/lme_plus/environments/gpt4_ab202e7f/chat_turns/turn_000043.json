Here are some tips to help you cook dumplings perfectly:\n\n1. **Choose the right dumpling wrappers**: Fresh or frozen dumpling wrappers work well. If using frozen, thaw them first. Make sure they're not too thick or too thin, as this can affect cooking time.\n2. **Don't overfill the dumplings**: Leave a small border around the edges to allow for expansion during cooking. Overfilling can cause the dumplings to burst open during steaming.\n3. **Use a bamboo steamer**: A bamboo steamer is ideal for cooking dumplings, as it allows for even steam distribution and prevents the dumplings from sticking. You can also use a metal steamer with a heatproof plate.\n4. **Steam at the right temperature**: Steam the dumplings over boiling water, but make sure the water isn't too vigorously boiling. You want a gentle, steady steam. Aim for a temperature of around 180\u00b0F to 190\u00b0F (82\u00b0C to 88\u00b0C).\n5. **Cooking time**: Cooking time will vary depending on the size and type of dumplings. As a general rule, cook for 8-12 minutes for small to medium-sized dumplings, and 15-20 minutes for larger ones.\n6. **Check for doneness**: Check the dumplings after 8 minutes by carefully lifting the lid and peeking inside. They should be cooked through, but still slightly firm to the touch. If not, continue steaming in 2-minute increments until done.\n7. **Serve immediately**: Serve the dumplings immediately after steaming, while they're still hot and tender. You can serve them with your stir-fry, or with a dipping sauce of your choice.\n\nSome additional tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Make sure the dumplings are not crowded in the steamer, as this can cause them to stick together.\n* Use a gentle touch when handling the dumplings to prevent them from breaking open.\n* If you're using a metal steamer, you can add a piece of parchment paper or a silicone mat to prevent the dumplings from sticking.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to cook delicious, tender, and perfectly steamed dumplings to accompany your stir-fry!",
