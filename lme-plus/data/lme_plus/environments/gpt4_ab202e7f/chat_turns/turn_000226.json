  "content": "In our opinion, David J. Collis' approach to crafting a resilient strategy is wise because it emphasizes the importance of integrating all elements of the complete strategy landscape. This approach recognizes that competitive positioning is critical to value capture, but also emphasizes the need to consider alternative business models and to focus on execution through ongoing experimentation and adaptation.\n\nIn the context of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) situations, this approach works well because it allows organizations to be agile and adaptable, while also maintaining control through clear guidance and support for strategic initiatives. This enables companies to respond to changing circumstances and seize new opportunities, while also building the capabilities they need for long-term success. Overall, we believe that David J. Collis' approach is a valuable tool for crafting a resilient strategy in a rapidly changing world.",
