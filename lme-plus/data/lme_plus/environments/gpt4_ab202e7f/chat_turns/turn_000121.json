  "content": "Yes, there are several myths in Hindu mythology that explore the consequences of greed and selfishness, and how they can lead to negative outcomes. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. The story of King Nriga in the \"Mahabharata\" tells the tale of a king who gave away thousands of cows to his guests but accidentally gave a cow back to a Brahmin who had already received one. The damning consequence of this careless act was that he was transformed into a lizard.\n\n2. The story of the demon king Ravana in the \"Ramayana\" is another example. Ravana was consumed by his ambition and greed for power, which eventually leads to his downfall.\n\n3. The story of Hiranyakashipu, mentioned earlier, teaches lessons about pride and selfishness. Hiranyakashipu is a demon king who wants to be worshipped by everyone and is infuriated when his own son, Prahlada, refuses to worship him. His pride and selfishness lead to his death at the hands of Vishnu.\n\n4. The story of the demon Banasura in the \"Puranas\" teaches about the consequences of arrogance and greed. Banasura is a demon king who refuses to show respect to Lord Shiva and faces the consequences of his actions.\n\nOverall, Hindu mythology teaches about the importance of being selfless, generous, and empathetic, and the negative consequences of greed, arrogance, and selfishness.",
