Here are some tips to help you keep your granola fresh for a long time:\n\n1. **Airtight containers**: Store the granola in airtight containers, such as glass jars or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. This will prevent air, moisture, and pests from getting in.\n2. **Cool, dry place**: Store the containers in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cupboard. Avoid storing granola near a heat source, oven, or direct sunlight, as it can cause the ingredients to become rancid.\n3. **Layering**: If you're storing a large batch of granola, consider layering it in smaller containers or ziplock bags. This will help prevent the granola from becoming stale or soggy.\n4. **Freezer storage**: You can also store granola in the freezer to keep it fresh for a longer period. Simply transfer the granola to an airtight container or freezer bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and label it. Frozen granola will keep for up to 6 months.\n5. **Portion control**: Divide the granola into smaller portions (e.g., 1/2 cup or 1 cup) and store them in separate containers or bags. This will make it easier to grab a fresh portion whenever you want.\n6. **Check on it regularly**: Every few weeks, check the granola for signs of staleness, such as a musty smell or soft texture. If you notice any changes, it's time to make a fresh batch.\n7. **Use within 2-3 weeks**: As a general rule, homemade granola is best consumed within 2-3 weeks of making it. After that, the flavors and texture may start to degrade.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to keep your homemade granola fresh and delicious for a long time. Enjoy your Espresso Granola Parfait and other granola-based creations!",
