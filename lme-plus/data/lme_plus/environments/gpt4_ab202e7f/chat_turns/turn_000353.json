  "content": "In Death Stranding, the Bridge Babies are connected to the Chiral Bridge through a process called \"voidout,\" which involves surgically implanting the baby inside the stomach of a person known as a \"Porter.\" This allows the Porter to sense and detect supernatural phenomena, such as Beached Things (BTs), which helps them to navigate through the game's dangerous world. The process of implanting the babies is depicted as traumatic and painful, both for the babies and the Porter, and is a central theme in the game. It is also revealed that the babies are actually stillborn children of women who were pregnant at the time of the Death Stranding event, and that the Chiral Bridge technology was developed as a way to keep them alive and connected to the world of the living. The use of Bridge Babies is morally and ethically controversial and is a central theme throughout the game.",
