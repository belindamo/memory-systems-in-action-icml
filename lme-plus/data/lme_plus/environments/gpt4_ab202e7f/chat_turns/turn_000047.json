One such myth is that of Sang Nila Utama, who is said to have discovered Singapore in the 13th century. According to legend, Sang Nila Utama saw a strange animal which he later identified as a lion. This led him to name the island \"Singapura,\" which means \"Lion City\" in Malay. This myth has since become an important part of Singapore's national identity.\n\nAnother legend is that of the Five Stones game, which is a popular traditional game played in Singapore. According to the legend, the game was invented by a group of children who used five stones to play a game that represented the obstacles and challenges they faced in their daily lives. The game has since become an important part of the country's culture and identity and is often played at cultural festivals and events.\n\nThe legend of Badang is also an important part of Singapore's culture and identity.
