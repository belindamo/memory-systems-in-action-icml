  "content": "\"Salsa with Maria\" is a great resource for Salsa!\n\nFor Bachata, I think you might enjoy \"Bachata with Ana\" on YouTube. Ana is an experienced instructor who breaks down Bachata movements and techniques in a clear, easy-to-follow way. Her channel is perfect for beginners, and she has a gentle, encouraging teaching style.\n\nAna's videos cover various aspects of Bachata, including:\n\n* Basic steps and footwork\n* Body isolations and movement\n* Partner work and leading/following techniques\n* Shines and styling\n* Musicality and timing\n\nShe also has a series of videos specifically designed for beginners, which is great for those just starting out.\n\nAnother option is \"Bachata Addiction\" (which I mentioned earlier). Ataka and Alejandra, the instructors, have a very detailed and structured approach to teaching Bachata. They offer a free beginner's course on their website, which covers the fundamentals of Bachata.\n\nBoth \"Bachata with Ana\" and \"Bachata Addiction\" are excellent resources for beginners, and you can't go wrong with either one. If you prefer a more gentle, encouraging approach, Ana might be the way to go. If you prefer a more structured, detailed approach, Bachata Addiction is a great choice.\n\nRemember, the key to improving your Bachata skills is to practice regularly, so try to set aside time each week to work on your technique. You can also supplement your online learning with local classes or workshops, if possible.\n\nGood luck, and have fun learning Bachata!",
