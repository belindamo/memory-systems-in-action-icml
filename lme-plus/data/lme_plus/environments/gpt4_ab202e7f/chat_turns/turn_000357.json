  "content": "In Death Stranding, the game uses a variety of visual and narrative techniques to convey different themes and ideas. The scene you are describing where the camera goes down a person's throat and finds a baby may be symbolic or metaphorical, rather than depicting an actual event. The idea of the Bridge Babies being inside people may represent the connection between the characters and the babies, how they are carrying something precious and fragile and are willing to go through the traumatic experience of being a Porter to help others, and how they are keeping the babies alive. It may also be a representation of the heavy responsibility that the characters have in protecting the babies, and how they are connected to them emotionally. It's also worth noting that the game's creator, Hideo Kojima, is known for his use of symbolism and metaphors in his storytelling.",
