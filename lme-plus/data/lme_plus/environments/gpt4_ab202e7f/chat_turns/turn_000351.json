  "content": "In the game Death Stranding, \"Bridge Babies\" are infants who are connected to a device called the \"Chiral Bridge\" which allows them to sense and detect \"Beached Things\" (BTs) which are ghostly creatures that roam the world after the Death Stranding event, as well as other supernatural phenomena. The Bridge Babies are used by the organization known as \"Bridges\" to help locate and avoid BTs while on delivery missions. As the game progresses, it is revealed that the Bridge Babies are actually the stillborn children of women who were pregnant at the time of the Death Stranding event, and that the Chiral Bridge technology was developed as a way to keep them alive and connected to the world of the living. The use of Bridge Babies is morally and ethically controversial and is a central theme throughout the game.",
