Gently bring your attention back to your breath or chosen meditation object.\n\nYou're taking a great first step by exploring different resources and committing to a regular practice. Keep in mind that meditation is a journey, and it's okay to adjust your approach as you learn and grow.\n\nHow do you plan to incorporate these resources into your daily routine, and what are your goals for your meditation practice in the next few weeks?",
