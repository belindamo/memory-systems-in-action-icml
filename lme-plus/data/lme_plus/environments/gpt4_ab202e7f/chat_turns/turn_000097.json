  "content": "Exactly! Setting a goal to prep one protein source per week is a great way to start, and it's definitely achievable. By doing so, you'll be building a foundation for healthier habits and creating a sense of accomplishment as you reach your goal each week.\n\nAnd I love your idea of getting creative with different seasonings and spices! That's a great way to add variety to your protein sources and keep things interesting. You can try out different cuisines, like Korean-style chicken with Gochujang sauce or Mexican-inspired tofu with cumin and chili powder. The possibilities are endless!\n\nRemember, the key is to keep it simple and fun. Don't be too hard on yourself if you miss a week or two, but instead, focus on getting back on track and celebrating your small wins. As you get into the habit of prepping protein sources, you might find that you're more motivated to try new recipes and experiment with different flavors.\n\nTo help you stay on track, you might consider setting a specific day and time for your protein prep, like Sunday afternoons or Monday mornings. That way, it becomes a habit and you'll be more likely to stick to it.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you ready to get started and commit to prepping one protein source per week?",
