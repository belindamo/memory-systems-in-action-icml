The statue depicts a mythical creature that is half-lion and half-fish, with a lion's head and a fish's body. The Merlion is the national symbol of Singapore, and the statue stands as a monument to the city's origins and growth.\n\nThe origins of the Merlion statue date back to 1964 when the Singapore Tourism Board held a competition to design a new logo for the country. The winning design was submitted by Fraser Brunner, a British artist, who came up with the idea of the Merlion. The statue was later commissioned in 1971 by the Singapore Tourism Board to promote tourism in the country.\n\nThe Merlion statue is located at One Fullerton, overlooking Marina Bay, and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore. It stands at 8.6 meters high and weighs 70 tons, with water spouting from its mouth into the bay.\n\nThe cultural significance of the Merlion statue lies in its representation of Singapore's history and identity. The lion's head symbolizes Singapore's Malay name, Singapura, which means \"lion city,\" and the fish's body represents the city-state's origins as a fishing village. The statue also reflects the country's position as a maritime nation and its connection to the oceans.\n\nOver the years, the Merlion statue has become a beloved symbol of Singapore and a source of pride for its citizens. It has been featured on stamps, coins, and banknotes and has become a popular symbol of the city-state in souvenirs and merchandise.\n\nIn conclusion, the Merlion statue in New Town holds a special place in Singapore's history and culture. It is an iconic symbol of the country's origins, identity, and connection to the sea and is a source of pride for its citizens.",
