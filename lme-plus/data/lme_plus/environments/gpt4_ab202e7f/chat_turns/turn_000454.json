Latte art can be a bit tricky, but with practice, you'll get the hang of it.\n\nAs for espresso-based desserts, tiramisu and espresso brownies are excellent choices! Here are some recipes and tips to get you started:\n\n**Tiramisu Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 12-16 ladyfingers\n* 1 cup of strong espresso\n* 8 oz mascarpone cheese\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 large egg yolks\n* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* Cocoa powder for dusting\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Dip each ladyfinger into the espresso for about 3-5 seconds on each side. They should be soft and pliable but not too wet.\n2. In a separate bowl, combine the mascarpone cheese, granulated sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.\n3. To assemble, create a layer of ladyfingers in a large serving dish. Top with a layer of the mascarpone mixture, then repeat the process until you run out of ingredients.\n4. Dust with cocoa powder and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.\n\n**Espresso Brownies Recipe:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 and 1/2 sticks of unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan\n* 2 cups of sugar\n* 4 large eggs\n* 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder\n* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n* 1 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon of salt\n* 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips\n* 2 shots of espresso (about 1/4 cup)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan with butter and line with parchment paper.\n2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and cocoa powder. Set aside.\n3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.\n4. Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.\n5. Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave in 30-second increments, stirring between each interval until smooth. Allow to cool slightly.\n6. Add the melted chocolate and espresso to the batter. Mix until just combined.\n7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few moist crumbs.\n\nTips:\n\n* For both recipes, make sure to use high-quality espresso and chocolate for the best flavor.\n* When making tiramisu, it's essential to dip the ladyfingers quickly and evenly to prevent them from becoming too soggy.\n* For the espresso brownies, don't overmix the batter, as this can result in a dense and tough texture.\n\nI hope you enjoy these recipes!
