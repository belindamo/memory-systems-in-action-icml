  "content": "The Olympic Mountains are a stunning sight, and The Edgewater Hotel does offer rooms with views of the Olympic Mountains, although they might not be as plentiful as rooms with Puget Sound views. Here's what you can expect:\n\n* **Olympic Mountain View Rooms**: These rooms are located on the north side of the hotel, and they offer views of the Olympic Mountains, including Mount Olympus and the surrounding ranges. These rooms are typically located on higher floors (5th floor and above) to ensure an unobstructed view.\n* **Partial Olympic Mountain View Rooms**: Some rooms on the south side of the hotel may offer partial views of the Olympic Mountains, although they might be obstructed by other buildings or trees. These rooms are usually priced lower than rooms with direct Olympic Mountain views.\n\nKeep in mind that the Olympic Mountain views might not be as expansive as the Puget Sound views, due to the hotel's location on the waterfront. However, the Olympic Mountains are still a breathtaking sight, especially during sunrise and sunset when they're bathed in golden light.\n\nWhen booking, be sure to request an Olympic Mountain View Room or Partial Olympic Mountain View Room specifically. The hotel will do its best to accommodate your request, but it's not guaranteed. You can also ask about the room's orientation and view when you check-in to ensure you get the best possible view.\n\nHere are some approximate price ranges for Olympic Mountain View Rooms:\n\n* **Deluxe Olympic Mountain View Room**:\n\t+ Low season (Nov-Mar): around $300-$400 per night\n\t+ Shoulder season (Apr-May, Sep-Oct): around $400-$500 per night\n\t+ High season (Jun-Aug): around $550-$650 per night\n* **Premium Olympic Mountain View Room**:\n\t+ Low season (Nov-Mar): around $400-$500 per night\n\t+ Shoulder season (Apr-May, Sep-Oct): around $500-$600 per night\n\t+ High season (Jun-Aug): around $700-$800 per night\n\nRemember to check the hotel's website or contact them directly for the most up-to-date pricing and availability.",
