  "content": "David J. Collis's approach is a comprehensive and integrated approach to strategic management. He argues that successful strategy involves more than just identifying an attractive industry or defining a competitive advantage. Instead, it requires a series of interconnected choices about which opportunities to pursue, how much value the firm can create and capture, and how to keep realizing value and build a foundation for long-term success.\n\nThis approach is particularly relevant in today's VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) business environment. The rapid pace of technological change, shifting global economic dynamics, and increased competition from both traditional and non-traditional sources make it essential for firms to be able to adapt and respond to changing market conditions.\n\nCollis's approach provides a framework for doing just that. By considering the complete strategy landscape - including the opportunity set, business model, competitive positioning, and the ability to keep realizing value over the long-term - firms are better equipped to identify and exploit new opportunities while also building the capabilities they need to succeed in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, Collis's emphasis on experimentation, learning, and adaptation is particularly relevant in VUCA situations. By encouraging teams to experiment with new configurations and approaches, firms can stay ahead of the curve and maintain a competitive edge. And by consistently investing in capabilities and building organizational resilience, firms can better weather the storms of volatility and uncertainty.\n\nOverall, Collis's approach is a wise one that can help firms navigate the complex and rapidly changing business landscape. It provides a comprehensive and integrated framework for identifying and pursuing new opportunities while also building the capabilities necessary for long-term success.",
