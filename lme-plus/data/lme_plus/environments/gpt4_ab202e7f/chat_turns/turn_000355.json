  "content": "Yes, in the game Death Stranding, the Bridge Babies are not physically implanted inside the player's stomach, but are instead carried in special containers called \"Incubators\" which are worn on the back. The Porter, which is the player character, can communicate with the Bridge Baby via a umbilical cord-like structure and can sense the presence of supernatural phenomena through this connection, which helps them navigate through the game's dangerous world. The Incubator also contains a life support system that keeps the baby alive. The game depicts the Bridge Babies as being precious and fragile, and the player must take care to protect them while on delivery missions. The use of Bridge Babies is morally and ethically controversial and is a central theme throughout the game.",
