  "content": "In the articles, David J. Collis discusses a comprehensive approach to strategy that encompasses the entire strategy landscape, including the opportunity set, business model, competitive positioning, execution, and outcome. He argues that a complete strategy must align all of these elements in order to be effective.\n\nCollis begins by explaining the importance of identifying opportunities in the external environment and how these opportunities can be exploited through the development of a business model. He notes that the more value a business model creates, the more competition it is likely to face, and that it is essential for firms to apply frameworks such as industry attractiveness, competitive positioning, and competitive interaction in order to capture sufficient value.\n\nCollis then discusses the importance of execution in realizing value over time. He notes that firms must balance agility and control in order to adapt to changing opportunities and build the capabilities required for long-term success. He recommends a strategic approach that champions experimentation within clearly established bounds and emphasizes the need for regular after-action reviews in order to continually improve and adapt.\n\nCollis also emphasizes the need for integration across the entire strategy landscape. He argues that a firm's positioning, business model, and execution must all be aligned in order to create and capture value. He provides the example of Edward Jones, a brokerage firm that is shifting from a product-based business model to a financial life solutions model in order to create more value for customers and avoid commoditization.\n\nOverall, Collis argues that a complete strategy must align all of the elements of the strategy landscape in order to be effective. He emphasizes the need for firms to identify opportunities, develop a value-creating business model, establish a sustainable competitive advantage, and execute on a plan that builds capabilities for the future. By integrating these elements, firms can increase their chances of long-term success.",
