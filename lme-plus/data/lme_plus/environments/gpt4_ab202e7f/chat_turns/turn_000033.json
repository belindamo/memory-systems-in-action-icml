I'm happy to help you with some veggie-packed recipe suggestions!\n\nHere are a few ideas that use up a lot of veggies:\n\n1. **Veggie Stir-Fry Extravaganza**: This recipe is a great way to use up any combination of veggies you have on hand. Simply saut\u00e9 a mix of veggies like broccoli, bell peppers, carrots, mushrooms, and onions in a wok or large skillet with some oil, garlic, and ginger. Serve over rice or noodles.\n2. **Roasted Vegetable Soup**: Roasting brings out the natural sweetness in veggies, making them perfect for a hearty soup. Toss your favorite veggies (such as sweet potatoes, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and carrots) with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast in the oven until tender. Then, blend with broth and cream for a creamy soup.\n3. **Veggie-Packed Quinoa Bowl**: Cook quinoa and top it with a variety of roasted or saut\u00e9ed veggies like kale, cherry tomatoes, avocado, and sweet potatoes. Add some nuts or seeds for crunch and a tangy tahini dressing for extra flavor.\n4. **Grilled Veggie Wrap**: Fill large tortillas with grilled slices of zucchini, eggplant, red bell peppers, and onions, along with hummus, feta cheese, and mixed greens.\n5. **Lentil and Veggie Curry**: Cook lentils and add them to a flavorful curry made with onions, ginger, garlic, and a variety of veggies like carrots, potatoes, and green beans. Serve over rice or with naan bread.\n6. **Veggie-Loaded Frittata**: Whisk together eggs, salt, and pepper, then add diced veggies like bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and spinach. Pour the mixture into a greased skillet and cook until set.\n7. **Stuffed Bell Peppers**: Fill bell peppers with a mix of cooked rice, black beans, diced tomatoes, and shredded cheese, along with saut\u00e9ed onions and mushrooms. Bake until the peppers are tender and the filling is hot and bubbly.\n\nThese recipes are all great ways to use up a variety of veggies and are perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or a weekend meal prep. Enjoy experimenting and happy cooking!\n\n(By the way, I'm happy to hear about your kitchen shelves, but I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I didn't know about your kitchen shelves before. But I'm always here to help with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss!)",
