  "content": "According to Hindu mythology, Daksha cursed Chandra to wax and wane every month after Chandra failed to give equal attention and affection to his 27 wives, who are believed to represent the 27 lunar mansions or Nakshatras. Chandra used to spend most of his time with his favorite wife, Rohini, and neglect his other wives.\n\nDaksha, who was Rohini's father, was angry with Chandra's behavior and cursed him to gradually lose his light and become dark. The curse was so powerful that it affected Chandra's beauty, power, and influence on humans.\n\nAs a result of the curse, Chandra began to wax and wane every month, losing and regaining his brightness over a 30-day cycle. Chandra became desperate to rid himself of the curse and requested the help of several Hindu gods, including Vishnu and Shiva.\n\nVishnu advised Chandra to perform penance for 1,000 years to please Lord Shiva, who is known for his forgiving nature. Chandra followed Vishnu's advice and performed a severe penance in a forest. Lord Shiva, impressed with Chandra's devotion, appeared before him and blessed him.\n\nShiva declared that Chandra would be able to regain his light, beauty, and power for 15 days every month, after which he would start to lose his brightness again, following the same cycle that he had been cursed to.\n\nSince then, Chandra has waxed and waned every month, following the same cycle, and his beauty and power have been partially restored. Despite his curse, Chandra is still considered a powerful deity in Hinduism, and people offer prayers and seek his blessings for good health, prosperity, and longevity.",
