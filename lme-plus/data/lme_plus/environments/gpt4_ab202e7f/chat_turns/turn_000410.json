Planning your weathering approach and studying reference images will definitely help you achieve a more realistic and accurate look for your P-51 Mustang. And don't hesitate to experiment with different products and techniques to find what works best for you.\n\nRemember, weathering is all about subtlety and restraint. It's easy to get carried away and add too much weathering, but it's harder to remove it once it's been applied. So, start with a light hand and build up gradually.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. I'm always here to help. And don't forget to have fun and enjoy the process of building your P-51 Mustang!\n\nBy the way, I'm curious - what inspired you to build a P-51 Mustang, and what's your favorite thing about this aircraft?",
