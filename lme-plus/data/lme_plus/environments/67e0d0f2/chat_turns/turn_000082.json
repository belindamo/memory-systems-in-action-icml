A lamp that provides sufficient brightness can help reduce eye strain and alleviate headaches.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when looking for a brighter lamp:\n\n* **Lumens:** Look for a lamp with a higher lumens rating. A minimum of 500-800 lumens is a good starting point, but you may need more depending on your specific needs.\n* **Wattage:** While wattage isn't always a direct indicator of brightness, a higher wattage lamp (e.g., 9W-12W) can provide more light output.\n* **LED type:** LEDs are generally brighter and more energy-efficient than traditional bulbs. Look for lamps with high-quality LEDs that provide a high color rendering index (CRI) for better color accuracy.\n\nAdjustability is also important, but I'd consider it a secondary priority in your case. A lamp with adjustable features like a flexible arm, swivel head, or tilting shade can help you direct the light exactly where you need it, which can be beneficial for reducing eye strain. However, if the lamp isn't bright enough, adjustability might not make a significant difference.\n\nWhen you're shopping for a new lamp, consider the following:\n\n* Read reviews: Check reviews from other customers to see how bright they find the lamp and if it's suitable for their needs.\n* Check the specs: Look for lamps with clear specifications on brightness, lumens, and wattage to ensure you're getting a lamp that meets your requirements.\n* Test it out: If possible, try out the lamp in person before purchasing to get a sense of its brightness and adjustability.\n\nRemember, it's essential to find a lamp that meets your specific needs and preferences. If you're still unsure, you could consider visiting IKEA again to check out the lamp you liked, or explore other options that fit your criteria.",
