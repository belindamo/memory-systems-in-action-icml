  "content": "I think mentioning the car wash in the motorcycle ad might be a bit unrelated, and it might not be relevant to potential buyers. The ad should focus on the motorcycle itself, its features, condition, and any unique selling points.\n\nHowever, if you're planning to sell the car as well, you could consider creating a separate ad for it and mention the car wash and detailing service you plan to use to get it cleaned up before selling. This could be a nice touch to showcase the car's cleanliness and appeal to potential buyers.\n\nBut for the motorcycle ad, stick to highlighting its best features, condition, and any relevant details that will attract potential buyers. You can always mention the car wash and detailing service in a separate conversation with potential buyers if they ask about the motorcycle's cleanliness or maintenance history.\n\nRemember to keep the ad focused, clear, and concise, and make sure to include plenty of high-quality photos to showcase the motorcycle from different angles. Good luck with the sale!",
