In Costa Rica, I'll probably focus on the Arenal area and explore the national parks and beaches around there. In Thailand, I'll likely focus on Phuket and maybe take a few day trips to the surrounding islands. What are some must-know tips or precautions for traveling in these countries, especially when it comes to outdoor activities and interacting with locals?",
