  "content": "I didn't see the twist coming at all! I was completely blindsided, and it was one of those moments where I had to pause the audiobook and process what just happened. I think that's what made it so great, though - it was a complete surprise, but it still made sense in retrospect. I love when authors can pull off a twist like that.\n\nSpeaking of authors, I've been meaning to explore more of Gillian Flynn's works. I've already listened to \"Gone Girl\" and loved it, but I haven't gotten around to \"Sharp Objects\" yet. Would you recommend it?",
