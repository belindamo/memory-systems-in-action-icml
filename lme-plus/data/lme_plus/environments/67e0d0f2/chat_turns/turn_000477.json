  "content": "It's not clear how Lucy, the character in the story, is able to attend social events and parties while in her flattened form. The story doesn't specify how she is able to participate in these activities, so it's possible that she has some special adaptations or accommodations that allow her to do so.\n\nIn general, people who are unable to move or stand on their own may have difficulty participating in social events and parties. These activities often require mobility and the ability to interact with others, which can be challenging for someone who is confined to a flat, stationary position.\n\nHowever, it's possible that Lucy could find ways to participate in social events and parties even in her flattened form. For example, she could use a special device or vehicle to transport herself to the event, or she could use technology such as a computer or phone to communicate and interact with others remotely.\n\nWithout more information about Lucy's body and how it functions, it's difficult to say for sure how she is able to attend social events and parties. It's possible that she has some special adaptations or accommodations that allow her to participate in these activities, or it could be that the story simply doesn't address this aspect of her life.",
