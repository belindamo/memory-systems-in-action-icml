I'd be happy to help you find a complementary gift for your sister's birthday.\n\nConsidering you got her a delicate silver necklace with a heart-shaped pendant, here are some ideas that might resonate with her style:\n\n1. **Earrings to match**: A pair of dainty silver earrings with a similar heart-shaped design or a minimalist stud would complement the necklace nicely.\n2. **Personalized charm**: A small, customized charm with her initials, name, or a special message can add a thoughtful touch to the necklace or be worn separately on a chain.\n3. **Layering necklace**: A shorter, delicate chain with a small pendant, like a tiny star, moon, or dot, can be layered with the heart-shaped necklace for a trendy look.\n4. **Bracelet**: A simple silver cuff or a delicate chain bracelet with a small charm or pendant can complement the necklace and add a touch of elegance.\n5. **Jewelry box or case**: A beautifully crafted jewelry box or travel case with a soft velvet interior can help her store and organize her jewelry collection.\n6. **Candle or home decor**: A luxurious candle, a decorative vase, or a beautiful piece of home decor with a similar aesthetic to the boutique store's style can complement her personal taste.\n7. **Experience gift**: Treat her to a fun experience, like a wine and jewelry-making workshop, a spa day, or a concert ticket, to create lasting memories.\n8. **Upgrade or add-on**: If you want to build upon the original gift, consider adding a chain extender, a pendant enhancer, or upgrading the necklace's chain to a higher-quality material.\n\nKeep in mind your sister's personal style, preferences, and interests when choosing a gift. If you're still unsure, you could consider asking her friends or family members for input or dropping hints to get a better sense of what she'd love.\n\nI hope these ideas help you find the perfect birthday gift for your sister!",
