  "content": "These reviews are for a 4-slice toaster on Amazon. Most of the reviewers were not satisfied with their purchase. The first reviewer said that the toaster does not toast evenly and that her bread slices are too large for the toaster. Another reviewer said that the top of the bread does not get toasted as much as the rest of the slice. A third reviewer mentioned that the toaster is quite big and lightweight, with a short cord, and that the eject function is jarring and loud. However, the same reviewer liked the wide slots and the ability to cook four slices at once. The last reviewer also mentioned that the top of the bread does not get toasted, and that the clean-out tray does not catch all the crumbs. Overall, the reviewers found the toaster unsatisfactory and would not recommend it.",
