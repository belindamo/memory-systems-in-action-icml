  "content": "I'm glad you're excited to check out Something Rotten! I think you'll really enjoy its unique blend of humor, wit, and catchy music.\n\nAnd I completely agree with you about The Book of Mormon soundtrack! It's an amazing show with an incredible score, and it's great that you've been enjoying it on your daily commute. There's something about musical theater soundtracks that can really make a commute more enjoyable, isn't there?\n\nReliving the music and story of a show like The Book of Mormon can be a great way to experience it again, even if you're not physically in the theater. And it's amazing how certain songs or moments can transport you back to the emotions and feelings you had when you first saw the show.\n\nDo you have a favorite song or moment from The Book of Mormon that always gets you pumped up or puts a smile on your face during your commute?\n\n(And don't worry, I won't judge you if you're belting out \"Hasa Diga Eebowai\" at the top of your lungs on the bus)",
