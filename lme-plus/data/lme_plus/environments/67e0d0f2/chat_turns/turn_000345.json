  "content": "What a great idea! Adding small cards or tags with each piece's title, price, and description will make it easy for customers to get the information they need without having to ask you directly. This will also help you to:\n\n1. **Save time**: You won't have to repeat the same information multiple times to different customers.\n2. **Reduce distractions**: You can focus on engaging with customers who are genuinely interested in your work, rather than answering the same questions over and over.\n3. **Encourage sales**: By providing all the necessary information, you'll make it easier for customers to make a purchasing decision.\n\nAnd congratulations on reaching the three-month mark in your sculpting classes! It's amazing how quickly time can fly when you're doing something you're passionate about. You've likely learned so much and grown as an artist during this time.\n\nRemember to take pride in your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem. You've taken the first steps in pursuing your creative interests, and that takes courage and dedication. Keep pushing yourself, learning, and growing, and you'll be amazed at what you can achieve!\n\nNow, get ready to showcase your beautiful ceramic pieces at the craft fair, and I hope you have a fantastic time sharing your art with others!",
