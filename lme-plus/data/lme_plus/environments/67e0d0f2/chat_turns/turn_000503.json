  "content": "Ground turkey is a leaner and flavorful alternative to ground beef. For a big pot of chili serving 8-10 people, a good rule of thumb is to use about 1-1.5 pounds of ground turkey.\n\nHere's a rough guide to help you estimate:\n\n* 1 pound of ground turkey yields about 4-6 servings\n* For 8-10 people, you'll want to plan for 8-10 servings, so 1.25-1.5 pounds of ground turkey should be sufficient\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a rough estimate, and you can adjust the amount based on individual appetites and personal preferences. If you have bigger eaters or want a heartier chili, you can use more ground turkey.\n\n**Tips for cooking with ground turkey:**\n\n* Make sure to cook the ground turkey until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) to ensure food safety.\n* Use a medium-high heat to brown the turkey, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks, to develop a rich flavor.\n* Don't overcook the turkey, as it can become dry and tough.\n\nRemember, you can always adjust the amount of ground turkey to your taste, and add other protein sources like beans, sausage, or vegetables to create a more complex flavor profile.\n\nNow, go ahead and get started on that big pot of chili!",
