  "content": "The Synology DiskStation DS920+ is a great choice for media streaming, and it's compatible with various media formats, including 4K video files. Here's what you need to know about its transcoding capabilities and codec support:\n\n**Transcoding:**\n\n* The DS920+ is capable of transcoding media files, including 4K video, using its built-in video transcoding engine. This means it can convert media files into a format that's compatible with your Samsung 4K smart TV.\n* The NAS's transcoding engine is powered by a quad-core processor, which provides a good balance between performance and power efficiency.\n* However, it's essential to note that 4K video transcoding is a resource-intensive process. The NAS's transcoding engine can handle 4K video files, but it might not be able to transcode them in real-time, especially if the files are heavily encoded or have high bitrates.\n\n**Codec support:**\n\n* The DS920+ supports a wide range of media codecs, including:\n\t+ Video codecs: H.264, H.265 (HEVC), MPEG-4, MPEG-2, VC-1, and more\n\t+ Audio codecs: AAC, AC3, DTS, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, and more\n* The NAS also supports various container formats, including MP4, MKV, AVI, and more\n* For 4K video playback, the DS920+ supports the following codecs:\n\t+ H.265 (HEVC) up to 4K at 30fps\n\t+ H.264 up to 4K at 30fps\n\n**4K video playback:**\n\n* The DS920+ can stream 4K video files to your Samsung 4K smart TV, but the playback smoothness may vary depending on the file's bitrate, codec, and resolution.\n* To ensure smooth playback, it's recommended to:\n\t+ Use a wired Ethernet connection between the NAS and your router\n\t+ Ensure your TV is connected to the same network as the NAS\n\t+ Use a compatible media player app on your TV that supports the necessary codecs\n\t+ Adjust the transcoding settings on the NAS to optimize performance\n\n**Additional tips:**\n\n* Make sure to check the compatibility of your 4K video files with the DS920+ using Synology's media compatibility checker tool.\n* If you have a large collection of 4K video files, consider using a more powerful NAS model or a dedicated media server.\n* You may need to adjust the NAS's transcoding settings or use a third-party media player app on your TV to optimize playback quality.\n\nIn summary, the Synology DiskStation DS920+ is capable of transcoding 4K video files and supports the necessary codecs for smooth playback on your Samsung 4K smart TV. However, the playback quality may vary depending on the file's characteristics and the NAS's transcoding performance.",
