  "content": "It's not clear how the two sisters, Emily and Sarah, care for Lucy in the story. The story doesn't specify how they provide for her needs or support her, so it's possible that they have developed some special techniques or routines to help her.\n\nIn general, people who are unable to move or care for themselves need to rely on others for support and assistance. This could involve helping them with basic tasks such as eating and bathing, or it could involve providing emotional support and companionship.\n\nWithout more information about the specific needs of Lucy and the resources available to the sisters, it's difficult to say for sure how they care for her. It's possible that they have developed some special techniques or routines to help her with her daily needs, or it could be that the story simply doesn't address this aspect of their lives.",
