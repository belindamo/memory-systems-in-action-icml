Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set up a media server on your NAS and configure it to stream media files to your TV:\n\n**Step 1: Enable Media Server on the DS920+**\n\n1. Open the Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) web interface by typing the NAS's IP address in your web browser.\n2. Log in to the DSM using your admin account.\n3. Go to the \"Control Panel\" and select \"File Services\" > \"Media Server\".\n4. Enable the \"Media Server\" service by checking the box next to \"Enable Media Server\".\n5. Set the \"Media Server Name\" and \"Media Server Port\" as desired.\n\n**Step 2: Configure Media Server Settings**\n\n1. In the \"Media Server\" section, click on \"Settings\".\n2. Set the \"Media Server Type\" to \"DLNA/UPnP\" (this is the protocol supported by most smart TVs, including Samsung).\n3. Set the \"Media Folder\" to the folder where you store your media files on the NAS.\n4. Set the \"Transcoding Settings\" to optimize performance for your TV (you can choose from various preset settings or customize them manually).\n\n**Step 3: Add Media Folders**\n\n1. In the \"Media Server\" section, click on \"Media Folders\".\n2. Click \"Create\" to add a new media folder.\n3. Select the folder where you store your media files on the NAS.\n4. Choose the media type (e.g., video, music, photos) and set the folder's permissions.\n\n**Step 4: Configure TV Settings**\n\n1. On your Samsung 4K smart TV, go to the \"Settings\" menu.\n2. Select \"Network\" > \"Network Settings\".\n3. Ensure that the TV is connected to the same network as the NAS.\n4. Set the TV's DLNA/UPnP settings to enable media streaming from the NAS.\n\n**Step 5: Connect to the Media Server**\n\n1. On your TV, go back to the \"Settings\" menu.\n2. Select \"Apps\" > \"Media Player\" (or the app you want to use to stream media files).\n3. Select \"Network\" > \"DLNA/UPnP\" as the media source.\n4. Your TV should now detect the Synology DiskStation DS920+ media server.\n5. Select the media server and choose the media folder you created earlier.\n\n**Step 6: Stream Media Files**\n\n1. On your TV, navigate to the media folder you created.\n2. Select a media file to play (e.g., a movie or TV show).\n3. The file should now stream from the NAS to your TV.\n\nThat's it! You should now be able to stream media files from your Synology DiskStation DS920+ to your Samsung 4K smart TV. If you encounter any issues, ensure that:\n\n* The NAS and TV are connected to the same network.\n* The media server is enabled and configured correctly on the NAS.\n* The TV's DLNA/UPnP settings are enabled.\n* The media files are in a compatible format and are stored in the designated media folder on the NAS.\n\nI hope this helps!
