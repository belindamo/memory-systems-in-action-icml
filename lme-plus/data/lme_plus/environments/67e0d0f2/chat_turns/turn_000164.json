Based on the events you've mentioned, here's a breakdown of your contributions:\n\n* **Education**: $120 (from \"Bake Sale for Education\")\n* **Healthcare**: $250 (from \"Walk for Cancer\")\n* **Homelessness**: $600 (from \"Gala for the Homeless\")\n* **Food Security**: $300 (from \"Food Drive\")\n* **Animal Welfare**: $0 (no direct contributions, but you've been volunteering your time at the \"Animal Shelter\")\n\nNote that the \"Polar Bear Plunge\" funds might not fit neatly into one category, as the event might support a general charitable organization or a cause that doesn't fit into the above categories. If you know the specific cause or organization that benefited from the \"Polar Bear Plunge\", please let me know and I can update the categorization.\n\nHere's a summary of your charitable giving by cause:\n\n* Healthcare: 14% ($250 / $1,770)\n* Education: 7% ($120 / $1,770)\n* Homelessness: 34% ($600 / $1,770)\n* Food Security: 17% ($300 / $1,770)\n* Animal Welfare: 0% (volunteer time only)\n\nThis breakdown can help you understand how your charitable giving is distributed across different causes. You might find it useful to review this distribution and consider adjusting your giving strategy to align with your values and priorities.",
