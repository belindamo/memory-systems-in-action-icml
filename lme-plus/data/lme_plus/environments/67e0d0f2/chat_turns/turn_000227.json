Adjust this goal as needed based on your progress.\n2. **Social media usage**: Decide on specific times of the day when you'll allow yourself to use social media, e.g., 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening. Stick to these times to avoid mindless scrolling.\n3. **Screen-free zones**: Designate certain areas or times of the day as screen-free, e.g., during meals, an hour before bedtime, or during family time.\n4. **Log your progress**: Update your tracker at the end of each day, reflecting on your screen time and social media usage.

Set reminders or calendar events to help you stay on track.\n3. **Find alternative activities**: Replace screen time with activities you enjoy, such as reading, exercise, or hobbies.\n4. **Review and adjust**: Regularly review your tracker to identify patterns and areas for improvement. Adjust your goals and rules as needed to stay motivated.\n\nBy tracking your screen time and limiting your social media usage, you'll be more mindful of your habits and can make positive changes to reduce your overall screen time.
