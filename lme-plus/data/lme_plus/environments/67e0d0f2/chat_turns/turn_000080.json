Since you didn't get a chance to buy it, I can suggest some alternatives that might fit the bill. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Task lamps with a similar design:**\n\t* Amazon's AmazonBasics LED Task Lamp (~ $25) - A simple, adjustable lamp with a compact design.\n\t* Target's Threshold Adjustable Task Lamp (~ $30) - A modern, sleek lamp with a flexible arm.\n\t* Walmart's Mainstays Flexible Arm Desk Lamp (~ $25) - A budget-friendly option with a similar design to IKEA's lamps.\n2. **Lamps with similar features:**\n\t* Anker's LED Desk Lamp (~ $40) - A highly adjustable lamp with a USB port and a modern design.\n\t* TaoTronics LED Desk Lamp (~ $35) - A feature-rich lamp with a touch-sensitive dimmer, USB port, and a compact design.\n\t* BenQ's e-Reading Desk Lamp (~ $50) - A lamp specifically designed for reading and working, with a focus on eye care and comfort.\n3. **IKEA alternatives:**\n\t* If you're set on an IKEA lamp, you can try checking their website or other online marketplaces like Amazon for the specific lamp you liked. You might be able to find it online or get it delivered to your doorstep.\n\nWhen shopping for a new desk lamp, consider the following factors:\n\n* Brightness: Look for a lamp with adjustable brightness or a high lumens rating (e.g., 500-1000 lumens) to ensure it's bright enough for your needs.\n* Color temperature: If you're sensitive to blue light, look for lamps with a warmer tone (e.g., 2700K-3000K) or those with adjustable color temperature.\n* Adjustability: A lamp with a flexible arm or adjustable head can help you direct the light exactly where you need it.\n* Power source: Consider a lamp with a USB port or a built-in USB hub to keep your devices charged.\n\nI hope this helps you find a suitable replacement for your current desk lamp!",
