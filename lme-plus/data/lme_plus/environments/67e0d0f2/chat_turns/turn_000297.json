Mid-century modern is a fantastic style for a coffee table, and it can add a lot of character to your living room.\n\nStyling a coffee table, especially with a mid-century modern vibe, is all about creating a thoughtful and intentional arrangement of decorative items. Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Keep it Simple**: Mid-century modern design is all about clean lines, minimal ornamentation, and an emphasis on function. Avoid cluttering your coffee table with too many items.\n2. **Choose a Focal Point**: Select a statement piece, like a decorative vase, a sculptural object, or a unique decorative box, to anchor the arrangement. This will draw the eye to the coffee table and create visual interest.\n3. **Add a Plant**: A small potted plant or a vase with fresh flowers can bring a touch of natural elegance to your coffee table. Choose a plant with a simple, sleek pot that fits with the mid-century modern aesthetic.\n4. **Incorporate Books and Magazines**: A few carefully chosen books or magazines can add a layer of sophistication to your coffee table. Look for titles with simple, minimalist covers that fit with the mid-century modern vibe.\n5. **Add a Decorative Tray**: A small decorative tray can help corral small items like coasters, remotes, or other knick-knacks, keeping the surface of the coffee table clean and clutter-free.\n6. **Bring in Texture**: Mix different textures like wood, metal, glass, or ceramics to add depth and visual interest to your arrangement.\n7. **Keep it Balanced**: Balance the arrangement by distributing the items in a way that creates visual harmony. You can use the rule of thirds to place items along the coffee table's surface.\n\nHere's an example of how you could style your mid-century modern coffee table:\n\n* Place a small, sleek vase with a single stem of eucalyptus or a simple bouquet on one side of the coffee table.\n* Add a decorative tray with a few carefully chosen coffee table books or a small bowl with river rocks.\n* Place a small potted plant or a decorative box on the other side of the coffee table.\n* Add a few coasters or a small decorative item, like a geometric-shaped paperweight, to fill in any gaps.\n\nRemember, the key is to keep it simple, elegant, and intentional. Don't be afraid to experiment and move things around until you find a arrangement that feels balanced and visually appealing to you.\n\nAs for your IKEA bookcase, $80 is a steal! You can style it by grouping books by color, author, or genre, or by mixing in decorative objects like vases, sculptures, or framed photos. You could also add some greenery, like a small potted plant or a vase with fresh branches, to bring in a natural touch.\n\nDo you have any other questions about styling your coffee table or bookcase?",
