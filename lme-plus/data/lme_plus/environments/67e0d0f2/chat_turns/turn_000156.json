  "content": "Now we have enough information to solve for x.\n\nLet's use the equation we set up earlier:\n\nTeam's total contribution = x + $1,380\n\nWe know the team's total contribution is $1,500, so we can plug that in:\n\n$1,500 = x + $1,380\n\nSubtract $1,380 from both sides to solve for x:\n\nx = $1,500 - $1,380\nx = $120\n\nSo, your individual contribution to the \"Bake Sale for Education\" event is $120.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount you've raised so far:\n\n$250 (from Walk for Cancer) + $120 (from Bake Sale for Education) = $370\n\nYou've raised a total of $370 so far!",
