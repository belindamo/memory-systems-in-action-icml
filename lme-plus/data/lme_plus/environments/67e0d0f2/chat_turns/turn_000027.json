  "content": "Yes, there are countless examples of humanitarian missions that have required a task force. One recent example is the response to Hurricane Dorian, which devastated parts of the Bahamas in September 2019. In response to the disaster, a task force was formed involving multiple organizations and agencies, including the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the Red Cross, and various national governments. The task force was responsible for coordinating and providing relief efforts, such as distributing food, water, and medical supplies to those affected, deploying search and rescue teams to find survivors, and setting up temporary shelters for displaced individuals. The task force also worked to assess the extent of the damage and develop plans for long-term recovery efforts.",
