  "content": "For the \"Gala for the Homeless\", I actually spent $500 on a painting at the live auction, and my ticket price was $100, so I didn't really \"raise\" any funds there. For the \"Food Drive\", we collected $300 in cash donations. At the \"Polar Bear Plunge\", I raised $500 in donations. As for the \"Animal Shelter\", I don't think I raised any funds, but I've been volunteering my time regularly. Let's focus on the cash amounts for now.",
