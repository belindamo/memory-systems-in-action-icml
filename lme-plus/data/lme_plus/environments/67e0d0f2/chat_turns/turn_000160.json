Now, let's add the amounts from the other events:\n\n* \"Food Drive\": $300 in cash donations\n* \"Polar Bear Plunge\": $500 in donations\n\nAdd these amounts to your initial total:\n\n$370 + $300 = $670\n$670 + $500 = $1,170\n\nYou've raised a total of $1,170 so far this year.\n\nRegarding the \"Gala for the Homeless\", you didn't raise any funds, but you did contribute $600 ($500 for the painting and $100 for the ticket). This is a significant personal contribution, and you might want to consider including it in your overall charitable giving for the year.\n\nAs for the \"Animal Shelter\" volunteering, it's great that you're dedicating your time to a good cause! While we didn't count the value of your time in this calculation, it's still worth acknowledging your efforts.\n\nFeel free to update me if you have any other charity events or contributions you'd like to add to your total!",
