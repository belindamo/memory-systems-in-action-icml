  "content": "I'd be happy to help you calculate the total amount you've raised so far.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. You raised $250 at the \"Walk for Cancer\" event, so that's a direct contribution.\n2. At the \"Bake Sale for Education\" event, your team raised $1,380 more than your individual contribution. This means that if you contributed x dollars, the team's total contribution would be x + $1,380. Since you want to know your individual contribution, let's call it x. We don't know the exact value of x yet, but we'll get to that in a moment.\n\nTo find the total amount you've raised so far, you need to add your individual contributions from both events. So, the total amount is:\n\n$250 (from Walk for Cancer) + x (your individual contribution from Bake Sale for Education)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. You know that the team's total contribution was $1,380 more than your individual contribution, so we can set up an equation:\n\nTeam's total contribution = x + $1,380\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the exact value of x. Could you please provide more details about the \"Bake Sale for Education\" event, such as the team's total contribution or any other relevant information? That way, I can help you calculate your individual contribution and the total amount you've raised so far.",
