  "content": "The article discusses the effects of psychedelics on the growth and complexity of dendrites in cortical neurons. The study found that several psychedelics increased dendritic arbor complexity in a similar way to ketamine, and that psychedelics from a variety of structural classes promoted neuritogenesis. The study also found that hallucinogens and entactogens were more potent than ketamine in promoting neurite outgrowth. The study also found that the anti-addictive alkaloid ibogaine had no effect on neuritogenesis, but its metabolite noribogaine did promote neuritogenesis in a similar way to ketamine.",
