Here are some additional ideas to help you give your living room a modern touch:\n\n1. **Lighting**: Update your lighting fixtures to create a modern ambiance. Consider installing sleek floor lamps, table lamps, or a stylish chandelier. You can also add LED candles or string lights to create a cozy glow.\n2. **Color Scheme**: Modern living rooms often feature a neutral color palette with pops of bold color. Try incorporating a statement wall, a bold piece of art, or a vibrant rug to add visual interest.\n3. **Textiles**: In addition to throw pillows, consider updating your upholstery, drapes, or blankets with modern patterns and materials like velvet, linen, or performance fabrics.\n4. **Artwork**: Add some modern art pieces or prints to your walls.
