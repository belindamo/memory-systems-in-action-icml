  "content": "I'm really looking forward to exploring the museum's collection, especially the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist exhibits. During my solo trip to New York City, I spent hours at the MoMA and the Guggenheim, and I'm excited to see how the Art Institute's collection compares. Can you recommend any good restaurants or cafes near the museum where I can grab lunch or a snack?",
