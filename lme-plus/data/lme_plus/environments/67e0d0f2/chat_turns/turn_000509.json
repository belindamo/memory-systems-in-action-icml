Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish or a 9-inch round cake pan.\n2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.\n3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter.\n4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. The batter should still be slightly lumpy.\n5. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish or cake pan.\n6. If desired, drizzle a small amount of honey or sugar on top of the batter for a sweet and savory contrast.\n7. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\n8. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* For a more moist cornbread, use 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk and reduce the amount of eggs to 1.\n* Add some heat to your cornbread by incorporating diced jalape\u00f1os or red pepper flakes into the batter.\n* Mix in some grated cheese, like cheddar or Monterey Jack, for an extra burst of flavor.\n* Replace the butter with olive oil or avocado oil for a lighter, more savory flavor.\n* Experiment with different types of cornmeal, like stone-ground or blue cornmeal, for unique textures and flavors.\n\nThis cornbread recipe is a classic, and its simplicity allows the natural flavors of the cornmeal and buttermilk to shine. It'll pair beautifully with the rich, spicy flavors of your chili. Enjoy!",
