It's possible that the city government of Atlantic City is considering increasing the number of police officers on patrol if there has been a recent increase in crime or a rise in public safety concerns. However, it is always best to check with local officials or news sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information on this matter."

As an AI language model, my responses are only as accurate and up-to-date as the information I have been programmed with, and I do not have access to real-time or current events. However, I am programmed to continuously learn and update my knowledge with the latest available data.
