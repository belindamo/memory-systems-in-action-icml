The views are simply breathtaking, with the city stretching out in every direction.\n\n**What to Expect:**\n\n1. **Security Check**: Before entering the Skydeck, you'll go through a security check, similar to what you'd experience at an airport.\n2. **Elevators**: You'll take two high-speed elevators to reach the 103rd floor. The first elevator takes you to the 33rd floor, where you'll transfer to a second elevator that takes you to the 103rd floor.\n3. **Skydeck**: Once you reach the Skydeck, you'll be greeted by stunning views of the city. The Skydeck is an enclosed area with large windows on all sides, offering unobstructed views.\n4. **Ledge**: If you're feeling adventurous, step out onto the Ledge, a series of four glass balconies that extend 4.3 feet outside the building. The Ledge is a thrilling experience, with nothing but glass between you and the ground 1,353 feet below!\n5. **Interactive Exhibits**: The Skydeck features interactive exhibits and displays that provide information about the tower's history, architecture, and engineering.\n\n**Is it Worth the Cost?**\n\nThe Skydeck experience is definitely worth the cost, especially if you're interested in architecture, engineering, or just want to take in the stunning views of the city.
