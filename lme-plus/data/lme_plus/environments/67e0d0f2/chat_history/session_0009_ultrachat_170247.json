Conversely, a media outlet that highlights the positive contributions of immigrants to society, such as economic growth or cultural diversity, can create a more positive image of immigrants. Social media and other digital platforms also play a big role in shaping public opinion on immigration, through the sharing of news articles and opinions among users."
