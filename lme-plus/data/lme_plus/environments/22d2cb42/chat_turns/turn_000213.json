I exist solely to provide information and assist with questions to the best of my abilities. I don't have personal experiences or physical interactions.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with information about cooking classes, recipes, and techniques if you're interested! Sur La Table is a great cooking school with many locations, and they offer a variety of classes for different skill levels and cuisines. If you're interested in taking a cooking class, I'd be happy to help you find one that suits your interests and needs.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with, and I'll do my best to assist you!",
