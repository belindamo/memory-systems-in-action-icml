  "content": "A good wok or large skillet is essential for stir-frying. I'm happy to help you with some recommendations!\n\n**Wok Options:**\n\n1. **Carbon Steel Wok**: A carbon steel wok is an excellent choice for stir-frying. It heats evenly, retains heat well, and can be seasoned for non-stick performance. Look for a wok with a flat bottom (for stability on electric stoves) and a long handle for easy maneuvering.\n\t* Recommended brand: Joyce Chen or Helen's Asian Kitchen\n2. **Cast Iron Wok**: A cast iron wok is another great option. It retains heat exceptionally well and can be seasoned for non-stick performance. However, it may require more maintenance than carbon steel.\n\t* Recommended brand: Le Creuset or Lodge\n\n**Large Skillet Options:**\n\n1. **Stainless Steel Skillet**: A stainless steel skillet is a great alternative to a wok. Look for one with a heavy bottom for even heat distribution and a non-stick coating for easy food release.\n\t* Recommended brand: All-Clad or Calphalon\n2. **Cast Iron Skillet**: A cast iron skillet is another excellent option. It heats evenly, retains heat well, and can be seasoned for non-stick performance.\n\t* Recommended brand: Le Creuset or Lodge\n\n**Things to Consider:**\n\n1. **Material**: Carbon steel, cast iron, and stainless steel are all good options. Avoid non-stick pans, as they can be prone to scratches and may not heat evenly.\n2. **Size**: A larger skillet or wok (12-14 inches) is ideal for stir-frying, as it allows for quick cooking and easy stirring.\n3. **Non-stick coating**: If you prefer a non-stick surface, look for a skillet or wok with a PFOA-free non-stick coating.\n4. **Handle**: A long handle with a comfortable grip is essential for easy stirring and maneuvering.\n5. **Price**: Woks and skillets can range from under $50 to over $200. Set a budget and look for options within your range.\n\n**Your Current Non-Stick Pan:**\n\nIf you're experiencing uneven heating with your current non-stick pan, it might be due to the pan's material or design. Non-stick pans can be prone to scratches, which can affect their heat distribution. Consider upgrading to a more durable option or trying a different cooking technique to improve heat distribution.\n\nI hope this helps you find the perfect wok or large skillet for your stir-frying needs!",
