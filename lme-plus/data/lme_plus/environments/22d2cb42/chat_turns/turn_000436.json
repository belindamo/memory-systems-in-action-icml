Department Heads: These would be the next level of leadership within the MRB, responsible for specific areas of the organization such as Enforcement, Licensing, Training, and Research. Each department head would have a team of managers and supervisors who would be responsible for carrying out the tasks and objectives within their department.\n3. Agents/Enforcers: These would be the front-line employees of the MRB, responsible for enforcing the laws of resonance and investigating any violations.

Trainers: These would be responsible for training the agents, enforcers and inspectors on the laws of resonance and how to use their abilities responsibly and effectively.\n\nThe exact structure and hierarchy of the MRB would depend on the specific needs and demands of the society it serves.",
