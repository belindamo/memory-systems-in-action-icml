  "content": "What a thoughtful consideration! Yes, asking people to bring a copy of the recipe they used is a wonderful idea! This way, if someone falls in love with a particular dish, they can easily get the recipe and try making it at home. It's also a great way to share knowledge and inspiration among your book club members.\n\nYou could suggest that each member brings a few copies of their recipe, so that others can take one if they're interested. This way, everyone can benefit from the shared knowledge and creativity.\n\nAdditionally, you could also consider creating a shared document or online folder where members can upload their recipes, along with a photo of the dish and any notes or tips they'd like to share. This way, everyone can access the recipes and inspiration even after the meeting.\n\nBy doing so, you'll not only create a fun and engaging potluck experience but also foster a sense of community and sharing among your book club members.\n\nRemember to keep it simple and flexible, though. You can always adjust the details based on your group's preferences and needs. The goal is to have fun and enjoy each other's company while discussing your shared love of books!",
