  "content": "I've been meaning to clean my shower curtain, and I finally got around to it last weekend. It was a real pain to scrub off all the soap scum and mildew, but it looks brand new again. I also replaced the shower curtain liner while I was at it, since the old one was getting all mildewy and gross. What do you think about using a shower cleaning product with a built-in scrubber? Would that make the cleaning process easier?",
