  "content": "The performances were definitely a highlight, but I think what really made the festival special was discovering new artists and bands. I ended up buying a few merchandise items, including a Pale Waves t-shirt and a vinyl record of The 1975's latest album. It was great to see some of my favorite artists perform live, but also to be introduced to new music and sounds. By the way, have you heard of the podcast \"Song Exploder\"? I stumbled upon it recently and it's been really inspiring to learn about the creative process behind some of my favorite songs.",
