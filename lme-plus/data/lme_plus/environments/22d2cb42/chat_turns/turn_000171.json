I'd be happy to guide you through some exercises that can help increase your flexibility, especially in your hips and legs.\n\n**Warm-up (5-10 minutes)**\n\nBefore you start stretching, it's essential to warm up your muscles. You can do some light cardio, such as jogging in place, jumping jacks, or even some salsa steps to get your heart rate up and your muscles warm.\n\n**Hip Flexibility Exercises (3 sets of 30-second holds each)**\n\n1. **Butterfly Stretch**: Sit on the floor with your soles together, knees bent, and feet touching. Let your knees fall apart, stretching your inner thighs and hips. Hold for 30 seconds.\n2. **Lying Hip Stretch**: Lie on your back with your legs straight and feet flexed. Cross one foot over the other, keeping your ankle towards your opposite knee. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.\n3. **Piriformis Stretch**: Sit on the floor with your affected leg crossed over your other leg. Place your hand on the knee of the crossed leg and pull it toward your opposite shoulder. You should feel a stretch in your glutes and hips. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.\n4. **Lizard Pose**: Start on your hands and knees. Step your right foot forward, keeping your knee bent at a 90-degree angle. Lower your torso down, stretching the front of your hip and leg. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.\n\n**Leg Flexibility Exercises (3 sets of 30-second holds each)**\n\n1. **Hamstring Stretch**: Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lean forward, reaching for your toes, and hold for 30 seconds.\n2. **Quad Stretch**: Stand with one hand against a wall for balance. Bend one knee, keeping your foot behind you, and lean forward, stretching the front of your leg. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.\n3. **Calf Stretch**: Stand facing a wall with one hand on the wall for balance. Step one foot back about a foot and a half, keeping your heel on the ground. Bend your front knee and lean forward, stretching your calf muscle. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n* Breathe deeply and naturally while stretching. Don't bounce or force your muscles beyond a comfortable range.\n* Focus on relaxing the muscle you're stretching, rather than tensing up.\n* Make sure to stretch both sides of your body equally to maintain balance and prevent uneven flexibility.\n* Incorporate these exercises into your daily routine, ideally 2-3 times a week, to see progressive improvement in your flexibility.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and stop if you experience any discomfort or pain. It's also essential to consult with a medical professional or dance instructor if you have any underlying injuries or concerns.\n\nNow, go ahead and get stretching! Your hips and legs will thank you, and you'll be ready to take on that salsa class with confidence and flexibility.",
