  "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have access to information about Encompass's future plans. However, I can assume that, just like every other organization that seeks to serve diverse communities, Encompass might have plans to expand its multilingual services. \n\nExpanding multilingual services and resources can be an effective way to enhance the accessibility of resources for individuals and families with limited English proficiency or who speak languages that Encompass does not currently serve. This could mean adding new languages to their already established translation services, interpretation services, and community workshops.\n\nFurthermore, as the world becomes more interconnected, multicultural and multilingual, the need for multilingual services and resources continues to increase, which may lead Encompass to expand its multilingual services and resources further.\n\nOverall, it is always beneficial for organizations like Encompass who offer social services to diverse communities to continue expanding their multilingual resources and services as this will increase the impact of their outreach, services and support for individuals with different languages and cultures.",
