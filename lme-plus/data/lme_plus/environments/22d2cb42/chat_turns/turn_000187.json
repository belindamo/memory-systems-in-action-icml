  "content": "Gatorland is definitely a unique experience, and getting up close to the alligators is something you won't forget. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring sunscreen, as much of the park is outdoors. Don't forget your camera too, as you'll want to capture some great shots of the animals. Have a great time at Gatorland!",
