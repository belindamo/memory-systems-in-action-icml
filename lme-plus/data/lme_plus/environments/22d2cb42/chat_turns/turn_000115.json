  "content": "Warby Parker is a great brand for sunglasses, and they're known for their try-before-you-buy policy, which makes it easy to exchange or return glasses that don't fit quite right.\n\nIf your current pair is too big for your face, I'd recommend exchanging them for a smaller size. Warby Parker offers a wide range of sizes, so you're likely to find a pair that fits your face perfectly.\n\nBefore you exchange, consider the following:\n\n* **Measure your face:** Take a look at Warby Parker's size guide and measure your face to determine your ideal size. This will help you choose the right size for your new pair.\n* **Check the style:** If you love the style of your current glasses but they're just a bit too big, you might want to try a smaller size in the same style. If you're not sold on the style, you could consider trying a different one that fits your face better.\n* **Consider a different shape:** If you're finding that the current style is too big, you might want to try a different shape that's more suited to your face shape. Warby Parker has a wide range of shapes, from aviators to round frames, so you're likely to find one that fits your face nicely.\n\nIf you're not sure what to do, you could always visit a Warby Parker store or schedule a virtual try-on to get a better sense of the fit and style.\n\nIn terms of finding a pair that goes well with your Merrell boots and black jeans, here are some tips:\n\n* **Neutral colors:** Look for sunglasses with neutral colors like black, brown, or tortoiseshell that will complement your boots and jeans.\n* **Earth tones:** Earthy tones like olive green, terracotta, or rust can add a nice touch of warmth to your outfit and complement your Merrell boots.\n* **Simple designs:** A simple, understated design can let your boots and jeans take center stage. Look for classic shapes with minimal embellishments.\n\nI hope this helps, and happy sunglasses shopping!",
