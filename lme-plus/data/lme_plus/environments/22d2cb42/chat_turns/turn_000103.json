  "content": "Rhythm Central on Main St, that sounds like a great lead!\n\nIt's always a good idea to do your research and ask around before choosing a music shop for guitar servicing. Since your friend mentioned Rhythm Central, it's likely they have a good reputation in your community.\n\nBefore you call them, you might want to prepare a few questions to ask:\n\n* What types of guitar servicing do they offer (e.g., setup, fretwork, electronics repair)?\n* What's their average turnaround time for servicing?\n* Do they offer any warranties or guarantees for their work?\n* Can they provide a rough estimate of the cost for the services you need?\n* Do they have any experience with your specific type of guitar (e.g., acoustic, electric, bass)?\n\nBy asking these questions, you'll get a better sense of their expertise, pricing, and customer service. It's also a good idea to ask if they have any availability before the festival, so you can plan accordingly.\n\nGive them a call, and I hope you get your guitar serviced and sounding great for the festival!",
