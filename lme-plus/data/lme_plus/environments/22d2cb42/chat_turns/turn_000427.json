  "content": "In this story, the magic system relies on \"resonance.\" Humans live in the physical realm, but there is a magical realm that some people are more attuned to than others - this is what is called resonance. Those with strong resonance with the magical realm are \"resonant,\" because they possess the ability to draw upon that magic and transform it into spells within the physical realm. However, this comes at a cost. There are laws to resonance, the second law of resonance being that all magic tends towards chaos. In other words, each spell costs a fraction of the caster's life force, scaled based on how powerful the caster is combined with how powerful the spell is.",
