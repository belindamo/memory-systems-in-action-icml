  "content": "In this story, society may regulate the use of magic by having a strict set of laws and regulations in place that govern how and when resonant individuals can use their abilities. This could include restrictions on the type of spells that can be cast, the circumstances under which they can be cast, and the level of power that can be used. For example, only certain spells may be allowed in certain situations, or there may be limits on how much power a resonant individual can draw upon at any one time.\n\nThe society may also have a system of licensing or certification for resonant individuals, which would be required before they are allowed to use their abilities. This could involve rigorous training and testing, as well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure that the individual is using their abilities responsibly and within the bounds of the law.\n\nAdditionally, there may be a specialized agency or organization responsible for enforcing the laws of resonance, such as a magical police force or a council of magic users. This agency would be responsible for investigating and punishing those who break the laws, as well as providing support and guidance for those who are trying to use their abilities in a responsible way.\n\nOverall, the society's regulations would be focused on maintaining balance and stability by preventing powerful resonant individuals to abuse their abilities and to prevent overuse of magic. This would be a way to mitigate the second law of resonance and to keep the society safe.",
