  "content": "I'm thinking of incorporating strength training exercises 3 times a week, focusing on my core, legs, and glutes. I've been doing exercises like squats, lunges, and deadlifts, but I'm not sure if I'm doing enough. Since I just finished a 5K charity run with a personal best time of 27 minutes and 12 seconds, I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to improve my running performance. Can you recommend any specific exercises or routines that would be beneficial for me?",
