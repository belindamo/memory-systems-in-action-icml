That's great to hear!\n\nIn that case, you might want to consider upgrading to a newer Fitbit model that offers more advanced features, such as the Fitbit Inspire HR or the Fitbit Sense. Both of these models offer more detailed sleep tracking, including sleep stages and sleep scores, which can provide you with a more comprehensive understanding of your sleep patterns.\n\nThe Fitbit Inspire HR also offers guided breathing sessions and female health tracking, which can be useful for women who want to track their menstrual cycles and symptoms.\n\nThe Fitbit Sense, on the other hand, offers more advanced health features, such as electrodermal activity tracking, which can help you manage stress and anxiety. It also has a built-in GPS, which can be useful for outdoor activities like running or hiking.\n\nBoth of these models are compatible with the Fitbit app, which you're already familiar with, and offer a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to track your progress and set goals.\n\nUltimately, the choice between these two models will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you're looking for more advanced sleep tracking and female health features, the Inspire HR might be the better choice. If you're looking for more advanced health features and a built-in GPS, the Sense might be the better choice.\n\nI hope this helps you make a more informed decision!",
