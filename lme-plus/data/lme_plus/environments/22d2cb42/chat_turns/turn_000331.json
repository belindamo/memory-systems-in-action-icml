  "content": "I'm looking to avoid foods that are high in sugar and refined carbs, and I'm trying to stick to a low-carb diet. I've been doing some research on the glycemic index and trying to focus on foods with a low GI. I'm also trying to eat more vegetables and lean proteins. As for sweeteners, I've been using stevia lately and it seems to work well for me. Do you have any recipes that feature vegetables as the main ingredient, and can you suggest some healthy protein sources that won't raise my blood sugar levels too much?",
