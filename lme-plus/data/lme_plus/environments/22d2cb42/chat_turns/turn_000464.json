  "content": "The connection string for a Railway PostgreSQL database can be used to connect to the database using a tool like DataGrip or DBeaver. The format of the connection string depends on the specific tool you are using, but it typically includes the following information:\n\n* Host: The hostname or IP address of the database server.\n* Port: The port number used by the database server.\n* Database: The name of the database you want to connect to.\n* User: The username to use when connecting to the database.\n* Password: The password associated with the user account.\n\nHere's an example of a connection string in the format used by DataGrip and DBeaver:\n```bash\njdbc:postgresql://host:port/database?user=user&password=password\n```\nReplace `host` with the hostname or IP address of the database server, `port` with the port number used by the database server, `database` with the name of the database you want to connect to, `user` with the username to use when connecting to the database, and `password` with the password associated with the user account.\n\nNote: The connection string format may vary depending on the specific tool you are using and the version of PostgreSQL you have installed. Please consult the documentation for your specific tool for more information on how to create a connection string.",
