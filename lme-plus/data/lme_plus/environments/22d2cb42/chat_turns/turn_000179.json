I'm just a language model, I don't actually take salsa classes or have an instructor, but I'm sure that would be super helpful for you!\n\nAsking your instructor for feedback on your technique is an excellent idea. They can provide personalized guidance and help you identify areas where you can improve. They may also be able to offer tips and corrections that are specific to your learning style and needs.\n\nInstructors can also help you develop good habits and prevent bad ones from forming. They can provide feedback on your posture, alignment, footwork, and overall technique, which can help you improve your overall dance skills.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for feedback or corrections during class or even after class. Instructors are there to help you learn and improve, and they want to see you succeed. Remember, feedback is a gift, and it's an opportunity to learn and grow as a dancer.\n\nSo, take advantage of your instructor's expertise and ask for feedback on your technique. I'm sure you'll find it super helpful and see improvement in your dancing!",
