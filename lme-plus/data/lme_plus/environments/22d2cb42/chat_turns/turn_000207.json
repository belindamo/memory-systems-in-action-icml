  "content": "The Classic Chicken and Broccoli Stir-Fry is a timeless favorite.\n\nCooking chicken to perfection can be a challenge, but don't worry, I've got some tips to help you achieve juicy and evenly cooked chicken:\n\n1. **Cut the chicken into uniform pieces**: Cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces, about 1-inch (2.5 cm) in size. This ensures that the chicken cooks evenly and quickly.\n2. **Marinate or season the chicken**: Marinate the chicken in your favorite seasonings, such as soy sauce, olive oil, and garlic, for at least 30 minutes. This helps to add flavor and tenderize the chicken. If you're short on time, simply season the chicken with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices.\n3. **Cook the chicken in batches**: If you're cooking a large amount of chicken, cook it in batches to prevent overcrowding the pan. This ensures that each piece of chicken has enough room to cook evenly.\n4. **Use high heat**: Heat your wok or large skillet over high heat (around 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C). This helps to sear the chicken quickly and lock in juices.\n5. **Don't overcook the chicken**: Cook the chicken for 5-7 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Use a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken is cooked to a safe temperature.\n6. **Stir-fry quickly**: Once you add the chicken to the pan, stir-fry it quickly to prevent it from sitting in one spot for too long. This helps to distribute the heat evenly and cook the chicken consistently.\n7. **Don't press down on the chicken**: Resist the temptation to press down on the chicken with your spatula, as this can squeeze out juices and make the chicken dry.\n8. **Add aromatics first**: Cook your aromatics (like garlic and ginger) before adding the chicken. This helps to flavor the oil and create a savory sauce.\n9. **Use a small amount of oil**: Use a small amount of oil (about 1-2 tablespoons) to prevent the chicken from swimming in oil and becoming greasy.\n10. **Don't over-stir**: Stir-fry the chicken and vegetables quickly, but don't overdo it. You want to maintain the texture and crispness of the vegetables.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to cooking juicy and evenly cooked chicken for your Classic Chicken and Broccoli Stir-Fry. Enjoy!",
