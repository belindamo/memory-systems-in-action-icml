That way, I can provide you with more specific and relevant statistics on women in leadership positions.\n\nRegarding your conversation with Emily, that's great to hear that you're having open and important discussions about the gender pay gap in your company! According to a report by the American Association of University Women (AAUW), in 2022, women in the United States typically earned 83 cents for every dollar earned by men. This gap varies by industry, occupation, and other factors, but it's a persistent issue that affects many women.\n\nOnce I know your industry, I can try to find more specific data on the representation of women in leadership positions and the gender pay gap.",
