John Thune, R-N.D., said at a news conference. Thune, a member of Republican leadership and a senior member of the Commerce Committee, is sponsoring the bill with Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, D-Va.; the legislation has 10 co-sponsors, five from each party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly concerned about TikTok\u2019s connections to the Chinese Communist Party, which repeatedly, repeatedly spies on American citizens,\u201d Thune added.\n\nBrooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in an email that the Biden administration already has the power to oversee the app through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, and that a blanket ban would be counterproductive for U.S. interests.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that some members of Congress remain willing to explore options for addressing national security concerns that don\u2019t have the effect of censoring millions of Americans,\u201d Oberwetter said. \u201cA U.S. ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.\u201d\n\nOberwetter noted that TikTok had negotiated a deal with CFIUS that the Biden administration has been reviewing for six months.\n\nBut the bill\u2019s implications go beyond TikTok. It\u2019s designed to let the federal government pre-empt situations in which technology produced in any of the six authoritarian countries named in the bill becomes popular in the U.S., as was the case with the Russian antivirus company Kaspersky, which is banned on federal computers, and the Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturers Huawei and ZTE.\n\nThe bill doesn\u2019t explicitly say how a ban would take effect. Warner said at Tuesday\u2019s news conference that it \u201cgives the secretary of commerce a series of tools to mitigate, divest, up to and including banning,\u201d technology that would harm the U.S.\n\nThe tools apply to technology that could be used to interfere in elections, that is designed with deceptive intent or that could otherwise present a national security risk, the bill says.\n\nThe legislation comes in a widespread U.S. crackdown on TikTok. The White House has instructed all federal employees to delete it from their work devices before the end of the month after Congress passed a ban on the app on government devices late last year. A number of state governments have already banned it on work devices, and some universities have blocked students from accessing the site on school Wi-Fi.\n\nLike most phone apps, TikTok has access to and collects substantial user data, which the company says helps improve their experience. The company has had to acknowledge at least one episode in which access to that data was abused. It admitted in December that some employees had spied on journalists\u2019 location data in an attempt to identify which of its employees were speaking to the media.\n\nDespite broad bipartisan support for some sort of crackdown on TikTok, some senators expressed reservations about a narrow approach that doesn\u2019t address data security in a comprehensive way, including regulating the data brokers operating in the U.S. that scrape Americans\u2019 data and sell it, including to foreign companies or entities.\n\n\u201cWhile it is sensible to restrict TikTok on government phones and government interests and the like, if that\u2019s all you do, the big winners are these sleazy private data brokers who will move right in and pick up all of that,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nAmerica needs a \u201ccomprehensive policy that starts closing the gaps,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nMany privacy experts say that while TikTok is a threat to Americans\u2019 privacy, it\u2019s not unique in that regard. China\u2019s prolific cyberspies routinely hack Americans\u2019 data. The U.S. has no major data privacy law, and an entire industry of data brokers buys, sells and trades Americans\u2019 private information.\n\nCaitriona Fitzgerald, the deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a think tank, said TikTok represents \u201cmaybe 2% of the problem\u201d when it comes to Americans\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cWithout the coverings of privacy law in the U.S., there are millions of apps that are collecting and abusing Americans\u2019 data,\u201d she said.\n\nNBC News \u00b7 by Kevin Collier and Scott Wong",
