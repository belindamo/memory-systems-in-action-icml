It's possible that it was a one-time event or a special installation.\n\nHowever, I did some research, and it seems that \"Art in Bloom\" might be a program or event that combines art and flowers, where local florists and artists create arrangements inspired by artworks in the museum's collection. This type of event is often organized by museums to engage visitors and provide a unique experience.\n\nIt's possible that MoMA hosted a one-time \"Art in Bloom\" event, and it might not be a recurring exhibition. If you enjoyed the event, you might want to keep an eye on MoMA's website and social media for similar events or programs in the future.\n\nIf you're interested in attending more events that combine art and flowers, you might want to explore other museums and cultural institutions in NYC that offer similar programs. For example, the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) often hosts exhibitions and events that feature flower arrangements inspired by art and nature.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. I'd be happy to assist you in finding more information about \"Art in Bloom\" or similar events in NYC!",
