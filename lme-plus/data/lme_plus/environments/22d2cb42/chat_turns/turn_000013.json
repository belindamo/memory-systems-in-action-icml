  "content": "MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a file format that represents music in a digital form. It is not an audio file format like MP3, but rather a way to represent musical information such as notes, pitches, and timing. MIDI files do not contain any actual audio data, but rather a series of instructions for how to generate music.\n\nMP3, on the other hand, is an audio file format that stores actual audio data as a series of digital audio samples. MP3 files are compressed versions of audio files that can be played on a wide range of devices, including computers, phones, and portable music players.\n\nOne key difference between MIDI and MP3 files is that MIDI files are much smaller in size, since they do not contain any actual audio data. This makes MIDI files easy to transmit and store, but they require a device that can interpret the MIDI data and generate sound from it. MP3 files, on the other hand, contain audio data and can be played directly on most devices without the need for any additional software.\n\nAnother difference between MIDI and MP3 files is the level of detail and complexity that they can represent. MIDI files can represent a wide range of musical information, including specific notes, pitches, and timing, as well as more complex details such as expression and articulation. MP3 files, on the other hand, are limited to representing audio data and do not have the same level of detail or flexibility as MIDI files.",
