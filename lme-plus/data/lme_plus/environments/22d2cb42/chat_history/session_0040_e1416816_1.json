They're usually quiet, have tables and chairs, and are easily accessible.\n2. **Coffee shops or cafes**: Look for coffee shops or cafes with a quiet area or a separate room that can be reserved. They often have comfortable seating, and you can order food and drinks to fuel your discussion.\n3. **Bookstores**: Some bookstores have event spaces or quiet areas that can be reserved for book clubs. This is a great option, as you'll be surrounded by books and might even get some staff recommendations!\n4. **Community centers**: Community centers often have meeting rooms that can be rented for a low fee.
