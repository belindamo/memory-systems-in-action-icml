However, assuming that you want to avoid traffic as much as possible during rush hour, one possible route is:\n\n1. From the University of Texas at Dallas, take the President George Bush Turnpike West towards Dallas. 2. Merge onto Dallas North Tollway South towards Downtown Dallas. 3. Take the Woodall Rodgers Freeway/TX-366 East towards downtown. 4. Take exit 47B for Field Street. 5. Turn right onto Field Street and you will reach downtown Dallas. Please note that during rush hour, there may be heavy traffic on this route and alternative routes may need to be considered as well. It is always a good idea to check a map application for real-time traffic updates and suggested alternate routes."
