I'd recommend booking as soon as possible to secure the best price.\n\nIf you're flexible with your travel dates, consider flying on the 10th or 12th, as these seem to be the cheaper options. However, if you prefer to arrive closer to your sister's birthday, the 14th or 16th might be a better option for you.\n\nTo give you more options, I've also searched for business class flights on other airlines:\n\n**Alternative Business Class Fares in March:**\n\n* **ANA (Los Angeles to Tokyo)**: $2,400 - $2,800\n* **American Airlines (Los Angeles to Tokyo)**: $2,600 - $3,200\n* **Delta (Los Angeles to Tokyo)**: $2,800 - $3,400\n\nKeep in mind that these fares may not be exactly on your preferred dates, but they might be worth considering if you're open to flying with other airlines.\n\nWhat would you like to do? Would you like to book one of the Japan Airlines options, or would you like me to explore other airlines further?",
