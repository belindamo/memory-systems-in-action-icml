  "content": "Many people share your frustration about the Catholic Church's historical attitudes towards scientific discoveries. It's true that the Church's focus on preserving its authority and traditional beliefs sometimes led to resistance towards scientific ideas that challenged those beliefs. However, it's also worth noting that the Church has a long history of supporting scientific inquiry and has contributed to numerous scientific discoveries throughout history.\n\nIn recent years, the Vatican has acknowledged past mistakes and has sought to establish a more positive relationship with the scientific community. For example, in 2018, Pope Francis publicly acknowledged the role of the Big Bang theory in explaining the origins of the universe and the theory of evolution in explaining the development of life on Earth. \n\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge and learn from the mistakes of the past, it is also important to recognize the progress that has been made and the potential for a positive relationship between religion and science in the future.",
