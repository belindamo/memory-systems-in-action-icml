Here are some of the most popular and iconic geothermal attractions in Yellowstone:\n\n1. **Old Faithful**: This is probably the most famous geyser in the world.

You can check the park's website or the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center for eruption times.\n2. **Grand Prismatic Spring**: The largest hot spring in the United States, the Grand Prismatic Spring is a stunning sight. Its vibrant colors, created by microorganisms and minerals, are a photographer's dream.\n3. **Mammoth Hot Springs**: A complex of hot springs and travertine formations, Mammoth Hot Springs is a must-see. The travertine formations resemble a white, frozen waterfall, and the area is steeped in history and geology.\n4. ** Norris Geyser Basin**: This is the hottest, oldest, and most dynamic geyser basin in Yellowstone. It's home to Steamboat Geyser, which is the tallest active geyser in the world, erupting up to 300 feet high.\n5. **Castle Geyser**: Located in the Upper Geyser Basin, Castle Geyser is a picturesque geyser that erupts about every 12 hours, shooting steam and water up to 100 feet high.\n6. **Morning Glory Pool**: This hot spring is known for its vibrant colors and unique shape, resembling a morning glory flower. It's a popular spot for photographers and nature enthusiasts.\n7. **Boiling River**: This is a unique spot where hot springs and the Gardner River meet, creating a natural hot tub. It's a great place to relax and soak in the warm waters.\n\n**Tips and Safety Reminders:**\n\n* Always stay on designated boardwalks and trails when exploring geothermal areas. The ground can be unstable, and the water is extremely hot.\n* Keep a safe distance from geysers and hot springs, as the water can splash and cause burns.\n* Be respectful of the environment and other visitors. Don't touch or throw objects into the geothermal features, as this can damage the formations and disrupt the ecosystem.\n* Check the park's website or visitor centers for up-to-date information on geyser eruption times and trail closures.\n\nThese are just a few of the many geothermal wonders waiting for you in Yellowstone. Enjoy your exploration of these natural marvels!",
