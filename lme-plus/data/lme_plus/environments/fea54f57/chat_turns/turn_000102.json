  "content": "Here is a revised version of your abstract that's around 250 words:\n\nRobot-assisted surgery is a growing field in medical practice, but training operators is challenging due to the lack of haptic feedback and performance assessment methods. This research proposes using passive stereo imaging and machine learning to provide quantifiable and automated feedback to robot surgeon operators. Our approach involves using a locally connected convolutional neural network to extract patient-side manipulator kinematics and find correlations between the robot pose and operator skill level. The network model uses VGG19 as a pre-trained base and trains locally connected layers to determine the spatial relationship between the surgical tools. Our experiments show that the model can estimate kinematics with a correlation error of less than 8 millimeters, providing a more consistent and accurate assessment of procedural skills compared to the current subjective grading methods. This research has the potential to significantly improve the training process for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery and enhance the overall performance of robot surgeons.",
