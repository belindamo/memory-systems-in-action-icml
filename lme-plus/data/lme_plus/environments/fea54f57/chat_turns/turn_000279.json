  "content": "Four Barrel Coffee has plenty of power outlets available throughout the cafe, so you should be able to find a spot to plug in and keep your laptop charged.\n\nIn particular, the tables along the walls in the back area tend to have outlets, and there are also some outlets available at the communal tables. Additionally, some of the couches have outlets nearby, so you can lounge comfortably while keeping your devices charged.\n\nThat being said, it's always a good idea to be mindful of other customers and make sure you're not hogging an outlet. If you're planning to stay for an extended period, you might want to consider bringing a portable power bank as a backup, just in case.\n\nOne more tip: if you're looking for a spot with a lot of natural light and a power outlet, try to grab a table near the windows in the back area. It's a great spot to get some work done while enjoying the morning sunshine!\n\nOverall, Four Barrel Coffee is a great spot to get some work done, and with plenty of outlets available, you should be able to stay productive and connected throughout your visit.",
