  "content": "Revised version:\n\nIn the field of minimally invasive surgery, the utilization of robot-assisted technology is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the inherent lack of haptic feedback and the inconsistent nature of subjective performance assessments pose challenges to the effective training of robot surgeon operators. This study aims to address these challenges through the application of passive stereo imaging and machine learning.\n\nThe proposed approach utilizes a locally connected convolutional neural network to extract patient-side manipulator kinematics and establish correlations between the robot pose and operator skill level. The network model incorporates the VGG19 architecture as a pre-trained base, accepting left and right endoscopic views as inputs. Trainable, locally connected two-dimensional layers are concatenated, locally connected, and flattened, with a 5% dropout to generalize binocular spatial determination of the surgical tools.\n\nExperiments conducted have demonstrated the ability of the model to estimate kinematics with a correlation error of less than 8 millimeters, offering a more consistent and accurate means of evaluating procedural skills compared to the current standard of subjective grading methods. The results of this study hold the potential to significantly improve the training process for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery and enhance the overall performance of robot surgeons through the provision of quantifiable and automated performance feedback.",
