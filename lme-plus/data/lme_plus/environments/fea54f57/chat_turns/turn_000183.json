However, when it comes to using the EDA Scan feature during exercise, there are some limitations and considerations to keep in mind.\n\n**Can you use the EDA Scan feature during exercise?**\n\nThe short answer is yes, but with some caveats. The EDA Scan feature can be used during exercise, but it's essential to understand that the accuracy of the readings might be affected by several factors.\n\n**Why might EDA Scan readings be less accurate during exercise?**\n\n1. **Sweat and moisture**: Exercise can cause sweating, which may interfere with the EDA Scan's ability to detect subtle changes in your skin's electrical activity. Sweat can create a barrier between your skin and the electrodes on the watch, reducing the accuracy of the readings.\n2. **Movement and vibration**: Physical activity can cause your body to move and vibrate, which may affect the EDA Scan's ability to take accurate readings. This is because the electrodes on the watch need consistent contact with your skin to measure electrodermal activity accurately.\n3. **Heart rate and physiological responses**: Exercise can stimulate your body's \"fight or flight\" response, causing your heart rate and other physiological responses to increase. This might affect the EDA Scan readings, making it more challenging to distinguish between stress and exercise-related physiological responses.\n\n**Tips for using EDA Scan during exercise**\n\nIf you still want to use the EDA Scan feature during exercise, follow these tips to minimize potential inaccuracies:\n\n1. **Wait until you're relatively calm**: Try to take EDA Scan readings during periods of lower intensity or during breaks in your exercise routine, when your heart rate and breathing have returned to a more normal state.\n2. **Keep your skin dry**: Try to minimize sweating by wearing a sweatband or using a towel to keep your wrist dry. This can help ensure better contact between your skin and the electrodes.\n3. **Hold still and relax**: When taking an EDA Scan reading during exercise, try to hold still and relax your arm as much as possible. This can help reduce movement and vibration interference.\n4. **Consider using other stress tracking features**: Fitbit offers other stress tracking features, such as heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep tracking, which might be more suitable for tracking stress levels during exercise.\n\nKeep in mind that the EDA Scan feature is designed to provide insights into your stress levels during periods of relaxation, not during intense physical activity. If you're looking to track your stress levels during exercise, you might consider using other methods, such as heart rate monitoring or subjective self-assessment.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the limitations and considerations for using the EDA Scan feature during exercise!",
