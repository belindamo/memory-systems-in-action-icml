The EDA Scan feature is a unique aspect of the Fitbit Sense, and I'd be happy to explain how it works.\n\n**What is EDA Scan?**\n\nEDA stands for Electrodermal Activity, which is a measure of the electrical activity of the skin. The EDA Scan feature on the Fitbit Sense uses small electrodes on the watch's metal frame to detect tiny changes in the electrical activity of your skin. This activity is associated with your body's \"fight or flight\" response, also known as the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n**How does EDA Scan work?**\n\nTo use the EDA Scan feature, you'll need to place your palm over the watch's face, making sure your fingers are in contact with the metal frame. The watch will then prompt you to remain still and relaxed for about 2-3 minutes. During this time, the EDA Scan will take readings of your electrodermal activity.\n\nThe EDA Scan uses a technique called impedance plethysmography, which measures the changes in the electrical conductivity of your skin. This allows the watch to detect subtle changes in your skin's electrical activity, which can be influenced by your emotional state, stress levels, and other physiological factors.\n\n**What does EDA Scan measure?**\n\nThe EDA Scan provides a score based on your electrodermal activity, which is represented as a graph on the Fitbit app. This score can help you understand your body's response to stress and relaxation. Here's what the scores typically indicate:\n\n* **Low EDA score**: Indicates a state of relaxation and low stress.\n* **High EDA score**: May indicate a state of stress, anxiety, or heightened emotional arousal.\n\n**How can you use EDA Scan?**\n\nThe EDA Scan feature is designed to help you:\n\n1. **Track your stress levels**: Monitor your EDA scores over time to identify patterns and correlations with your daily activities, emotions, and environment.\n2. **Identify relaxation techniques that work for you**: Experiment with different relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, and see how they affect your EDA scores.\n3. **Develop a personalized stress management plan**: Use the EDA Scan to identify when you need to take a break or practice relaxation techniques to manage stress.\n\nKeep in mind that the EDA Scan feature is not a medical-grade diagnostic tool, and it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your stress levels or overall health.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the EDA Scan feature on the Fitbit Sense!",
