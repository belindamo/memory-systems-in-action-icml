  "content": "I forgot to mention that I've also been collecting vintage posters and prints, focusing on pieces from the 1920s to the 1950s. I recently found an amazing Art Deco-era travel poster for the Orient Express at an antique shop, and it's now proudly displayed above my desk. It's really added a touch of elegance to the room, and I'm excited to continue growing my collection.",
