  "content": "When bananas are dehydrated, the water content is removed, causing the fruit to shrink and become more concentrated. Although the fiber content doesn't disappear, the overall volume of the dehydrated banana is reduced. As a result, when comparing equal volumes or weights of fresh and dehydrated bananas, it might seem like the fiber content of dehydrated bananas is lower.\n\nTo get a comparable amount of fiber from dehydrated bananas as you would from fresh ones, you would need to consume a larger quantity (by weight) of dehydrated bananas to account for the reduced volume. The nutritional content, including fiber, is more concentrated in dehydrated bananas, but the serving size needs to be adjusted accordingly.",
