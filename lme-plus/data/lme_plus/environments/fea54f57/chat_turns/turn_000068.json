However, during that time period, the Catholic Church was hesitant to accept scientific ideas because of its emphasis on traditional beliefs and its authority in theological matters. The Church viewed itself as the ultimate authority on matters of faith and morality, and therefore felt threatened by ideas that could potentially challenge its teachings. \n\nAdditionally, during the time period in question, there was a lack of clear separation between scientific and theological inquiry. Many argued that scientific theories could have implications for theology and religious belief, which intensified the Church's scrutiny of new scientific ideas. \n\nIt is true that embracing new discoveries and knowledge could have been beneficial, but the Church's position on this issue was complicated by its role as a religious institution. Over time, the relationship between religion and science has evolved, and there is now greater acceptance of scientific ideas within many religious communities.",
