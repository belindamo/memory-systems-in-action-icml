  "content": "Adding grilled chicken to your Penne alla Vodka is an excellent idea! It will not only add protein to make the dish more substantial but also introduce a nice textural contrast to the creamy pasta. Grilled chicken pairs beautifully with the spicy and tangy flavors of the vodka sauce.\n\nHere are some tips to consider when adding grilled chicken to your Penne alla Vodka:\n\n1. **Marinate the chicken**: Marinate the chicken breasts in your favorite seasonings, such as olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and Italian herbs, before grilling. This will help the chicken absorb flavors and stay juicy.\n2. **Grill the chicken**: Grill the chicken breasts until cooked through, about 5-7 minutes per side, depending on the thickness. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing it into strips.\n3. **Add the chicken to the pasta**: Toss the cooked penne pasta with the vodka sauce, then add the sliced grilled chicken. You can also add some chopped fresh parsley or basil on top for extra flavor and color.\n4. **Adjust the sauce**: If you find the sauce too thick, you can add a bit more heavy cream or pasta water to achieve the desired consistency. If it's too thin, simmer the sauce for a few more minutes to reduce it.\n5. **Balance the flavors**: Taste the dish as you go and adjust the seasoning accordingly. You may want to add more salt, pepper, or red pepper flakes to balance the flavors.\n\nBy adding grilled chicken to your Penne alla Vodka, you'll create a satisfying and well-rounded meal that's perfect for a weeknight dinner or a special occasion. Buon appetito!",
