  "content": "Let's update the count:\n\n* Tide coupons: You started with 5, used 3, so you have 2 remaining coupons for $1 off Tide each.\n* Bounty coupons: You started with 3, used 2, so you have 1 remaining coupon for 50 cents off Bounty.\n\nSo, you have a total of 2 Tide coupons worth $2 and 1 Bounty coupon worth $0.50.\n\nNext, let's talk about the expiration dates. Do you remember when the coupons expire? Are they valid for a specific period, or do they have a \"while supplies last\" kind of deal?\n\nAlso, which stores do you plan to visit this weekend to use these coupons? Are you going to a specific supermarket, discount store, or maybe a warehouse club?\n\nLastly, are you looking to buy these items at a specific price point or quantity to maximize your savings? For example, do you want to buy a certain size or bundle of Tide or Bounty products to get the best deal?",
