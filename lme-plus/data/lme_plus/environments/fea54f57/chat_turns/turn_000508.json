Now, let's get you set up for a successful backpacking trip in the Rockies!\n\nYou're right to consider the fuel type for your portable stove, especially when venturing to high elevations. Here's a brief rundown to help you choose the right fuel:\n\n**Fuel Options:**\n\n1. **White Gas (Naphtha):** This is a popular choice for backpacking stoves. It's a refined petroleum-based fuel that burns well in most conditions. However, it can be affected by high elevations, and its performance may decrease above 10,000 ft (3,000 m).\n2. **Canister Fuel (Isobutane-Propane):** This is a convenient and widely available option. Canister fuel is a mixture of isobutane and propane, which provides a consistent burn. It's a good choice for high elevations, as it's less affected by altitude. Look for canisters with a high propane content (e.g., 80/20 or 70/30 isobutane-propane mix) for better performance in cold and high-altitude conditions.\n3. **Diesel Fuel:** Diesel fuel is a good option for high-altitude use, as it's less affected by elevation. However, it's not as widely available as other fuels, and it can be heavier and more expensive.\n\n**High-Elevation Considerations:**\n\n* At high elevations, the air pressure is lower, which can affect fuel performance. Look for fuels that are designed for high-altitude use or have a higher propane content.\n* Cold temperatures can also impact fuel performance. If you expect to encounter cold conditions, choose a fuel that's designed for cold-weather use.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nFor high-elevation backpacking in the Rockies, I recommend using a canister fuel with a high propane content (e.g., MSR IsoPro or Coleman Fuel). These fuels are widely available, convenient, and perform well in cold and high-altitude conditions.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines for fuel selection and use.\n* Store your fuel in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality and performance.\n* Consider bringing a fuel backup or a spare canister in case of emergencies.\n\nNow that you're all set with your fuel choice, get ready to enjoy the beautiful Rocky Mountains!",
