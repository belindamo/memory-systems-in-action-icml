  "content": "I apologize for the mistake earlier. Let's re-calculate the savings:\n\n* 3 coupons for $1 off Tide = 3 x $1 = $3 saved\n* 2 coupons for 50 cents off Bounty = 2 x $0.50 = $1 saved\n* Total savings: $3 + $1 = $4\n\nI'm still getting $4 as the total savings. I understand that you're sure you saved $5, but the math doesn't add up. It's possible that there's another factor involved, such as a sale or discount that contributed to the additional $1 in savings.\n\nIf you're certain about the $5 savings, could you think back to your last shopping trip and see if you remember any other details that might explain the discrepancy? Was there a sale or promotion on Tide or Bounty? Did you use any other coupons or discounts? Any additional information you can provide might help clarify things.",
