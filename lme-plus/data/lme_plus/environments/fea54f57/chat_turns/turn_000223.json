  "content": "A dedicated film scanner is a great investment for any film enthusiast! Digitizing your negatives and slides can help you preserve your work, share it easily, and even edit and enhance your images.\n\nFor an entry-level film scanner that can handle 35mm and 120 film, I'd recommend the following options:\n\n1. **Epson Perfection V550**: A popular and highly-regarded scanner that can handle 35mm and 120 film, as well as medium format. It's easy to use, has a high-quality scanning sensor, and comes with Epson's ScanSmart software.\n2. **Epson Perfection V600**: Similar to the V550, but with some additional features like a built-in transparency unit for scanning slides and a higher optical resolution (6400 dpi vs 4800 dpi).\n3. **Plustek OpticFilm 8200i**: A dedicated film scanner that can handle 35mm and 120 film, with a high-quality scanning sensor and a built-in infrared channel for dust and scratch removal. It's a bit more expensive than the Epson options, but offers excellent image quality.\n4. **Reflecta ProScan 7200**: A compact and affordable scanner that can handle 35mm and 120 film, with a high-quality scanning sensor and a built-in transparency unit. It's a great option for those on a budget.\n\nWhen choosing a film scanner, consider the following factors:\n\n* **Resolution**: Look for a scanner with a high optical resolution (measured in dpi) for detailed scans.\n* **Film handling**: Ensure the scanner can handle your desired film format (35mm, 120, or medium format).\n* **Software**: Check if the scanner comes with bundled software that can help you edit and enhance your scans.\n* **Connectivity**: Consider a scanner with USB or Wi-Fi connectivity for easy connection to your computer.\n* **Price**: Entry-level film scanners can range from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars, so set a budget and look for options within your range.\n\nBefore making a final decision, read reviews, watch YouTube tutorials, and compare the features and pricing of different scanners to find the best fit for your needs.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about film scanners or the digitization process?",
