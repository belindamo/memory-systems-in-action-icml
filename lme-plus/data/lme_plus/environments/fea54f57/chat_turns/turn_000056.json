  "content": "To get to Todoroki Valley from central Tokyo, you can take the Tokyu Oimachi Line from Shibuya Station to Todoroki Station. From there, it's about a 10-minute walk to the entrance of the valley. Alternatively, you can take the Setagaya Line from Sangen-jaya Station to Todoroki Valley Station, but this station is a bit further from the valley entrance, so you'll need to walk for around 20-25 minutes to reach the valley. Once you arrive at the entrance of the valley, you'll be able to start your hike and explore the beautiful surroundings.",
