That's great!\n\nJust to clarify, I'm a large language model, I don't have the ability to store or recall any personal information, including your business plans, financial projections, or meeting schedules. This conversation is a fresh start every time you interact with me.\n\nHowever, I can certainly help you with any questions or topics related to business plans, financial projections, or the loan application process. If you'd like to discuss any of those topics or need guidance on preparing for your meeting with the loan officer, feel free to ask!",
