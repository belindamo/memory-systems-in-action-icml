  "content": "Understood. Here are some additional ideas for a game that combines \"outdoor\" and \"giant fun\":\n\n1. Giant Lawn Bowling: A supersized version of the classic lawn game, where players roll a giant ball to knock over giant pins.\n2. Giant Ring Toss: A game where players toss giant rings onto giant pegs, similar to the classic carnival game.\n3. Giant Pick-Up Sticks: A game where players take turns pulling giant sticks out of a pile without causing the other sticks to move.\n4. Giant Bubble Soccer: A game where players wear inflatable bubbles and try to score goals while bouncing into each other.\n5. Giant Pong: A game where players use large balls to play a giant version of beer pong.\n6. Giant Dominoes: A game where players take turns laying giant dominoes in a line, with the goal of creating a long chain.\n7. Giant Cornhole: A game where players toss giant beanbags into giant holes in a board, similar to the classic tailgating game.\n\nI hope these ideas are helpful for your upcoming brainstorming session!",
