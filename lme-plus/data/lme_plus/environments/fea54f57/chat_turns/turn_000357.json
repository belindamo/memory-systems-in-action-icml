These prophecies include:\n\n1. The Rapture: This is when all true believers in Christ are taken up to heaven, leaving behind the unbelievers to face the tribulation, which is a period of seven years of intense suffering and persecution.\n\n2. The Antichrist: This is a figure who rises to power during the tribulation and leads the world in rebellion against God. The Antichrist is said to be a charismatic and powerful leader who can perform miracles and deceive many people.\n\n3. The Mark of the Beast: This is a mark or symbol that the Antichrist requires everyone to have in order to buy or sell goods. Those who refuse to take the mark will be killed.\n\n4. The Battle of Armageddon: This is the final battle between Jesus Christ and the forces of evil, which takes place at the end of the tribulation. It is depicted as a massive, apocalyptic battle.\n\n5. The Second Coming: This is when Jesus Christ returns to earth to defeat the Antichrist and establish his kingdom on earth. After the Second Coming, there is a period of 1,000 years of peace and prosperity, known as the Millennium.\n\nThese are just a few of the major prophecies depicted in the film. Reading the sources I mentioned earlier can provide additional context and insights into these prophecies.",
