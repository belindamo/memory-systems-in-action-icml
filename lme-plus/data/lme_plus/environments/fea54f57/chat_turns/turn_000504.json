July is a great time to visit the Rockies, with warm weather and long days. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Temperature:**\n\n* Daytime temperatures in July usually range from the mid-70s to mid-80s Fahrenheit (23-30\u00b0C) in the lower elevations (below 8,000 ft).\n* At higher elevations (above 8,000 ft), daytime temperatures can be 10-15\u00b0F (5-8\u00b0C) cooler.\n* Nighttime temperatures can drop significantly, even in the summer, so be prepared for temperatures ranging from 50\u00b0F to 60\u00b0F (10-15\u00b0C).\n\n**Precipitation:**\n\n* July is typically a dry month in the Rocky Mountains, with an average of 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of precipitation throughout the month.\n* Afternoon thunderstorms are common in the Rockies during the summer, so be prepared for occasional rain showers.\n\n**Other Weather Conditions:**\n\n* Humidity is usually relatively low in the Rockies, ranging from 30-50%.\n* UV radiation is high at high elevations, so don't forget your sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat.\n* Wind can be a factor, especially in the afternoons, so pack layers and be prepared for gusty conditions.\n\n**Regional Variations:**\n\n* The weather can vary depending on the specific location within the Rocky Mountains. For example:\n\t+ The southern Rockies (e.g., Colorado, New Mexico) tend to be warmer and drier than the northern Rockies (e.g., Montana, Wyoming).\n\t+ The higher elevations (e.g., above 10,000 ft) will be cooler and potentially snowier than the lower elevations.\n\nTo get more specific weather forecasts, I recommend checking websites like:\n\n1. National Weather Service (NWS): [www.weather.gov](http://www.weather.gov)\n2. OpenSnow: [www.opensnow.com](http://www.opensnow.com) (for mountain weather forecasts)\n3.
