  "content": "In the story, the mother flushed the following items down the toilet:\n\n* The soiled diaper\n* The wipes used to clean up the diaper blowout\n* Emma's soiled shirt\n* Emma's soiled overalls\n\nThese items were all contaminated by the diaper blowout and could not be kept, so the mother decided to flush them down the toilet. As mentioned earlier, flushing clothing and other non-biodegradable items down the toilet is not a recommended practice and should only be done in emergency situations. However, in this case, the mother was able to dispose of the soiled items without any issues and was able to get Emma into clean clothes.",
