  "content": "Habitica is highly customizable, and you can tailor it to fit your specific exercise tracking needs. Here are some ways you can customize your exercise habit tracking:\n\n1. **Custom Habit Types**: You can create custom habit types, such as \"Morning Workout,\" \"Evening Run,\" or \"Yoga Practice.\" This allows you to differentiate between different types of exercise and track them separately.\n2. **Habit Tags**: Habitica uses a tagging system, which enables you to add specific tags to your habits. For example, you can add tags like \"Cardio,\" \"Strength Training,\" or \"Flexibility\" to your exercise habits. This helps you filter and track specific types of exercises.\n3. **Task Notes**: As I mentioned earlier, you can add notes to your tasks, including exercise habits. This is where you can log additional details, such as:\n\t* Exercise type (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench press)\n\t* Weight lifted or reps completed\n\t* Distance or time for cardio exercises\n\t* Any other relevant details you want to track\n4. **Custom Fields**: Habitica offers custom fields, which are essentially additional input fields that you can add to your habits. You can create custom fields like \"Weight,\" \"Reps,\" \"Distance,\" or \"Time\" to track specific metrics for your exercises.\n5. **Habitica Scripts**: If you're comfortable with coding, Habitica has a scripting feature that allows you to create custom scripts to automate tasks or calculations. You can use scripts to create custom tracking systems or integrate Habitica with other services.\n\nTo access these customization options, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to your Habitica account and navigate to the \"Habits\" tab.\n2. Click on the \"New Habit\" button to create a new habit or edit an existing one.\n3. In the habit creation/edit page, you'll find options to add tags, notes, and custom fields.\n4. To access custom habit types, go to the \"Settings\" tab and click on \"Habit Types.\"\n\nRemember, Habitica is a highly customizable platform, so don't be afraid to experiment and tailor it to your specific needs. If you have any questions or need help with customization, the Habitica community is very active and supportive.",
