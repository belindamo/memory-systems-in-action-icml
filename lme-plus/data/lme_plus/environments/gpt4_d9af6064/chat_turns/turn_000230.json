Graders look for signs of wear, such as scratches, dings, and corrosion.\n3. **Surface Preservation:** The coin's surface is examined for its originality, luster, and any signs of cleaning, tampering, or alteration.\n4. **Strike:** The coin's strike, or the impression of the dies on the planchet, is evaluated for its quality and clarity.\n5. **Eye Appeal:** The coin's overall appearance, including its color, tone, and aesthetic appeal, is considered.\n6. **Rarity:** The coin's rarity and demand are taken into account when determining its value.\n\n**Grading Scale:**\n\nThe grading scale used by most services is as follows:\n\n* **MS-70:** Mint State, perfect condition, with no signs of wear or imperfections.\n* **MS-69:** Mint State, nearly perfect condition, with minor imperfections.\n* **MS-68:** Mint State, high-quality condition, with slight imperfections.\n* **MS-67:** Mint State, high-quality condition, with noticeable imperfections.\n* **MS-66:** Mint State, average condition, with visible imperfections.\n* **MS-65:** Mint State, lower-quality condition, with significant imperfections.\n* **AU-58:** Almost Uncirculated, light wear on the high points.\n* **AU-55:** Almost Uncirculated, moderate wear on the high points.\n* **XF-45:** Extremely Fine, moderate wear on the entire surface.\n* **VF-35:** Very Fine, noticeable wear on the entire surface.\n* **F-25:** Fine, significant wear on the entire surface.\n* **VG-10:** Very Good, heavy wear on the entire surface.\n* **G-5:** Good, very heavy wear on the entire surface.\n* **AG-3:** About Good, highly worn, with some detail remaining.\n* **G-1:** Good, extremely worn, with minimal detail remaining.\n\nRemember, coin grading is subjective, and different services may have slightly different standards. It's essential to research and understand the grading process to make informed decisions when buying or selling coins.",
