  "content": "I actually prefer full-cast narrations, especially for novels with multiple characters and dialogue-heavy scenes. I think it adds to the immersive experience and helps me keep track of who's speaking. But I've also enjoyed audiobooks with single narrators who can bring a unique tone and style to the story. What about you, do you have any recommendations for audiobooks with great narration?",
