  "content": "I'm with XYZ Internet, and I currently have a 500 Mbps plan. I recently got a new router on January 15th, which has improved my Wi-Fi signal strength significantly. However, I still need to figure out how to set up the guest network feature. As for devices, I have around 5-6 devices connected, including my laptop, smart TV, and smart speaker. I usually work from my home office, which is about 10-15 feet away from the router. I've been using Wi-Fi, but I do have an Ethernet cable if needed. I haven't run a speed test recently, but I'll do that now.",
