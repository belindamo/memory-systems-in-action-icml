  "content": "The Cucumber Lime Refresher is a perfect drink for a summer party, and you can definitely make it ahead of time to some extent. Here's what I recommend:\n\n**Make-ahead options:**\n\n1. **Infuse the cucumber:** Slice the cucumber and infuse it in water for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. You can do this up to 2 hours in advance. Strain the cucumber slices from the water and store it in the fridge until you're ready to assemble the drinks.\n2. **Prepare the lime juice:** Juice the limes and store the juice in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 24 hours. This will save you time when assembling the drinks.\n3. **Mix the sweetener:** If you're using a sweetener like agave nectar, honey, or sugar, you can mix it with water to create a syrup and store it in the fridge for up to 1 week.\n\n**Assemble just before serving:**\n\n1. **Combine the ingredients:** Just before serving, combine the infused cucumber water, lime juice, sweetener syrup, and sparkling water in a large pitcher. Stir well to combine.\n2. **Add garnishes:** Add slices of cucumber, lime wedges, and mint leaves to the pitcher or individual glasses for garnish.\n\n**Why not to make it too far in advance:**\n\n* The cucumber flavor will become too strong and overpowering if it infuses for too long.\n* The lime juice may lose its brightness and flavor if stored for too long.\n* The sparkling water will lose its fizz if added too far in advance.\n\n**Tips for large batches:**\n\n* Use a large pitcher or container to make the drink in batches, if needed.\n* Consider setting up a DIY drink station with the ingredients and garnishes, so guests can assemble their own drinks.\n* If you're concerned about the drink getting watered down, you can prepare the ingredients in smaller batches and assemble the drinks in smaller pitchers or jugs.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be able to make a large batch of Cucumber Lime Refresher for your summer party while maintaining its fresh and refreshing flavor!",
