  "content": "In the story, the overalls were flushed down the toilet. When something is flushed down a toilet, it is carried away through a network of pipes and eventually reaches a wastewater treatment plant. At the treatment plant, the water is cleaned and any solid waste is removed and disposed of properly. So, it can be assumed that the overalls were carried away through the pipes and ended up at a wastewater treatment plant, where they were likely disposed of in an appropriate manner. However, it is also possible that the overalls did not make it through the pipes and became stuck somewhere along the way, in which case they would need to be removed by a professional.",
