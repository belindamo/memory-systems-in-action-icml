  "content": "The post-workshop contact organization conundrum! I'm happy to help you with that. Here are some tips to help you categorize and label your new contacts:\n\n1. **Create a new group or label**: Designate a specific group or label for the contacts you met at the workshop. This could be something like \"Workshop 2023,\" \"Networking Contacts,\" or \"Industry Connections.\"\n2. **Use tags or keywords**: Assign relevant tags or keywords to each contact, such as \"Marketing,\" \"Design,\" or \"Entrepreneur.\" This way, you can quickly filter your contacts by topic or industry.\n3. **Add context notes**: Include a brief note or description about how you met each person, what you discussed, or any follow-up actions you need to take. This will help you remember the context of your initial conversation.\n4. **Categorize by role or profession**: If you met people with similar roles or professions, consider creating separate groups for each category (e.g., \"Designers,\" \"Marketers,\" \"Entrepreneurs\").\n5. **Prioritize follow-up contacts**: Identify the people you want to follow up with immediately and label them as \"Follow-up\" or \"Priority.\" This will help you stay on top of your post-workshop connections.\n6. **Use color-coding**: If your phone or contact app allows it, use different colors to categorize your contacts. For example, you could use blue for workshop attendees, green for colleagues, or red for priority follow-ups.\n7. **Standardize your naming convention**: Establish a consistent naming convention for your contacts, such as \"First Name Last Name - Workshop\" or \"First Name - Company/Role.\"\n8. **Merge duplicates**: If you have multiple contacts with the same name, merge them into a single entry to avoid duplication and confusion.\n9. **Review and update regularly**: Set a reminder to review your contacts periodically to ensure they're still relevant and up-to-date.\n10. **Consider using a CRM tool**: If you have a large number of contacts or plan to attend more workshops, consider using a customer relationship management (CRM) tool like HubSpot, Trello, or Airtable to help you organize and manage your contacts more efficiently.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you'll be able to effectively categorize and label your new contacts, making it easier to stay in touch and nurture those valuable connections.\n\nNow, go ahead and give Emily a call to catch up and discuss how you can collaborate or support each other!",
