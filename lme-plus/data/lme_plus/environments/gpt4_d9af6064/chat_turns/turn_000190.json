While a DIY drink station can be a fantastic way to offer guests a customizable experience, it's not necessary to have a separate station dedicated to it. Here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\n**DIY Drink Station:**\n\nPros:\n\n* Guests can customize their drinks to their liking with various garnishes and sweetener options.\n* It can be a fun and interactive experience, encouraging guests to get creative with their drinks.\n* You can display the ingredients and garnishes attractively, adding to the overall aesthetic of your party.\n\nCons:\n\n* It requires a dedicated space, which might be a challenge if you're short on space.\n* You'll need to set up multiple containers, utensils, and garnishes, which can be time-consuming and add to your party prep.\n* Guests might need guidance or instructions on how to assemble their drinks, which could lead to confusion or mess.\n\n**Pitcher Service:**\n\nPros:\n\n* It's a more low-key and low-maintenance option, requiring minimal setup and space.\n* Guests can still serve themselves, and you can label the pitchers with the drink name and ingredients.\n* It's a more straightforward and easy-to-execute option, leaving you more time to focus on other party details.\n\nCons:\n\n* Guests won't have the option to customize their drinks as much, although you can still offer a few garnish options on the side.\n* It might not be as visually appealing or interactive as a DIY drink station.\n\nConsidering your concerns about space, I think offering a few pitchers of Cucumber Lime Refresher and letting guests serve themselves is a great option. You can still add a few garnish options, like cucumber slices, lime wedges, and mint leaves, on the side to give guests some customization options.\n\nTo make it more visually appealing, consider the following:\n\n* Use attractive pitchers or dispensers that fit your party theme.\n* Add a few decorative elements, like a small vase with fresh flowers or a few sprigs of mint, to the serving area.\n* Create a simple sign or label with the drink name and ingredients to add a personal touch.\n\nBy offering a pitcher service, you'll still provide a refreshing and delicious drink option for your guests while keeping things simple and easy to manage.",
