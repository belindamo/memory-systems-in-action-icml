  "content": "I do not have access to personal anecdotes or stories from smith college students, but i can tell you that students often participate in various outdoor activities on mountain day, such as hiking, picnicking, playing frisbee, or just relaxing in the beautiful surroundings. some students have even created their own traditions for mountain day, like organizing a sing-along, dancing, or playing games. one story i found online tells of a student who brought a portable grill up the mountain and cooked burgers for her friends. another story talks about students sledding down the mountain using cafeteria trays. overall, it seems that students use the day to enjoy each other's company, take a break from classes, and make memories that will last a lifetime.",
