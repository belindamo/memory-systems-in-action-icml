That's a great step towards better internet connectivity.\n\nRegarding your slow speeds, have you tried troubleshooting the issue or checking your internet speed using online tools like Speedtest.net? This can give you a better understanding of your current speeds and help you identify if the issue is with your provider or your setup.\n\nBefore calling your provider, you may want to consider the following:\n\n1. **Check your plan**: Review your current internet plan and ensure it's suitable for your needs, especially when working from home. You may need to upgrade to a faster plan to support multiple devices and heavy usage.\n2. **Restart your router**: Sometimes, a simple reboot can resolve connectivity issues. Try turning your router off and on to see if it improves your speeds.\n3. **Check for interference**: Other devices in your home or nearby can interfere with your Wi-Fi signal. Try moving devices that use the same frequency band (e.g., cordless phones, microwaves) away from your router.\n4. **Optimize your router's placement**: Ensure your router is placed in a central location, elevated, and away from obstacles to maximize signal strength and coverage.\n5. **Check for outages**: Visit your provider's website or social media to see if there are any reported outages or maintenance in your area.\n\nWhen you're ready to call your provider, be prepared to:\n\n1. **Know your current plan details**: Have your plan details, including your speed tier and pricing, ready to discuss with the customer service representative.\n2. **Explain your issues**: Clearly describe the slow speeds you're experiencing, including when the issues started and any troubleshooting steps you've taken.\n3. **Ask about promotions**: Inquire about any current promotions or discounts that might be available to you.\n4. **Negotiate**: If you're not satisfied with the response, politely ask to speak with a supervisor or retention specialist to see if they can offer a better deal.\n\nRegarding the guest network feature on your new router, you can usually find instructions in the router's user manual or online documentation. If you're still having trouble, feel free to ask, and I can try to guide you through the process.\n\nRemember to stay calm and patient when negotiating with your provider. Good luck, and I hope you're able to resolve your internet speed issues and get a better deal!",
