  "content": "It is not common for parents to have to flush their children's clothing away. In most cases, soiled clothing can be cleaned and kept, or disposed of in a trash bin. Flushing clothing down the toilet is not a typical method of disposal and should only be done in emergency situations, such as when the clothing is contaminated with a hazardous substance. It is generally not recommended to flush clothing down the toilet, as it can clog the pipes and cause other issues. Therefore, it is not something that most parents have to do on a regular basis.",
