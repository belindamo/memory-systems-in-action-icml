The highlight of our Christmas dinner was definitely the food - we had a huge feast with all the trimmings, and my sister helped me with the cooking. We made a mess, but it was worth it. As for traditions, we usually exchange gifts, watch a movie together, and just enjoy each other's company.\n\nBut anyway, back to meal prep... I was thinking of making a big batch of rice and roasting some vegetables to go with the chicken. Do you have any suggestions for some easy vegetable recipes that would pair well with the Lemon Garlic Chicken?",
