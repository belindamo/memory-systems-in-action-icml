  "content": "I'm glad you're excited to explore your smart speaker's capabilities further. I just remembered that I need to reorder some smart speaker batteries, as they're running low. Anyway, I was wondering if you could give me some tips on how to create custom routines on my smart speaker. I'd love to automate some tasks, like turning off lights when I leave the house or locking doors at night. Could you walk me through the process?",
