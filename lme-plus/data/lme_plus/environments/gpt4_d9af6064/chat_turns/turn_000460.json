Many museums offer guided tours, artist talks, workshops, or other interactive experiences that can enhance your visit and provide a deeper understanding of the artwork.\n\nSome possible events or activities they might offer could include:\n\n* Guided tours with a knowledgeable docent or photographer\n* Artist talks or lectures about the exhibit\n* Photography workshops or classes where you can learn new techniques\n* Interactive activities, such as photography scavenger hunts or hands-on projects\n* Panel discussions or Q&A sessions with photography experts\n\nIf you're interested in getting more out of your visit, I'd recommend checking the museum's website or contacting them ahead of time to see what's available. You can also ask about any special events or activities that might be happening during your planned visit.\n\nThat being said, viewing the exhibit on your own can also be a great way to experience the artwork at your own pace and have more of a personal connection with the photographs. So, either way, I'm sure you and your sister will have a great time!",
