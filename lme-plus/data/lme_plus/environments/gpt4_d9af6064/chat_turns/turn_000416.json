  "content": "The standard progress payment schedule under the NSW HIA Lump Sum contract outlines the payment schedule for a construction project. The schedule typically starts with an initial deposit paid to the builder before construction begins. Subsequent payments, known as progress payments, are made throughout the project based on the completion of specific stages or milestones.\n\nThe payment schedule should be clearly outlined in the contract, including the amount and timing of each payment. It is important for homeowners to understand the payment schedule and their payment obligations to avoid disputes with the builder. Homeowners should also keep track of progress payments to ensure that they are being made correctly and in accordance with the contract.\n\nIf a dispute arises over a progress payment, the parties can seek resolution through the Security of Payment Act in NSW. This legislation provides a process for resolving payment disputes in the construction industry and can help ensure that progress payments are made in a timely and fair manner.",
