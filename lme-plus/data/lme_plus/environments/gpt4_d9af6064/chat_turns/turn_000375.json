Here are some tips on how to store roasted vegetables in the fridge and freezer:\n\n**Fridge Storage:**\n\n1. **Cool completely**: Let the roasted vegetables cool down to room temperature before refrigerating them. This helps prevent moisture from forming and promotes even cooling.\n2. **Airtight containers**: Store the cooled vegetables in airtight containers, such as glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. You can also use zip-top plastic bags or beeswax wraps.\n3. **Label and date**: Label the containers with the contents and date, so you can easily keep track of how long they've been stored.\n4. **Store in the refrigerator**: Place the containers in the refrigerator and consume within 3 to 5 days.\n\n**Freezer Storage:**\n\n1. **Cool completely**: Same as above, let the roasted vegetables cool down to room temperature before freezing.\n2. **Portion and package**: Divide the cooled vegetables into portions you'll use in a single meal. Package each portion in airtight containers, freezer bags, or freezer-safe mason jars.\n3. **Label and date**: Label the containers or bags with the contents, date, and any relevant reheating instructions.\n4. **Freeze**: Place the containers or bags in the freezer and store at 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or below.\n\n**Tips for Freezer Storage:**\n\n* Frozen roasted vegetables are best consumed within 3 to 6 months for optimal flavor and texture.\n* When reheating frozen vegetables, simply thaw them overnight in the refrigerator or reheat in the microwave or oven until warmed through.\n* You can also blanch roasted vegetables before freezing to preserve their color and texture. To blanch, submerge the vegetables in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then immediately plunge them into an ice bath to stop the cooking process.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you can enjoy your roasted vegetables for a longer period and reduce food waste.
