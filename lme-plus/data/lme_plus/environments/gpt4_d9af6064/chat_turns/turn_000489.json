  "content": "It is not possible for Emma to retrieve her overalls once they have been flushed down the toilet. Once something is flushed down a toilet, it is carried away through a network of pipes and eventually reaches a wastewater treatment plant. At the treatment plant, the water is cleaned and any solid waste is removed and disposed of properly. Therefore, the overalls are no longer accessible and cannot be retrieved. They have been disposed of and are no longer in Emma's possession.",
