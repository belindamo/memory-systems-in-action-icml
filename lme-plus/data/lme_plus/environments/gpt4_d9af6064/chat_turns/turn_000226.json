The 1955 Doubled Die Lincoln Cent and the 1937-D Buffalo Nickel with a three-legged buffalo are indeed two of the most iconic error coins in numismatics. Let me share more about these famous errors:\n\n**1955 Doubled Die Lincoln Cent:**\n\n* Also known as the \"King of Error Coins,\" this cent features a double-strike of the die, resulting in a doubled image of Lincoln's portrait, date, and inscriptions.\n* The error occurred when a die was impressed twice, creating a doubled image, rather than being properly aligned for a single strike.\n* Only 24,000-40,000 coins were produced with this error, making it highly sought after by collectors.\n* In mint state condition, the 1955 Doubled Die Lincoln Cent can fetch prices ranging from $1,000 to over $10,000.\n\n**1937-D Buffalo Nickel with a Three-Legged Buffalo:**\n\n* This error coin features a buffalo with only three legs, instead of the usual four, due to a die break or clash.\n* The error occurred when the die was damaged, causing the fourth leg to be missing or partially formed.\n* Only five examples of this error are known to exist, making it one of the rarest and most valuable error coins.\n* In mint state condition, the 1937-D Buffalo Nickel with a three-legged buffalo can fetch prices ranging from $100,000 to over $1 million.\n\nOther famous error coins include:\n\n* **1943 Lincoln Wheat Cent with a bronze planchet:** A rare error where a few cents were struck on bronze planchets instead of steel, similar to the 1943 copper cent.\n* **1950-D Jefferson Nickel with a reverse of 1949:** A mistake where the 1950-D nickel was struck with a 1949 reverse die, featuring a different design.\n* **1970-D Kennedy Half Dollar with a 40% silver content:** A small batch of half dollars was mistakenly struck with a 40% silver content, instead of the standard copper-nickel clad.\n* **1982 Lincoln Cent with a copper planchet:** A few cents were struck on copper planchets instead of the usual zinc-coated steel, similar to the 1943 copper cent.\n\nWhen collecting error coins, it's essential to remember:\n\n* Authenticity: Ensure the coin is genuine and not altered or tampered with.\n* Condition: The coin's condition greatly affects its value, so handle and store them carefully.\n* Rarity: The fewer examples of an error coin, the more valuable it tends to be.\n* Provenance: Keep records of the coin's history, including its origin, ownership, and any notable sales.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many fascinating error coins out there. Happy collecting, and who knows, you might stumble upon a rare error coin that becomes a crown jewel in your collection!",
