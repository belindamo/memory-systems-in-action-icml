  "content": "Thank you for this comprehensive guide on how to create better prompts for Midjourney Bot. I've carefully read and noted the information you've provided. From now on, I will focus on creating clear and specific prompts by considering subject, medium, environment, lighting, color, mood, composition, and using collective nouns or specific numbers when appropriate. I'm excited to apply these principles to generate more accurate and creative ideas for you! Please let me know if you have any additional guidance or if you're ready for me to provide new ideas based on these prompting techniques.",
