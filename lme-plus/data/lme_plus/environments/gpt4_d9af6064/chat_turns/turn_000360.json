  "content": "Prompts\n Light\nA Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.\nStructure\nBasic Prompts\nA basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji\n\nImage showing the Midjourney prompt structure.\n\nAdvanced Prompts\nMore advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parameters\n\nImage showing the Midjourney prompt structure.\n\nImage Prompts\nImage URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.\n\nRead more about Image Prompts\n\nPrompt Text\nThe text description of what image you want to generate. See below for prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images.\n\nParameters\nParameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.\n\nRead more about Parameters\n\nPrompting Notes\nPrompt Length\nPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney\u2019s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren\u2019t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.\n\nGrammar\nThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.\n\nMidjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.\n\nFocus on What you Want\nIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you don\u2019t want. If you ask for a party with \u201cno cake,\u201d your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.\n\nThink About What Details Matter\nAnything left unsaid may suprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.\n\nTry to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:\n\nSubject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.\nMedium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.\nEnvironment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.\nLighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc\nColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.\nMood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.\nComposition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.\nUse Collective Nouns\nPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. \"Three cats\" is more specific than \"cats.\" Collective nouns also work, \u201cflock of birds\u201d instead of \"birds.\u201d",
