Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. **Calendar Integration**: Habitica allows you to connect your Google Calendar or iCal calendar to your Habitica account. This integration enables you to:\n\t* See your Habitica tasks and habits on your calendar.\n\t* Get reminders for your habits and tasks on your calendar.\n\t* Use Habitica's \"Dailies\" feature to schedule habits on specific days of the week or month, which will then appear on your calendar.\n2. **Reminders**: Habitica offers reminders for your habits, including exercise routines. You can set reminders for:\n\t* Specific times of the day (e.g., 7:00 AM for your morning workout).\n\t* Specific days of the week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday for your exercise routine).\n\t* Custom intervals (e.g., every 2 days, every 3 days, etc.).\n3. **Task Notifications**: Habitica sends you notifications when it's time to complete a task or habit, including exercise routines. You can customize the notification settings to fit your preferences.\n4. **Habit Streaks**: Habitica tracks your habit streaks, which can be a great motivator. If you miss a workout, your streak will reset, and you'll need to start again from day one.\n\nWhile Habitica doesn't directly connect to fitness tracking apps like MyFitnessPal or Strava, you can still use its habit tracking features to log your workouts and stay consistent. You can also use Habitica's \"Notes\" feature to track additional details about your workouts, such as the type of exercise, duration, or weight lifted.\n\nOverall, Habitica is an excellent choice for tracking your exercise routine and staying consistent with your morning workouts. Its gamification features, habit tracking, and reminders will help you stay motivated and on track!",
