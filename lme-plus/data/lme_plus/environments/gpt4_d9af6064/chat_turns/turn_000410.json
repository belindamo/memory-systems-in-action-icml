  "content": "Payment schedules are an essential part of the progress payment process under the NSW HIA Lump Sum contract. They provide a framework for the payment of the builder\u2019s work at specific stages of the construction process. The payment schedule must be included in the contract, and it outlines the amount of each progress payment and when it is due.\n\nThe importance of payment schedules lies in the fact that they ensure that both parties understand when payments are due and how much is due at each stage. This clarity can help prevent disputes and misunderstandings between the homeowner and the builder. Additionally, payment schedules provide a level of protection for homeowners. They ensure that the builder does not receive more money than they are entitled to before completing the work required for that payment stage. Conversely, payment schedules also ensure that builders are paid for the work they have completed and that they have a clear understanding of when they will receive payment.",
