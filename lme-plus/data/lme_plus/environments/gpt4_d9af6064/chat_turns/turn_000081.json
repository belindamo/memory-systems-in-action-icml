Within the simulated reality of the Matrix, the rules of physics and mathematics can be manipulated by those with sufficient power and control.\n\nSo, in theory, if you were \"Neo\" and had control over the Matrix, you could potentially make the result of 2 plus 7 equal 8 within that simulated reality.
