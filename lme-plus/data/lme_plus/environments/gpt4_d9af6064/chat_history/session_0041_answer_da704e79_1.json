      "content": "Thank you for providing that information!\n\nIt's great to hear that your new router has improved your Wi-Fi signal strength. Setting up a guest network is a good idea to isolate visitors from your main network. I can provide you with general steps to set it up, if you'd like.\n\nNow, let's focus on your internet speed. With a 500 Mbps plan, you should expect fast speeds. Since you're working from home, a reliable and fast connection is crucial.\n\n**Speed Test Results:**\nPlease go ahead and run a speed test using a tool like Speedtest.net (by Ookla) or Fast.com (by Netflix). This will give us a better understanding of your current internet speeds. Take note of the following:\n\n* Download speed (measured in Mbps)\n* Upload speed (measured in Mbps)\n* Ping (measured in ms)\n\nOnce you have the results, share them with me, and we can analyze them together.\n\n**Potential Areas to Investigate:**\n\n1. **Interference from Neighboring Networks:** With more devices connected, there's a higher chance of interference from nearby networks. We might need to explore ways to minimize this interference.\n2. **Router Configuration:** Although your new router has improved your signal strength, there might be some configuration tweaks we can make to optimize its performance.\n3. **Device Prioritization:** With 5-6 devices connected, we might need to prioritize devices that require high-bandwidth activities, like video conferencing or online gaming.\n4. **Network Congestion:** If multiple devices are consuming bandwidth-intensive resources simultaneously, it could slow down your internet speed. We can discuss ways to manage network congestion.\n\nLet's get started with the speed test results, and then we can dive deeper into these potential areas to improve your internet speed!",
