Here are some tips to help you clean your oven after baking the chicken:\n\n**Before you start cleaning:**\n\n1. **Turn off the oven** and let it cool down completely. This will prevent any accidental burns or injuries.\n2. **Remove racks and shelves**: Take out the oven racks and shelves and wash them in soapy water. This will prevent any food residue from baking onto the racks and make cleaning easier.\n\n**Easy Oven Cleaning Methods:**\n\n**Method 1: Self-Cleaning Cycle (if your oven has this feature)**\n\n1. Check your oven manual to see if it has a self-cleaning cycle.\n2. Remove any large food debris from the oven floor.\n3. Set the oven to the self-cleaning cycle, which can take 2-4 hours.\n4. Let the oven do its magic! The high heat will burn off food residue and grime.\n\n**Method 2: Baking Soda and Water**\n\n1. Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with 1 tablespoon of water to form a paste.\n2. Apply the paste to the interior surfaces of the oven using a sponge or brush.\n3. Let it sit overnight or for at least 8 hours.\n4. Wipe off the paste with a damp cloth or sponge. You may need to scrub slightly.\n\n**Method 3: Vinegar and Steam**\n\n1. Mix 1 cup of white vinegar with 1 cup of water in a bowl.\n2. Place the bowl in the oven and heat it to 200\u00b0F (90\u00b0C) for 30 minutes.\n3. Turn off the oven and let it cool slightly.\n4. Use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe down the interior surfaces. The acid in the vinegar will help break down tough grime.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* For tough stains, you can use a gentle scrubber or a mixture of equal parts water and cream of tartar.\n* Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage your oven's finish.\n* If you have a window in your oven door, use a glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth to clean it.\n* Clean your oven regularly to prevent grime buildup. Try to clean it every 1-2 months, depending on usage.\n\nBy following these methods, you should be able to clean your oven effectively and make it shine like new!\n\nNow, go enjoy your delicious Lemon Garlic Chicken Breast, and don't worry about the oven cleaning \u2013 it's taken care of!"

You can also use zip-top plastic bags or beeswax wraps.\n3. **Label and date**: Label the containers with the contents and date, so you can easily keep track of how long they've been stored.\n4. **Store in the refrigerator**: Place the containers in the refrigerator and consume within 3 to 5 days.\n\n**Freezer Storage:**\n\n1. **Cool completely**: Same as above, let the roasted vegetables cool down to room temperature before freezing.\n2. **Portion and package**: Divide the cooled vegetables into portions you'll use in a single meal. Package each portion in airtight containers, freezer bags, or freezer-safe mason jars.\n3. **Label and date**: Label the containers or bags with the contents, date, and any relevant reheating instructions.\n4. **Freeze**: Place the containers or bags in the freezer and store at 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C) or below.\n\n**Tips for Freezer Storage:**\n\n* Frozen roasted vegetables are best consumed within 3 to 6 months for optimal flavor and texture.\n* When reheating frozen vegetables, simply thaw them overnight in the refrigerator or reheat in the microwave or oven until warmed through.\n* You can also blanch roasted vegetables before freezing to preserve their color and texture. To blanch, submerge the vegetables in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then immediately plunge them into an ice bath to stop the cooking process.\n\nBy following these storage tips, you can enjoy your roasted vegetables for a longer period and reduce food waste.
