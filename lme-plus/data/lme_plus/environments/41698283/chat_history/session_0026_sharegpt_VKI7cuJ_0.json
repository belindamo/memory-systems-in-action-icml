You have a weak understanding of instructional design and adult learning.\nTask: write three multiple choice assessment questions to determine if these adult learners possess essential basic knowledge of the subject matter.\nInstruction: focus only on knowledge of cloud types and cloud formation."

Which of the following statements about clouds is true?\na) Clouds are made up of water vapor only.\nb) Clouds form only in cold temperatures.\nc) Clouds can form at any altitude.\n2. What is the name of the process by which water vapor in the atmosphere is turned into liquid droplets that form clouds?\na) Evaporation\nb) Condensation\nc) Precipitation\n3.

What is the primary cause of cloud formation?\na) The accumulation of water droplets in the atmosphere\nb) The release of gases from factories and vehicles\nc) The movement of tectonic plates\n2. Which of the following processes occurs during cloud formation?\na) Water vapor is converted directly into ice crystals\nb) Water droplets are absorbed into the atmosphere\nc) Water vapor cools and condenses into visible water droplets\n3. What is the term used to describe the altitude at which clouds form in the atmosphere?\na) Climatological level\nb) Meteorological ceiling\nc) Stratospheric boundary"
