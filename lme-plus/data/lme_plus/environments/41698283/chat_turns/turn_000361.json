  "content": "Nepenthe Market is a great choice for snacks and sandwiches. While Nepenthe Market itself doesn't have outdoor seating areas, you're in luck because Nepenthe Restaurant, which is located right next to the market, has an iconic outdoor seating area with stunning views of the coastline!\n\nNepenthe Restaurant's outdoor seating area is a popular spot to enjoy a meal or snack, and it's a great place to take in the breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean and the surrounding redwoods. You can grab your snacks and sandwiches from the market and then head over to the restaurant's outdoor seating area to enjoy your meal.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Be prepared for crowds, especially during peak season (June to September).\n* Seating is first-come, first-served, so you might need to wait a bit for a table.\n* If you're planning to eat at the restaurant, be aware that they have a separate menu and prices compared to the market.\n* Don't forget to take plenty of photos of the stunning views!\n\nIf you're looking for alternative picnic spots, there are several state parks and scenic overlooks in Big Sur that offer picnic tables and stunning views. Some popular options include:\n\n* Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park\n* Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park\n* Bixby Bridge Overlook\n* McWay Falls Trailhead\n\nRemember to always follow park rules and regulations, and be respectful of the environment and other visitors.\n\nEnjoy your picnic lunch and the stunning views of Big Sur!",
