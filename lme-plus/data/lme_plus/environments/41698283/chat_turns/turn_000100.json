Since you mentioned enjoying sourdough with butter, I'll suggest some recipes that share similar characteristics or flavor profiles. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **Rosemary and Olive Oil Focaccia**: This Italian bread is perfect for sopping up olive oil, much like your sourdough with butter. The rosemary adds a piney, herbaceous flavor that pairs beautifully with the richness of olive oil.\n2. **Cheesy Garlic Ciabatta**: This Italian bread is known for its airy holes and crispy crust. By adding garlic and grated cheese, you'll create a savory, aromatic bread that's perfect for snacking or serving alongside soups.\n3. **Kalamata Olive and Thyme Bread**: This bread combines the brininess of olives with the earthiness of thyme. The result is a complex, savory flavor profile that's perfect for accompanying Mediterranean-inspired dishes.\n4. **Sundried Tomato and Basil Bread**: This bread is a great way to capture the flavors of summer in a loaf. The sweetness of sun-dried tomatoes pairs beautifully with the brightness of fresh basil, creating a delicious savory bread.\n5. **Rye and Caraway Seed Bread**: If you enjoy the earthy, slightly sour flavor of sourdough, you might appreciate the distinctive taste of rye flour. Caraway seeds add a nutty, slightly bitter flavor that complements the rye beautifully.\n\nHere's a simple recipe to get you started:\n\n**Rosemary and Olive Oil Focaccia Recipe**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 1/2 cups warm water\n* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary, chopped\n* Coarse sea salt, for topping (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Combine warm water and yeast in a bowl. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.\n2. Add flour, salt, and olive oil to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough for 10-12 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\n5. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n6. Punch down the dough and shape it into a rectangle. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n7. Dimple the dough with your fingers, then sprinkle chopped rosemary and coarse sea salt (if using).\n8. Drizzle with olive oil and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.\n\nThese savory breads are perfect for experimenting with different flavors and ingredients.
