  "content": "I'm mostly using my camera for portrait and low-light photography, so I think I'll need a bag that can protect my gear well. I've also been having some issues with my old 18-55mm kit lens, and I've been relying on manual focus lately. Speaking of lenses, I recently got a new 50mm prime lens, which has been working out great. Do you think either of these bags would be good for carrying my Nikon D5600 and a few lenses, including the 50mm prime?",
