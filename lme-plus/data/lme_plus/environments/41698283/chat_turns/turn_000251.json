  "content": "Yes, the Canadian federal government provided significant financial support for the hosting of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. In total, the federal government contributed approximately $440 million CAD towards the cost of the games, which accounted for about one-third of the total budget. This funding was used to build new facilities, upgrade existing infrastructure and cover event-related costs. The government also provided tax incentives for private sector investments, which helped to attract funding from corporate sponsors who wanted to associate themselves with the prestigious event. Despite the significant investment from the government, the financial success of the games allowed for a surplus of $88 million CAD, which was used to establish a foundation for the development of amateur sports in Canada. Overall, the government's financial support played a vital role in making the 1988 Winter Olympics a success and generating long-term economic benefits for Calgary and the Canadian economy.",
