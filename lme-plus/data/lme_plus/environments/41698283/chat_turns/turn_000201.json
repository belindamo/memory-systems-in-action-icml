I am generally available to work during normal business hours, Monday through Friday. However, I am also able to be flexible and work evenings or weekends if needed to meet tight deadlines or accommodate the client's schedule.\n\nIn terms of my availability, I typically work on a project-by-project basis, which means that I am able to take on multiple projects at once and adjust my schedule as needed to ensure that I am meeting the needs of all of my clients.\n\nOverall, my working hours are flexible and can be adapted to meet the unique needs of each project and client.",
