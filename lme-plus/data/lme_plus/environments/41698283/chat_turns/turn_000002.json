I had a lovely conversation with a jam maker at the farmer's market two weeks ago on a Saturday morning, and it got me inspired to try out some new dishes. He also recommended some flavor combinations that I want to try out. Speaking of which, do you have any suggestions on how to pair different types of jam with cheeses and crackers?",
