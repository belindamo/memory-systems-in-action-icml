  "content": "Yes, toms are also important in a rock band. Toms are used to create fills, rolls, and other rhythmic variations and can help build tension and excitement in a song. \n\nTom drums are available in a variety of sizes and pitches, and each size and pitch has its own distinct sound. The smaller toms tend to have a higher pitch and are used for faster, more intricate fills, while the larger toms have a lower pitch and are used for more dramatic fills or to create a thundering sound.\n\nOverall, the placement and use of toms, along with the bass drum, snare drum, and cymbals, create a rhythmic foundation that is essential to any rock band.",
