  "content": "Based on your description of the box plot and the fact that you calculated skewness and kurtosis, it seems that the 'asylum application' column might not be normally distributed. The presence of many outliers, along with a significant positive skew (data concentrated on the right side), indicates a non-normal distribution.\n\nTo further support this observation, you can also look at the values of skewness and kurtosis. A skewness value significantly different from 0 indicates a lack of symmetry in the distribution, and a kurtosis value significantly different from 3 (Fisher's kurtosis) implies a shape that deviates from the normal distribution. Depending on the skewness and kurtosis values you obtained, you can infer whether the data deviates significantly from normality.\n\nConsidering the graphical and numerical results, it is reasonable to conclude that the 'asylum application' column may not be normally distributed. In this case, using a rank-based correlation method like Spearman's correlation, which is more robust to outliers and does not assume normality, would be appropriate for your analysis.",
