  "content": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that their individual properties are no longer independent of each other, even if they are separated by large distances. This means that measuring the state of one particle will instantaneously affect the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.\n\nFor example, if two particles are entangled in such a way that their spins are opposite, then measuring the spin of one particle will immediately determine the spin of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them. This effect happens even if the particles are separated by billions of kilometers, which is why it is often referred to as \"spooky action at a distance\".\n\nQuantum entanglement is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has been experimentally confirmed in numerous studies. It has applications in quantum cryptography and quantum computing, and has also played a role in the development of our understanding of the nature of reality at the most fundamental level.",
