  "content": "Exciting upgrade! Clipless pedals can definitely take your riding to the next level.\n\nNow, let's find a great bike shop near you for that maintenance check. I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nTo get started, could you please provide me with your location or zip code? That way, I can give you a list of well-reviewed bike shops in your area.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try checking out online review platforms like Google, Yelp, or Facebook to find top-rated bike shops near you. Look for shops with high ratings (4.5 stars or above) and pay attention to the reviews that mention road bike maintenance or clipless pedal installation. This should give you an idea of their expertise and quality of service.\n\nOnce you find a few promising shops, I recommend giving them a call to ask about their experience with road bikes and clipless pedals. You can also ask about their maintenance services, pricing, and turnaround time to ensure they meet your needs.\n\nLastly, don't forget to ask the shop if they're familiar with Shimano Ultegra pedals and if they have any experience with installing them. This will give you peace of mind knowing that your new pedals are in good hands.\n\nLet me know if you need any more assistance, and I'll do my best to help you find a great bike shop near you!",
