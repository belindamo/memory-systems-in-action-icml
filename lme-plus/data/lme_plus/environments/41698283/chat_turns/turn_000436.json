  "content": "Both Firefly and Governors Ball are fantastic festivals for rock and indie music fans.\n\nAs for Imagine Dragons, they do have a busy touring schedule, but I couldn't find any confirmed performances at Firefly or Governors Ball for this year. However, it's always possible that they might be added to the lineup later or make a surprise appearance.\n\nThat being said, both festivals have an amazing track record of booking great rock and indie acts. Here are some other bands and artists you might be interested in that are already confirmed for each festival:\n\n**Firefly Music Festival:**\n\n* The Killers\n* The 1975\n* Panic! At The Disco\n* The Lumineers\n* Billie Eilish\n* Vampire Weekend\n* Two Door Cinema Club\n\n**Governors Ball Music Festival:**\n\n* The Strokes\n* The 1975\n* Nas\n* The Black Keys\n* Tame Impala\n* Flume\n* Miley Cyrus\n\nKeep an eye on the festival websites and social media for any lineup updates or additions. You can also sign up for their newsletters or follow them on Songkick to get notified when your favorite artists are added to the lineup.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing Imagine Dragons specifically, you might want to keep an eye on their tour schedule and follow them on Songkick as well. They might announce additional tour dates or festival appearances in the coming months.",
