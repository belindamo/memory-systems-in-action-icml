I'll probably include a brief introduction to my equipment and process, and then provide more detailed information in the captions or a separate section. That way, readers who are interested in the technical details can access them easily, while others can focus on the story and images. By the way, I've been really happy with my Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS III USM lens - the image stabilization and bokeh have been fantastic for my portrait and general photography work.",
