Their bread flour will work beautifully in the Rosemary and Olive Oil Focaccia recipe.\n\nNow, about achieving a lighter, airier crumb in sourdough bread... That's a great question! A lighter crumb is often the holy grail for sourdough enthusiasts, and it requires a combination of factors. Here are some tips to help you achieve a more airy crumb:\n\n1. **Use a healthy, active sourdough starter**: A robust, bubbly starter is essential for producing a light, airy crumb. Make sure your starter is fed regularly and is at its peak activity before using it in your dough.\n2. **Use the right flour**: Bread flour with a high protein content (12-14%) will produce a more open, airy crumb. You can also experiment with all-purpose flour, but you might need to adjust the water content and proofing time.\n3. **Maintain a gentle mixing and folding technique**: Overmixing can lead to a dense, tight crumb. Mix the ingredients just until they come together in a shaggy mass, then use a gentle folding technique to develop the dough.\n4. **Keep the dough at the right temperature**: A temperature range of 75\u00b0F to 78\u00b0F (24\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) is ideal for sourdough fermentation. This will help the yeast and bacteria work together to produce a more open crumb.\n5. **Use the right water content**: Sourdough bread typically requires a higher water content than other types of bread. Aim for a dough with a hydration level of around 70-80%. This will help create a more open, airy crumb.\n6. **Proof the dough slowly and gently**: A slow, gentle proofing process will help the dough develop a more even, open crumb. Avoid over-proofing, as this can lead to a dense, flat crumb.\n7. **Score the bread correctly**: Scoring the bread just before baking can help control the way the bread expands during baking, resulting in a more open, airy crumb.\n8. **Bake with steam**: Steam helps create a more open, airy crumb by allowing the bread to expand more during baking. You can use a steamy oven or place a pan of water in the oven to create steam.\n9. **Monitor your dough's progress**: Keep an eye on your dough's progress during fermentation and proofing. If you notice it's becoming too dense or tight, adjust your techniques accordingly.\n10. **Practice makes perfect**: Achieving a light, airy crumb in sourdough bread takes time and practice. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't happen right away. Keep experimenting, and you'll eventually develop the skills and techniques needed to produce a beautiful, airy crumb.\n\nBy following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a sourdough bread with a lighter, airier crumb. Happy baking!",
