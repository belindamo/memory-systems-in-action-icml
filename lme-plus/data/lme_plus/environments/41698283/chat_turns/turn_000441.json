  "content": "To determine if your data is normally distributed, you can use a combination of graphical methods and statistical tests. Here are some common techniques:\n\n1. Visual inspection: Create a histogram or a density plot of your data. If the shape of the distribution appears symmetrical and bell-shaped, it may be approximately normal.\n2. Q-Q plot (Quantile-Quantile plot): A Q-Q plot compares the quantiles of your data with the quantiles of a normal distribution. If the data points in the Q-Q plot fall approximately along a straight line, this suggests that your data is normally distributed.\n3. Box plot: Create a box plot of your data. If your data is normally distributed, the box plot should be roughly symmetrical, with the median line near the center of the box and the whiskers extending approximately equally in both directions.\n4. Skewness and kurtosis: Calculate the skewness and kurtosis of your data. For a normal distribution, the skewness should be close to 0 (indicating a symmetrical distribution), and the kurtosis should be close to 3 (indicating a distribution with a similar shape to a normal distribution).\n5. Statistical tests: Perform statistical tests to formally test the null hypothesis that your data comes from a normal distribution. Common tests include:\n\t* Shapiro-Wilk test: Suitable for small to moderate sample sizes.\n\t* Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (with Lilliefors correction): Suitable for larger sample sizes.\n\t* Anderson-Darling test: Considers the entire distribution and is more sensitive to tails.\n\t* D'Agostino-Pearson test: Combines skewness and kurtosis to test for normality.\n\nWhen using statistical tests, a non-significant result (p-value > \u03b1, where \u03b1 is your chosen significance level, e.g., 0.05) indicates that you fail to reject the null hypothesis, and your data may be normally distributed. However, keep in mind that these tests are sensitive to sample size and may show significant results even with small deviations from normality in large samples.\n\nIt's a good idea to use a combination of these techniques, as no single method is perfect. Visual inspection of plots, along with statistical tests, can help you make a more informed decision about whether your data is normally distributed or not.",
