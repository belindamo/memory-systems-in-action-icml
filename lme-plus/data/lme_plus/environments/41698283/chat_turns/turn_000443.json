  "content": "Just having the standard deviation (STD) of a column in your dataset does not provide enough information to determine if the data is normally distributed. The standard deviation is a measure of dispersion or spread in your data, but it does not inform you about the shape of the distribution.\n\nTo assess the normality of the 'asylum application' column after the second method of manipulation, you can apply the techniques mentioned in my previous response. Here's a step-by-step guide using Python and the pandas and seaborn libraries:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries and create a DataFrame:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import shapiro\n\n# Assuming you have a DataFrame called 'df2' after the second method of manipulation\n```\n1. Visualize the distribution using a histogram:\n```python\nsns.histplot(df2['asyl_app'], kde=True)\nplt.xlabel('Asylum Applications')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()\n```\n1. Create a Q-Q plot:\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import probplot\n\nprobplot(df2['asyl_app'], dist='norm', plot=plt)\nplt.title('Q-Q Plot')\nplt.show()\n```\n1. Create a box plot:\n```python\nsns.boxplot(x=df2['asyl_app'])\nplt.xlabel('Asylum Applications')\nplt.show()\n```\n1. Calculate skewness and kurtosis:\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis\n\nskewness = skew(df2['asyl_app'])\nkurt = kurtosis(df2['asyl_app'])\n\nprint(f\"Skewness: {skewness}\")\nprint(f\"Kurtosis: {kurt}\")\n```\n1. Perform a normality test, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test:\n```python\nstat, p = shapiro(df2['asyl_app'])\n\nprint(f\"Shapiro-Wilk Test Statistic: {stat}\")\nprint(f\"Shapiro-Wilk Test P-value: {p}\")\n```\nExamine the results of these analyses to determine if the 'asylum application' column is normally distributed. Remember that a combination of graphical and statistical methods should be used to make an informed decision about the normality of your data.",
