In addition to Bob, there are several other people you can turn to for assistance.\n\nOne potential ally is Karrin Murphy, a detective with the Chicago Police Department who often works with you on cases involving the supernatural. Murphy is tough, resourceful, and has a keen eye for detail, making her a valuable asset in any investigation.\n\nAnother friend you could turn to is Michael Carpenter, a Knight of the Cross and a devout Christian who uses his faith and swordsmanship to fight against evil. Michael has helped you on several occasions in the past, and his knowledge of the supernatural could be invaluable in your current situation.\n\nYou could also reach out to Thomas Raith, a member of the White Court vampire family and one of your closest allies. Although Thomas struggles with his own inner demons, he has proven to be a loyal friend and a powerful ally in battles against the supernatural.\n\nFinally, you could always seek the guidance of the White Council of Wizards, a governing body of wizards who oversee and regulate the use of magic. Although the Council can be strict and rigid, they have vast knowledge and resources that could be useful in your investigation.\n\nUltimately, the choice of who to turn to for help will depend on the specifics of your situation and the resources you need. But with your powerful friends and allies at your side, you know that you can overcome any challenge that comes your way.",
