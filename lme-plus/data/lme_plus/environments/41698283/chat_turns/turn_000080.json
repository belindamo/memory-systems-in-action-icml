Lizzie purred in contentment, her eyes still closed in sleep. Alyssa couldn't help but lean in and give Lizzie a soft kiss on the forehead, feeling her heart flutter at the thought of being with her.\n\nThe two of them stayed cuddled up for a while longer, before eventually getting up and getting ready for the day ahead. They knew they had important duties to attend to as Grand Admiral and Captain, but for now, they were content to just be with each other.\n\nAs they went about their day, Alyssa couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth in her heart, knowing that she had someone special to share her life with. And Lizzie felt the same, knowing that she had someone who truly cared for her and accepted her for who she was, Neko and all.",
