However, let's break down how each bag can accommodate your gear:\n\n**Lowepro ProTactic 450 AW:**\n\n* The main compartment can fit your Nikon D5600 with the 50mm prime lens attached, as well as a few additional lenses, such as the 18-55mm kit lens.\n* The bag has multiple compartments and pockets, including a dedicated laptop sleeve, which can fit a 15-inch laptop.\n* The ProTactic 450 AW has a modular design, allowing you to customize the layout to fit your specific gear needs. You can remove or add compartments as needed.\n* The bag's weather-resistant design and built-in rain cover will provide excellent protection for your gear in harsh weather conditions.\n\n**Think Tank Urban Disguise 40L:**\n\n* The main compartment can also fit your Nikon D5600 with the 50mm prime lens attached, as well as a few additional lenses, but the capacity is slightly smaller compared to the ProTactic 450 AW.\n* The Urban Disguise 40L has multiple compartments and pockets, including a dedicated laptop sleeve, which can fit a 13-inch laptop (not 15-inch).\n* The bag is designed for urban environments, so it's more compact and lightweight, but it still offers good protection for your gear.\n* While it's not as weather-resistant as the ProTactic 450 AW, the Urban Disguise 40L is still a well-made bag that can handle light rain or snow.\n\nConsidering your portrait and low-light photography needs, I think both bags can accommodate your gear. However, if you prioritize weather protection and a more rugged design, the Lowepro ProTactic 450 AW might be the better choice.\n\nRegarding your manual focus issues with the 18-55mm kit lens, it's great that you're enjoying the 50mm prime lens! If you plan to continue using manual focus, you might want to consider a bag with a more comfortable and accessible design, making it easier to grab your camera and lenses quickly. Both bags have comfortable shoulder straps and handles, but the ProTactic 450 AW has a more modular design, which might make it easier to access your gear.\n\nUltimately, I recommend checking out reviews, watching videos, and reading feedback from other photographers who own these bags to get a better sense of which one might be the best fit for your specific needs and preferences.",
