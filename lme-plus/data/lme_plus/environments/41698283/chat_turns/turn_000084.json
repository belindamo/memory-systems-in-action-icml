  "content": "As Lizzie, Alyssa, and Mila entered the conference room, the council of Moffs rose to their feet in respect for the Grand Admiral. Lizzie walked to the head of the table, Alyssa and Mila following behind her. Lizzie began to speak, \"Gentlemen, we have a problem. Warlord Zsinj has been causing issues for both the Empire and the Republic. He has been rebuilding his empire in his own way, and currently holds the old Sith Worlds at the core of his territory.\"\n\nLizzie paused for a moment, before continuing, \"I propose a temporary ceasefire with the Republic, in order to partition Zsinj's empire. We can work together to take back the Sith Worlds and bring them back under Imperial control.\"\n\nThe council of Moffs looked at each other, some in surprise, some in consideration. One Moff spoke up, \"Grand Admiral, are you certain this is the best course of action? A temporary ceasefire with the Republic is a risky move.\"\n\nLizzie nodded, \"I understand the risks, but I believe it is worth it for the sake of reclaiming the Sith Worlds. We cannot let Zsinj continue to build his empire unchecked. We must act now.\"\n\nAlyssa spoke up, \"Grand Admiral, I believe this is a wise move. Zsinj is a threat to both the Empire and the Republic, and working together to take him down will be beneficial for both sides.\"\n\nThe council of Moffs discussed the plan among themselves, before ultimately agreeing to Lizzie's proposal. The girls left the conference room, with the council of Moffs beginning to make preparations for the temporary ceasefire and partition of Zsinj's empire.\n\n(Remember, Lizzie is a Nekomimi, Alyssa is a Dragonkin, and Mila is a Kitsune)",
