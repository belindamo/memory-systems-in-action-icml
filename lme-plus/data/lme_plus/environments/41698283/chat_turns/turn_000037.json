It has a maximum load capacity of 35.3 lbs (16 kg), which is more than enough for a Nikon Z6 and most lenses you'll use with it.\n\nHere are some benefits of the Manfrotto MT057CXPRO4 for future-proofing:\n\n1. **Weight capacity**: As mentioned, the tripod can support a significant amount of weight, making it suitable for full-frame cameras and larger lenses.\n2. **Stability**: The MT057CXPRO4 has a sturdy and stable design, which is essential for capturing sharp images with a full-frame camera.\n3. **Durability**: Manfrotto is a well-known brand, and the MT057CXPRO4 is built to last, with a durable construction that can withstand harsh environments and heavy use.\n4. **Adjustability**: The tripod has a wide range of adjustability, allowing you to fine-tune your camera's position to achieve the perfect shot, even with a larger camera body.\n5. **Compatibility**: The MT057CXPRO4 is compatible with a wide range of camera brands and models, including Nikon, making it a versatile option for future upgrades.\n\nThat being said, if you're planning to upgrade to a full-frame camera body like the Nikon Z6, you might also want to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Tripod head**: If you plan to use a larger or heavier lens with your Z6, you might want to consider a tripod head with a higher load capacity or a more robust design.\n2. **Tripod height**: A full-frame camera body like the Z6 might require a slightly taller tripod to achieve the same camera height as your current D5600. Make sure the tripod you choose can accommodate your desired camera height.\n3. **Balance and stability**: A full-frame camera body can be more front-heavy, which might affect the balance and stability of your tripod. Look for a tripod with a sturdy center column and a wide base to ensure stability.\n\nIn summary, the Manfrotto MT057CXPRO4 is a great option to consider for future-proofing, but make sure to evaluate your specific needs and requirements when upgrading to a full-frame camera body like the Nikon Z6.",
