  "content": "Sure! Here is the rest of the description of the formal semantics for the scenario using logical matrices:\n\nNext, we need to define a set of truth-values and a subset of those values called designated truth-values. For example, we might define the set of truth-values as {0, 1}, where 0 represents \"false\" and 1 represents \"true\". We might then define the set of designated truth-values as {1}, meaning that only the value 1 is designated as a valid truth-value.\n\nThen, we need to define an interpretation function for the logical connectives. For example, we might define the interpretation function as follows:\n\n* \u00ac: if the input is 1, the output is 0; if the input is 0, the output is 1.\n* \u2227: if both inputs are 1, the output is 1; otherwise, the output is 0.\n* \u2228: if either input is 1, the output is 1; otherwise, the output is 0.\n* \u2192: if the first input is 0 or the second input is 1, the output is 1; otherwise, the output is 0.\n\nWith these definitions, we can use the interpretation function to assign truth-values to the propositions in the scenario. For example, we might assign the truth-value 1 to the proposition \"M(walk(bar))\" in one state and the truth-value 0 to the proposition \"M(walk(bar))\" in another state, depending on whether M is walking into a bar in those states.\n\nI hope this helps to illustrate how logical matrices can be",
