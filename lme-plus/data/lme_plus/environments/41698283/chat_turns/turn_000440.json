Getting to the venue early to grab a beer and a t-shirt is always a good idea, and it's awesome that you got to check out The Neighbourhood's set as well. They're a great band with a really cool sound, and it's great to hear that they brought their A-game to the stage.\n\nI'm sure Imagine Dragons put on an incredible show, but it's always nice to have a solid opening act to get the crowd warmed up and excited. Did you have a favorite song or moment from The Neighbourhood's set, or were you more focused on getting ready for Imagine Dragons to take the stage?\n\nAnd how was the atmosphere in the venue during the show? Was the crowd energetic and into it, or was it more of a laid-back vibe?",
