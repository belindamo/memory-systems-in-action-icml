During the winter season, including December, the Haunted House attraction is usually open, but with some modifications.\n\n**Winter Version:** Universal Studios Japan typically offers a winter-themed Haunted House, often with a unique storyline and design. This special winter version is usually available from late November to February. The winter Haunted House might have some differences in terms of theme, design, and scare factors compared to the regular version.\n\n**Operating Schedule:** The Haunted House attraction usually operates during regular park hours, but it's always best to check the Universal Studios Japan website or the official app for the most up-to-date operating schedule and any special event information.\n\n**Note:** Be prepared for possible closures or modifications due to inclement weather, maintenance, or special events. It's always a good idea to check the park's website or social media before your visit to confirm the Haunted House's operating status.\n\nIf you're planning to visit both Tokyo DisneySea and Universal Studios Japan, consider the travel time and distance between the two parks. You might want to plan your days accordingly to ensure you have enough time to enjoy both parks without feeling rushed.\n\nHave a spooky-ooky time at the Haunted House, and enjoy your theme park adventure in Japan!",
