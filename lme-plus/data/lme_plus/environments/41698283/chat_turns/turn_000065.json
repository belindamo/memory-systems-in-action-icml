It sounds like the Kryptonite U-Lock is meeting your expectations and providing the security and convenience you need.\n\nIt's great that you're enjoying your road rides on your Trek Emonda, and I'm excited for you about the upcoming charity ride! 40 miles is a great distance to challenge yourself, and I'm sure you'll crush it. Have you been training specifically for this ride, or is this a good opportunity to test your endurance?\n\nRemember to stay hydrated, fuel up with some energy-rich foods, and pace yourself during the ride. It's also essential to make sure your bike is in good working condition, with proper tire pressure, well-lubricated chain, and functioning brakes.\n\nWhat's the charity ride for, if you don't mind me asking? Is it for a cause that's close to your heart?",
