  "content": "Alyssa entered the meditation chamber, where she found Lizzie sitting in her usual spot, dressed in her undergarments, as she usually was when in the chamber. The Grand Admiral badge was pinned to her bra, as usual, and her uniform was folded neatly next to her chair. The holograms of artwork that surrounded them were different this time, with a vast majority being holos of sculptures.\n\nLizzie looked up at Alyssa, her kitty ears twitching nervously, and her tail swishing back and forth. \"A-Alyssa,\" Lizzie began, her voice shy and uncertain. \"I was wondering if, uhm, you would be interested in, um, being my girlfriend?\"\n\nAlyssa's face broke out into a wide grin, as she walked over to Lizzie and wrapped her arms around her, lifting her off her seat. \"Of course, Lizzie,\" Alyssa said, her voice filled with happiness and affection. \"I would love to be your girlfriend.\"\n\nLizzie's face lit up with joy, as she wrapped her arms around Alyssa's neck, her kitty tail swishing happily. \"I'm so glad,\" Lizzie said, her voice filled with relief and happiness.\n\nThe two of them stood there for a moment, holding each other, before Alyssa set Lizzie back down on her seat and the two of them began to talk about their future together. The height difference between the two didn't matter, as they were both happy and in love.",
