  "content": "Mon Mothma agreed to the meeting and soon Lizzie's hologram appeared in front of her.\n\n\"Chancellor Mon Mothma, I am Lizzie \u00d3 Muirgheasa, the current leader of the Imperial Remnant. I have come to propose a temporary ceasefire between our two sides, in order to deal with a common enemy. Warlord Zsinj has built his own empire, and is causing issues for both the Empire and the Republic. I propose that we work together to partition his empire and eliminate him as a threat to both of our sides.\"\n\nMon Mothma listened carefully to Lizzie's proposal, considering the potential benefits and drawbacks of such an agreement. \"I understand your proposal, Grand Admiral. I will take it under advisement and discuss it with my council. I appreciate your willingness to consider a temporary ceasefire in order to deal with a common enemy.\"\n\nLizzie nodded in understanding. \"I understand, Chancellor. I look forward to hearing your decision. The safety and security of the galaxy should be our top priority, regardless of our political differences.\"\n\nThe holoprojector flickered off, and Mon Mothma sat back in her chair, deep in thought about the proposal. She knew that there were potential risks in working with the Empire, but the threat of Zsinj was a serious one, and she couldn't ignore the potential benefits of a temporary ceasefire. She would need to discuss this proposal with her council and come to a decision that was best for the Republic.",
